You are asking about a model's ability to generalize to unseen examples. Consult Abu-Mostafa, et al. , Learning From Data, ยง 5.3 Data Snooping. If a data set has affected any step in the learning process, its ability to assess the outcome has been compromised. There is a giant space of models that you might choose from, based on your knowledge of the underlying generative process (e.g. "sales of widgets"). You might choose a linear model for regression, or a quadratic or other polynomial model, or perhaps SVM , random forest , or a multitude of other hypothesis families and loss functions. Having decided on a family of hypotheses, you next must settle on the hyperparameters that specify a particular hypothesis, such as "max tree depth" for RF, together with per-node learned parameters. Commonly there will be more than half a dozen hyperparameters. Their values matter, they affect model performance. So we can sweep through a grid of proposed hyperparameter settings, or better we can quickly explore hyperparameter space by choosing random points. The reason we do this is so we can generalize. To get 100% accuracy on already-seen training data is trivial; any RDBMS could parrot back Y for such X values. But for novel X values, being able to interpolate or otherwise generalize requires a more sophisticated approach. The generative process in the world produced observables that adhere to some pattern, and it is the model's job to learn that pattern. For example, proposing "interpolation" suggests a continuous smoothly differentiable generating function, to which we can usefully apply interpolation techniques. no cheating We evaluate our model's ability to generalize to unseen data by scoring it against unseen test data, which superficially resembles scoring against folds of training data. If any of the model's parameters or hyperparameters have settings based on some test data, then that data cannot be used to assess the model's ability to generalize to unseen data. We need new , unseen data to accomplish such an assessment.
