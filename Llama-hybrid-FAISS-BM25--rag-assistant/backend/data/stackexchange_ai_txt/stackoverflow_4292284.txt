Why Unobtrusive JavaScript?

Just been reading on Wikipedia Separation of functionality (the "behavior layer") from a Web page's structure/content and presentation[1] Best practices to avoid the problems of traditional JavaScript programming (such as browser inconsistencies and lack of scalability) Progressive enhancement to support user agents that may not support advanced JavaScript functionality[2] In these days where Javascript libraries like jQuery rule the internet, why still take care of this Unobtrusiveness? Point 2 and 3 about browser's not supporting Javascript and inconsistency? Which browsers? If they are not in the IE 6.0+, FF 2+, Safari 3.0+, Opera 9.0+, Chrome range, frankly I don't care! (I might care about Mobile though..) Ok a user can disable Javascript, but do I have to make sure everything is 'Unobtrusive' just for that? I am asking this because I have by sumbit buttons (links actually because styling HTML buttons is a pain) triggered with Javascript. Is this a bad idea?
