Telephony event notification in .NET

I have a Windows Forms application, developed in C#, that would benefit from being able to receive telephony event notifications. For example, if office worker Joe answers a telephone call on his organization's PBX system, I need my desktop application to know it (as well as when he initiates a call, when he hangs up, etc.). I would like to use as generic and common a mechanism as possible to achieve this goal for maximum hardware / telephony system support. Any advice regarding what mix of technologies are best applicable would be greatly appreciated.
