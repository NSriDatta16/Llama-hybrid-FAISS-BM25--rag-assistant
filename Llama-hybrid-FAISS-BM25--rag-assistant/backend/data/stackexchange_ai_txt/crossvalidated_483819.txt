When using a linear-kernel SVM, you should definitely not expect the fit to be comparable to a decision tree. Simply put, a decision tree is able to find nonlinear characteristics of a dataset, whilst a linear-kernel SVM cannot. This is due to the different hypothesis in each model. The SVM tries to find a hyperplane to divide the space, while the decision tree uses multiple hyperplanes to divide the space. Consider the following image: although not a perfect classification, you can see how the decision tree is able to find nonlinear features of the dataset, whilst the linear SVM cannot. For the more robust SVM with RBF kernel, the division is made on an infinite-dimensional theoretical space, while the decision tree does not.
