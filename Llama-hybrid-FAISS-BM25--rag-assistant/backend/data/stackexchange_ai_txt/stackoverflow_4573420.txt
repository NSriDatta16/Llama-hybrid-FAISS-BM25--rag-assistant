GWT + GAE + Multiple pages + SSH

I am trying to write an application with two pages where one needs SSH and the other doesn't (because of performance concern). I understand that multiple pages/entry-points are discouraged in GWT framework. But I don't know how I can turn SSH traffic on and off dynamically using GWT+GAE. Even though I think I can setup to use SSH all the time by modifying web.xml. Can anyone suggest a simple solution? Many Thanks!
