How many run should we implement on the machine learning model?

Theoretically, we can implement fix seed on the machine learning model to get the same results every run (reproducible)but it may leads to bias. So, in order to prevent bias, I gonna run the model for several times without fix the seed/state. How many time should I run the machine learning model or normally done by researchers to get the result (10 runs,20.. or more)?
