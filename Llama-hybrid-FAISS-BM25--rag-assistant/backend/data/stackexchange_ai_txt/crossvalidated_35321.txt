Not quite. Factor analysis operates with the second moments, and really hopes that the data are Gaussian so that the likelihood ratios and stuff like that is not affected by non-normality. ICA, on the other hand, is motivated by the idea that when you add things up, you get something normal, due to CLT, and really hopes that the data are non-normal, so that the non-normal components can be extracted from them. To exploit non-normality, ICA tries to maximize the fourth moment of a linear combination of the inputs: $$\max_{{\bf a}: \| {\bf a}\| =1} \frac1n \sum_i \bigl[ {\bf a}'({\bf x}_i-\bar {\bf x})\bigr]^4 $$ If anything, ICA should be compared to PCA, which maximizes the second moment (variance) of a standardized combination of inputs.
