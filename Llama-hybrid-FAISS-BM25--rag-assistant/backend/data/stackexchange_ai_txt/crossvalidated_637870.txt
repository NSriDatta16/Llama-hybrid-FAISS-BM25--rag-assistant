Can I transform two log variables into one using multiplication in VECM time series model?

I performed a Vector error correction model using Tourist Arrivals as a dependent Variable and Real GDP, Public Road Transport operated distance and Public Railway Transport operated distance as Independent variables. Although the model was significant it did not pass the Normality test. (Image1- model1) Then I converted two Transport variables into one using multiplication and performed the model again and this time whole model passed the normality test. (Image2- Model2) I just want to know if can I use this Variable transformation in my model and if so could you please advise any reference for it. Highly appreciate your comment on this. Thank You.
