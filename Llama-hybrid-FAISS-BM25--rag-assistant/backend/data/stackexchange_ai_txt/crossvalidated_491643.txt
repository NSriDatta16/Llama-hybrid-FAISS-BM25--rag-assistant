how to generate state and reward in model free reinforcement Learning

In the model free reinforcement Learning , most algorithms mentioned that using random walk simulates the next state. Here I don't understand how to generate the next state? Does it select all the states with same probability? And for the reward $r(s,a,s'),$ in the algorithms, why isn't it a input function i.e. when $(s,a,s')$ is given, we have a value. I think it is better to give a real world example to illustrate above question.
