There a few things you need to do to get this working: Set the zIndex on your draggable element so that it shows up above the map. Set the revert flag on your element so it doesn't drop under the map. Add a handler for the stop event, so you can execute some code when the user drops the element on your map. Map from the offset inside the map element to a latitude longitude offset from the top left corner of your map bounds. I have implemented a sample based on your code that does the first three of these points. To do the last you will need to query the GMap2 object to determine the current view and then do the mapping. If you have problems with this part, please post here and when I get some time I will update my answer with that functionality. $("#b").draggable({ zIndex: 2700, revert: true, revertDuration: 0, stop: function(event, ui) { var dragOffset = ui.offset; var mapOffset = $(".map").offset(); if (dragOffset.top > mapOffset.top && dragOffset.left > mapOffset.left && dragOffset.top
