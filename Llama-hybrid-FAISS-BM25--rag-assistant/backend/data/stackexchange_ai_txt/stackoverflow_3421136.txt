How about an Ajax post back on certain fields? We looked into this as well and eventually gave up as it added a lot of time to the site execution and made the user experiance bad. We eventually just settled for an ajax check when the user clicked the next button at which point we validated ages, emails, phone numbers etc. All the required information was checked by required field validators as the user tabbed through the form. edit I just wanted to re state that we tried on the fly servaer side validation but rejected it because of web page speed. for example, as the address was being validated the user was tying elsewhere and the sudden appearance of an error message some seconds later confused and infuriated them.
