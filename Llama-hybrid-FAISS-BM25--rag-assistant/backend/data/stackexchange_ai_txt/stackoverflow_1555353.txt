You could always suggest a random password if the user's imagination suddenly turns blank. Of course you made sure the generated password is "strong" (according to your rules), and you would have a "suggest a new password"-button. Users that don't want complicated passwords or unique passwords for different sites will always change to the one they would have picked if you would have let them in the first place. In this case, you made them impatient because you: sent out a valid password/activation code in an email made them check their email inbox (and perhaps wait for your email to arrive) made them change their password Final advice: rather than forcing; encourage and emphasize the importance of a size password. The password-strength meter is one of the fun ways to do this.
