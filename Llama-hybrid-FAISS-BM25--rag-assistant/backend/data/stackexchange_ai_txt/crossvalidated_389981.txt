Your problem is not (so much) a lack of data. Your problem is that the data generating process changes abruptly multiple times. First there is a step change around Sep 20, then there is a period of strangely low variability at the beginning of November, almost two weeks of missing data at the beginning of December, and finally a precipitous drop at the end of December. The last is a particular problem for your models, and it will be for any model. Your models fit either a downward trend, which they extrapolate (TBATS and Prophet), or another step change (ETS). Which one makes more sense? We don't know, since we don't know what happened recently, whether the downward trend will continue, or whether your series has reached a new equilibrium, or whether it will increase again to the level it showed before the drop. I'd very much recommend you find out what happened to your series in the past, and include this in any model. For instance, you could regress your series on explanatory variables and fit your time series to residuals. This is related to How to know that your machine learning problem is hopeless?
