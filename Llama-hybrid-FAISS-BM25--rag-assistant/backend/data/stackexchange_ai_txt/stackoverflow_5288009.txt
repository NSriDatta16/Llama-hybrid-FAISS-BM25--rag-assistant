Because it's what you've told to do :) You're passing a string 'item_id' as the second element of the conditions array, and it's put into the place of the question mark. If you have a variable item_id that contains the id, you don't need to put it into quotemarks: Bid.average(:amount, :conditions => ['item_id = ?', item_id])
