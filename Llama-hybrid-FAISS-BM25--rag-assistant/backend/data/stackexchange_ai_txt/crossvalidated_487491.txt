This illustrates the unidirectionality of conditional probabilities. Given a particular a sample and a hypothesis with well-defined probabilities, we can say with confidence what the probability, given the hypothesis , of seeing the sample. But in frequentist statistics, we cannot say what the probability, given the sample, of the hypothesis is. That the sample is taken randomly is usually not explicitly stated as part of the null hypothesis, but it is always implicitly part of it. When we reject the null, we reject all of the null. And remember that the negation of a statement with "and" turns into a statement with "or". So if the null is "the sample is drawn from a distribution that is normal and the mean is $\mu$ and the standard deviation is $\sigma$ and the samples are independent of each other, and ..." then rejecting the null means that we believe that ""the sample is not drawn from a distribution that is normal or the mean is not $\mu$ or the standard deviation is not $\sigma$ or the samples are not independent of each other, or ..." It's only by eliminating the possibility that the sample was cherry picked that we can definitively conclude that one of the other possibilities holds. For a Bayesian perspective, this shows the importance of updating not only on your knowledge but also on your meta-knowledge. That is, not only what you know, but how you know it. Much of the controversy surrounding the Monty Hall problem comes from the ambiguous nature of the metaknowledge. If the host always randomly picks from the two unchosen doors and shows what's behind it, then switching doesn't help your odds. But if the host always picks a door with a goat and opens it, then switching does help your odds. Another puzzle is "Suppose you know a particular woman has two children, and you know that one of her children is a boy. What's the probability that she has two boys?" The answer depends on how you know that one of her children is a boy. If you asked whether her older child is a boy, and she said yes, then the probability is 1/2. But if you asked her whether any of her children are boys, and she said yes, then the probability is 1/3.
