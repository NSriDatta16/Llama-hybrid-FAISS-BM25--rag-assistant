Magento: get a static block as html in a phtml file

I have a static block called newest_product (with content) and I would like to display it on a .phtml file as html . I've tried this code: echo $this->getLayout()->createBlock('cms/block')->setBlockId('newest_product')->toHtml(); But this nothing is being displayed. Am I using the wrong code?
