Well ... It seems that the sprite class has a scale method that lets you set its scale, as a floating-point value where 1.0 is the default ("native") scale. You're not being very clear on how you want the sprite to scale, if it's supposed to scale to "follow" the touch, i.e. letting the user re-size the sprite by dragging, or if's just going to (for example) change its scale to notify the user the touch was registered. You need to figure these things out, and compute the desired scale you want.
