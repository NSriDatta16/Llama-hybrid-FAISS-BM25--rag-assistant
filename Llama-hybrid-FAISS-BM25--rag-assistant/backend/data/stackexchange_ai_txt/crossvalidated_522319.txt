After a bit more thinking and simulation, I couldn't find an obvious flaw with my described procedure and I wanted to explain my reasoning in this answer. If you find something wrong with it, I'd be happy to hear. If we assume that the correlations are more or less stable across time points and groups, calculating the PCA on the group and time-specific centered data finds the general direction (i.e. the eigenvector) of maximal variance. Illustrating this with the example given in the question, here is the first component visualized as black line together with the original, uncentered and unscaled data: The line nicely aligns with the axes of the normal ellipse, indicating the direction of maximal variance. The new variable would then be created by projection the data orthogonally onto the line: Because the first component is calculated the same for all data, the relationship between the groups and time points is preserved. Compare that to an example, where the PCA makes less sense in my opinion: Here, the correlation differs between time points (it's $0.85$ at baseline and $0.55$ at follow-up). If we center these data with their group and time-specific means, we get the following graph: The normal ellipse for the overall data is shown as continuous line whereas the time-specific ellipses are shown as dotted lines. It's obvious that there is not a single direction of maximal variance but two. Here is the same graph showing the projection using only one overall component. To capture the variance structure for both time points, we'd need to calculate two separate PCAs on those subsets, leading to two different lines and projections as shown here: But the use of two separate PCAs distorts the relationship between the groups and times and I'd think this makes this approach infeasible for inferring group differences in the ANCOVA.
