Turns out this is easy â€” once you know how. Set the Designer attribute on the control to a custom class that inherits from ControlDesigner . Override the OnSetCursor method so that, while over the splitter region, you show the HSplit or VSplit cursor, respectively. Per this ticket , make sure not to set the control's cursor (this will cause a stack overflow, crash, or other erratic behavior, and certainly not what you want), but rather Cursor.Current . Override OnMouseDragBegin , OnMouseDragMove and OnMouseDragEnd to resize the inner panels.
