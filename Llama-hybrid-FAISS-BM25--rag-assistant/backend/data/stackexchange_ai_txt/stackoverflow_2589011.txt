I presume by 'typo' you mean mistyping variable/function/class names. This is less of an issue in Python than in Perl, since Perl (and I believe Ruby) by default will automatically create a variable and initialise it to zero or "" on its first use. Python does not do this since it is an error to use a variable that has not been explicitly created, so in that sense it is already in 'strict' mode. I use Vim with the pyflakes plugin, which underlines most kinds of typos as soon as you type them. I also use pylint and pychecker frequently since they can catch many other kinds of errors. Another thing I do is make heavy use of Vim's auto completion - I only type a name in full once, then on subsequent uses of the name type the first few letters and use or to cycle through the matches. I also use Test Driven Development with the aim of 100% unit test coverage. I find that the combination of all these practices means that problems caused by typos are virtually non-existent.
