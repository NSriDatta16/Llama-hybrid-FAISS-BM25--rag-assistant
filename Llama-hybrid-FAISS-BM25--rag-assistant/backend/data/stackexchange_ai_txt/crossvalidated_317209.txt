You seem to be confusing many things in your question. Is there any quick solution (either by any statistical software or manual workout) to find the maximum likelihood estimates of alpha of three independent variables of a dirichlet distribution First of all, Dirichlet distribution is a multivariate distribution, I assume that you mean trivariate distribution in here. Obviously, the individual variables are not independent, it should be obvious at least from the fact that if $x_1,x_2,\dots,x_k$ are draws from Dirichlet distribution, then $\sum_{i=1}^k x_i = 1$, so they need to be dependent to meet the constraint. provided that the initial values of the three parameters are found by the method of moments. What do you mean by "method of moments" in here? There are many ways of computing the parameters of Dirichlet distribution (see, e.g. Minka, 2000; Huang, 2005), that in most cases maximize the likelihood numerically, and there is no simple, closed-form solution. Or, Is the initial values sufficient to obtain posterior estimates in multinomial-dirichlet bayesian analysis? To obtain posterior in Bayesian analysis you do not need to find the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches are two different approaches to estimating parameters. Maximum likelihood is about finding such combination of parameters that maximize the likelihood function. In Bayesian case, you estimate the parameters in terms of the likelihood function and the priors. In Dirichlet-multinomial model (this is not the same as Dirichlet distribution), this is straightforward since Dirichlet is a conjugate prior for the multinomial distribution, and we have a closed form solution. The posterior estimate for $k$-th $\alpha$ is $\alpha_k + y_k$ where $\alpha_k$ is your prior guess for $\alpha_k$ and $y_k$ is the observed number of successes for $k$-th category in the multinomial distribution.
