You have a couple of options here. You can run port scans over the entire network address space, but that's pretty wasteful and unfriendly. I don't recommend it. A nicer approach would be to query for devices using a service discovery protocol like DNS-SD / Zeroconf (aka Bonjour ). Most Linux and Mac systems will respond, as will many network printers and other network devices. Windows systems don't ship with a DNS-SD agent, but one can be installed. A pure python implementation of DNS-SD is available here . I have used it on Linux, MacOS, and Windows. If you prefer a Microsoft approach, you can try the discovery features of UPnP , though I can't vouch for how well it works or how many systems will respond.
