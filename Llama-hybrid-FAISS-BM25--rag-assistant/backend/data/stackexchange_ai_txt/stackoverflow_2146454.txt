Consider using Java Web Start to deploy your software with a JNLP file per customer with a customer specific, hard to guess, location. This allows you to do centralized management, and delete the JNLP when the time period is up. Also ensure that a small jar is always uncached so the customer need to contact your server to be able to run.
