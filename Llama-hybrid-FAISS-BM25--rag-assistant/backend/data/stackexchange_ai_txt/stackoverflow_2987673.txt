Div always uses for styling and decorating the form so that it is not a useful element to wrap texts. in a well-formed & standard html tag, you have touse p to show the search engine or whoever, that you are displaying a paragraph or your are writing some text It is not a command but a best practice which you need to follow for a better coding. Do not use same element for same reasons. each one has one destiny.
