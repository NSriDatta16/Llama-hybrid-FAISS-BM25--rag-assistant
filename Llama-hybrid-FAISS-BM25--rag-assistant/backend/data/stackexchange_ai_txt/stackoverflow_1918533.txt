Normally mixing two libraries is strongly discouraged. Not only due to potential conflicts, but due to the excessive overhead and performance implications. Mixing three would obviously be even worse. The best solution to this problem is to take one or more frameworks out of the equation. Anything you can do in jQuery can be accomplished in Mootools and vice versa. Anything written on Prototype can be ported to jQuery or Mootools fairly trivially as well.
