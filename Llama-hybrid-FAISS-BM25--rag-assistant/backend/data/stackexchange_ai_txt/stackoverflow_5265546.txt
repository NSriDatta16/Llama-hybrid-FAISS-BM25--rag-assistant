You can query it by splitting all letters. WHERE `postcode` LIKE '" . implode("%", str_split("W1A1AA")) . "%' LIMIT 1 Because you're querying a field of limited length this shouldn't create too many problems as far as false positives and you can order by likeness in code after retrieval (I assume this is for an autocomplete). Performance should be bad.
