Chosing optimal k and optimal distance-metric for k-means

I have a data-set with roughly 20-dimensions and millions of points which I want to cluster. The goal is to find a set of clusters which: Are as distinct as possible from each other (minimum coupling) between clusters, i.e. maximum average distance between centroids With instances as similar as possible (maximum cohesion) inside the clusters, i.e. minimum average distance between the points within each cluster. Without considering the domain, is there a good metric to help determine the optimal $k$ I should choose ? Intuitively, I would pick $k=\sqrt{N}$ for a data-set in two dimensions, and $k=\sqrt[M]{N}$ for a data-set with $M$ dimensions and $N$ data-points, but I have a hunch that there are better methods. A related and complementary question is which distance metric to use. Due to the curse of dimensionality, I know that euclidean distance becomes a poor choice as the number of dimensions increases. Note that this question is different than Choosing optimal K for KNN (this one asks about clustering rather than k-NN classification)
