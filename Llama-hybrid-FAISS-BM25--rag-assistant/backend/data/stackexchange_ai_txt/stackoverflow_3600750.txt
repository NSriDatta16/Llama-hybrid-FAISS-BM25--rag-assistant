Is it possible to delete an object's property in PHP?

If I have an stdObject say, $a . Sure there's no problem to assign a new property, $a , $a->new_property = $xyz; But then I want to remove it, so unset is of no help here. So, $a->new_property = null; is kind of it. But is there a more 'elegant' way?
