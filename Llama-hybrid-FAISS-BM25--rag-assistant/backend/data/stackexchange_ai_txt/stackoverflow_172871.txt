How to manage documents for many tasks/projects

I'm probably asking for the world, but is there any Windows-based software for easily managing lots of tasks/projects and all the associated documents (spreadsheets, Word documents, other files) that can be quickly navigated/searched. I deal with probably 10-20 active projects and tasks, some lasting only a day or so, some lasting weeks, and some that go for months. I like to keep everything about any project in a single folder, but it seems like I spend forever navigating folder trees when saving a spreadsheet, SQL script, or if I want to drag a website shortcut to a folder so I can find it when I need it. I've tried various folder organizations (i.e. a top level project directory, then broken down by department or person or application), but no matter what I try, it's still too time consuming to find what I'm looking for. The closest to what I'm looking for is like Lotus had in their Agenda program back in the DOS days, where you could organize and view data multiple ways, I'd like to be able to do the same thing with a nice fast Windows app that would fully integrate with Explorer so it would know what projects I'm actively working on when asking me where to save something, and maybe even do some minimal project management so as I mark things complete, their directories would no longer appear, or if something is marked as high priority, it would show at the top or be color coded. Edit: Adding user-defined labels to Explorer, with filtering would probably go 90% of the way; if I could define 10 - 20 labels, and have an option in Explorer to show a single label, which would then show only any folders that have content marked with that label. It's be even slicker if you could have a tabbed interface, one tab for each label. Mac's have had color coded user labels on files for at least 10 years. I hate to ask if Vista has this, but I'd take a look at it if it did.
