In my understanding, the problem is not about opposing parameter estimation or hypothesis testing that indeed answers different formal questions but more about how science should work and more specifically what statistical paradigm should we use to answer a given practical question. Most of the time, hypothesis testing is used : you want to test a new drug, you test $H_O:$ "it effect is similar to a placebo". However, you can also formalize it as: "what is the range of probable effect of the drug ?" which leads you to inference and particularly interval (hpd) estimation. This transposes the original question in a different but maybe more interpretation prone manner. Several notorious statisticians advocate for "such a" solution (e.g. Gelman see http://andrewgelman.com/2011/04/02/so-called_bayes/ or http://andrewgelman.com/2014/09/05/confirmationist-falsificationist-paradigms-science/ ). More elaborated aspects of Bayesian inference for such testing purpose includes: model comparison and checking in which a model (or competing models) can be falsified from posterior predictive checks (e.g. http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/philosophy.pdf ). hypothesis testing by mixture estimation model https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.2044 in which the posterior probability associated to the set of possible explicited hypothesis are inferred.
