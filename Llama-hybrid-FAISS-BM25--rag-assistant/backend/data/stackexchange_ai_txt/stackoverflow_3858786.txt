The way I learned Groovy might be a bit old-fashioned but I just picked up a book and read it. I highly recommend: Programming Groovy: Dynamic Productivity for the Java Developer by Venkat Subramaniam http://www.pragprog.com/titles/vslg/programming-groovy It's a very quick, easy and purposeful read. After I read the book I just began coding in Groovy and learned more and more from there.
