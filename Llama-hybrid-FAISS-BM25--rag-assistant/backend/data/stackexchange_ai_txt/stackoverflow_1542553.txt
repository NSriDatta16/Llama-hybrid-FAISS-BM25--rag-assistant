This may not be the answer you're looking for but I've found it very straightforward to just run passenger locally for development. You can always tail the development.log, it's really just as easy as watching the terminal output from webrick. Dev setup is made all the easier with the drag and drop ease of the phusion passenger pref pane. http://www.fngtps.com/passenger-preference-pane Seems like it would be easier than setting up the VM and all. Though yes, there could still be differences if your not hosting on OS X server I suppose.
