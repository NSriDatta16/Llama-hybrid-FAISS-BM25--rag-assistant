I can't seem to connecting any of my IBOutlets between IB and XCode

I created a new iPhone project using the built-in "tab bar" template. I put a few sliders, labels, textfields in the view. I added in needed code for: "IBOutlet, @property, @synthesize, and release" for the above UI objects. It saves and compiles without any errors or warnings. I try to hook-up my connections with control-drag, but don't see any of my IBOutlets appearing in the list. I can't seem to "connect" any outlets from IB to my code. (My IBActions all connect fine) What did I do wrong?
