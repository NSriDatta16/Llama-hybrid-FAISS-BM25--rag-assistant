One idea would be to use the rfe function in the caret package. Use the option rfeControl = rfeControl(functions=rfFunctions) to calculate variable importance using a random forest. The rfe algorithm is explained in detail in the vignette : If a random forest performs well on your dataset, this is usually a good way to improve it. Or maybe the random forest alone gives you sufficiently accurate predictions. You can also use the glmnet package to use the elastic net for regularization/selection. This will be MUCH faster, and often performs quiet well. If you've already got a glm model that you like, glmnet might improve it. tl;dr: If a random forest works well on your data, try rfe with the rfFuncs . If a linear model works well, try glmnet , or rfe with lmFuncs .
