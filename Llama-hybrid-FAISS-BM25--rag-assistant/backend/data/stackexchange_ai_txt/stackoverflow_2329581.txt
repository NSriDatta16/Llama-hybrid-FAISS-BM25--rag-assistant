C++ Pointers. How to assign value to a pointer struct?

I have the following struct: typedef struct{ int vin; char* make; char* model; int year; double fee; }car; Then I create a pointer of type car car *tempCar; How do I assign values to the tempCar? I'm having trouble tempCar.vin = 1234; tempCar.make = "GM"; tempCar.year = 1999; tempCar.fee = 20.5; Compiler keeps saying tempCar is of type car*. I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong
