What has seemed to have fixed it is disabling Nagling on the ServicePoint associated with that URI, and sending the request as HTTP 1.0 (neither on their own seem to fix it): var servicePoint = ServicePointManager.FindServicePoint(uri.Uri); servicePoint.UseNagleAlgorithm = false; However this still seems to have fixed it only by making the request go out faster, rather than forcing the headers and payload to be written as one packet. So it could presumably fail on a loaded machine / high latency link etc. Wonder how hard it would be to write a defragmenting proxy...
