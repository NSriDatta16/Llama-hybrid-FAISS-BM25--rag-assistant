Does Ivy's url resolver support transitive retrieval?

For some reason I can't seem to resolve the dependencies of my dependencies when using a url resolver to specify a repository's location. However, when using the ibiblio resolver, I am able to retrieve them. For example: Checkstyle is a development tool to help programmers write Java code that adheres to a coding standard compile(*),master(*);runtime->runtime(*)"/> compile(*),master(*);runtime->runtime(*)"/> compile(*),master(*);runtime->runtime(*)"/> compile(*),master(*);runtime->runtime(*)"/> compile(*),master(*);runtime->runtime(*)"/> Using the "ibiblio" resolver I have no problem resolving my project's two dependencies (commons-lang 2.0 and checkstyle 5.0) and checkstyle's dependencies. However, when attempting to exclusively use the "custom-repo" or "ibiblio-mirror" resolvers, I am able to resolve my project's two explicitly defined dependencies, but not checkstyle's dependencies. Is this possible? Any help would be greatly appreciated.
