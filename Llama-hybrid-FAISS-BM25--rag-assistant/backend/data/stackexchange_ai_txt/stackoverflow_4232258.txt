Using memcache as assession storage for multiple sites

I have a server hosting one that stores sessions in memcached. I want to host a second one and I am thinking if there is going to be a problem if I use the same memcached server to store the sessions of this 2nd site as well. Am I going to have conflicts with the session ids? Is it possible that the session id generated for one site matches one generated for the other? Thanks
