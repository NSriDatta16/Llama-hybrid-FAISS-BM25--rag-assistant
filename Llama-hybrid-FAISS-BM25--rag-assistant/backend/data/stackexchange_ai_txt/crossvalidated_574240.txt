An example of a summary statistic that is only based on the sum without normalization is the Akaike Information Criterion : $$AIC = 2k - 2\ln(L) = 2k - 2\sum_{i=1}^n \ln(f(x_i))$$ where $f$ is the probability density of a model with $k$ parameters that has been fitted to the data. It is meaningless in itself, though, and only useful for comparing different models. Another example is the Deviance for logistic regression: $$D=-2\sum_{i=1}^n \ln(P(Y=1|x_i))$$ where $P(Y=1|x_i)$ is computed from a model fitted to the data. In order to interpret the value (e.g. as a "pseudo $R^2$ "), however, some normalization is subsequently necessary.
