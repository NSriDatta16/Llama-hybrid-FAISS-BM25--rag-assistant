Android vs iPhone vs Windows Phone vs Others as a platform for internal business software

I am evaluating smartphone operating systems and hardware platforms (and in a roundabout way, mobile carriers) to see which one would be the most suitable for delivering custom business software. Our applications will only be used by internal employees. Here are some features and bullet points that influence the selection: Our apps will need access to about 1 GB of proprietary data. We could use an embedded SQL database, but for speed, our preference is to have access to some kind of file system, or possibly SD card storage. This data is mostly read-only on the mobile side. But we do need to update it regularly from corporate data sources. This could happen over the wire, or by docking to a workstation, or by taking an SD card out, and updating the data it on a PC. Our applications will be graphical visualizations of the proprietary data. The data is used in a ag/biotech/research environment. Code execution speed is critical. The 1GB of data will be shared across multiple applications that we create. Devices will be used worldwide, but by a relatively small number of users (~1000). Users work both indoors and outdoors doing agricultural research. While indoors, they have good network connectivity. While outdoors, connectivity is poor. They also travel a fair bit throughout the year. Our development staff has lots of experience with C# and .net (mostly windows forms) and some exposure to C++ and java. We have done some mobile development with .net, some palm OS stuff years ago, and a few developers have tinkered with learning iPhone development. Being cross platform and not tied to a specific wireless provider or software platform would be desirable. But vendor lock-in seems to be the name of the game these days. We will deploy applications ourselves, and have no need for app stores and the like. I know that is a lot to digest. So what is my question? I would like opinions on which devices and platforms are the most suitable for what we are doing. I would also like developers who have developed internal business software for these platforms to chime in and share what they have learned.
