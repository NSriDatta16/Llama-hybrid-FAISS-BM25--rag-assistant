Efficient environment for machine or deep learning in Python

I am getting very frustrated working with either Google Colab or Azure notebooks (they are very slow and glitchy). Usually, I work with Jupyter notebooks to perform Machine Learning or Deep Learning tasks in Python. Does anyone have any recommendations for a truly good performing alternative? It does not matter if it is free or not.
