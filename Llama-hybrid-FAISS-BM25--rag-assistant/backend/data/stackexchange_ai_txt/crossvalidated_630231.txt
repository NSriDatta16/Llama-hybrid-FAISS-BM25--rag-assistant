Are regression CIs valid when the outcome is an ML prediction?

If we use classification labels from a machine learning model in a linear regression, and treat those labels as the ground truth, will the resulting confidence intervals be valid? Imagine we have $n$ labelled (ground truth) points and a larger set of $N$ unlabelled points. We train a machine learning model on the $n$ labelled points and use it to generate labels for the $N$ unlabelled points. We then group the $n+N$ points together and regress their labels on some random treatment indicator $X$ with the goal of estimating the causal effect of $X$ on the label. We construct confidence intervals for this regression, treating the labels as ground truth. My question is, will the resulting confidence intervals be valid? My intuition is that they will be too small, but I can't prove it.
