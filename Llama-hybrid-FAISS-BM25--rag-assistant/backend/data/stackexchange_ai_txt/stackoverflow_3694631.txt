HTML5 drag and drop between windows

is there anyway with the HTML5 Drag & Drop functionality or/and the File API to drag an jpg image from one window to another? The idea is that I could drag and image from Facebook to a different browser's window with a custom HTML that would get that image. Or, at least, a way to drag from the Desktop to a browser? Thanks a lot
