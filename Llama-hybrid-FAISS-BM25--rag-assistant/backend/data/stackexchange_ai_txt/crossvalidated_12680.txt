Imagine you want to find a better strategy to beat your friends at the board game Monopoly. Simplify the stuff that matters in the game to the question: which properties do people land on most? The answer depends on the structure of the board, the rules of the game and the throws of two dice. One way to answer the question is this. Just follow a single piece around the board as you throw the dice and follow the rules. Count how many times you land on each property (or program a computer to do the job for you). Eventually, if you have enough patience or you have programmed the rules well enough in you computer, you will build up a good picture of which properties get the most business. This should help you win more often. What you have done is a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis. The board defines the rules. Where you land next only depends on where you are now, not where you have been before and the specific probabilities are determined by the distribution of throws of two dice. MCMC is the application of this idea to mathematical or physical systems like what tomorrow's weather will be or where a pollen grain being randomly buffeted by gas molecules will end up.
