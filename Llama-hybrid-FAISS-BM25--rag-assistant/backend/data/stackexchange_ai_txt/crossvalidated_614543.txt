Interpretation of coefficient of dummy variable in regression

I have a regression where the dependent variable is the difference in income between towns i and j. The independent variable is a dummy variable which takes value 0 if both towns have the same ruling party and takes value 1 if they are ruled by different parties. There are two political parties A and B in all. How do I interpret the coefficient of the dummy variable. Say it is -10 and significant. On average the income gap between the two town is lesser when they are ruled by different parties. Is this interpretation right? But this cannot be attributed to any one party. Say the income is lower when party A is ruling? I would like to use the difference in income in place of income itself to overcome an endogeneity problem. So I would like some help with interpreting the dummy variable.
