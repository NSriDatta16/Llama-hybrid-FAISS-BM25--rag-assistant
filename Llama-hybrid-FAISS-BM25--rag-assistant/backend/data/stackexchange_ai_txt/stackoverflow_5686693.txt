When you import into a module, you import into the module's namespace. Thus when you have from jpa_export_helpers import SourceFile in plugin_jrt_py you have actually created a name plugin_jrt_py.SourceFile . Following namespace resolution, within plug_in_jrt.py that name can be shortened to SourceFile but only within plug_in_jrt . Because an import has side effects, the import statement is careful not to import a module twice. You don't specify a calling sequence, but I suspect that fragments.py is imported by plugin_jrt.py and so the name is not accessible without qualification. Try dropping the from clauses and the error will become more apparent.
