How to interpret the odds ratio in a logistic regression with proportion as a response variable

I have a glm model for some data with a proportion as the outcome variable as follows: xi: glm pos_tests i.covariate_1 covariate_2 , family(binomial total_tests) link(logit) vce(robust) eform In this model, pos_tests is the number of positive laboratory results and total_tests in the number of all tests conducted. i.covariate_1 and covariate_2 are categorical and continuous independent variables respectively. pos_tests | Odds Ratio Std. Err. z P>|z| [95% Conf. Interval] -------------+---------------------------------------------------------------- _Icovariate_1 | 2.535989 .9193459 2.57 0.010 1.246149 5.160891 covariate_2 | .976045 .0270064 -0.88 0.381 .9245231 1.030438 My question is how do I interpret the significant result for covariate_1. Does it mean that the odds of all test results being positive are 2.54 time greater for those individual with covariate_1 or is there some other way of interpreting. Thanks.
