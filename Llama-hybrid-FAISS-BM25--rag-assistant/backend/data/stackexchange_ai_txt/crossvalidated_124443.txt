The primary benefit of using monthly returns data instead of daily return data is that with monthly data, returns are at least approximately normally distributed (or, at the very least, the simplifying assumption of normality is much less crazy for monthly returns than it is for daily returns). As an aside, check out this quotation from Eugene Fama's book, Foundations of Finance (available here ): The usefulness of the portfolio model depends not on whether the normality assumption which underlies it is an exact description of the world (we know it is not), but on whether the model yields useful insights into the essential ingredients of a rational portfolio decision. Likewise, the usefulness of the model for securities prices depends on how well it describes observed relationships between average returns and risk. If the model does well on this score, we can live with the small observed departures from normality in monthly returns, at least until better models come along.
