How to estimate missing data points from a moving average curve?

The table below is extracted from Wikipedia . It shows the Pollution Standards Index (PSI) readings of Singapore. I am trying to estimate the four missing data points (2-5am) on day 20th June . I did this by first plotting a graph of the 3-hourly readings. Then I try to derive the 1-hourly readings with the formula: PSI(1hrly)n = 3 * PSI(3hrly)n - PSI(1hrly)n-1 - PSI(1hrly)n-2 This derived data is then used to plot a graph of the 1-hourly readings. In theory, the 3-hourly curve functions like a moving average curve that lags the 1-hourly curve. There shouldn't be too much deviation. I tried a few values but I am getting wildly erratic results. The curve below is plotted based on values 200,200,140 and 200. Is there a way to get a rough estimate of the missing data?
