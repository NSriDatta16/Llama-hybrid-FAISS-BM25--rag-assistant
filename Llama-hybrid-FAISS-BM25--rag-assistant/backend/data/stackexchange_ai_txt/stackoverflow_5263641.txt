How to fix 'undeclared identifier' error in Indy?

I have downloaded Indy 10.4587 and I get 'undeclared identifier' error when I try to compile it and install it in Delphi 7. type ADDRINFO = record ai_flags : Integer; // AI_PASSIVE, AI_CANONNAME, AI_NUMERICHOST ai_family : Integer; // PF_xxx ai_socktype : Integer; // SOCK_xxx ai_protocol : Integer; // 0 or IPPROTO_xxx for IPv4 and IPv6 ai_addrlen : size_t; The error is in this file: LIB\SYSTEM\IdWship6.pas(49) Fatal: Could not compile used unit 'IdWinsock2.pas' How can I fix this bug? Does anybody have the direct download link to a stable version? It looks like the latest pseudo-stable version of Indy you can download may be 10.4587, which actually may be 10.4.587. There is no ReadMe or About file inside the archive to explain the version and release date. It can be downloaded from a 3rd party web site here: http://indy.fulgan.com However, people are talking about a possible version 10.5.8. Please let me know if you have a real download link for this 'magic' version. Edit: I just downloaded v10.4587 and it doesn't compile.
