Statistical methods for ranking units

The problem: Suppose I have an ordered sample of $n$ observations (e.g. a playlist of songs) that are ranked according to some latent (unobserved) feature, for each of which $p$ covariates are recorded. I want to build a model that is able to rank a new $m$ -sample consistently with the original sample, based on their covariates. All I can think of is to fit a logistic regression model with $2p$ variables on the probability $\pi_{ij}$ that observation $i$ is ranked higher than observation $j , but I am not sure if this is a good way to go. Are there any well-established techniques for this out there? I have attempted to search for relevant literature, but I am unsure about the specific terminology used to describe this type of problem, and I couldn't find anything about it. I would also appreciate solutions to alternative and similar problems, as there may exist more suitable formulations to my problem.
