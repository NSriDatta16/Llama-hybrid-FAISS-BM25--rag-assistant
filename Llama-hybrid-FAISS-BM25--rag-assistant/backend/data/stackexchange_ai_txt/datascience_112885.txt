Why does the PCA Scores plot (PC1 vs PC2) flips when using extracted variables from the Gaussian?

Imagine you have some multivariate data (1000s of variables) which approximately follows the Gaussian distribution. You can generate various PCA Scores plots from this data, of course. One option is to extract variables from the Gaussian (such as the max height of the distribution or its full width at half maximum and so on) and use this as input for creating your PCA scores plot. I did this and I also plotted the PCA scores plot using just the original data as it was. Something unusual happened: the axes remained on the same scale and these plots were a flip of each other about x = 0. That is, the left-most point became the right-most point on the other plot and so on. So like a mirror reflection. What could this mean?
