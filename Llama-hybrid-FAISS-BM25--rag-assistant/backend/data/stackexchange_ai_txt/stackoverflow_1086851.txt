Good practice class line count

I know that there is no right answer to this question, I'm just asking for your opinions. I know that creating HUGE class files with thousand lines of code is not a good practice since it's hard to maintain and also it usually means that you should probably review your program logic. In your opinion what is an average line count for a class let's say in Java (i don't know if the choice of language has anything to do with it but just in case...)
