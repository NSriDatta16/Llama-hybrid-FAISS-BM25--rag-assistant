How can I parse and normalize HTML from different HTML generators?

This is an extension of this question . I'm trying to parse HTML snippets embedded in an XML backup of a Blogger blog and retag them with InDesign tags. Blogger doesn't standardize the HTML for any of its posts, and the posts can be written in Word, Windows Live Writer, the native Blogger interface, or text editors, resulting in tons of different forms of HTML. Some posts don't mark paragraphs and only use double s in between paragraphs—others use actual tags. What's the best way to parse this unstandard conglomeration of tags? Additionally, each post is not a complete HTML file--just a snippet that gets inserted into a template—which means that there is no overall HTML structure to parse ( , etc.) Does that have any effect on XML/HTML parsing? Here's some potential examples, mostly standard HTML, missing paragraphs: This is a section of a blog post. It has links and lists and stuff. Weee.... Here's a list Item 1 Item 2 And another paragraph here... Etc. The Word HTML looks like this - http://www.timeatlas.com/mos/images/stories/word_html_tags.png
