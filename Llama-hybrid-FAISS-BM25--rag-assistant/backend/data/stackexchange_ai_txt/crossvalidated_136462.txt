How do you generate correlated ARMA(1,1) models?

I am interested in generating two ARMA(1,1) time series with a pre-defined cross-correlation p between x(t) and y(t). If you could please provide the mathematical framework and the code in R for generating it would be perfect! I have looked at the question Generate two correlated ARMA(1,1) processes which is not a duplicate, since that question (despite the title) looks for a given correlation between the errors, while I am looking for a given correlation between the series themselves.
