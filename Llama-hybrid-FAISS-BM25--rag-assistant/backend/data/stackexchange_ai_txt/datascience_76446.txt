k-means and LDA for text classification: how to test accuracy?

I have many tweets that I would like classify based on their similarity. Unfortunately I am not quite familiar with text-classification and nlp, so I had to read a lot of documents before having an idea on the topic. My tweets have no labels so I cannot classify them: only manually, but it would be time consuming. I would like to group them by topic, so i have first considered LDA for topic classification, then k-means clustering. Is it a good approach to proceed? What are the differences and how I can test the accuracy of the classification?
