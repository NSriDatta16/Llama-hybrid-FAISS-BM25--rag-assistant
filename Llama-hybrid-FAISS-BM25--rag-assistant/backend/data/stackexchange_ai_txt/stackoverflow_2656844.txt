Using git as a backend storage system

New to git here... I want to commit my personal file share to a git repo (text, docs, images etc). As I make modifications to various files over time, telling git about them along the way, how do go about things so I can: Get out of the business of traditional fulls/incrementals. Be able to do a point-in-time file or full clone restore. Basically, I want something granular, such that, if I make an edit to a file 5 times on a particular day. I will have 5 versions of that file that I can refer back to- forever. Or even just derive the a full copy of everything the way it looked on that particular day. I am currently using rsync for remote incremental syncs (no file versioning).
