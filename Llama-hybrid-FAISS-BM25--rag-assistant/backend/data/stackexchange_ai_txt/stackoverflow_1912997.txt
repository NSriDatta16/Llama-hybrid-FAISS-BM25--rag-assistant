Using HAML elements inside a block of text

I often want some html like this: ( all items shown) which I end up getting by using haml like this: %span> Note that I end up having to create extra spans, and then having to control for the whitespace around those spans, in order to get the exact syntax that I want, without extra spaces between the first ( and the all . So here's the question. What's the best way of having the exact html above, to display (all items shown) with all in a span? Is there something more elegant than my haml?
