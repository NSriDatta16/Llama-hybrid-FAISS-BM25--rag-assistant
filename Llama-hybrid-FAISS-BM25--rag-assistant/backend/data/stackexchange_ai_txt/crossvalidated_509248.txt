Rank-ordered statistics of a data time series

I have a time series of observations $(x_t)_{1\leq t\leq T}$ that I can order into $(x_n)_{1\leq n\leq N}$ , with $N = T$ such that $x_n and $x_1=\min{x_t}$ and $x_N=\max{x_t}$ . Then I pair up the data and construct $(y_n)_{1\leq n\leq N/2}$ , with $y_n=(x_n + x_{N-n+1})/2$ , and $(z_n)_{1\leq n\leq N/2}$ , with $z_n=(x_n^2 + x_{N-n+1}^2)/2$ . I now linearly regress $(y_n)_{1\leq n\leq N/2}$ vs. $(z_n)_{1\leq n\leq N/2}$ and obtain $$y_n = c + bz_n + e_n,$$ where $(e_n)_{1\leq n\leq N/2}$ is the regression error. I get a pretty good fit ( $R^2 > 0.90$ ). The questions are: what does it tell about the data, what is the meaning of the coefficient $b$ , how does it relate to the standard skewness of the distribution or to maybe a Spearman's rho of some sort, in a word, what have I demonstrated?
