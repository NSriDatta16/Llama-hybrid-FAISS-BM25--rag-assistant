As I understand it, this issue is not at all specific to mixed models, but is a variant of "the difference between significant and non-significant is not significant" (see also other blog posts by Gelman); see also Pockock et al.2002 . Consider the following statements: "within C1, we can reject the null hypothesis of no $A \times B$ interaction; the effect of A on responses differs significantly across levels of B (and vice versa )" "within C2, we cannot reject the null hypothesis; the effect of A on responses does not differ significantly ..." "we cannot reject the hypothesis that the $A \times B$ interaction is the same in both levels of C" All three are true. As @Wolfgang points out below, the test of the three-way interaction is the formal test that there is a difference between the strength of the interaction across different levels. The corresponding picture:
