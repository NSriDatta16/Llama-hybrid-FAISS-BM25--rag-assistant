Tuning logistic regression with class_weight hyperparameter for an imbalanced dataset

I just have an imbalanced dataset, and now I am at the point where I am tuning my model, logistic regression. As I understood, class_weight parameter helps us dealing with these kind of datasets, and when doing model tuning you can use different weights to get a better performance. What I am not sure about is how can choose different weights to tune my model according to the dataset that I am using. I am using this well-known dataset, adult income found on kaggle. So I am looking to get different weights for my two classes (0 and 1) - if income is 50k a year. For example , we know that weights can be in this form : {class_label (0 and 1) : weight (how can I find, deduce different weights for each label here?)}. Some examples would be helpful. Thanks.
