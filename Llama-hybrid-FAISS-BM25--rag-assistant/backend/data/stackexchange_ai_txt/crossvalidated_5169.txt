I interpret this question as supposing that an experiment is conducted 200 times. In this experiment, 25 people are independently drawn from the population (with replacement) and their average height is rounded to the nearest centimeter. This process yields 200 whole numbers. You seem to be asking, what is the chance that the average of these 200 numbers exceeds 176 cm. This interpretation requires us to deal with several phenomena: the sampling distribution of the mean, the effects of rounding, and the effect of repeated sampling. Other interpretations are possible but it appears these issues will arise no matter what, so I hope the following analysis will illustrate useful, relevant techniques even if a different interpretation is intended. The sampling distribution of the mean of 25 independent values (with replacement) has the same mean as the parent distribution and 1/25th of its variance. It's also Normal. Thus in this case it's a Normal(174.5, 6.9/5) distribution. Rounding turns a continuous distribution (Normal(174.5, 6.9/5) in this case) into a discrete distribution, because now the only possible values are 0, 1, ..., 174, 175, 176, ..., cm. The probability of observing one of these values $y$ equals the probability that the true value lies between $y - 1/2$ and $y + 1/2$ and therefore is given by $$\Pr(Y) = \Phi(\frac{y + 1/2 - 174.5}{6.9/5}) - \Phi(\frac{y - 1/2 - 174.5}{6.9/5}).$$ where, as usual, $\Phi$ is the cumulative distribution function for the standard Normal distribution. Because normal distributions are symmetric, bias in rounding of values less than the mean ought to balance any bias in rounding of values greater than the mean. The balancing will be perfect when the distribution's mode is a half integer, which is the case here. Thus the mean of this "discrete Normal" distribution is exactly 174.5. The rounding will increase the variance . As an approximation, people usually think of rounding as acting at random to vary a number by some amount uniformly distributed between $-1/2$ and $+1/2$. The variance of this uniform distribution is $1/12$, whence we can estimate the variance of the discrete normal distribution as $$\sqrt{sd^2 + 1/2} = \sqrt{(6.9/5)^2 + 1/12} = 1.40986\ 99703\ 63697\ 52354,$$ approximately. This approximation works well when the rounding is small compared to the standard deviation of the true distribution, which is the case here. In fact, exact calculations give a value of $1.40986\ 99703\ 63697\ 65285$, differing from the approximation by about $10^{-16}$. That's more than accurate enough! -- But it was worthwhile checking. Now that we know the parameters of the distribution of rounded averages of 25-person samples--namely, a mean of 174.5 and SD of 1.40986--we determine as before that the expectation of the mean of 200 such rounded averages is 174.5 and its SD is $1.40986/\sqrt{200}$ = $0.099693$. Now this distribution is going to be extremely close to Normal, but not perfectly so: after all, its values must all be multiples of 1/200 = 0.005 cm. If you like, you can introduce a continuity correction in the usual way by observing that there can be no average between 176 and 176.005 cm, so you would compute the probability of a Normal variate exceeding their midpoint of 176.0025 cm. However, this makes no practical difference, because 176 - 174.5 cm is more than 15 standard deviations above the mean: it's virtually impossible that the average of 200 rounded values could exceed either 176.0025 or 176. The exact value is approximately $$1 - \Phi(\frac{176.0025 - 174.5}{0.099693})$$ which less than $10^{-53}$. Because the original population is only "approximately" Normal, we shouldn't rely on any probability calculation this small. We might just as well say the answer is "essentially zero."
