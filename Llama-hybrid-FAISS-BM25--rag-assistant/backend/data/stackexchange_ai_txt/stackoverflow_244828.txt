To understand what ls does, you could take a gander at the OpenSolaris source: https://hg.java.net/hg/solaris~on-src/file/tip/usr/src/cmd/ls/ls.c . If thatÂ´s overwhelming, on Solaris you start by using truss to look at the system calls that ls makes to understand what it does. Using truss, try: truss -afl -o ls.out /bin/ls then look at the output in ls.out I believe that trace is the equivalent to truss in Linux.
