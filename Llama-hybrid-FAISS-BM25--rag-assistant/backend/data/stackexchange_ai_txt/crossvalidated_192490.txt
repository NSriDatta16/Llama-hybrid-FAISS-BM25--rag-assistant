Application of Huber-White Variance Estimates in GLMER

I'm currently working on an analysis in R using GLMER mixed-effects model with a logistic regression framework under the lme4 package. I would like to include empirical (Huberâ€“White sandwich) variance estimates within the GLMER framework but I haven't been able to find a way to include them. I would greatly appreciate any assistance on addressing this issue.
