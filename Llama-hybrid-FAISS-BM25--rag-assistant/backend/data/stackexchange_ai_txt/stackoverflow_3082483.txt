On the iPhone, it can indicate that you ran out of memory. Use the "Run with Performance Tool" -> "Leaks" in Xcode to monitor memory usages and for catching memory leaks. On the older 3G iPhone models, anything over 30MB is a candidate for running into out of memory issues. If your memory is heavily fragmented, this can occur more with lower memory usage.
