Is there a workaround to the Flash bug where selection doesn't stop?

Is there any workaround to the issue with Adobe Flash where a Flash Movie does not receive a mouse up event if the mouse is dragged outside of the movie? EDIT: This issue seems to affect Firefox only See: http://bugs.adobe.com/jira/browse/FP-234 Basically the issue is, I have a Flash movie which contains a text box, and if the user clicks in the text box and drags to select (highlight) text, and they drag outside the flash movie and release the mouse, then the FLash move doesn't receive the mouse release event and even though the mouse is up, moving the cursor around the page continues to change the selected text within the flash. Many have suggested using ActinScript to listen for a MOUSE_LEAVE event but there's two issues. One, I am using AS2 not AS3, and second, it seems like MOUSE_LEAVE doesn't fire if the mouse is held down when it leaves the stage. EDIT 2: George Profenza's "dirty hack" had been mostly working for me for months... but as of 8/24/10, I now see that Adobe has marked this issue as resolved, finally!
