Creating Java object with boost::posix_time::ptime serialized XML representation

I have following XML generated by serializing a boost::posix_time::ptime structure. I want to create a Java Date object with this XML. 20100119 11 53 33 0 Below is the Java code that is supposed to construct Date object by de-serializing this XML. Problem that I am facing is how to break the tag into year/month/day sequence. Integer date = timeStamp.getPtimeDate().getDate(); Integer hrs = timeStamp.getPtimeTimeDuration().getTimeDurationHours(); Integer mins = timeStamp.getPtimeTimeDuration().getTimeDurationMinutes(); Integer secs = timeStamp.getPtimeTimeDuration().getTimeDurationSeconds(); Calendar cal = Calendar.getInstance(); //TODO //cal.set(year, month, day, hrs, mins, secs); Date date = cal.getTime(); Any hints? EDIT: I am looking for some elegant solution that doesn't require converting date to a string and then splitting it. That would be my last resort. Thanks
