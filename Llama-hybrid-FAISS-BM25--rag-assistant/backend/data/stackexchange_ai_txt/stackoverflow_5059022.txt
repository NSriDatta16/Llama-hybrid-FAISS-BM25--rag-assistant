How to build a media streaming server

We'd like to build a media streaming server and would like to know the strategies when it comes to choose the hardware and software. Some of our requirements: We host everything ourselves Bandwidth is not an issue (we got good backings) Commodity hardware (no expensive NAS, SANs) Support large files Prefer not to use Flash Media Server The situation here is a little bit different than what some of you guys might have experienced before. The cost of a professional system-admin and developers are way much cheaper than signing a contract with hardware or software vendors in storage solutions area. The way we scale is by buying cheap commodity hardware and (probably) build the infrastructure ourselves using varieties of open source software. We're looking at a varieties of distributed file systems for storage such as MogileFS, GlusterFS, HDFS and it looks like HDFS might be the front runner. Please share your experience if you've built something similar before. Thanks!
