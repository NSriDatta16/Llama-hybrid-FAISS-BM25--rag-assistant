Style Inheritance with ActionBar Tab troubles

Many of my questions about "styling" actionbar tabs were answered by adamp in this thread on tab style , but I am still struggling with my arriving at the desired presentation. Specifically, I am attempting to do what adamp suggested in the following fragment from my styles.xml file, but, I cannot get the inherited (Widget.holo.actionbar) feature of a light blue line to appear under the selected tab nor is there any indication of selection: @style/CustomActionBar @style/customActionBarTabTextStyle @style/customActionBarTabStyle @style/customActionBarTabBarStyle #2966c2 20sp sans @drawable/actionbar_tab_bg --> 20dp 20dp 240dp Can someone explain why the thin blue line selection behavior of the Honeycomb Gallery Sample App does not work for me? New insight since this was written: the problem here, I think, is that the style I have created to overide ActionBarTabStyle is entirely bogus: 20dp 20dp I need to specify the correct parent of this style per "Theme.holo"....how can one find where the default style is so it can be specified as a parent? Thanks
