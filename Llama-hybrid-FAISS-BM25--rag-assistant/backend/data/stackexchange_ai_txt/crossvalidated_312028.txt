Relationship between PCA and KPCA

The relation between PCA and KPCA seems somewhat confusing. Basically, the Kernel variant of PCA can be described as constructing the normalized kernel matrix of the data $n \times n$ (n is the number of samples), followed by eigendecomposition to extract the linear principal components. Then, KPCA can extract up to n (number of samples) nonlinear principal components. Does this have the same effect as performing PCA on the data matrix associated with a kernel matrix, where the data matrix $X$ of kernel matrix $K$ is expressed as: $$ K = U\Sigma U^{\top} = U\Sigma^{1/2}(U\Sigma^{1/2})^{\top} = XX^{\top} $$ In other words, for $K = XX^{\top}$, the following relation should hold between PCA and KPCA: $$ KPCA(K) == PCA(X^{\top}) $$ Does the above relation hold?
