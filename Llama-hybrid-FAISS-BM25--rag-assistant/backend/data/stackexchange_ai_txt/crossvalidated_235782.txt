PCA maintains the best possible projection. Some reasons you would use random projections are: With very high dimensions, if speed is an issue, then consider that on a matrix of size $n \times k$ , PCA takes $O(k^2 \times n+k^3)$ time, whereas a random projection takes $O(nkd)$ , where you're projecting on a subspace of size $d$ . With a sparse matrix its even faster. The data may well be low-dimensional, but not in a linear subspace. PCA assumes this. Random projection are also quite fast for reducing the dimension of a mixture of Gaussians. If the data is very large, you don't need to hold it in memory for a random projections, whereas for PCA you do. In general PCA works well on relatively low dimensional data.
