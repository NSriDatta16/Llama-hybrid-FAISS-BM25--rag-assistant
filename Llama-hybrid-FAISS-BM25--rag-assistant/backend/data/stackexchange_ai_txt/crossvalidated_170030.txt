T-test using only summary data in a box plot

I have the 5 number summary (min, Q1, Median, Q3, max) from two boxplots and wanted to test whether or not the averages of the groups in the two boxplots were significantly different. I would like to do this using a t-test but I don't have the data available to me (just the 5 number summary). Is there a way to test for differences of the mean? Or a crude approximation to a t-test? Also, I do know the sample size and the mean.
