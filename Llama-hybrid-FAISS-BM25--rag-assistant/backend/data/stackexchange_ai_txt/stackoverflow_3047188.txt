From the question I assume that you can add code to the outer edges of the applications but that there are everywhere "Beware of the JabberWock" signs. If it is not serializable then the object will probably contain references to intrinsically unserializable stuff like services, stateful beans, ... and other stuff which only makes sense in the container. Now normally most of this stuff you probably wont need outside the container. RMI will not solve your problem, because then the payload must be serializable, back to square 1. A pragmatic approach could be to use a simple XML generator like XML Digester of Apache Commons if it still exists, or some simple JSON generator, and pick the data from the Session you need in the standalone app and dump it in a tree which makes sense.
