Do HTTP request headers have to be UTF-8 encoded?

I could not find anything in the spec which says it should be. I have seen a couple of browsers setting their user-agents to non UTF8 encoded strings. There is however a Content-Type request header which specifies the media type (and charset), and I'm not sure if that is applicable only to the body of the request or the headers too.
