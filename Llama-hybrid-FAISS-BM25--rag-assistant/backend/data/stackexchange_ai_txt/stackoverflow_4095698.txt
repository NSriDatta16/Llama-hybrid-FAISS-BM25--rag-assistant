It might help you understand the situation if you consider a program (C++) as below. It displays the groups of successive integers that get rounded to the same float value: #include #include int main() { float prev = 0; int count = 0; double from; for (double to = 2000000000 - 150; count " Output: 1999999850..1999999935 ==> 1999999872 1999999936..2000000064 ==> 2000000000 2000000065..2000000191 ==> 2000000128 2000000192..2000000320 ==> 2000000256 2000000321..2000000447 ==> 2000000384 2000000448..2000000576 ==> 2000000512 2000000577..2000000703 ==> 2000000640 2000000704..2000000832 ==> 2000000768 2000000833..2000000959 ==> 2000000896 This indicates that floating point is only precise enough to represent all integers from 1999999850 to 1999999935, wrongly recording their value as 1999999872. So on for other values. This is the tangible consequence of the limited storage space mentioned above.
