Evaluating fuzzy C-Means clustering

I am new machine learning practitioner. I have run fuzzy c-means algorithm on a multi-label dataset ( PPI dataset ) on the network using skfuzzy python library. I want to evaluate the performance of the fuzzy c-means algorithm on the dataset using overlapped NMI, Omega Index. I found a github repository OvpNMI , but it requires two clsfiles, ground truth labels file and predicted labels file. I created a truth labels file from dataset but unable to get the predicted labels file from the c-means library. What I am able to get from cmean_predict is fuzzy c-partitioned matrix. I have searched the internet but failed to get answers. Can anyone please help me?
