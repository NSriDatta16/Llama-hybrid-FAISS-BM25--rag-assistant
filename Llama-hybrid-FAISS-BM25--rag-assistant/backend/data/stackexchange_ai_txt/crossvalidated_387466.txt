Discard features with small variance, how to do in practice?

I'm training a neural network for regression. The input vectors consist of $92$ different features, I want to discard features with small variance (standard deviation). There are two ways that came up to me: Decide the number of features to keep, say $N$ . Then keep the $N$ features with the biggest standard deviations. Choose a $\sigma_{min}$ , then discard features whose standard deviation is smaller than this $\sigma_{min}$ . For the second approach, I don't know how to choose such a $\sigma_{min}$ , there are also two ways that came up to me: Just arbitrarily choose a $\sigma_{min}$ , say 1e-5 . Let $\sigma_{min}$ to be $\text{mean}\{\sigma_i\}_{i = 1}^{92}$ Which approach should I choose?
