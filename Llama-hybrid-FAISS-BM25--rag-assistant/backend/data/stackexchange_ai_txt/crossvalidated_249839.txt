Sample to small for logistic regression: can I group my continuous variables and use some other test?

I was suggested to use logistic regression in order to examine if different levels of antibodies in animals influence parasite isolation rates from their tissues. However, my total sample comprises of only 45 animals, so when I tried regression after all, Hosmer and Lemeshow test showed p-value well below 0.05... I was wondering if I could group data regarding antibody levels (for example, group 1 would be animals with titres below 25, group 2 animals with titres of 25, group 3 animals with titres of 50 and group 4 animals with titres equal or higher than 100) and use some other test instead of regression, for the same purpose? Thank you...
