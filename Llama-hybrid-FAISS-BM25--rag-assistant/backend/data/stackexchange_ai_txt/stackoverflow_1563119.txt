how not to hard code connection stringin all pages

I have a webconfig file which has a connectionstring in it... But then when ever i access a database i have to write the same connectionstring again and again... is there a way it can take the value of the connectionstring from the webconfig file itself..???? System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnection dataConnection = new SqlConnection(); dataConnection.ConnectionString = @"Data Source=JAGMIT-PC\SQLEXPRESS;Initial Catalog=SumooHAgentDB;Integrated Security=True"; System.Data.SqlClient.SqlCommand dataCommand = new SqlCommand(); dataCommand.Connection = dataConnection; any suggestions??
