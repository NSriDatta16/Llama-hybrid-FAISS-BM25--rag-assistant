Is it possible to derive anything useful from this piece of data?

Let's say you have online Profile A. Profile A is present on 3 websites: X, Y, Z. Profile A on site X contains the following fields: name: A email: a@a.com sex:m age:35 location:europe Profile A on site Y contains the following fields: name: B email: a@a.com sex:f age:28 location:us Profile A on site Z contains the following fields: name: A email: b@b.com sex:t age:35 location:asia This is just an example it could be any other kind of data. My question is about whether a threshold exists of recordset randomness. How would that be detected? Where models will not derive anything significant out it. Kinda of like poop in -> poop out kind of scenario. What is this even called in the field of Data Science? So I can read more about it. Does this kind of data just get ignored and become irrelevant? Does it result in heavily unrealistic estimations? Does it solely depend on how the model is structured whether meaning is derived from this example? Thanks
