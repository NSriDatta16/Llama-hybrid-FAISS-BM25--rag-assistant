Proper way to center pop window with Javascript and pass html

Goal: quick and dirty app (client side only) to grab some arguments from one page and put results onto a new page, which can be printed and then closed. Arguments on the original page then can be changed and new page popped. Used this as a starting point: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.open http://www.yourhtmlsource.com/javascript/popupwindows.html Proof of concept(final version will have about 10 inputs/args) HTML fragment JS function dirtypop(arg) { var popwin=window.open('','name','height=300,width=400,status=1,center=1'); popwin.document.write(' Square '); popwin.document.write(' '); popwin.document.write(' Squared plus one is: '+arg+' '); popwin.document.write(' Close this window '); popwin.document.write(' '); popwin.document.close(); }; function genResults() { x = document.getElementById('x').value; if (x == parseFloat(x)) { dirtypop(x*x+1); } }; This works(tested on FF3.5 and Chrome), except new window does not pop into center. How to center it? Mozzila says needs chrome=yes and talks about UniversalPrivilege scripts, what kind of beasts are those? Anything else that can be improved?
