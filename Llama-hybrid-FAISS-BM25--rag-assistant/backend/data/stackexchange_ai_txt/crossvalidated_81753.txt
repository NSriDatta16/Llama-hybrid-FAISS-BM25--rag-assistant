PCA in Matlab: what proportion of variance is explained by the PCs?

I try to implement PCA in MATLAB using the Fisher iris data. I am having a problem finding out the percentage of variance in Principal Component Analysis. Running this code load fisheriris X = bsxfun(@minus, meas, mean(meas)); [pc, ~, latent] = pca(X) cumsum(latent)/sum(latent) I get the following result: pc = 0.3614 0.6566 -0.5820 0.3155 -0.0845 0.7302 0.5979 -0.3197 0.8567 -0.1734 0.0762 -0.4798 0.3583 -0.0755 0.5458 0.7537 latent = 4.2282 0.2427 0.0782 0.0238 ans = 0.9246 0.9777 0.9948 1.0000 Now how do you choose the percentage of variance? (In the "hald" dataset it is 98%, but I also don't understand why 98%.)
