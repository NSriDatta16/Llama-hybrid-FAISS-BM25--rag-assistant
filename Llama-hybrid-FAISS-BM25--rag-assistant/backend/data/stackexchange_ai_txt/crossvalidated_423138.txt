Very basic question about task

As a machine learning super beginner I decided to play around with some programs that can perform action recognition task. I decided to give this one a try: x 1) I don't really understand why accuracy number for each iteration is so high. I decided to print out the values of TN, TP, FN and FP for diving action and here's what I got: TP = 9 FP = 4 FN = 1 TN = 109 Why is there such a disparity between these numbers? I have to admit that I don't now much about programming in Python and can't fully grasp how the program exactly works.
