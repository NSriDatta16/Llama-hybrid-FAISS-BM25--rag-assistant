Cross-validation can be done once (10 times, or simply 10 ), or done ten times (10 times done 10 times, or 10 x 10 ). For clarity, let's change these values to 5 and 5 x 20 . Here's how this works: The training set is randomly partitioned into five chunks. Five models are built out of these five. Each model is built using four of the chunks as a training set, and one as a testing set. The five models are averaged to create a single model balanced for randomness. To account for the initial choice of the five partitions, we repeat steps one through three 20 times. The resulting 20 models are averaged. Steps 1-3 constitute cross validation, which is the 10 you're asking about, or the 5 in the example. Step 4, which repeats steps 1-3, is repeated portion of repeated cross-validation and the x 10 you're asking about, or the x 20 in the example.
