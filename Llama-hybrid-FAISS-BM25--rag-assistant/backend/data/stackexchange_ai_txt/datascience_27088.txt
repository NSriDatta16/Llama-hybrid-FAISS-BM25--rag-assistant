Logistic Regression Independent Samples

I'm studying Logistic Regression for the first time. My book explains how to fit the weights $w$ using the likelihood function $L(w)$, assuming that the individual samples in our dataset are independent of one another . I know what independent events are. But I don't understand the meaning of the individual samples in our dataset are independent of one another in the Logistic Regression case. What does this mean? And why?
