Permissions are required to access the system properties files, and your code is clearly running in a sandbox that does not grant the permission. You either need to modify the sandbox security rules to allow access to that file, add a specific API you can call to pass the "agent.properties" file contents, or find some other way to get the properties to your code that doesn't involve reading a file at all. An example of the last might to pass the properties in the file as command line arguments, or put the file into your JAR file so that you can read it as a resource (modulo the security sandbox not blocking that as well.) But it must be said that there is something weird about a JAR file that won't let you read files on your own machine. Why is it doing this? Is this a homework exercise ... about security managers, permissions, etc?
