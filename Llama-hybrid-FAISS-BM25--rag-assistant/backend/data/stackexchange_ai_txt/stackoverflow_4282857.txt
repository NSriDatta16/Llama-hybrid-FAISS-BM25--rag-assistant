Where should I store a user ID key in spring / spring-security in a webapp?

Once a user is authenticated I have an Object userID. Where is the "best" place to store this in Spring using Spring-Security (this is a webapp)? Session seems inelegant, because then I have two locations managing authentication (I need special code to manage removing the sesion object when the user is logged out for whatever reason) The currentContext.getAutentication().getDetails(...) seems complicated because it is seems to generate the details object per request There are many options, but the best seems to be somewhere close to the Spring-Security authentication mechanism.
