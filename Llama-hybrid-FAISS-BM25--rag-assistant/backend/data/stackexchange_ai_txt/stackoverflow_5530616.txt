Is git stable on Windows?

Possible Duplicate: What are currently the problems with Git on Windows Recently, I've been considering switching our source control system from svn to git so that we can leverage the feature of distributability. After I did some investigations. I found that, it seems we don't have much choice on running git on the Windows. Only one option that balances on both side of learning curve and administrative effort is msysGit. Unfortunately, It's still on the preview version so far. Do I miss something? Or, is there a better alternative?
