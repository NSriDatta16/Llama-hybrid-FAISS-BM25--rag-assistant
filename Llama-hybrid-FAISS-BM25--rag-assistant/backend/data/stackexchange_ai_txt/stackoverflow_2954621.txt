Coffeescript really just makes writing JS easier. You end up with cleaner, more efficient code. That being said, you still can only do whatever you can do in vanilla JS. Once you use coffeescript enough, it does become a lot easier to write (good) JS. So if you haven't used JS a ton, I'd suggest learning coffescript instead. You'll get better, cleaner, less buggy code. If you're already really fluent in JS, it might not be a good idea to start using coffeescript on a "real" app. (Also, coffeescript does irk me a bit in that it seems to encourage rather "floofy" code. I don't know if it's a good thing or a bad thing, but it seems an extreme case of TMTOWTDI)
