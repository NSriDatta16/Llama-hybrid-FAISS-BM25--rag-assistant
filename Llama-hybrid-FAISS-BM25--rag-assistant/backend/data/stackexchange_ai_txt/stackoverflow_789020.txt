Unless you're distributing the browser, you won't be able to dictate when IE/Firefox/Safari/etc. set the TE header. You may be able to register a callback in your webserver's request handler before headers are processed, and remove the TE header, but... Unfortunately, the TE: client header only has to appear in requests that also have the Connect: header, which are usually only at the beginning and end of the pipeline (see rfc2616 ), which means that if a browser is already reusing the connection for the page you don't want chunked, then you're out of luck. A hack: you may consider embedding a second instance of the webserver that has chunking disabled and serve only the problem page from there. Obviously this requires running the server on a different vhost or port. It's most ideal if your vendor can just fix the bug, but I know you don't get to pick the timing on that :-)
