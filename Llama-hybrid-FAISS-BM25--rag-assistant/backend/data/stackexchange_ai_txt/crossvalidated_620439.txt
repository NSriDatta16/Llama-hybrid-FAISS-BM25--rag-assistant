According to Section 9.2 of a User Guide for " Ecopath with Ecosim ," what you are showing seem to be fits of a dynamic coupled differential-equation model to time-series data of the biomass of (potentially multiple) predator and prey species. The quote in the OP explaining the SS values (on page 81 of the User Guide) is followed by an explanation of the weights: Each reference data series can be assigned a relative weight using a simple spreadsheet in the search interface, representing a prior assessment by the user about relatively how variable or reliable that type of data is compared to the other reference time series. So this isn't the same as an ordinary (or weighted, in the usual sense) linear least-squares regression. There is a dynamic model fit to multiple outcomes observed over time, with outcomes contributing differentially to the fit of the model depending on their estimated reliability. The time-series aspect of the modeling adds additional complications. The simplest thing would be to proceed as @Dave suggests in another answer. For each type of biomass, you could use the weighted residual sum of squares as the numerator of the fraction shown on the right, provided that you similarly weighted the sum of squared deviations of the individual log-biomass values from the mean log-biomass over the observations that form the denominator. That should be easy to calculate from the data you provided to the model. There are problems with that. First, even with a simple ordinary least squares model, you can get an arbitrarily high $R^2$ just by fitting a more complex model. Thus an $R^2$ adjusted for the number of fitted parameters is typically preferred. Yet this model is fitting a very large number of parameters to handle the interactions among the species in the ecosystem. Second, time-series data can be lead to anomalously high $R^2$ values due to autocorrelation among observations. As the User Guide says on page 94, you need "to account for autocorrelation in the model residuals that is expected even under the null hypothesis." Section 9.5.7 of the User Guide, "Time series random effects," indicates that there might be a way to get a global F -statistic "under the null hypothesis that all of the deviations between model and predicted abundances are due to chance alone." That uses Monte Carlo simulations to deal with the autocorrelation problem. That would seem to be a more useful estimate of model performance than $R^2$ values for individual (log) biomass values. I don't have any experience with this software, however, so I suggest that you work closely with someone who does to make sure that I'm interpreting that section of the User Guide properly.
