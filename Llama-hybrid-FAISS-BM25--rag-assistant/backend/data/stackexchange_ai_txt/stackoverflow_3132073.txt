Dealing with session hijacking in PHP

Reading through the many questions regarding session hijacking here on Stackoverflow, I've gathered that the only 'solution' to validating a users session is by checking the user agent, which is such a weak layer of protection that I don't even bother to implement it. So, I was wondering what solutions you guys have implemented? Are you even using PHP's native sessions or is there a more secure solution?
