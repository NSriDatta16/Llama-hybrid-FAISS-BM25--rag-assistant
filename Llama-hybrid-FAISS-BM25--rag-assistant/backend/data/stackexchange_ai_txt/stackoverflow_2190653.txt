Frameworks are generally a part of your architecture. They are normally part of the infrastructure of your code. MVC is a framework, as is ASP.NET, WinForms and many many libraries (NHibernate, PostSharp and more). Architecture refers to how your software it put together - how it is organized, how the different classes and modules in it interact.
