horizontal to vertical table transformation in SQL Server 2005

I have a page that dynamically builds forms input fields from a table allowing users to enter input into the form. Each input is a field in a _info table. I would like report showing all of the entries of a user in one line. Each field entry is a row. So I need to take the vertical data and make it horizonal. There are many different forms with different configurations so must be dynamic. I’ve come across a lot of articles for cross-tab pivots but they only work for aggragates/sums. The Registration_Info table has multiple entries for one form submission. I need to list these horazontal with each form_field.label as its fieldname for reporting. Below is an example table layout: FORM —————————————— FORM_ID|FORM_NAME 500|“Custom Form 1″ FORM_FIELD —————————————— FORM_FIELD_ID|FORM_ID|LABEL 1|500|“Field 1″ 2|500|“Field 2″ REGISTRATION —————————————— REG_ID|FORM_ID|USER_ID 23|500|45 24|500|98 REGISTRATION_INFO —————————————— REG_ID|FORM_FIELD_ID|FIELD_VALUE 23|1|“My Name” 24|2|“My City” Required Report Output: REG_ID |Field 1 |Field 2 |FORM_ID |USER_ID ——————————————————————————————— 23 |My Name |My City |500 |45 24 |Another Name |Another City |500 |98
