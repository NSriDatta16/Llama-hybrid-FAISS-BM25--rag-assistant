How to deal with unknown classes with a convolution neural network classifier?

I'm quite new into the DL and ML field. I'm training a CNN able to classify 3 different classes, however I would like in the testing phase to make the CNN able to not misclassify images that do not belong to any of the three classes. I understand that the network will always provide one of the three class for any input testing image, but I was expecting quite low score values when the image is "unknown", in order to apply some threshold. Is there a way to improve the CNN in order to obtain this result? Or it is better to change the classifier? I was also thinking to add a fourth class, the "unknown" one, but for the purpose of my study it would be difficult to obtain a training set of unknown images.
