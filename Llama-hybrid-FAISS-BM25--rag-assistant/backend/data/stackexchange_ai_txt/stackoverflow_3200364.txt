You need to instruct the webbrowser to not cache the pages in the history so that it's forced to fire a brand new request to the server when you navigate back in the history. In JSP/Servlet this can be done by adding the following headers to the response of the page(s) you'd like to disable the cache for: response.setHeader("Cache-Control", "no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate"); // HTTP 1.1. response.setHeader("Pragma", "no-cache"); // HTTP 1.0. response.setDateHeader("Expires", 0); // Proxies. This can be done in a Servlet which forwards to the JSP or a Filter which intercepts on JSP requests. See also: Making sure that the page is not cached across browsers
