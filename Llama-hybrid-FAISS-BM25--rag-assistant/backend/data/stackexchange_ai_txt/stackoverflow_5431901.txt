which spring ws jaxb annotation to change xml element name

I am using a sping ws endpoint with jaxb marshalling/unmarshalling to proudce a list of Organisation objects (our local type). The endpoint is SOAP 1.1, no parameters supplied on the request message. I understand JAXB doesn't handle lists very well, so I use a wrapper class. @XmlRootElement(name="orgResponse", namespace=....) public class OrganisationListWrapper { private ArrayList organisationList; public getOrganisationList() { return organisationList; } public setOrganisationList(ArrayList organisationList) { this.organisationList = organisationList; } } The endpoint.... @PayloadRoot(localPart=.... namespace=....) @ResponsePayload public OrganisationListWrapper getOrganisations() { OrganisationListWrapper wrapper = new OrganisationListWrapper(); wrapper.setOrganisationList(.... call service layer get list ....); return wrapper; } This works fine and I get a SOAP payload with ... contents of organisation 1 ... comtents of organisation 2 .... etc .... The Organisation class is not JAXB annotated. It is part of a large list of pre-existing classes that are being exposed through web services for the first time. Trying to get by without going in and annotating them all by hand. I was able to override the name OrganisationWrapper with orgResponse in the XmlRootElement annotation. I would like to override the organisationList name in the child element with organisation but haven't been able to find an annotation that does this. I can replace the array list name with organisation and it will work fine, but our coding standard here required us to put List on the end of our list names. I would like to try and stick to that. I have tried XmlElement , but that produced a jaxb exception. Any suggestions would be appreciated.
