Impact of feature selection

I am trying to understand the impact of feature selection on neural networks. If I have n features and n' number of features are redundant, and I eliminate those n'. Do the remaining number of features I use for deep learning have a positive/negative effect on accuracy or does feature selection here simply reduces time to train the model since there are lesser number of parameters now?
