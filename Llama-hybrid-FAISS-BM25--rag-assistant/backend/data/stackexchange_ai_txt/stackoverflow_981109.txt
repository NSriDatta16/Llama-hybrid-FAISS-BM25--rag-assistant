design considerations for a WCF service to be accessed 500k times/day

I've been tasked with creating a WCF service that will query a db and return a collection of composite types. Not a complex task in itself, but the service is going to be accessed by several web sites which in total average maybe 500,000 views a day. Are there any special considerations I need to take into account when designing this? Thanks!
