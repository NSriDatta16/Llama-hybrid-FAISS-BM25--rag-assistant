I asked the same question to myself recently. I developped my own stats counter stuff. But I'm not completly happy with the results (too much heap consumed for stats, made a bad choice when decided to choose a memory model for the storage). The question you have to answer is: how often will I have a look at these stats? In my case, not very often (that's why the memory-only storage is a bad choice for me). I was wondering if I should move the storage model to something like jrobin (a java impl of the Round Robin Database model). I also recently discovered the perf4j ( http://perf4j.codehaus.org/ ) project
