jQuery BBQ Pretty URLs

I'm using the BBQ jquery plugin for AJAX history management, but I'm having a problem getting 'pretty urls'. I've tried everything I can think of, but hopefully I'm missing something stupid and someone can point me in the right direction. I'm serializing a form for only inputs that are filled to avoid empty querys in the hash fragment. Alerting decodeURIComponent is showing the string how I want it, yet I'm still ending up with #hashfragment=key%26value%3Dkey%26value Can anyone help? The related code is below. stateQuery = $('#searchUsers :input[value]').serialize(); stateQuery = decodeURIComponent(stateQuery); // Push the state into history and replace any other keys $.bbq.pushState({ search: stateQuery }, 2); Thanks.
