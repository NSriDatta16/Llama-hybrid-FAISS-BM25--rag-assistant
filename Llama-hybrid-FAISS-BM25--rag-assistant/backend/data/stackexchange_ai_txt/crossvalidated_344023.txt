If running all the models on all the time series is too expensive, you could pick a representative sample of time series and evaluate the models on each of the time series in that sample, hoping that the results will be representative for the whole population of time series. But how do we pick that sample? If you have an overview of the types of series and their counts, you could do random stratified sampling, i.e. randomly pick some series from each type and use weights to account for overrepresentation or underrepresentation if needed. If you do not have an overview, then select the series randomly (number all of the series and draw a bunch of random numbers between 1 and the number of series).
