So long as we're talking about C++, the only authoritative source is the ISO standard. That doesn't ever use the word "instantiation" for anything but class and function templates. It does, however, use the word "instance". For example: An instance of each object with automatic storage duration (3.7.2) is associated with each entry into its block. Note that in C++ parlance, an int lvalue is also an "object": The constructs in a C++ program create, destroy, refer to, access, and manipulate objects. An object is a region of storage. Since new clearly creates regions of storage, anything thus created is an object, and, following the precedent of the specification, can be called an instance.
