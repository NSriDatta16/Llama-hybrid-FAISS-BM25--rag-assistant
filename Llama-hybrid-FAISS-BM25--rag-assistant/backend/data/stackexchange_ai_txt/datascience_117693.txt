I see what you're trying to do. It looks like you're trying to implement a simple graph convolutional network (GCN) that averages the node values over local neighborhoods in a graph. One thing that stands out to me is that you are using add_remaining_self_loops to add self-loops to the edge index. This will cause the node values to be aggregated with themselves, which may not be what you want. Instead, you might want to consider only using the edges that connect different nodes, rather than adding self-loops. Additionally, it looks like you have commented out the linear transformation and bias term in your TranscriptConv layer. This means that the node values will not be transformed in any way during the message passing process. Is this what you intended to do? Finally, it might be helpful to print out the inputs and outputs of your message passing layer to see what is happening at each step. This can help you debug any issues that might be occurring.
