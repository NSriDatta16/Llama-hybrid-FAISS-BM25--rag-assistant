foreach is not a standard C++ feature. This was something Eric Roberts and I developed for the Stanford introductory programming sequence and predates the more modern C++11 range-based for loop. Now that C++11 compiler support is more widespread, we've stopped using foreach and just opted to go with the standard C++ enhanced for loop. I would generally not advice using foreach going forward as it's nonstandard. However, if you're compiling older code that uses it, you'll need to include one of the header files from the Stanford C++ Libraries that defines it.
