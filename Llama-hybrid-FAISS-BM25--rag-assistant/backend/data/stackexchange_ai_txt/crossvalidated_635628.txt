That's certainly one good way. You might also consider classification trees, random forests, or other methods, but logistic reg is fine. Discriminant analysis is yet another possibility, but IIRC, it imposes a lot of assumptions. However, if 19% of your data are positive, that's about 30 cases. One rule of thumb limits you to about 3 independent variables. If those variables are related, you might try factor analysis, and keep, at most, 3 factors.
