Not sure if this is the most elegant solution, but it worked for me when we used SQL 2000... If you're writing a stored procedure, you can do it with a temporary table. Create a temporary table which has an automatically incrementing Identity column as well as the same columns as your result set. Then, select the data from the result set and insert it into this temporary table (in the right order). Finally, return results from your temporary table where the value of your Identity column acts as your row number.
