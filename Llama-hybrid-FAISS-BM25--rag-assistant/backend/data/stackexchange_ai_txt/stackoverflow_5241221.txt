You should manage your hierarchy by tagging all subitems as deleted. This way if your eg. product belongs to a brand, you can check only if brand is deleted. You should also put your logic on data retrieval side, to avoid unnecessary gathering of deleted information. SELECT * FROM products p, category c WHERE p.catId = c.Id AND NOT c.Deleted And above all, information about deleted category should be indexed. CREATE PRIMARY INDEX ON category (Id) CREATE INDEX ON category (Deleted) or CREATE INDEX ON category (Id, Deleted)
