Static inner classes are an alternative to normal classes in another package. So you won't have to worry about them getting mixed up with your servlet classes. Because you call the .handleRequest() methods as a result of servlet calls, you must make sure that the implementation of your controllers is re-entrant . I.e. their execution should not use variable storage other than the stack and the objects you pass as arguments. That said, I would opt to put the controllers in their own package outside of the package that contains your servlets. You can then add a manager class that owns and initialises the map and handles calls from servlets (abstracting the implementation details.)
