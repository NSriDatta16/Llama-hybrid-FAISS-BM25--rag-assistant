I'm not aware of any way to install a plugin from within Safari. Also, keep in mind that while you may think of the extension-style deployment as easier for users, it's not all that uncommon for Mac users to use more than one browser. If you make them re-install your plugin in each browser they will be confused (since that's not how browser plugins are generally deployed on the Mac) and annoyed. An installer or a manual drag-and-drop installation are the standard ways of deploying plugins on the Mac.
