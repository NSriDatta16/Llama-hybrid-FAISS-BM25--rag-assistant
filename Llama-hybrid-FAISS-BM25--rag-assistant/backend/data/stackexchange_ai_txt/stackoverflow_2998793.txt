What does it mean when a DataInputStream keeps returning 0?

I have a DataInputStream , created from a Socket in Java. The connection is to a simple web server that uses chunked transfer encoding. The web server does in fact work in normal browser. But in my program, I am attempting to read, I read the first first bytes (some 5kb of data). But each read after that returns 0 bytes read. Isn't it supposed to block until it can read? Note: This usually doesn't occur. The problem is with the server I am connecting to. Also, this code here all returns false even after the bytesread == 0.: System.out.println(socket.isClosed()); System.out.println(socket.isInputShutdown()); System.out.println(socket.isOutputShutdown()); And here are the resp headers: HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Tue, 08 Jun 2010 14:01:01 GMT Server: Apache/2.2.11 (Unix) PHP/5.2.10 X-Powered-By: PHP/5.2.10 Expires: Thu, 19 Nov 1981 08:52:00 GMT Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0 Pragma: no-cache Keep-Alive: timeout=5, max=100 Connection: Keep-Alive Transfer-Encoding: chunked Content-Type: text/html
