What is a good interface to allow display in multiple languages

I'm working on a website that theoretically should be available in all languages. The interface and content are very simple so this is not a problem. The problem is what internationalization interfaces are usually used to cue the user to the availability of multiple language? The obvious one is a drop down list. Any other good examples of how this has been done elegantly? As a side question: are there any books or material dedicated to the topic of i18n and localization, preferably for PHP but any good resources on the topic can help.
