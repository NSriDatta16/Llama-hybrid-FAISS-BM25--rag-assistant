Learning parameters of non-parametric Bayesian models

I have a sample of Chinese restaurant process which I want to model as Pitman–Yor process. How do I determine parameters of Pitman-Yor model from given sample? For Dirichlet process I would just use the fact that on average K=αlogN where is K is observed number of tables and N is total number of visitors but I see no similar way for the Pitman-Yor process.
