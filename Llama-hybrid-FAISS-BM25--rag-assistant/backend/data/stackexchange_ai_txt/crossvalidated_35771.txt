Comparing coefficients in logistic regression

I have some problems I need help with. I am running a binary logistic regression. DV: Brand choice (0/1) IV1: Attitude towards product (p (Both IV1 and IV2 are measured on the same scale) I have found that “Attitude towards product” is more powerful ($β=1.308$) than “Price sensitivity” ($β=0.956$) in predicting brand choice. However, according to my thesis supervisor, in order to claim this fact, I need to run an additional test. That is, I need to find out if this difference is significant. So, what I want to know is if: $β_{Attitude}> β_{Price}$ (or if $β_{Attitude}≠ β_{Price}$) and if this is statistically significant. I have been searching a lot, but I cannot find how I am supposed to test this. Does anybody have any ideas?? I have read that it is possible to run a t-test (with brand choice as grouping variable) and look at the t-values and if the t-value is higher for “Attitude towards product” is higher, then it is the stronger one. However, I have 3 groups (conditions) so I’m not sure that I can run a t-test. Can I use an ANOVA instead and look at the F-values? I also came across some information that I could include an interaction-term (Attitude*Price) and that the p-value for each interaction term gives me a significance test for the difference in those coefficients. Is this a valid method??
