Low correlation of predictions: the "hot hand"

In this recent article ( http://www.statsblogs.com/2016/12/19/low-correlation-of-predictions-and-outcomes-is-no-evidence-against-hot-hand/ ), the Hot Hand problem is discussed, referring to Josh Miller's lines: On correlations, you know, the original Gilovich, Vallone, and Tversky paper found that the Cornell players’ “predictions” of their teammates’ shots correlated 0.04, on average. No evidence they can see the hot hand, right? Here is an easy correlation question: suppose Bob shoots with probability ph=.55 when he is hot and pn=.45 when he is not hot. Suppose Lisa can perfectly detect when he is hot, and when he is not. If Lisa predicts based on her perfect ability to detect when Bob is hot, what correlation would you expect? I'm not an expert in statistics, but I'm quite sure that the issue, although evident in binary situations, also exists for continuous variable / covariates. Is that true? If yes, it would be hard to elaborate a code which can demonstrate that?
