First order condition for OLS?

The below is quoted from this post: When is logistic regression solved in closed form? "In OLS, you have $$ \sum_i (y_i - x_i' \beta)^2 \to \min_\beta, $$ which has the first order conditions $$ -2 \sum_i (y_i - x_i'\beta) x_i = 0 $$ " I'm not sure what this syntax and terminology means. I think the right arrow means that we want to minimize $\beta$ ? And what is the purpose of the "first order condition" equal to 0? Sorry the silly questions.
