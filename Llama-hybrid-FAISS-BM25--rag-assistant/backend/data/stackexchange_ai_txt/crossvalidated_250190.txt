Suitability of Factor Analysis to sample data

I am looking into Factor Analysis as a tool for dimensional reduction in a data set I am working with. I have a quick question regarding this technique. How can I check that FA with a given number of common factors n captures enough information from my original data? I am looking for a criterion to assess variance retained when I convert my features similar to what we can do on PCA when we look at the eigenvalues after svd decomposition. Thanks a lot for your reply.
