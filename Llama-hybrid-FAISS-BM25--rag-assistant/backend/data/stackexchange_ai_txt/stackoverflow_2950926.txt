I think Pragmatic Unit Testing is a good complementary book for Osherove's Art of Unit Testing. Pragmatic unit testing deals with flushing out errors and different types of targeted testing, whereas Roy's book is a higher level and more general book that deals with a wider range of concepts. As a beginner, I found the Pragmatic book an excellent starting point. Here are some other quality resources: Misko's guide to writing testable code . One of the main battles when writing tests is ... how to structure code to make it testable. Misko's guides are invaluable. Roy Osherove's cranky test review videos . The second battle we face is writing good, clear, maintainable tests. It's really easy to write bad/brittle/unmaintainable tests, so it is important to be aware of common mistakes. These videos can be a bit cranky at times, but they're full of good tips.
