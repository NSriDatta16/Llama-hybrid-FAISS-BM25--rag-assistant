How to connect .Net app to JMX agent?

I need to connect my .Net application to somebody else's JMX agent. I've read that this is simply not the done thing and I should use soap or practically anything else. As this is just not going to happen, are there any libraries or interop techniques out there that can help me? I'm only interested in the simple things like invoking a remote operation or returning a string result.
