I would use a set for this: type TMyDatum = (mdLoaded, mdPersisted, mdChanged, mdMarkedToDelete, ...); TMyData = set of TMyDatum; var Foo: TMyData; begin Foo := [mdLoaded, mdChanged]; if (mdPersisted in Foo) then ... These are implemented as integers, so you can pass them easily. And I find the code much, much more readable than bitwise operators.
