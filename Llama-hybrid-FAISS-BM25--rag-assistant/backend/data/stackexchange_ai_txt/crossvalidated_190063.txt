Is this a valid way to calculate an SD of a pooled sample (NOT a pooled SD)?

Let's say I've got 2 different populations (e.g. 35 and 40) with 2 different means and SDs (22.3, 28.0) and n (e.g. 35,40). I don't actually know the individual values. Obviously you can calculate a pooled SD (NOT what I want) it in R with something like this: n This gives an SD of around 4.194827. However, would it be valid to assume these 2 populations are normal, synthesise them using the means and SDs given, and then take an SD of these 2 hypothetical populations? I don't see why not as long as I'm not explicit we've estimated the SD in a paper's methods? I could do this e.g. with: > result for (i in 1:10000) { + control mean(result) [1] 5.06259 I iterated 10000 times to get a good average. So 1) Is this a valid calculation? 2) If yes/no, is there a better way of doing it? A colleague appears to have an excel spreadsheet which gives a very similar number using this formula: =SQRT((A2*(D2^2)+A2*((C2-G2)^2)+B2*(F2^2)+B2*((E2-G2)^2))/(A2+B2)) Where A, C and E are n, mean, sd of the 1st arm, and B, D, F are the same of the 2nd arm. G is the weighted mean of the 2 groups. It seems to give the same result as my synthetic data so I assume it is valid? Thanks
