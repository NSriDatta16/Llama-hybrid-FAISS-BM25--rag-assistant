UIScrollView does not respond to touches in iPhone

I have a scroll view with images inside it and I'm using touhesBegan, touchesMoved, and touchesEnded to tap on an image to enlarge it. But It does not seem that the scroll view is responding to touches at all. I tried most of methods in similar questions but still does not work. I have been working on that for long so please any help would be appreciate it. Thanks,
