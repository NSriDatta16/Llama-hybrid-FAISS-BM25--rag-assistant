What's the problem of evaluating a global metric at the end of each epoch in deep neural network?

I'm interested in evaluating the weighted f-score at the end of each epoch while training a deep neural network. However, I found that in Keras 2.0 they removed such metrics because they can be misleading. Quoting from this issue on GitHub: Basically these are all global metrics that were approximated batch-wise, which is more misleading than helpful. This was mentioned in the docs but it's much cleaner to remove them altogether. It was a mistake to merge them in the first place I don't really understand; how is this can be misleading (more details)?
