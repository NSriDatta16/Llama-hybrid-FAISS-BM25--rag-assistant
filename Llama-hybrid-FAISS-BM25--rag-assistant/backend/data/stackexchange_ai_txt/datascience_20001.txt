Multi-class Classification Task with Input space size n x 1

I am trying to create a model that predicts / classifies the response variable with an input space of size n x 1 , which is essentially a single feature. To be more precise, I have to predict which class in among 0~9 (y) would it be according to a probability value (X). Intuitively, I am thinking that y and X will have negative correlation. However, I cannot really think of a model that would perform well under the condition provided above since there is only one feature to consider when creating a model. I have tried XGBoost and RandomForest, but I feel like I used those models mostly as blackboxes. Please do suggest a fine machine learning model to conduct such multi-class classification with input space of size n x 1 . Thank you!
