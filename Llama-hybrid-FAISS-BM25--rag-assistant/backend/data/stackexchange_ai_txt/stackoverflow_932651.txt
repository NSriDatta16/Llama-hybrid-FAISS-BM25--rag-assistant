Does it happen for tags without an asp: prefix. e.g. Can you create a UserControl, and drag that in and give it a different tag prefix If not, then it sounds like something has gotten set on your system that treats asp as a protocol :( But to be honest, I'm at a complete loss as to why this might happen.
