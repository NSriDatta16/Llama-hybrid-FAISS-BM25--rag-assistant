Make sure you have removed any max_execution_time limits by setting this to 0 (unlimited) in your PHP.ini or by calling set_time_limit(0) . This will ensure that PHP doesn't stop the script mid-execution. If it all possible, you should run the script from the CLI so that you don't have to worry about Apache timing your request out (it shouldn't, but it might). Since you are working with only 15 MB of data I wouldn't worry about memory usage (128 MB is the default in PHP). If you are really worried you can remove memory limits in PHP by modifying the memory_limit to be either a higher number of -1 (infinite memory). Keep in mind modifying the PHP.ini will affect all scripts that are interpreted by that installation. I prefer to use the appropriate ini setting functions at the top of my scripts to prevent dangerous global changes. On a side note: This doesn't really sound like a job for PHP. I'm not trying to discourage your use of PHP here, but there are other languages that are better suited for command line usage.
