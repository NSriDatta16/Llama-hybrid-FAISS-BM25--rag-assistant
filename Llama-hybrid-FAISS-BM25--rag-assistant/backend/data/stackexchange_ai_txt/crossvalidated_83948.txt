Is R-squared value appropriate for comparing models?

I'm trying to identify the best model to predict the prices of automobiles, using the prices and features available on automobile classified advertisement sites. For this I used a couple of models from the scikit-learn library and neural network models from pybrain and neurolab. The approach I used so far is to run a fixed amount of data through some models(machine learning algorithms) and compare there $R^2$ values which was calculated with the scikit-learn metrics module. Is $R^2$ a good method to compare the performance of different models? Although I got quite acceptable results for models such as Elastic net and Random forests I got very poor $R^2$ values for Neural network models,so is $R^2$ an appropriate method for evaluating neural networks (or non-linear methods)?
