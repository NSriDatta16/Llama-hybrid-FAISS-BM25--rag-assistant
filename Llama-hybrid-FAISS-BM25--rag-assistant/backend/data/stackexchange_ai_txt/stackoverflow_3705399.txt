PHP function to sanitize all data

Is it a good, or stupid idea to sanitize all the data that could be sqlinjected? I wrote a function that should do it, but I've never seen it done and was wondering if it was a poor idea. The function I wrote: function sanitizeData() { $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'] = mysql_real_escape_string($_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT']); foreach(array_keys($_COOKIE) as $key) { $_COOKIE[$key] = mysql_real_escape_string($_COOKIE[$key]); } foreach(array_keys($_POST) as $key) { $_POST[$key] = mysql_real_escape_string($_POST[$key]); } foreach(array_keys($_GET) as $key) { $_GET[$key] = mysql_real_escape_string($_GET[$key]); } }
