I worked on a project where another programmer had tried out metaprogramming. It was terrible. It was a complete headache. I'm an average programmer with a lot of C++ experience, and trying to devise what the hell they were trying to do took way more time than if they had written it straight out to begin with. I'm jaded against C++ MetaProgramming because of this experience. I'm a firm believer that the best code is most easily readable by an average developer. It's the readability of the software that is the #1 priority. I can make anything work using any language... but the skill is in making it readable and easily workable for the next person on the project. C++ MetaProgramming fails to pass muster.
