Sending the same System.Net.MaiL.MailMessage to multiple recipients

I've got a method that basically has a "SendEmail" method (it will later be used by WCF service) It has params like, Subject, Body, etc... and a string[] of Recipients. What I do, is create a MailMessage based on the parameters, then send it using smtp - I know the MailMessage has a To MailAddressCollection, but if I add each address to that, the message is CC'd to each and every person in the collection. What I want to do is send it to them seperateley. Is there any way of doing this, other than creating a seperate mail message for each item in the Recipient array, and sending it that way? I don't want to just BCC it to them either... as far as i know that's still recorded in the headers of the mail, and it's not particularly elegant.
