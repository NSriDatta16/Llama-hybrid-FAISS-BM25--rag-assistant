I think representation of the data is less of a problem here. Although coordinate data are frequently used as predictors, the problem with those data is that they are autocorrelated eg Why does including latitude and longitude in a GAM account for spatial autocorrelation? So the tricky part is correctly modeling this variance structure, a construct of which can then be used as a predictor. One possibility is Moran Eigenvector Maps (MEM). On a separate point, depending on your dataset size (if it is not extremely large), Random Forests may be a more powerful technique than SVM.
