Silverlight: Wrapping a non-DependencyProperty in a DependencyProperty

I want to be able to add a Binding to some properties of a DataGridTextColumn (i.e. Width, Sorting order, etc.), however it seems that those properties are not DependencyPropertys, so they can't be bound to. Another answer suggested subclassing DataGridTextColumn to expose those properties as DependencyPropertys, however I can't seem to find any info on how to do this. Thanks, Robert
