Conceptually, a logistic regression is used to codify the probability of an event happening when an independent variable(s) changes. This is carried out by using a sigmoid function where x axis will be the value of the independent, and y-axis is the probability of the event occurring. If you have a categorical variable, you effectively have a step function as opposed to a sigmoid function. It will still work, but quite obviously not as well as it would work if your variable was continuous. So the presence of a categorical variable will raise or lower the expected probability by a fixed step, whereas with a continuous variable the change in expected probability will be a function of the magnitude of the input and the size of the coefficient - ie how steep the slope of the sigmoid function is.
