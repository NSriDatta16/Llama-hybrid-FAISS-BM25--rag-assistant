Without knowing exactly what version of Magento you are running, I chose to look at 1.3.2.4 for you. Oddly, I'm suprised you get any good result using 'catalog/product_new'. It has no provision for passing in the product id as a block arg. 'catalog/product_view' will allow you to pass in the product id as an arg, but only once. If you notice below, it's sets the product as a registry object the first time and will not use the passed in product id after that. public function getProduct() { if (!Mage::registry('product') && $this->getProductId()) { $product = Mage::getModel('catalog/product')->load($this->getProductId()); Mage::register('product', $product); } return Mage::registry('product'); }
