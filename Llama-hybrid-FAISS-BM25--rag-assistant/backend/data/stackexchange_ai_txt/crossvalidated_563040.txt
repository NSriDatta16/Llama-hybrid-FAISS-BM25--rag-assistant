The first obvious thing to deal with here is the question --- Why do the control and treatment group look so different (and why does the treatment groups suddenly trend upward rapidly) before the treatment is even applied ? This suggests either that you have misstated the start of the treatment, or you have a fundamental problem in your trial where the treatment and control groups are systematically different before the treatment is even applied. If I were you, I would put any considerations of modelling on the back-burner until you have given attention to this issue.
