Don't understand why I am getting this - 'Error: Value storage corrupted: negative offset'

I just started using IntelliJ-IDEA, and I don't know if the problem resides with the IDE or not. I'm assuming not but I have no idea. I've spent quite a lot of time googling this error to no avail. The error comes about at compile time. The weird thing is that I returned my code to the way it was before the error was showing up and it is still being thrown. Here is a little bit of my code that I believe is causing the problem. But I think it might be something besides my code. import org.joda.xpath.XPath; private XPath componentXPath; private List list; this.componentXPath = XPath.newInstance("(//rss/channel/item)"); Document doc = jiraAdapter.fetch("path to XML file"); list = componentXPath.selectNodes(doc); The componentXPath.selctNodes(doc) is somehow causing the problem. If i remove this line, then it compiles fine, but I need to get a list of all the nodes to work with. The error shows up in the messages pane: Error: Value storage corrupted: negative offset Any help would be greatly appreciated.
