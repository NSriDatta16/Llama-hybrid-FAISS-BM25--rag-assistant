How tangent distance works in three-dimentional space

I've read about tangent distance used in machine learning but I don't really know how it works. Concretely, consider two very different manifolds M1 and M2 and two points x1 , x2 on that two manifolds respectively. M1 is very far from M2 . What if the tangent plane p1 of M1 at x1 isn't parallel to the tangent plane p2 of M2 at x2 ? In fact, p1 will intersect p2 in this case, so distance( x1 , x2 ) is zero. This means that x1 and x2 will be classied into the same class regardless to the fact that M1 is very far from M2 . Can anybody explain this paradox for me ? Thanks alot for your helps
