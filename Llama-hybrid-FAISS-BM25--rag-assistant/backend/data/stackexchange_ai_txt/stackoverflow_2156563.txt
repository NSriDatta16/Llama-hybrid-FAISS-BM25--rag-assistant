How to keep one variable constant with other one changing with row in excel

Lets say I have one cell A1, which I want to keep constant in a calculation. For example, I want to calculate a value like this: =(B1+4)/(A1) How do I make it so that if I drag that cell to make a calculation across cells in many rows, only the B1 value changes, while A1 always references that cell, instead of going to A2, A3, etc.?
