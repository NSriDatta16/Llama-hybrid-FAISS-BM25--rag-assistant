As @Terrence says, this could be related to convergence issues. Since you are using stan I would suggest first looking at the $\hat{R}$ statistic. $\hat{R}$ > 1.1 are problematic, and for more information see this . Additionally, as @Terrence says credible intervals should be printed automatically when you apply summary() to a blavaan object. Though when I have used the blavaan R package in the past, I use the highest posterior density region (HPD) - one of many ways to construct Bayesian credible intervals (see this post for more information). In the code chunk below I calculated 95% percentile interval (which, as noted by @Terrence is not always equivalent to the HPD) using a dataset that can be found in the blavaan package (also see this post for a discussion of the 95% HPD in the context the blavaan package). ## Packages library(lavaan) library(blavaan) ## The industrialization and Political Democracy Example ## Bollen (1989), page 332 model
