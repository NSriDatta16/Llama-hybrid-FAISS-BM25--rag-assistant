jquery UI sortable, how can i return the text of moved ?

what i'm trying to do is to return the text that is contained by the moved li, after the list item was moved. Is there a way to do that? thanks EDIT: i tried: $(ui.item).text() but i get an ui is not defined error (i imported just jquery.js , ui.core.js and ui.sortable.js , do i have to import something else?) HTML text another text more text JS $(document).ready(function(){ $('ul#sortable').sortable({ handle:'.drag', axis:'y', update:function(){ alert($(ui.item).text()); } }); });
