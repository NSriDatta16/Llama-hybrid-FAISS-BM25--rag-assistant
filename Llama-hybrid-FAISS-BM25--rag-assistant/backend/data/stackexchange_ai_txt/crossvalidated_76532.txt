There are classification models that are inherently multiclass, without error-correcting codes or one-vs-rest. Some popular ones are Neural Networks, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Random Forests, Naive Bayes and kNN. The training time usually goes up a little, but it's far more efficient than one-vs-rest classification. There's a multiclass formulation of structural SVM, that worth mentioning. Though I haven't used it myself.
