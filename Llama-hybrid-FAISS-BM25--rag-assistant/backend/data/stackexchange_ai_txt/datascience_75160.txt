Rule base approach is always good starting point for initially as you might not have good amount of records to build classifier but be ready for certain false positive results. Let's understand the false positive situation in case of rule base. In your conversational dialogue you have put keywords like dinner, home, evening . But in certain news case like Trump having dinner with CEO's in the evening inside white house this might categories into conversational dialogue class. Now let's talk about classifier base approach. As you mention that there is already classifier for detecting fake news. You can use same classifier to decide whether its news or dialogue by setting up threshold based on accuracy let's say your model accuracy is 80%. Now when you fake/Not fake news classifier predict something but the accuracy/probability is below 80% then assume it's conversational dialogue . If you have good amount of datasets then always try to build your another classifier using pre trained embedding techniques to get good accuracy at early point.
