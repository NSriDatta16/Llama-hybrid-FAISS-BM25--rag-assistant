If you want a guaranteed minimum you could use three java.util.BitSets. These will only use one bit per flag (though you will have the extra object overhead, that may outweigh the benefits if the number of flags is small.) I would say if you have a large number of objects BitSet may be a better alternative, otherwise an array of byte constants or enums will lead to more readable code (and the extra storage shouldn't be a real concern.)
