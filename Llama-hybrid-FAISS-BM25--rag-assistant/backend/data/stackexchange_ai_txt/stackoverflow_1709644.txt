You're not enumerating over indices, but values there, to unset an array index, you have to unset it by index, not by value. Also, If your array index is actually the productID you can eliminate the loop altogether: public function RemoveItem($productID) { if (isset($this->shopcart[$productID])) { unset($this->shopcart[$productID]); } } Your example doesn't show how you are adding items to $this->shopcart , but this may or may not be an option for you depending on the needs of your project. (i.e. not if you need to have seperate instances of the same productid in the cart).
