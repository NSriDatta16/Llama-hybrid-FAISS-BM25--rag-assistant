I don't know Clojure, but I can give you some general advice about improving the performance of Vanilla A*. Consider implementing IDA* , which is a variant of A* that uses less memory, if it's suitable for your domain. Try a different heuristic. A good heuristic can have a significant impact on the number of node expansions required. Use a cache, Often called a " transposition table " in search algorithms. Since search graphs are usually Directed Acyclic Graphs and not true trees, you can end up repeating the search of a state more than once; a cache to remember previously-searched nodes reduces node expansions. Dr. Jonathan Schaeffer has some slides on this subject: http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~jonathan/Courses/657/Notes/10.Single-agentSearch.pdf http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~jonathan/Courses/657/Notes/11.Evaluations.pdf
