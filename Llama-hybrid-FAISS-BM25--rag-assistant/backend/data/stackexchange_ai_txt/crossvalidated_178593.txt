I have no problem mixing "supervised" and "unsupervised" techniques. What regression modeling assumptions are violated by doing so? For instance, by flipping the mode of the data matrix under analysis from cluster solutions to PCA yields another "unsupervised" technique -- which is like regression without a dependent variable. Many people prefer to run PCAs as an exploratory step intended to weed out redundancy among predictors. So, depending on how you use the results, it can provide insight into the variable selection process, contributing to a "supervised" predictive model.
