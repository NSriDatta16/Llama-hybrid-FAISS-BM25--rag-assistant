According to SiteCatalyst NetAverages , CSS3 Animations in October 2010 had a market reach of 11% on the desktop, up from 3% in January. On smart phones, the market reach is higher, 70% in October 2010. Strangely, their figures show a declining trend for CSS3 Animation on smart phones, down from 83% in November 2009. I don't know why. Perhaps it could be that iPhone had a bigger market share back then, but I don't really know. I guess it shows that all such statistic and web measurements should probably be taken with a grain of salt, or at least a lot of stuff needs to be taken into consideration when studying them or using them for making decisions. SiteCatalyst NetAverages is a service you need to sign up for (for a trial) so I can't post links to the statistics.
