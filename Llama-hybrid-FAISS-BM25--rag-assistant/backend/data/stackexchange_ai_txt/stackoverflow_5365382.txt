Since you just want the average of each two values to be inserted, you could do the following: v = [1 3 5 7 9]; W = zeros(1,2*numel(v)-1); W(1:2:end) = v; W(2:2:end-1) = (W(1:2:end-2) + W(3:2:end))/2 If you want something else, take a look at interp1 , which will allow for more advanced interpolation.
