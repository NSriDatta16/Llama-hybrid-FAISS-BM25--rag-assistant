Is it a good practice to embed mappings for errorcodes inside JSON?

Have a glance at this snippet of JSON. Motivation : The JSON is generated by a REST service & later on will be converted to XML. Simple Question : I am currently embedding the map for the error codes inside the JSON snippet, with the intention of helping the transformation to XML. The XML format does not use numeric codes. Should I place the mapping inside the JSON or inside the code that will do the transformation?
