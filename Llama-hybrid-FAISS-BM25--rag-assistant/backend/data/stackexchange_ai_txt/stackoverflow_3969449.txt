store data dynamically coming from database - c++

Can you give me a idea about the best way that can i store the data coming from the database dynamically. I know the number of columns before, so i want to create a data structure dynamically that will hold all the data, and i need to reorganize the data to show output. In one word - when we type the query "select * from table" - results will come. how to store the results dynamically. (Using structures , map , lists ..) . Thanks in advance.
