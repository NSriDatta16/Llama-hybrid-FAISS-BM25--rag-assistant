converting from treebank tags to wordnet-compatible tags in Java?

I have POS tagged input from OpenNLP...i need to use these with WordNet...but wordnet uses only 4 tags - noun, verb, adjective, adverb...where OpenNLP generates tags based on Penn treebank tagset . I need to convert them to wordnet-compatible tags... i did find this on the site - but its all python..i need java agreed that i can write a simple function myself to rename these tags..but what to do with other tags like DT, PP, PDT, POS, MD, etc...
