If Lisp is the perfect language, why are there so many?

Possible Duplicate: Why is the Lisp community so fragmented? Despite the snarky tone, I'm actually looking for a serious answer. I know the textbook response: Lisp is a model for computation, not a "language" per se. Still, why exactly are there so many different dialects of Lisp? Presumably it isn't because of surface syntax issues or crucial missing features, the way it is with so many other languages. But if not that, then what? Do they interpret that model of computation in slightly different ways? Are they pursuing different simplicity versus efficiency tradeoffs? Is it because of limitations in different compiler/interpreter codebases? Or something else entirely that non-Lispers like myself can't even imagine? I suppose the followup question would be: if the differences matter, which is the best modern Lisp for real-world usage? Thanks, Dr. Ernie
