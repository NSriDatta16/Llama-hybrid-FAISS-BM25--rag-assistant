SAS ARIMA: estimate without identify? or auto.arima in SAS?

I have several groups of data for time series analysis, and I need some automatic way to do the analysis. I try to find a way in SAS to automatically do the job, but I can't find one corresponding to auto.arima() in R. I have two questions regarding this: The closest one is to use identify with scan and esacf to find tentative orders for arima model. However, that doesn't test unitroot or whether the data is just a whitenoise. Also, I still need to manually figure out the orders. Does anyone know if there is any procedure in SAS that can do the analysis automatically? I tried to write a macro to do the job automatically. I need to fist run identify to check unitroot, whitenoise, orders etc. and based on the results, I need to run estimate accordingly with corresponding orders. However, when I write two separate proc arima procedures, SAS requires me to run identify again in the second procedure, otherwise the estimate can't be executed. For example: PROC ARIMA data = xxx; IDENTIFY VAR = yy scan esacf; RUN; /* other code */ PROC ARIMA data = xxx; ESTIMATE p=1 q=1; Is there a way to use the results of the identify in the first ARIMA for the estimate in the second ARIMA procedure? Otherwise, it's just a waste of time to run the identify twice.
