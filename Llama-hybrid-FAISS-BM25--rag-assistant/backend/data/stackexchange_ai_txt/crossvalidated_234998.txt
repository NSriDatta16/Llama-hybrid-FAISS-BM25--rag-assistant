Logistic regression diagnostic plots in R

For testing purposes I made up some correlated data in R like this: mydata = data.frame( outcome = c(1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1), predictor = c(0.1, -0.2, 0, 0.1, -0.3, 0.3, 0.2, -0.1, 0.1, 0.1) ) Then I did this in order to create a logistic model that modeled this data: model1 = glm(family = binomial, formula = outcome ~ predictor, data = mydata) Running plot(model1) yields the following plots: I need answers to some questions in order to understand how to perform diagnostics on such a logistic model. As someone with only an introductory course in statistics I'm having trouble gathering knowledge on how to interpret the plots. What do the "Predicted Values" in the first plot represent? What does residual mean in the context of logistic regression? Which of these plots can in any way be useful for model diagnostics based on real data? How?
