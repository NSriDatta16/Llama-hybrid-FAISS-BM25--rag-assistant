Gray out dates older than the MinDate in WinForms MonthCalendar control

I am using the MonthCalendar controls in a Windows Forms application. I want to gray out the dates older than the control's MinDate (or give the user some visual clue about which dates are not valid for selection). The control has no property for getting the behaviour I expect. I have tried the UltraDateTimeEditor from Infragistics but it has the same problem (no property to set a color/style for dates before the MinDate). How can I get what I want without having to code my own calendar control or doing too much low-level (i.e. custom drawing) stuff? Ideally, the solution should work on .Net framework 2.0, but if it needs 3.5, that's OK.
