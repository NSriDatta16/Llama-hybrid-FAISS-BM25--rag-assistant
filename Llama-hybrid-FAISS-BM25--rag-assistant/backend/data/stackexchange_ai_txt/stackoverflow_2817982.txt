I understand. I found the constant interruption annoying, like a PHB interrupting every 2 minutes for a status report. Did Infragistics think I was so stupid that I'd forgotten their stuff was running in trial mode when I had already dismissed the popup three times in this minute? Has anyone at Infragistics ever trialed their package as someone might who is considering if it can be included in a current project -- Change one property, run, change another, run, change another, run, ... ?? Apparently not. The process is - Change one property, run, DismissDlgBox, change another, run, DismissDlgBox, change another, run, DismissDlgBox ... Long before finishing figuring out whether Infragistics could help in my project I had enough of a company I perceived as assuming I'm an idiot and thought nothing of wasting my time. I deinstalled and moved on. For me, the popup on every run was part of their anti-sales strategy.
