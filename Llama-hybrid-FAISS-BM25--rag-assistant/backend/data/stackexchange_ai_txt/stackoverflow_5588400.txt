AppWidgetProvider is a BroadcastReceiver , and as such its life lasts as long as the onReceive() method. Your boolean keeps getting reinitialized to the default false at every touch. You could try making isEnabled static, but you never know when the process (and VM) that run the receiver will get killed (actually I'm not even sure that it would work at all). So your best chance is to use some storage, SharedPreferences would be fine I think.
