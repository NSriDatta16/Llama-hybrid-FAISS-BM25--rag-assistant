A rendering engine is the engine that a browser uses to render the html (i.e. gecko vs webkit). A user agent is how a browser identifies itself (i.e firefox 3.5). But even if you switch the user agent of lets say firefox to safari, it will still use the gecko rendering engine to render it's page. So to check how a page renders in different browsers you really need to render the page in those different browsers.
