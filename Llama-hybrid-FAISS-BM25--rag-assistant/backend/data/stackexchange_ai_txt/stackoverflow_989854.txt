Order is important very often. When it is, linked lists are good. If you have a growing collection, you have the option of linked lists, array lists ( vector in C++) and double-ended queues ( deque ). Use linked lists if you want to modify (add, delete) elements anywhere in the list often. Use array lists if fast retrieval is important. Use double-ended queues if you want to add stuff to both ends of the data structure and fast retrieval is important. For the deque vs vector question: use vector unless inserting/removing things from the beginning is important, in which case use deque . See here for an in-depth look at this. If order isn't important, linked lists aren't normally ideal.
