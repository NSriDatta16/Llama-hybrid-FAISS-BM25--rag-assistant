The Gaussian process is a Bayesian model. It uses Bayesian updating, so it doesnâ€™t matter if you process the data one sample at a time, or all at once, the result would be the same. There is no reason why you would tune the hyperparameters on a subsample of your data other than using held-out test set for validation.
