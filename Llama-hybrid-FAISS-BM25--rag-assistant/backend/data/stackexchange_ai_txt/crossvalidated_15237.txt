If it actually worked, and was something you could implement statistical code on in one way or another? Absolutely. There are undoubtedly new techniques that could emerge from throwing yet more computational firepower at something. Or, as importantly, making currently bleeding edge, computationally intensive techniques accessible. Just think about current computers - Bayesian estimation isn't exactly new. But being able to run MCMC-based analysis on massively complex data sets where that's not the focus of the paper, but just something that happened along the way, is profoundly powerful thing. So even if they don't bring about new techniques (which they will) being able to go "yeah, sure we can do that" to computationally intensive techniques on huge data sets is a big deal.
