Disable Drag-drop from TextBox

I have a WPF textBox that is declared as ReadOnly So, User can not write anything into the TextBox or delete the content but it still allows user to drag the text from this textbox and drop it in any other textbox that caused the text removed from the first textbox(the read-only one) and thats unexpected. Is it a bug? how can I get rid of this?
