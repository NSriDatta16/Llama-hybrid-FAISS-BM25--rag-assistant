In the EDM (Entity Data Model) the first one is represented by Store Schema Definition Language (SSDL) and the secound one by Conceptual Schema Definition Language (CSDL) . But, there is also a third player in this game: Mapping Specification Language (MSL) . In the Entity Framework metadata, the mapping layer sits between the conceptual and store layers and provides the map from the entity properties back to the tables and columns in the data store. Ef, as an ORM, works with all three. Developer codes against the Conceptual model and EF maps it back to the storage model using the MSL.
