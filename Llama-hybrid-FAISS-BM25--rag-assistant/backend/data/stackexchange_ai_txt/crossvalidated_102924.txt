All we need are basic properties of expectation and variance . Let $X_i\sim F_i$ be independent with mean and variance $\mu_i$ and $\sigma^2_i$ respectively. Then $E(\bar X)=\bar \mu = \frac{_1}{^n} \sum_{i=1}^n \mu_i$ (linearity of expectation) and $\text{Var}(\bar X) = \text{Var}(\frac{_1}{^n} \sum_{i=1}^nX_i) =\frac{_1}{^{n^2}} \sum_{i=1}^n \text{Var}(X_i)=\frac{_1}{^{n^2}} \sum_{i=1}^n \sigma^2_i$. From that, you can immediately compute the standard error of the mean as $\frac{1}{^n}\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n \sigma^2_i}$. (Indeed, you don't have to have independence, uncorrelated variables will do.) If the $X_i$ are correlated, the calculation can still be done (as long as you also know the pairwise covariances or correlations), it's just a little more complicated - specifically, $\text{Var}(\sum X_i) = \sum \text{Var}(X_i) + 2\sum\sum_{i These are not asymptotic results, as the CLT is, but exact, finite sample results that hold whether you have normal distributions or not. For example, if $X_1$ is $\text{Exponential}(1)$ and $X_2$ is $\text{Uniform}(0,1)$, independent of $X_1$, their average is not even close to normal, but the standard error of their average is still given by the formula I gave above. Here's a histogram of simulated values and theoretical density for the average of a standard exponential and standard uniform: $E(X_1)=1$ and $E(X_2)=\frac{1}{2}$. $E(\frac{X_1+X_2}{2}) = \frac{1+\frac{1}{2}}{2} = \frac{3}{4}$ (simulated = 0.74975). $\text{Var}(X_1)=1$ and $\text{Var}(X_2)=\frac{1}{12}$. $\text{Var}(\frac{X_1+X_2}{2}) = \frac{1}{4} (1+\frac{1}{12}) = \frac{13}{48}=0.27083...$ (simulated = 0.273). Standard error of the mean is then $\sqrt\frac{13}{48}\approx 0.5204$. Does this mean it is valid to use the standard error of the mean as representative of the uncertainty on the $\bar X$ That depends on what you regard as 'representative of the uncertainty'. There may be situations when you don't regard the standard error of $\bar X$ as the most appropriate way to measure the uncertainty of $\bar X$. If you want the standard error, you have it.
