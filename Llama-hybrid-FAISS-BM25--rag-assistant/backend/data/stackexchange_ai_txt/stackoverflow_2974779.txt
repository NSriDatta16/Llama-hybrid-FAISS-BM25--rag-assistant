Aside from hoping the person who created the webpage added a language identifier to the html tag or specified it in a meta tag, your best solution (and that means after those two) is to check the unicode character code for some non-English text from the web page. string text = "あの"; foreach (char c in text) { Console.WriteLine("U+{1:x4}", (int)c); } And check what language space it falls into. This won't be 100% accurate, however, as there is character overlap in a number of languages (Japanese can be determined fairly accurately due to hiragana/katakana use, but a random selection of Chinese characters MIGHT just be a section of Japanese kanji without hiragana or katakana). The quickest way to do this programatically is likely to narrow down as many language specific character sets as you can and check for those first and then do a more robust search failing any of the other three.
