How can you dynamically put different patterns on images in a webpage .

i have A bunch of fabric patterns (simple jpg files) An image for every letter of the alphabet(blank white background) I essentially want to have a page similar to this: http://www.craftcuts.com/hand-painted-wooden-letters-single-patterns.html but instead of having it as a static page, i would like a user to be able to: Type in a name Choose a pattern (one of the jpg files) and then have it display that name in that pattern. Obviously i could create separate jpgs for every combination of letters (right now i have a jpg for every letter with white back color) and patterns but i wanted to find out if there was a more elegant way of coding this up to have it dynamically put one image onto the letter in the other. EDIT: In my initial post, i assumed that this would have to be a front end thing (javascript), but if it makes it any easier (as a few people asked what is the backend), my back end is an asp.net-mvc so if there is some solution to build this up on the serverside and ship down to the client, i am more than happy using that as well.
