You are using a relational database system to store a set of key-value pairs. That means that you are not using the full power of a relational system. If you really think that key-value pairs are the best way of storing your data, then you should consider using something other than an RDBMS. Clearly, the database technology is not matched to your data storage needs. You should look into NoSQL and structured data storage.
