The important consideration is "what measure of effect matters for your purposes?". One common approach is to measure number of standard deviations of shift, that's probably not much use to you if you're trying to work out how much the mean changed . After all, if you're manufacturing screws , knowing the screws are 0.073 standard deviations shorter is not much use. Knowing they're about 0.016mm shorter on average -- that potentially matters. But if you were dealing with things whose scales are somewhat arbitrary, the numbers themselves aren't especially inherently meaningful, and then sd's of shift makes far more sense. If you're dealing with something like test scores, a change of 3 doesn't necessarily mean anything very much... but if you know it's half a standard deviation, that might matter much more.
