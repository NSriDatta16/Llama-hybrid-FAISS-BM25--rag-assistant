but I am not sure I can plot a logistic curve in this case since wouldn't my response variable have to be binary to apply a logistic curve. You have multiple observations at the same value of insecticide. So you get counts per total number of observations. Such counts are binomial distributed which is a sum of Bernoulli distributed variables. The count variable is actually under the hood a binary variable (a sum of several binary variables). See also: In using the cbind() function in R for a logistic regression on a $2 \times 2$ table, what is the explicit functional form of the regression equation?
