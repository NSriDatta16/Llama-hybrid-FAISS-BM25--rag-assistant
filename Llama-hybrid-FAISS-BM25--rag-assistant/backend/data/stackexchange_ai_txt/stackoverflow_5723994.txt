Your problem is that the rotation handling of UIWindow and UIViewController just isn't designed to work that way. Quoth the documentation : In an iOS application, the window object does much of the work associated with changing the current orientation. However, it works in conjunction with the application’s view controllers to determine whether an orientation change should occur at all, and if so, what additional methods should be called to respond to the change. Specifically, it works with the view controller whose root view was most recently added to, or presented in, the window. In other words, the window object works only with the frontmost view controller whose view was displayed using one of the mechanisms described in “Presenting a View Controller’s View.” This paragraph is somewhat vague and contradictory (is it the most recently added view controller, or the controller for the topmost view?), and in practice doesn't seem to necessarily match observations. The bottom line is that adding multiple views to a UIWindow will screw up the automatic rotation handling. You should change your code to use presentModalViewController:animated: (maybe with modalPresentationStyle set to UIModalPresentationFormSheet ) or a UIPopoverController instead of adding multiple subviews to the window.
