If you are interested in forecasting time series data you should follow Rob Hyndman and his blog https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/ . Start by reading his book Forecasting: Principles and Practice. You can find an online free version here https://otexts.com/fpp3/ . Then if you are interested in Financial data, I suggest you Rue Tsay Financial Time Series book, and finally (but you have to master the math before otherwise it will be very painful) you can approach the bible of time series analysis: J.D. Hamilton Time Series Analysis. These are off course just some hints, there is also the M Forecasting Competition of the Internation Institute of Forecasting that produces a lot of very useful resources. It focuses on the practical part of forecasting with the most up to date algos.
