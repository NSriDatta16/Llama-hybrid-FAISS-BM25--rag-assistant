First, the test set and the validation sets are supposed to be different. Second, when you have a small number of data points (users, not features measured from each user), you may want to use leave-one-out cross validation . This means you would determine which model to use by training each model 12 times, leaving out each user in turn, and you measure the model by how well it predicts the left out data on average. Third, if you expect that there is some correlation between answers to different questions from the same user, then using the properties of some answers to predict the properties of another answer by the same person is only reasonable if your goal is to predict a user's patterns from past data from the same person. It is not valid if you are trying to predict how other people behave.
