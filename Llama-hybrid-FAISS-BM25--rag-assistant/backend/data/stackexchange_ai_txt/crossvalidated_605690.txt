Depending on the ordering of the cards in your pre-shuffled deck, and how well you shuffle the deck, it may be reasonable to assume that your draw is a simple random sample without replacement . This means that any possible hand of cards in your deck is equally likely to occur. Note that this assumption might be wrong in some circumstances --- e.g., if your pre-shuffled deck has clumps of lands and you don't shuffle it very well then your draw would not be a simple random sample. Now, assuming you give it a "good shuffle", such that you are willing to assume that the draw is a simple random sample, the number of lands in the draw will follow a hypergeometric distribution . In a typical game of MTG you have a deck of $N=60$ cards containing $K$ lands and you draw an initial hand of $n=7$ cards. Let $X$ denote the number of lands in your opening hand. Then the probability of drawing exactly $x$ lands in the opening hand is: $$\begin{align} \mathbb{P}(X=x) &= \text{Hyper}(x|N=60,K,n=7) \\[12pt] &= \frac{{K \choose x} {60-K \choose 7-x}}{{60 \choose 7}} \\[6pt] &= \frac{1}{386206920} {K \choose x} {60-K \choose 7-x}. \\[6pt] \end{align}$$ We can use this distribution to compute the relevant probabilities for all possible decks of size $N=60$ drawing $n=7$ cards. Below I compute a matrix containing all the relevant probabilities. The rows show the number of lands in the deck and the columns show the number of lands drawn. This was computed in R using the dhyper function for the hypergeometric distribution. #Set deck size and draw size N When looking at the probabilities of getting a particular number of lands, it is also worth noting that MTG rules allow players to take a "mulligan", whereby they redraw their hand if they do not like their original hand. There are various rules variations for different types of mulligan and different strategies players can use when deciding to take a mulligan. These lead to different probabilities for the number of lands in the final hand. The mulligan rule gives players some safety if they draw an opening hand with to few lands, so as a general principle, it operates to decrease the probability of getting "too few" lands. When do you run out of land? As you are no doubt aware, the rules of MTG allow a player to play one land each turn, subject to some special cards that vary this. Consequently, a more useful statistical question for checking for sufficient land in MTG is to find the distribution of the number of turns it takes a player to run out of land and therefore be unable to play a land in their turn. In most situtions this is the more useful question for determining how many land should be included in a deck. This question requires some assumptions to calculate well (e.g., assuming player draws only one card per turn, no fetch-lands, etc.). Suppose the player has an initial draw of $d+1$ cards for the first turn and then draws one additional card each turn, with no other draw or search effects, etc. Let $X_n$ denote the number of lands drawn in the first $n$ cards and define the variable: $$T = \min \{ n = 1,2,3,... | X_{d+n} The random variable $T$ is the first turn at which the player is unable to play a land. Then we have the equivalence $\mathbb{P}(T > t) = \mathbb{P}(X_{d+t} \geqslant t)$ which then gives the probability mass function: $$\begin{align} \mathbb{P}(T = t) &= \mathbb{P}(T > t-1) - \mathbb{P}(T > t) \\[16pt] &= \mathbb{P}(X_{d+t-1} \geqslant t-1) - \mathbb{P}(X_{d+t} \geqslant t) \\[6pt] &= \sum_{x=t-1}^{\min(d+t-1,K)} \text{Hyper}(x|N=60,K,d+t-1) \\[6pt] &\quad - \sum_{x=t}^{\min(d+t,K)} \text{Hyper}(x|N=60,K,d+t). \\[6pt] \end{align}$$ We can use the hypergeometric distribution to compute the relevant probabilities for all possible decks of size $N=60$ drawing $n=7$ cards and then drawing one additional card each turn (so we have eight cards by the end of the first turn). Below I compute a matrix containing all the relevant probabilities. The rows show the number of lands in the deck and the columns show the first turn in which the player has no land left to play. (If you want to get the probabilities for a player who does not draw a card in the first turn, all you need to do is reduce d by one in this calculation.) #Set deck size, initial draw and maximum turn value of interest #At first turn we have d+1 cards N 1) { PROBTURN [k+1, t]
