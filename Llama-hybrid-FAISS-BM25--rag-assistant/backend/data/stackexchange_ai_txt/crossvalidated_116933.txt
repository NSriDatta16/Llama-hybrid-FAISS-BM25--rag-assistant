Bayesian models vs Bayesian network models

I'm new to statistical modeling and working on applications in spatial property prediction. Can you help me understand the difference between a hierarchical bayesian model and a bayesian network model? It seems that the dependencies of predictor variables can be well met within what I understand as "traditional" bayesian models, and I don't grasp what differences the bayesian network approach brings to the table.
