/dev/random Extremely Slow?

Some background info: I was looking to run a script on a Red Hat server to read some data from /dev/random and use the Perl unpack() command to convert it to a hex string for usage later on (benchmarking database operations). I ran a few "head -1" on /dev/random and it seemed to be working out fine, but after calling it a few times, it would just kinda hang. After a few minutes, it would finally output a small block of text, then finish. I switched to /dev/urandom (I really didn't want to, its slower and I don't need that quality of randomness) and it worked fine for the first two or three calls, then it too began hang. I was wondering if it was the "head" command that was bombing it, so I tried doing some simple I/O using Perl, and it too was hanging. As a last ditch effort, I used the "dd" command to dump some info out of it directly to a file instead of to the terminal. All I asked of it was 1mb of data, but it took 3 minutes to get ~400 bytes before I killed it. I checked the process lists, CPU and memory were basically untouched. What exactly could cause /dev/random to crap out like this and what can I do to prevent/fix it in the future? Edit: Thanks for the help guys! It seems that I had random and urandom mixed up. I've got the script up and running now. Looks like I learned something new today. :)
