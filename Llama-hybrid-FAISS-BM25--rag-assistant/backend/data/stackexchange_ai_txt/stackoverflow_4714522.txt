The easiest way to do this in my opinion is to substitute your s:Panel with a s:TitleWindow. The TitleWindow skin adds an area to the titlebar allowing it to be dragged and the TitleWindow class has code to deal with dragging. This will allow dragging without you having to code any handlers. Hope that helps.
