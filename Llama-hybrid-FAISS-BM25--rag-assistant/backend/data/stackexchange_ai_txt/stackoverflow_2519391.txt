1) If I have two or more threads in the same vb .net app and each of them calls the shared function at the same time with different RADIUS, will they each get their own AREA? Yes, because the radius value is passed by value and the method uses nothing but locally declare variables. 2) I want to know for each call to the function if it is using same local variables or each call creates new instances of local variables? Each call creates a new instance of its local variables. 3) Will the answers to above questions be same If I have multiple (2+) single threaded apps and they all call the function at the same time with different RADIUS value? Yes. Again, because there is no shared storage of information and because all inputs are passed by value, it is thread-safe.
