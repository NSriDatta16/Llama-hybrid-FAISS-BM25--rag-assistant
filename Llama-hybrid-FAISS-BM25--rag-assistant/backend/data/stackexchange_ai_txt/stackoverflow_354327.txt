I don't have exactly what you're looking for, but I'm now using a combination of Ramdisk and DRAM ramdisk . Since this is Windows, I have a hard 3 GB limit for core memory, meaning I cannot use too much memory for a RAM disk. 4 GB extra on the 9010 really rocks it. I let my IDE store all its temporary stuff on the solid state RAM disk and also the Maven repository. The DRAM RAM disk has a battery backup to the flash card. This sounds like an advertisement, but it really is an excellent setup. The DRAM disk has double SATA-300 ports and comes out with 0.0 ms average seek on most tests ;) Something for the Christmas stocking?
