You're conflating two ways that a regression can be "good". Low $R^2$ means that there's low correlation. That is, that the trendline doesn't provide much better prediction than just the sample average for the outcome. Reasonably calibrated QQ plot and lack of trend in the plot of predicted vs residuals just means that the data are kind of normal.
