Instead of dragging a stored procedure, can I just cut and paste its name somewhere?

I am using LINQ to SQL, and there is one thing I am not very happy about. Suppose I don't have a stored procedure I need, so I just go ahead and develop a new one. Now I want to expose it via the LINQ to SQL DataContext , so I have to: refresh the list of stored procs, which takes a few seconds Find the new stored procedure in this list, which also uses up precious time - I have thousands of them to scroll through. Is there any way I could just open up a dialog and paste the stored procedure name - that should be much faster.
