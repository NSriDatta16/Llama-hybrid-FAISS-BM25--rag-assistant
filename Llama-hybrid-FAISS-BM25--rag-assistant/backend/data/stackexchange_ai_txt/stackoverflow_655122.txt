Doing a run-around of existing application to make database changes, good idea?

We have an existing "legacy" app written in C++/powerbuilder running on Unix with it's own Sybase databases. For complex organizational(existing apps have to go through lot of red-tape to be modified) and code reasons(no re-factoring has been done in yrs so the code is spaghetti), so it's difficult to get modifications done to this application. Hence I am considering writing a new modern, maybe grails, based web app to do some "admin" type things directly into the database. For example to add users, or to add "constraint rows". What does the software community think of this approach of doing a run-around of the existing app like this? Good idea? Tips and hints?
