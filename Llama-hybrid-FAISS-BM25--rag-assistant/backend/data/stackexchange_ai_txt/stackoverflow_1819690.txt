The Pragmatic Programmer: After PHP, what's next?

I'm reading The Pragmatic Programmer and I'm on the section where the authors suggest that we learn a new language every year. I'm currently a PHP developer and I'm wondering, what should I learn next? I'm looking for a language that will help me improve my skills and help me with my daily tasks. Something useful. Any suggestions? [Edit] Awesome answers guys! Thanks. I'm still contemplating your answers and I'm leaning on studying Python or a functional prgoramming language as you guys have suggested (maybe Lisp).
