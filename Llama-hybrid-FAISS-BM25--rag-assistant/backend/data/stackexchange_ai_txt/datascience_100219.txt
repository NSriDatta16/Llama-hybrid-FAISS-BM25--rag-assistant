I have recently worked on the ASR system of speech to text using a bunch of dialects and the current state of the art says that the best way to handle dialects is using the approach of XLSR, fine-tuning your model to recognize a dialect while you are pre-trained it on an N number of language. To do so and build such a system, is using Transformers where actually you can assess your WER and PER without even perceive how data looks like or even understand the language in the first place. Because dialect is not often an easy way to understand in case we are not native speakers. That said, I just wanna help in the regard of how to handle well your model with dialects and you can check this out it helped me a lot: https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11477 and also you can check this https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.13979 .
