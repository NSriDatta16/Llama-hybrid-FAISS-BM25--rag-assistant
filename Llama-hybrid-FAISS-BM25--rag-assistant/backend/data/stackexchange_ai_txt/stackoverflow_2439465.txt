There is OmniXML that is faster than MSXML and is OpenSource. It is MSXML complicant, so the switch is very easy. Event the interface names are the same. Then there is SimpleStorage which expands the OmniXML interfaces, so that working with XML becomes very easy. Look at the demos and at blog posts about SimpleStorage usage. Just bear in mind that more complex operations in SimpleStorage sacrifice a little of the speed for ease of use and power.
