The Kalman filter is the "forward filtering" part of FFBS, while the "backward sampling" part provides a draw from the joint distribution for the $\Theta_t$ for all $t$. All the other ways of performing statistical parameter estimation, e.g. maximum likelihood, can be used for DLMs. Yes a particle filter could be used here, but since the model is linear and Gaussian, i.e. a DLM, you won't be gaining anything. Particle filters are better when you have non-linear or non-Gaussian models and thus cannot perform FFBS. Yes, it is possible to perform Metropolis-within-Gibbs for any Bayesian model.
