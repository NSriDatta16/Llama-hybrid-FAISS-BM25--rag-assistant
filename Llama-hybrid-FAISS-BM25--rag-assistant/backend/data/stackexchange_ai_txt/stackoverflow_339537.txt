End-line characters from lines read from text file, using Python

When reading lines from a text file using python, the end-line character often needs to be truncated before processing the text, as in the following example: f = open("myFile.txt", "r") for line in f: line = line[:-1] # do something with line Is there an elegant way or idiom for retrieving text lines without the end-line character?
