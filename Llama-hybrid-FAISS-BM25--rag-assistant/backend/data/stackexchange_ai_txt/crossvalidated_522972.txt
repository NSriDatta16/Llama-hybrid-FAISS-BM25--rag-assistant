Can you use SVMs with strongly biased sample sizes?

I want to use linear SVMs to classify two groups of objects based on ten features. However, I have a strong imbalance in group sizes with one group having a bit more than 90% of the cases. I have roughly 150.000 objects. Is there a way to use classification and especially linear SVM classification with a bias that big? Or would you advise to use a different technique?
