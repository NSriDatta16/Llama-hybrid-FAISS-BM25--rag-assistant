Magento product watermarks are not appearing transparent - any ideas?

I have a Magento ver. 1.3.3.0 install, I am having a problem with the transparency of product watermarks. The watermark is a .png file but when it is viewed on the product it loses its transparency and has a solid white background. The products on the shop are a wildlife artists paintings so this is really spoiling the artwork. Has anyone experienced this with 1.3.3.0? Upgrading at this stage is not really an option as the site needs to go live soon. Regards Dan
