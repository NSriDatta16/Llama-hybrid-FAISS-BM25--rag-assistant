From what I understand you have a questionnaire application, where you ask a series of questions and then ask the user to drop his answer using some drag and drop control ( a crane). I am going to go an a tangent and say the design seems to be wrong. Javascript is event based and having one main thread looping around for user interaction is going to reduce the usability. I will not use any way of stalling the thread ( aka in java). Javascript is not written for such an usecase. Your application will be perceived as non responsive by some browsers and by almost all performance analyzers (like Yslow). So I would provide each question with a div identified by a class which internally is a sequence (question1..2). Initially only one question will be enabled or visible. Once user answers the question, I will enable the enabled question. ( on the appropriate event, in this case probably the drop event of drag and drop). Since it is sequential, I will just have to check if the user has answered question1, then I will enable question2 appropriately. The whole flow should be event driven. The event here being the user answering the question.
