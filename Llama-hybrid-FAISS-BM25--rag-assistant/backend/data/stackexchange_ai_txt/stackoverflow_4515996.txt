Reorganizing an ASP.NET MVC folder structure

I have several sections and subsections of my MVC site, which I would like to have the folder layout to be structured differently than the default structure. For example if I have 5 main sections of the site, I would like to have 5 folders and then the models views controllers folders within each of those. Does anyone have any recommendations how I would accomplish this maybe a different idea? And would I have to set up custom routing in my global.ascx file?
