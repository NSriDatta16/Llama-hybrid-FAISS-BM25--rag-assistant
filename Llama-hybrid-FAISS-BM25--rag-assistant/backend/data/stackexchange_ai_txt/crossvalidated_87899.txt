If you mean logistic regression, for example, along the lines of $Y_i\sim\text{Bernoulli}(1,p_i)\,$, with $\text{logit}(p_i) = X\beta\,$, (equivalently, $P[Y_i=1] = \frac{\exp(X\beta)}{1+\exp(X\beta)},$) then use glm . For example: glm(y~x1+x2,family=binomial) There are examples in the help at ?glm.predict , ?infert and ?esoph . If you mean fitting a logistic curve via least squares, like $E(Y) = \alpha \cdot(\frac{\exp(\beta_0+\beta_1 x)}{1+\exp(\beta_0+\beta_1 x)})$ then use nls . There's an example of fitting a logistic function in the help at ?nls . Both are part of the standard R installation. If you mean something else, you need to clarify what you want. I see from this answer that apparently economists use 'fixed effect model' to refer to a conditional logit model, even though it's far from the only fixed effect model involving a logit. Who would have thought. As ndoogan mentions in one of the other answers, there's a conditional logistic regression model ( clogit ) in the survival package.
