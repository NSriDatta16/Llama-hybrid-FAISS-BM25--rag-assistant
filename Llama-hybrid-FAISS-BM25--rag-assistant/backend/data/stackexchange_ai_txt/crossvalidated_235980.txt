Whereas the previos answer by Firebug is correct, I want add another perspective: Unsupervised vs. supervised learning: LDA is very useful to find dimensions which aim at seperating cluster, thus you will have to know clusters before. LDA is not neccesarily a classifier, but can be used as one. Thus LDA can only be used in supervised learning PCA is a general approach for denoising and dimensionality reduction and does not require any further information such as class labels in supervised learning. Therefore it can be used in unsupervised learning.
