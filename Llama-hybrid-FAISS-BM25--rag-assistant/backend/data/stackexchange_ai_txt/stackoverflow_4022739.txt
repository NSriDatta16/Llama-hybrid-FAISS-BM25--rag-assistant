Response.write and locale settings

I am using VB .NET 4.0, ISS 7.0. I wondered how can I set the default locale for all applications? The problem is rising when I have a Response.Write(str) the numbers appear with ","(german notation) rather than "."(us notation). From where .NET knows that he need to use the german locale? In every my js script I have added Session.LCID = 3081;// to fix the ,->. but this is the brute force solution to fix the problem. Are there more elegant way to configure the server/.NET? thanks Arman.
