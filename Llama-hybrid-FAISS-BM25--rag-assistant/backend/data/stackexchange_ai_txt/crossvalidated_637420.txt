With a little more clarity, you should probably redefine your model in the following format. Let $i$ represent the $i$ th object $(i=1,2,\ldots,n)$ and $j$ represent the $j$ th $(j=1,2,\ldots,m)$ principal component (PC) extracted from the correlation or covariance matrix, and let $\mathbf{F}$ be the $n \times m$ matrix of PC scores for the $m$ components. Then the principal components regression model would be $y_i = \beta_0 + \sum_{j=1}^m \beta_j f_{ij} + e_i$ where $\beta_j$ is the regression coefficient for the $j$ th PC and $f_{ij}$ is the $i$ th PC score from the $j$ th PC. In regression terminology, your $\phi_k(x)$ is $\beta_j$ and your $\beta_{k,t}$ is $f_{ij}$ . Your data must be sorted in such a way that you are getting the results shown, since PC scores don't follow a curve. "Indexed" also doesn't say a lot -- so you should state how many dimensions (attributes, features, variables) and how many objects (instances, records) are in your dataset. Also, did you run PCA on the correlation or the covariance matrix?
