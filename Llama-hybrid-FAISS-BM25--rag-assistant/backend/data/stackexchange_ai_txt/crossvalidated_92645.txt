While I agree with Stephan Kolassa's analysis and conclusion, $$\hat{\mu} - \mu$$ with $\hat{\mu}$ the sample mean is definitely not an approximate pivot, let me make an additional remark. I investigated the use of the $t$-statistic $$\sqrt{m} \frac{\hat{\mu} - \mu}{\hat{\sigma}}$$ together with bootstrapping. The result was a coverage of around 0.8. Not a complete solution, but an improvement. Then I thought a little more about the whole setup. With only 10 observations and an extremely skewed distribution, is it then not basically impossible to nonparametrically estimate the mean let alone construct confidence intervals with the right coverage? The log-normal distribution considered has mean $e^2 + 1 = 8.39$. Since $P(X \leq 2) = 0.84$ when $X \sim \mathcal{N}(0,4)$ the mean is the $0.84$-quantile of the distribution! It means that the probability that all 10 observations are smaller than the mean is $0.84^{10} = 0.178$. So in a little less than 18% of the cases, the largest observation is smaller than the mean. To get a coverage greater than 0.82 we need a construction of a confidence interval for the mean the extends beyond the largest observation. I have a hard time imagining how such a construction can be made (and justified) without prior assumptions that the distribution is extremely skewed. But I welcome any suggestions.
