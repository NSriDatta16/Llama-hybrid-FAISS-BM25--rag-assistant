I don't believe there is a recommended way, but a prefered way. Some store connection strings in the web.config file, while some store in the registry or machine.config, while some go to the extreme and store it remotely...yes I've seen that. The most common storage I see and use myself is storing in the web.config. In my DAL objects I make a call to the web.config file for the connectionstring string connStr = ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings["myString"].ConnectionString as for auto changing of the connectionstring based on the app compiled mode, I've never seen that. You might have to put that check in the DAL itself to check if debug mode is turned "on" or "off". That would require 2 connectionstring entries in the web.config file.
