The simple answer is yes. The longer answer is Structured Storage is part of COM and the COM threading model (sometimes called the Apartment model) is different to the Win32 threading model and has its own rules and API for marshalling data across apartments. Before you embark on this, ask yourself if your storage mechanism really has to be structured storage...IMO it does not give you much over standard IO except a world of hurt (threading wise) The actual structured part is pretty basic and any XML file is far more structured.
