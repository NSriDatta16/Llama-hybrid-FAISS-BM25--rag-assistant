Maybe you could try generating some unique text using a markov chain - see here for an example implementation in Python. Maybe use sequential numbers (rather than random ones) to generate the chain, so that (hopefully) the each order number is unique. Just a warning, though - see here for what can possibly happen if you aren't careful with your settings.
