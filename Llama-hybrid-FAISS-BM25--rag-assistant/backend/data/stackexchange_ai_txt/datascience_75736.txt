Whenever there is unavailability of dataset in case of NLP one of the approach I have followed is to generate dataset using templates based approach. The implementation looks like this cities = ['paris', 'munich', 'new york'] days = ['monday', 'tuesday', 'sunday', 'friday'] templates = ['i am flying from {cities} to {cities}', 'my flight is arriving in {cities} on next {days}'] So now write a script that helps you to fill these missing values present inside templates.
