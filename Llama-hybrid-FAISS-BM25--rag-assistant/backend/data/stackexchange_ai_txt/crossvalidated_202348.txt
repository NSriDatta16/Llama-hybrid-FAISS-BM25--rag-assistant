Statistical methods for data where only a minimum/maximum value is known

Is there a branch of statistics that deals with data for which exact values are not known , but for each individual, we know either a maximum or minimum bound to the value ? I suspect that my problem stems largely from the fact that I am struggling to articulate it in statistical terms, but hopefully an example will help to clarify: Say there are two connected populations $A$ and $B$ such that, at some point, members of $A$ may "transition" into $B$ , but the reverse is not possible. The timing of the transition is variable, but non-random. For example, $A$ could be "individuals without offspring" and $B$ "individuals with at least one offspring". I am interested in the age this progression occurs but I only have cross-sectional data. For any given individual, I can find out if they belong to $A$ or $B$. I also know the age of these individuals. For each individual in population $A$, I know that the age at transition will be GREATER THAN their current age. Likewise, for members of $B$, I know that the age at transition was LESS THAN their current age. But I don't know the exact values. Say I have some other factor that I want to compare with the age of transition. For example, I want to know whether an individual's subspecies or body size affects the age of first offspring. I definitely have some useful information that should inform those questions: on average, of the individuals in $A$, older individuals will have a later transition. But the information is imperfect , particularly for younger individuals. And vice versa for population $B$. Are there established methods to deal with this sort of data ? I do not necessarily need a full method of how to carry out such an analysis, just some search terms or useful resources to start me off in the right place! Caveats: I am making the simplifying assumption that transition from $A$ to $B$ is instantaneous. I am also prepared to assume that most individuals will at some point progress to $B$, assuming they live long enough. And I realise that longitutinal data would be very helpful, but assume that it is not available in this case. Apologies if this is a duplicate, as I said, part of my problem is that I don't know what I should be searching for. For the same reason, please add other tags if appropriate.
