N Blake's answer is great, using the language of cognitive psychology. If you're up for a Bayesian slant, you could treat this as violating Cromwell's rule . You have a prior certain belief that the coin's probability of giving tails is $f=0.5$ . In other words, you believe that $p(f=0.5) = 1$ , which is the problem. This gives you no flexibility to update this as the experiment continues. Your posterior $p(f \mid \text{100 heads})$ is now proportional to $$ \cases{ p(\mathrm{H} \mid f)^{100} \times 1 & if $f=0.5$ \\ p(\mathrm{H} \mid f)^{100} \times 0 \color{red}{= 0} & otherwise } $$ Despite this long run of heads, your posterior remains unchanged from the prior! You didn't update your mental model of the coin despite the consilience of evidence against it being a fair coin.
