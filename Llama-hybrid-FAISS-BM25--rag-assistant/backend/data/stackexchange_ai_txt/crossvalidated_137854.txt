How to select the appropriate baseline calculation for population health studies

I'm taking over a project where I will need to create baseline measures for public health outcomes (reported annually), for example hospitalisation rates for different demographic groups. The person who previously worked on this calculated the baselines for each outcome differently. For years T1 to T5 (most recent), at various points they have used: Simple Moving Average (SMA: mean of T1:T5 values) Weighted Moving Average (WMA: (T5*5 + T4*4 + T3*3 + T2*2 + T1)/15) Mean of T5 and WMA From the documentation given to me, the reasoning for this is as follows (example data below): Outcome A shows a gradual decrease in time, so we should weight recent data more heavily and use the WMA value (22.5). Outcome B has stayed constant over time, so we should use the SMA value (22.5) Outcome C has been mostly stable until a big drop in T5, so we should take the mean of T5 and WMA to weight T5 more heavily (11.3). My initial feeling is that the same calculation should be used for all outcomes, but I can also see his reasoning. Does anyone have any ideas or resources on how to best choose an appropriate baseline for this sort of data? T1 T2 T3 T4 T5 SMA WMA Mean of T5 and WMA A 28.7 26.2 23.5 21.7 19.9 24.0 22.5 21.2 B 23.7 22.4 23.3 21.1 22.2 22.5 22.3 22.2 C 12.2 13.7 12.0 13.0 10.5 12.3 12.0 11.3 EDIT: The aim of the project is not to compare the rates of outcomes, but to track them over time. Each outcome will have a different target. For example, we may want to see outcome A reduced by 10% over 5 years, outcome B to increase by 20% over 10 years, and C to reduce to 0 within 10 years. We'd be wanting to be able to annually track whether we were on target. It's an open question of how we want to deal with existing trends (i.e. do we add our targets to be in addition to existing trends), so any feedback on that would be helpful too.
