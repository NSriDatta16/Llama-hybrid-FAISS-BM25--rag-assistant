This may require a long explanation but I can point you towards one blog post that has references to the relevant books. In a nutshell, if fitted for just numerical reasons, then a random-effects-model is useful when sample sizes are small, as information sharing and shrinkage happens - less overfitting and all that. If sample sizes are large then it does not make any practical difference in most cases when one considers the added complexity of the model. From a conceptual or philosophical view point, a random-effect model can be used to estimate 'super-population' parameters. GELMAN, A., & HILL, J. (2007).
