An indexed view is materialized e.g. its rows that it contains (from the tables it depends on) are physically stored on disk - much like a "system-computed" table that's always kept up to date whenever its underlying tables change. This is done by adding the clustered index - the leaf pages of the clustered index on a SQL Server table (or view) are the data pages, really. Columns in an indexed view can be indexed with non-clustered indexes, too, and thus you can improve query performance even more. The down side is: since the rows are stored, you need disk space (and some data is duplicated, obviously). A normal view on the other hand is just a fragment of SQL that will be executed to compute the results - based on what you select from that view. There's no physical representation of that view, there are no rows stored for a regular view - they need to be joined together from the base tables as needed.
