If you decide to stick with CSS sprites (because you require IE6/7 support, for instance, or are concerned about no-JS fallback), a few things that might help with maintenance: Organize sprites into separate images based on shape . For instance, put all of your 20x20 badges in the same sprite, all your 30x15 folders in another sprite. (Yes, you will have more HTTP requests, but HTTP performance is one of many factors to consider.) This makes calculating CSS much simpler. You can set the sprites up as single columns, double columns (which is nice for roll-over effects) or whatever keeps things cleanest. Dealing with a large, irregular sprite is a pain! Have a low-impact pattern for adding new imagery . Always add new items to the bottom, for instance, so you don't need to recalculate CSS for imagery above the new image. (This really only makes sense if you organize sprites per my first point.) If you are no longer going to use sprites, just blank them out . Leave white spaces or gray x's or something in their old spot. Then when you have time and a bunch of removed images to clean out, do them all at once. (Again, if you're crazy concerned about performance, you might not like the idea of leaving any spare bytes in these files...) Just a few thoughts.
