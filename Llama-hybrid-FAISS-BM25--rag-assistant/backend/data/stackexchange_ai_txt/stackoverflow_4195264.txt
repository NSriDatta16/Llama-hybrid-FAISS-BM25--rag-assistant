I just tried the Notes browser and got this User Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; Lotus-Notes/6.0; Windows-NT) Granted this is on Notes 6.0.4, but I imagine the internal Notes browser would still provide an accurate user-agent. The problem might be, though, that people are using the integrated Internet Explorer browser, which would show up as some version of IE.
