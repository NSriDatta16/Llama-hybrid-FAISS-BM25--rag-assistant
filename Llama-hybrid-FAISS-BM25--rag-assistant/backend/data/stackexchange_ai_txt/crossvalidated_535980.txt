How to verify if a graphical model has the markov property?

If I draw the computational graph of an HMM and an RNN from an architectural point of view they look very similar. The main difference is that an RNN gets some input $x$ and the HMM only operates on the latent sequence. From my understanding - and reading that from the drawn graph - both the hidden states $h_i$ in the RNN and the latent variable $Z_i$ are conditionally dependent on the previous state and produce some output. What I don't understand is, that an HMM is said to have the markov property (i.e., is memoryless) whereas the RNN does not. Why, where can I observe the difference? How can I read that property from a computational graph (if at all)?
