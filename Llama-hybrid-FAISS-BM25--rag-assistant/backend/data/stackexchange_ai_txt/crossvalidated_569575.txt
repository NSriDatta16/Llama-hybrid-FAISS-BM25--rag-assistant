How much data you have is irrelevant to the choice of loss function. If you have more data, lucky you. Loss is a part of your statistical model, your assumptions about the data as it corresponds to the likelihood function. Loss is also about characteristics of the data, for example you may want it to be more robust against some kinds of outliers. As about Euclidean distance, the problem relates to high dimensional data, i.e. many columns, not many rows (“big data”). Usually when minimizing loss you look at average loss across the samples, so it doesn’t really matter how many samples you have. Why squared loss? It is one of the simplest ones, it is mathematically convenient (corresponds to Gaussian likelihood, has simple derivative), and for historical reasons. See Why is the squared difference so commonly used? and What makes mean square error so good? for more details.
