PCA for your data schold just do eigendecomposition of the 8x8 covariance matrix which is no big deal for normal computers. Thus, it is likely the plotting that takes time, as pointed out by other posts. If your computer has a decent graphics card, you can try the software visumap that allows you to do PCA and interactively explore (scaling and rotating) data cloud with millions of data points.
