How can msn messenger and others provide a way to remember password on disk and then send it to the server for authentication later? They encrypt it, store it, then decrypt it on loading. The ones that are doing it properly will be using DPAPI to tie the keys to a Windows user's login. (This was previously done using ‘Protected Storage’.) This still isn't “secure” as such, as if you can log in as that user there's nothing stopping you decrypting it. But at least it reduces the risk compared to the common approach of having the ‘secret’ key built into the app alone.
