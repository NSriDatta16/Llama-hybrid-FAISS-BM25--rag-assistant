While Visual Studio using C# was mentioned I would like to be more explicit and state doing the above as a WPF application. While WinForms applications still exists, WPF really moved UI development into a much more maintainable and elegant work stream. It also coincides with Silverlight. So while Silverlight can be used OOB, it can also be used in the Web...and in WP7 development. Learning WPF really gives you a foundation to build upon, while WinForms doesn't.
