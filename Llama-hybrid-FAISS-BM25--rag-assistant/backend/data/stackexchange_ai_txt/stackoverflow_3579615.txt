What's the quickest mobile platform to create a Bluetooth application on?

Most of the time I write code for embedded modules or small programs on my computer to analyze data that said code generates. Now I've been asked to prototype a mobile application to analyze/display that data instead. I have no (6-year old CS101) experience with either of the popular languages (Obj-C/Java?), let alone with any of the APIs/libraries available on the 4-5 popular mobile OSs, so I'm more or less at square one. Adapting the embedded hardware to talk to a phone is fairly straightforward, just add a Bluetooth module that I can configure to emulate a serial port (using SPP profile), but I don't know where to start on the other side. What sort of mobile OS/device should I target for ease/speed of developing a Bluetooth serial port profile (SPP) application from having equal (no) experience on them all? BlackBerry Everyone has one around here (except me), so this is where I'm being nudged towards unless there are significant obstacles or another is vastly better (faster) Smaller community Lots of dev-blogs moan about poor SDK/tools "BlackBerry devices have limited support for SPP." ( PDF , p. 9) Android Very few phones around here. API makes it seem very straightforward to look for devices and connect to them. Large dev community, (many more examples to peruse). WM6 I have a (bad) WM6.5 phone. Smaller community Phones can have various stacks (MS, Widcomm), which are not interoperable, some don't support SPP, and I don't know what my phone (HTC Ozone) has... iOS Don't have/never used a Mac, iPhones only marginally popular around my organization. Large dev community Can only connect to approved Bluetooth devices (?) Kills that option dead if I read it right. Some portable framework (Appcelerator, PhoneGap) Seems impossible as they can't get at the Bluetooth.
