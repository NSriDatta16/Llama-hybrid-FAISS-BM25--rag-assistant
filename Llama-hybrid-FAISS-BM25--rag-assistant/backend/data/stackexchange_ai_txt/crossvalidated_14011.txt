Sorry to disappoint, but I would NOT try to categorize this as trend analysis, at least not in the usual time series sense. That said, you can still do productive modeling. You look at testing the hypothesis that the difference between (t1,t2) is non-zero (i.e. test against the null hypothesis). You could do the same for (t2,t3). Where this gets tricky is that the intervals (t2 - t1) and (t3 - t2) are not well defined in your question. There may be a constant interval, but is the response believed to have a linear relationship with the interval? Try examining students' math scores in January, May, and September, and you may see that the second interval drops a lot relative to the gain made in the first interval. Students' math scores croak in the summer. So, I would first begin with two separate tests. Second, what I would try is sign-testing of the deltas for the two periods. For this, you can do simple binomial hypothesis testing. (NB: If all values change monotonically, regardless of the factor being studied, then de-trending will be a little hard, but you could center with the sample mean at each timepoint.)
