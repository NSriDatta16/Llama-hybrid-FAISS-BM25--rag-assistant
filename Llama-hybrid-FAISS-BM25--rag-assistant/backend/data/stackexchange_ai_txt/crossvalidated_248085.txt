Multitask learning main assumptions

Multitask learning (ML) is a branch of transfer learning typically used in the machine learning society. In ML people utilize the similarities between units to improve accuracy of prediction etc... The units are typically Independent, ex: car batteries, we believe that batteries from different cars might behave differently however they have some commonalities, thus if we model them together using ML we might get better results. This idea seems common in machine learning, however, I believe also many statistical models utilize such approach , where they propose a common structure to model somehow different units. What are some statistics tool that use a similar ideology?
