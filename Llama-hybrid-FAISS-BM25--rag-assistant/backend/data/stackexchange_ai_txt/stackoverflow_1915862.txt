Here are a few considerations i've come up with so far: Stability Reliability Cost Brain Drain --------- ----------- ---- ----------- Large Company: High High High Risky Small Company: Med Med Med Med Individual: Risky Risky Low None Stability : Will the company/person be around months and years from now to support and extend the application? Reliability : What's the track record of delivery of product for the organization or individual? This is probably the most difficult parameter to gauge. Cost : This should probably be a secondary concern compared to the rest since the rest are multipliers. For example: a cheap developer could turn expensive when there's trouble. Brain Drain : Will knowledge workers on the project team be shuffled around causing loss of undocumented information and domain knowledge? After laying all this out, i think i realize that it's up to the customer to do its homework and hire an individual or organization that has a high track record of quality and stability and that cost per hour/man month what have you will change over the long term. And let's not forget that an individual or a key member of a small team can get hit by a bus, or suffer a debilitating health event. Bottom line: software development is a risky business!
