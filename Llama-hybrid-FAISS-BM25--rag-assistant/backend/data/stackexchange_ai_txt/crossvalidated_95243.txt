Current Population Survey (CPS) Data in Bertrand/Duflo/Mullainathan

I am trying to replicate the results in Bertrand, M., Duflo, E., Mullainathan, S., 2004. How Much Should We Trust Differences-In-Differences Estimates? The Quarterly Journal of Economics 119 (1). 249â€“275. On page 255 the authors state that "We extract data on women in their fourth interview month in the Merged Outgoing Rotation Group of the CPS for the years 1979 to 1999. We focus on all women between the ages 25 and 50. We extract information on weekly earnings, employment status, education, age, and state of residence. The sample contains nearly 900,000 observations." However, when I download the data and follow their conditions than I only obtain some 145,000 observations instead of 900,000. My Stata-code is as follows: use "http://www.nber.org/morg/annual/morg79.dta", clear forvalues i=80/99 { display `i' quietly append using "http://www.nber.org/morg/annual/morg`i'.dta" } //We extract data on women in their fourth interview month in //the Merged Outgoing Rotation Group of the CPS keep if sex == 2 & intmonth == 4 //We focus on all women between the ages 25 and 50. keep if age > 24 & age Does anyone have an idea what's wrong here? I am thankful for any advise.
