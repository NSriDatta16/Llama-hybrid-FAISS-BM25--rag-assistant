What repository products are available for keeping track of web services?

My organization is starting to take SOA seriously but before we jump in one of the components we seem to be missing is a rock solid repository for tracking these services across the enterprise. Can anyone suggest a product that they have worked with? If the product is also an ESB please mention that in your answer.
