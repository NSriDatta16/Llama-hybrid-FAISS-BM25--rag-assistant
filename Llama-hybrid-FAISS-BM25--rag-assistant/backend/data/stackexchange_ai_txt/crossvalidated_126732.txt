The answer above is correct. For reference, here's some elaborated working R code to compute it. I have take the liberty of adding an intercept, because you probably do want one of those. ## make some data set.seed(1234) N Now construct a log likelihood function to maximise, here using dbinom because it's there, and summing the results ## the log likelihood function log.like and fit the model by maximum likelihood. I haven't bothered to offer a gradient or choose an optimisation method, but you might want to do both. ## fit res Now have a look at the results. The ML parameter estimates and asymptotic SEs are: ## results data.frame(coef=res$par, SE=sqrt(diag(solve(-res$hessian)))) which should be ## coef SE ## 1 0.4731680 0.04828779 ## 2 0.5799311 0.03363505 or there's a bug (which is always possible). The usual caveats about Hessian-derived standard errors apply.
