I've noticed a weird thing where dimensions like this are stored from the previous window/session. When u go to landscape/portrait and get the rez, do a refresh, see if u get another different rez. Same is true for scaling. My advice is do a useragent lookup and make a page specifically for mobile devices. rendering the normal 'desktop' site just wont work. if you do make the mobile site look at the html meta tage "Viewport" and put something like this in your head
