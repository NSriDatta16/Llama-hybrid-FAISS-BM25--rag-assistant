The WinForms uses somewhat another paradigm. It uses BindingSource and this not matter what control you use. For example it could be simple UserControl or even Panel. Following are steps to bind your class to form. Drop BindingSource on you form or panel or whatever... In DataSource poperty click Add Project Data Source. Select Object, select object you want to bind. Click Finish. At this stage we have datasource configured. Next steps will generate something similar to FormView. Open Data Sources docked window. With drop-down select Details. Drag and drop that to your form. Result should be the form similar to the FormView. Let me know if you have any questions.
