How can I have an Android app install media to the SDcard?

And when I say "install" I mean "move upon installation". I want to package a movie file with an .apk, but it's kind of big for internal storage (at least on older phones) as it is ~10mb. Since there is no "run this custom code when you install" feature (reasonable), I can't save to the SDcard the normal way... right? There's always the option of having the app download the movie and save it to the SDcard when the user first launches, but then they can't watch the movie until it's done downloading, and that doesn't feel elegant since they just finished downloading the app and now have to wait again. I know about installing the entire app to the SDcard, but that only works for 2.2+, eh? Enough phones are still running 2.1 that I want to support those.
