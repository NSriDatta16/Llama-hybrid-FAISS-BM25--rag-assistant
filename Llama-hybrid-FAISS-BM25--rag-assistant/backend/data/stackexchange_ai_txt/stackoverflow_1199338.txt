Depends. Do you want to search on name or on integer? Are the names all about the same size? Are all the integers 32 bits, or some big number thingy? Are you sure it all fits into memory? If not then you're probably limited by disk I/O and memory (or disk usage) is no concern at all any more. Does the index (name or integer) have common prefixes or are they uniformly distributed? Only if they have common prefixes, a patricia tree is useful. Do you look up indexes in order (gang lookup), or randomly? If everything is uniform, random and no common prefixes, a hash is already as good as it gets (which is bad). If the index is the integer where gang lookup is used, you might look into radix trees.
