You don't need the server for new content unless it is stored or generated there. Not having done this exact thing before I don't see any grand scheme to implement, I would just add the features incrementally until you get where you need to go. You may have to refactor things a bit along the way, but I probably don't have to tell you that. ;) One thing you will have to do when you add or delete elements is to rebind the jQuery functions, it won't enough to just call them when the document loads. So put them in a function and call it whenever you add or remove an element. Regarding your description of the UI behavior, you say that inactive elements can be dragged and that they can be made active by clicking on them. You can do this (just see if the thing has been dragged or not on mouseup to know whether it was drag or a click) but it might not be the best UI design choice, IMO. It wouldn't be the worst thing in the world, but I find it a little frustrating when the wrong thing happens when I try to do something. Of course, implementing and seeing for yourself is probably best.
