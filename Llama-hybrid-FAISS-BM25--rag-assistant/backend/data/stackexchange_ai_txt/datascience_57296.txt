Solving Bayes Theorem equation -> I can't calculate proper result

I am solving questions for an edx course on Machine Learning. One particular question is giving me a problem: Assume a patient comes into the doctor’s office to test whether they have a particular disease. The test is positive 85% of the time when tested on a patient with the disease (high sensitivity): P(test+|disease)=0.85 The test is negative 90% of the time when tested on a healthy patient (high specificity): P(test−|heathy)=0.90 The disease is prevalent in about 2% of the community: P(disease)=0.02 Using Bayes' theorem, calculate the probability that you have the disease if the test is positive. My solution: I have created a table sick | healthy 2% | 98% + 90% | 15% - 10% | 85% From this I calculated bayes theorem like this: (0,02*0,9) P(A|B) = ----------------------------------------------------- (0,02*0,9) + (0,15*0,98) I get P(A|B)=0,109 however this answer is wrong, where did I do mistake?
