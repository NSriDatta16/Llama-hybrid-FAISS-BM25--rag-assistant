Prevent the run tool window from popping up everytime I run my tests

I run my tests a lot, most of the time all I need is the little balloon tip that pops up saying "12 tests passed" or "1 test failed". That's all I need, but the run tab demands attention, and sometimes takes focus, which is very annoying when I'm typing. I know I can hit escape when it takes focus, but I want to ignore the test results unless too many pass/fail. So, is there anyway to bury the run window until I want to see the results, or run the test in the background (but not outside of the IDE)?
