I guess the most basic way would be to : split each paragraph into an array of words , using either explode or preg_split the first one might be a bit faster the second one might provide a bit more options maybe, do some filtering on the list of words : clean each word removing special characters, like accented letters converting everything to lower/upper-case, to help the comparisons you'll be doing later remove too common words remove too short words array_filter , here, could probably help and then, get the list of words that are in both arrays , using something like array_intersect
