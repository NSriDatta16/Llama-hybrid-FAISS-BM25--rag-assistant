Your problem seems to be the one described here: http://www.grauw.nl/blog/entry/470 . The issue is that the XMLHttpRequest specification currently states that user agents should not set any Accept headers by default for the request, so that req.setRequestHeader() can just append new Accepts. Unfortunately browsers don't yet adhere to this. The problem writeup lets you test your browser to see if it works properly, and unfortunately IE7, Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Opera all fail. Laurens Grauw also talks about the effects of first trying to null out the Accept header with setRequestHeader('Accept', '') or setRequestHeader('Accept', null) These might help here. Ugly server-side hacks: If you have control over your server-side app you can hardwire it to always return XML, add support for a custom media type like "application/i-really-want-xml", or add support for a custom HTTP header like "X-Accept".
