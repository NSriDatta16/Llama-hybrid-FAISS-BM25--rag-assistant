Most of your code will probably work as expected. Please notice that because of stricter adherence to W3C standards you may experience some UI issues (that really depends on how strict you were in the first place, IE quirks would not work). Also pay attention to the changes in the SSP functionality, well, for once, there is no SSP any more. Namespaces having to do with user profiles and such have been changed and your code could be broken now
