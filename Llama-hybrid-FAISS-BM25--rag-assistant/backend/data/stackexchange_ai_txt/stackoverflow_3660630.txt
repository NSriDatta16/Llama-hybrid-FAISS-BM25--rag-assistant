The iPhone is like a special client which needs the output formatted in a special way (like AJAX sometimes needs JSON insted of HTML). So I'd recommend to keep the url as short as possible: example.com/rest/HomeScreen Now you have do determine in your controller which format is requested (html, json, iphone). You could do this by determine the user agent or by appending an extension like: example.com/rest/HomeScreen.iphone example.com/rest/HomeScreen.html example.com/rest/HomeScreen.xml etc.
