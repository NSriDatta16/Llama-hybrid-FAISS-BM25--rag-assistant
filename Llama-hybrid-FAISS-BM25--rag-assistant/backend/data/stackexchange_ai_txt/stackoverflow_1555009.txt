Try using a timer: myopThread *t = new myopThread; QTimer::singleShot(120000, myopThread, SLOT(terminate())); t->start(); Qt's doc : void QThread::terminate () [slot] Warning: This function is dangerous and its use is discouraged. The thread can be terminate at any point in its code path. Threads can be terminated while modifying data. There is no chance for the thread to cleanup after itself, unlock any held mutexes, etc. In short, use this function only if absolutely necessary. A better solution is to create a own slot terminateAsSoonAsPossible() in your thread which sets a variable shouldTerminate to true which you can poll in your thread and exit if it's true.
