Loading Canon .CR2 files in .NET

I am trying to process Canon RAW .CR2 files using C#. My code is as follows: BitmapDecoder bmpDec = BitmapDecoder.Create(new Uri(origFile), BitmapCreateOptions.DelayCreation, BitmapCacheOption.None); BitmapEncoder bmpEnc = new BmpBitmapEncoder(); bmpEnc.Frames.Add(bmpDec.Frames[0]); Stream ms = new MemoryStream(); bmpEnc.Save(ms); Image srcImage = Bitmap.FromStream(ms); The first few lines seem to run without a hitch, but the line bmEnc.Save(ms); just hangs without completing and without raising any exception. Has anyone had any success with this?
