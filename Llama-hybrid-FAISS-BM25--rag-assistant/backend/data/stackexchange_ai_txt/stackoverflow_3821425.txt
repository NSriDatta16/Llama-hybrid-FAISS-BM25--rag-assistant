Using classes to organize code?

At the moment my Form1 code is extremely heavy, mainly full of menu and control events. One thing I would like to do is organize it in some way, so I could expand or collapse "related code" (in Visual Studio). My first attempt at this was to put code relating to the main menu, for example, inside a nested class called "MainMenu", which was within the Form1 class, so that I could simply collapse the nested class when I don't need it. This resulted in all sorts of problems (i.e. I couldn't find a way to set up the main menu inside this nested class). Is there a simpler solution to this that I'm missing? Or can someone shed some light on why my nested class idea is faulty?
