Doing a t-test here is rather naive. The data are not independent since each subject has repeated measures. This must be dealt with. One way to do so is a multilevel model (in R see lme4' or 'nlme packages). The fact that some individuals see green more easily and others see red more easily allows two approaches: 1) Averaging over people, we see no overall effect (this is what the t-test does). 2) An alternative is to look for reasons why the people differ (using characteristics of the people as independent variables).
