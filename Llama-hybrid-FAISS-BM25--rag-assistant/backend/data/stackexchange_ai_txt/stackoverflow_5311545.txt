To connect a record in one table (one shipment) to more than one record in another table (two routes) you would ideally use explicit JOIN s against the route table twice (or more, for however many links you happen to need). Here's a quick modification to your query that demonstrates usage. Pay particular attention to the two routename columns in the SELECT and the two JOIN s to the route table in the FROM : SELECT fare, commission, driver, shipment._date, RS.routename, Obviously, this might not match your needs exactly, because I don't know what tables the other selected fields are from to be able to make sure they are all accounted for...
