How to optimize choosing a subset of members under aggregate constraints?

I'm looking for any algorithms or frameworks concerned with optimal selection of a subset of members of a set, subject to aggregate constraints placed on the heterogeneous features of the subset. I'm having difficulty even coming up with the proper terminology to form this question, as I don't possess formal training in mathematics, so I'll do my best to describe the problem. Consider a data set of N observations with P features (an N by P matrix). I want to select a subset S of the N observations such that constraints on aggregations of the P features are met. For example, consider that the average of P1 is required to be less than some constraint C1, and simultaneously the average of P2 is required to be greater than some constraint C2. A "good" procedure would select the largest possible S subset of N that meets all of the constraints C (or comes close to the largest, considering time/complexity). The pseudo-algorithm I'm imagining is extremely greedy, and goes like this: Drop a random observation from the current superset, resulting in the current subset Check the change in the aggregates of the features for the current subset relative to the current superset If the aggregates get closer to meeting the constraints, leave the dropped observation aside and start the algorithm over with the current subset as the superset of the next round (this would have to be some imperfect voting-type decision, as I wouldn't expect all changes to have the same direction) If the aggregates get further from meeting the constraints, replace the dropped observation and start the algorithm over with the same superset (this observation could be re-considered for removal in future steps once a new subset is established) Stop searching after all constrains are met I realize there are several problems with this approach, not least of all the very large number of combinations possible while for the optimal set. Is there any body of work that focuses on this type of optimal subsetting, and provides some tools to approach this problem?
