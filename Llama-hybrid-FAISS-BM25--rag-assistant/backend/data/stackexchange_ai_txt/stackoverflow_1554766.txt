Does anyone use Fortify 360 with Classic ASP? a Header Manipulation vulnerability story

I'm on a short-term contracting gig, trying to patch some vulnerabilities in their legacy code. The application I'm working on is a combination of Classic ASP (VBScript) and .Net 2.0 (C#). One of the tools they have purchased is Fortify 360. Here is a current classic ASP page in the application: I know, I know, short and very dangerous. So we wrote some (en/de)coders and validation/verification routines: And still Fortify flags this as vulnerable to Header Manipulation. How or what exactly is Fortify looking for? The reason I suspect that Fortify is looking for specific keywords is that on the .Net side of things, I can include the Microsoft AntiXss assembly and call functions such as GetSafeHtmlFragment and UrlEncode and Fortify is happy. Any advice?
