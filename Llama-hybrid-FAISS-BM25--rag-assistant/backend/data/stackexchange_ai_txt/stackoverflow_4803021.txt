I have 500k unique images in my folder/directory. I want call it by name and all names are stored in Mysql database. but I heard that images can be store in database. so my question is which is more fastest option to display image faster. You should use the file system. Storing in database is not going to work very well. You should read Facebook Photo Storage Architecture to learn how facebook does it. They have the most photos in the world. Haystack file storage: Also interesting: http://www.fredberinger.com/high-performance-at-massive-scale-lessons-learned-at-facebook/
