How to hide the JWPlayer play button?

How can I hide the play button that's in the center of the video screen in JW Player? I'm using version 5.4 of the player and I am embedding it using their own 'JW Embedder' technique. I've tried the following with no luck: jwplayer("myPlayer").setup({ file: 'myMediaFile.mp4', image: 'myPosterFile.jpg', controlbar: 'bottom', icons: false }); I've read somewhere that this may have been removed with version 5.0 and must now be done with a skin. But, I also read that it returned in version 5.1 ... ?
