Paired t-test following main effect of mixed model with missing data

I am analyzing data for a repeated measures study with missing data. For example here is a 3 X 3 experimental design with three conditions and 3-time measures: I am using a mixed model for the main effects: model1 Since time is significant, I would like to follow up with a paired test by averaging across condition to obtain values of each subject's time. As you can see in the example data above, subject 1 is missing an entire condition. When I aggregate the data across time: timeSubjectMeans In order to perform a paired t-test on this data, should I exclude subject 1 because they are missing 1 of the conditions?
