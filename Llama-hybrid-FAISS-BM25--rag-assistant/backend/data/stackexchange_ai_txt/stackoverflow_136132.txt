Better Way of Manipulating RichText in C#?

I need to create and copy to the clipboard some RichText with standard "formatting" like bold/italics, indents and the like. The way I'm doing it now seems kind of inelegant... I'm creating a RichTextBox item and applying my formatting through that like so: RichTextBox rtb = new RichTextBox(); Font boldfont = new Font("Times New Roman", 10, FontStyle.Bold); rtb.Text = "sometext"; rtb.SelectAll() rtb.SelectionFont = boldfont; rtb.SelectionIndent = 12; There has got to be a better way, but after a few hours of searching I was unable to come up with anything better. Any ideas? Edit: The RichTextBox (rtb) is not displayed/drawn anywhere on a form. I'm just using the object to format my RichText.
