The following are some ideas you can implement in case performance is of great issue: Reduce the dimensionality of the data : you have 2d data of long/lat, perhaps you can try projecting it down to 1D using something like Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) which tries to reduce the number of dimensions while preserving the distances in the original space, thus the distance function will only have to deal with one feature instead of two. An alternative way is to use Principal component analysis (PCA) Faster search : the step of computing the distance to each marker can be improved using KD-trees . Both of these technique are applied in an offline setting, so they are usually computed once and then used many times..
