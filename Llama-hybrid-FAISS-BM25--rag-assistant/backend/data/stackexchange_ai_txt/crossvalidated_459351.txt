You are correct in that you are likely looking at linear correlations and the neural network is finding non-linear correlations. Your best bet is to let the network do it's job and perform feature learning implicitly. If you insist on reducing dimensionality consider training a noisy auto-encoder prior to your predictive network. This will cast your features in an efficient, lower dimensional space. It's roughly equivalent to kernel PCA.
