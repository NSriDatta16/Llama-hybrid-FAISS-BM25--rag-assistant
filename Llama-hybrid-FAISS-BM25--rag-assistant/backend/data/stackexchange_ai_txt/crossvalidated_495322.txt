Is there a standard for statistical symbols?

Mathematics have ISO 80000-2:2019 which specifies mathematical symbols, explains their meanings, and gives verbal equivalents and applications. Is there an equivalent for statistical symbols? Edit: the question is broader than the question of statistical model notation since it also encompasses simpler topics (such as the symbol for average, median, etc.)
