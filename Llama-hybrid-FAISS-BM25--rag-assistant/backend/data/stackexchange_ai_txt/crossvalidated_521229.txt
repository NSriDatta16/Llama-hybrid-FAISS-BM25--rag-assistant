Resources on statistical inference

I plan to do a course on statistical inference, and would like to ask if anyone could recommend any useful texts. It will include topics such as sufficiency, likelihood, Bayesian approaches (& follows on from a 1st course in distribution theory). The ideal text would be something that is in fairly large font and uncluttered text (unlike Wackerly & Mendenhall), is organised well, explains concepts clearly, and has lots of exercises and clear, worked solutions (exercises without solutions are not of much use). Any suggestions would be appreciated (especially as it's difficult to gauge a text without purchasing it).
