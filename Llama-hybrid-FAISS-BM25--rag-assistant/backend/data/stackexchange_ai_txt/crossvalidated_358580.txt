Your approach is feasible but you need to accommodate many more columns (i.e. predictor series) than you have. I took your data into a comprehensive time series package that simultaneously deals with i.e. identifies 1) lead and lag effects around holidays 2) day-of-the-week effects and changes in day-of-the-week effects 3) time trends and level shifts 4) day-of-the-month effects % 5) week=of-the-month effects , 6) month-of-the-year effects 7) week-of-the-year effects 8) long-weekend effects 9) anomalies 10) changes in error variance over time and others including user-specified/suggested causals et al and of course any necessary arima structure to deal with omitted structure. This is the Actual/Fit and Forecast that you should be getting from a useful model with model residuals here and forecasts here for the next 365 days . Part of the equation is shown here and here Hope this helps raise your expectations regarding daily modelling . solutions.... If you can find a way to identify these additional "columns" for your data you possibly might be able to something useful out of your current approach. Of course the trick is this do this automatically/programattically as I did. Your "lack of confidence in your results" is echoed/mirrored by the "lack of confidence in your forecasts i.e. unrealistically very wide prediction limits " In help to Alex , I have added more of the equation explicitely showing the indicator series for some of the Pulses .. I was asked to provide a clear picture of the forecasts vis-a-vis the actuals
