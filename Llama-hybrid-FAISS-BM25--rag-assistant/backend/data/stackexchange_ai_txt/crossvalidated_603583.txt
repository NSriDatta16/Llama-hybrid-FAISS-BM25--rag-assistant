If a class overlay is too high for one to another, is it possible to do classification?

This is a figure of PCA Map of several class data that i am trying to classify: By looking at it, I wanted to be sure if this is not really applicable to be classified? (since it has a high overlap rate) or is there anyway I can do to somehow separate the class (so it minimize the class overlay) and make it more favorable to be classified? PC Information: Edit: Figure of ICA Map (alternatives)
