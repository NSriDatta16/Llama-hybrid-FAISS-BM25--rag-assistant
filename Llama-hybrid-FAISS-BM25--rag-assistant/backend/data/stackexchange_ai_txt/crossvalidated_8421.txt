To 'test' (i.e., evaluate) the proportional odds assumption in R, you can use residuals.lrm() in Frank Harrell Jr.'s Design package. If you type ?residuals.lrm , there is a quick-to-replicate example of how Frank Harrell recommends evaluating the proportional odds assumption (i.e., visually, rather than by a push-button test). Design estimates ordered logistic regressions using lrm(), which you can substitute for polr() from MASS. For a more formal example of how to visually test the proportional odds assumption in R, see: Paper: Ordinal Response Regression Models in Ecology Author(s): Antoine Guisan and Frank E.
