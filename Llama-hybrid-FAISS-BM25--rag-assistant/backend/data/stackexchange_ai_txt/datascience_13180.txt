There is no clear cut answer . What I'd recommend would be to scale your data using different approaches and then use the same model to predict outcomes on your holdout set (RFs would work fine here). That should atleast show you which scaling approach is best in your prediction problem. You don't need to scale your data for Random Forests The individual ranges shouldn't be a problem as long as they are consistently scaled to begin with. This is just illustrating that there are differences between the variables, just on a more compact scale than before. Yes - all your data should be scaled with the same approach. Otherwise values in your transformed dataset might relate not to the data itself, but the algo used for scaling. Hopefully this helps.
