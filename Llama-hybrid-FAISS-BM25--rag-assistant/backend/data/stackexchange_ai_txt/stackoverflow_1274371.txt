It isn't pretty, but in the past I've appended a guid in the layer description. Something like this: I've got a DLL floating around that would slam these xml frags into each layer of an MXD (with enough cr/lf in front to scroll the xml fragment out of the layer description in ArcMap Layer Prop dialog) . There's a help file in the 7z file (documentation is sparse because I'm doing other things): http://code.google.com/p/umbriel/downloads/list
