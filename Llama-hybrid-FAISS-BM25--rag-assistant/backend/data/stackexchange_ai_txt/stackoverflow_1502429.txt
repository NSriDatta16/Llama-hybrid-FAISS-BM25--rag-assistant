If you just want to retrieve a date and subsequently use it in another query, you're better off not converting it to a string at all. In that way you don't need to worry about what formats are used during the conversion. To do so you need to use parametered queries. You can google for this, but in classic ASP with VB it will look something like: ' Retrieval ... Set objCommand = CreateObject("ADODB.Command") ... objCommand.CommandText = "SELECT SomeDate FROM SomeTable" ... Set objRS = objCommand.Execute ... dtSomeDate = objRS("SomeDate").Value ' This is a Date object ' Write date to db ... Set objCommand = CreateObject("ADODB.Command") ... objCommand.CommandText = "INSERT INTO SomeTable (...,SomeDate) VALUES (...,?)" Set objParam = objCommand.CreateParameter("SomeDate", adDateTime, adParamInput, dtSomeDate) ... objCommand.Execute
