VARCHAR(MAX) is only capable of holding 8000 characters see here From MSDN: varchar [ ( n | max ) ] - Variable-length, non-Unicode character data. n can be a value from 1 through 8,000. max indicates that the maximum storage size is 2^31-1 bytes As Joseph (below) says, to hold more, use a text or ntext data type, but if you want to be able to search that, then you'd need some form of full-text indexing enabled.
