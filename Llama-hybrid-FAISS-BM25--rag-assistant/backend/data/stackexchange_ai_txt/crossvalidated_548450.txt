Assigning higher weights to more recent observations in a Neural Network

I have time-series data and am using a Neural Network for the purposes of forecasting forward. I have 20 years of monthly data but would like to assign a higher weight to those observations that have occurred more recently (like in the last 1 year) in the parameter estimation process, as I believe that this data will have a bigger influence on projections. Would the Neural Network be able to capture the fact that the more recent data is having a bigger influence on future estimates or would I have to explicitly feed it this information? If so, how could I look to do this in python?
