Rao-Blackwellization of Gibbs Sampler

I am currently estimating a stochastic volatility model with Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. Thereby, I am implementing Gibbs and Metropolis sampling methods. Assuming I take the mean of the posterior distribution rather than a random sample from it, is this what is commonly referred to as Rao-Blackwellization ? Overall, this would result in taking the mean over the means of the posterior distributions as parameter estimate.
