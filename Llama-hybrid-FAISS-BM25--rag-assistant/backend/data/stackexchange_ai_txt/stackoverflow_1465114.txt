We recently just added this to our CMS system, so yes, it's certainly doable. We found it easiest to just add a whole new button to tinyMCE that created its own popup that handled all the Internal Links stuff such as presenting a list of pages that could be linked to, creating the href itself and embedding it back into the page. Our CMS system already had all the functionality to list pages in a tree format so if you have something similar you can just popup your own created page from the tinyMCE button. (Also remember to give some thought to how you'll handle internal links to deleted or archived pages).
