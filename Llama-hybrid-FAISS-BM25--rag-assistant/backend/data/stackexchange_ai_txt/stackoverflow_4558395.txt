It seems that the CustomAction.dll was not updated when I update the installation with msiexec /fv . I now manually placed the newly build CustomAction.dll (with an empty uninstall override) into the installation folder and was able to uninstall. Update: (Credits to @pcans) use ORCA to edit the currently installed msi and manually disable the uninstall custom action.
