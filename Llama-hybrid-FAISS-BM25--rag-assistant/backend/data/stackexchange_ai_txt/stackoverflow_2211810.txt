jQuery Columnizer plugin only working correctly on window resize

I'm using the jQuery Columnizer plugin , and I'm running into a weird problem. Using 3 columns, I columnize content from a hidden into a target . It distributes only one paragraph to each of the first two columns and then puts all the remaining paragraphs into the last column. The strange thing is that it auto-corrects itself when the window is resized. I'm guessing it has something to do with the target resizing since opening a firebug console window also causes it to auto-correct itself. Setting lastNeverTallest:true doesn't seem to do anything. $('#hidden-about').columnize({ columns: 3, target: '#interiors', lastNeverTallest: true, doneFunc: function() { $('#interiors').css('white-space', 'normal'); $('#interiors').fadeIn(200); } }); Thanks for any suggestions!
