Yeah. There have been scenarios like that. Imagenet has more than 1000 classes. Same could be said for certain cifar datasets. If deep learning, go with one-hot encoding for the labels. Stick with something like multi-class AUC as metric instead of believing on Validation accuracy. Go with a keras DNN, then you could try advanced architectures, with the last Dense net to have 1880 neurons each representing one label. Also stick with categorical_crossentropy for loss. Hope this helps.
