I did see some interesting things on this NOAA page under the Technical Definitions and Computational Details heading, but I'm sure you've read that already. The answer to the SO question " Position of the sun given time of day, and lat/long " and the above may actually be all you need. As a side note (it doesn't answer your question directly), is there a reason you can't pull the NOAA data and use it as a lookup table instead of calculating it? Storage tends to be relatively cheap these days.
