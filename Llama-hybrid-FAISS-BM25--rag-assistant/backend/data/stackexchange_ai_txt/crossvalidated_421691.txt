Can i use short time series data?

I want to run ols regression for time series data in R, but my data is short that is annual from 2000-2009. There are only 9 variables(2000-2009) and i collected data for inflation and exchange rate that how these variables between 2000-2009 affect gdp growth between 2000-2018. Is it ok for regression?
