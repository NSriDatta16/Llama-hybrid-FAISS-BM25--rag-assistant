I've found a bit more elegant solution. In gnomevfs module there is function named mime_get_all_applications which returns proper list of associated applications. More information can be found here . Edit: Since the time this answer was written, GnomeVFS was marked as deprecated. GIO does provide this functionality now with methods like app_info_get_all and app_info_get_for_type .
