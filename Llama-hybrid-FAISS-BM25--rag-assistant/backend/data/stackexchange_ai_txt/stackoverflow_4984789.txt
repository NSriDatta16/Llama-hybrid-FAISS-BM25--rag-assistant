JFileChoose.getSelectedFile() returns a File object, not a String object. The File object has methods like getAbsolutePath(), getPath(), getName(), getParent() that return string versions of the file name and path. So something like: File file = fileChooser.getSelectedFile(); System.out.println("Selected file is: "+file.getAbsolutePath()+"/"+file.getName()); Should get you what you want. Also FYI, this doesn't compile ... String exportPath = fileChooser.getSelectedFile(); ... because the File object returned by getSelectedFile() is not a String object. However, the File object (like all objects) has a toString() method which gets called automatically to build the string when you did this ... String exportPath = fileChooser.getSelectedFile() +"\\"; The elegant way would be, as I said, something like this: String exportPath = fileChooser.getSelectedFile().getAbsolutePath(); Hope this helps, good luck!
