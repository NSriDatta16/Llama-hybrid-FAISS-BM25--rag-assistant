is there a functor that derefences a (smart) pointer, upcasts it, and then calls a method on it?

I have class A: public B { ...} vector v; I want to do for_each(v.begin(), v.end(), mem_fun_deref(B::blah())); (Actually I have: vector > but it shouldn't matter) I need to upcast and call the member function.
