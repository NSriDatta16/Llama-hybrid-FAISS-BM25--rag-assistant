AutoMapper Problem - List won't Map

I have the following class: public class Account { public int AccountID { get; set; } public Enterprise Enterprise { get; set; } public List UserList { get; set; } } And I have the following method fragment: Entities.Account accountDto = new Entities.Account(); DAL.Entities.Account account; Mapper.CreateMap (); Mapper.CreateMap (); account = DAL.Account.GetByPrimaryKey(this.Database, primaryKey, withChildren); Mapper.Map(account,accountDto); return accountDto; When the method is called, the Account class gets mapped correctly but the list of users in the Account class does not (it is NULL). There are four User entities in the List that should get mapped. Could someone tell me what might be wrong?
