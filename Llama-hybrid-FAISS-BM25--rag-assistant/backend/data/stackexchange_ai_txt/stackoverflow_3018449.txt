A common issue are spaces in the URL - beginning, in the middle, or trailing. Did you check that out? Edit - per comments below, spacing is not the issue. I ran your code and had the same problem - no output whatsoever. I tried the URL and with a GET request, the server talks to me. I would do the following: Use the following as $base_url: $base_url = ' http://ws.audioscrobbler.com/2.0/?user=bachya&period=&api_key=xxx&method=user.getTopTracks '; Remove the post fields from your request. Edit I moved your code out of the class since I didn't have the rest and modified it. The following code runs perfect for me. If these changes don't work for you, I suggest that your error is in a different function. 'bachya', 'period' => NULL, 'api_key' => 'xxxxx...', // obfuscated, obviously )); $options['method'] = 'user.getTopTracks'; // Initialize cURL request and set parameters $ch = curl_init($base_url); curl_setopt_array($ch, array( CURLOPT_URL => $base_url, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER => TRUE, CURLOPT_TIMEOUT => 30, CURLOPT_USERAGENT => 'Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 5.01; Windows NT 5.0)' )); $results = curl_exec($ch); return $results; } echo getTopTracks(); ?>
