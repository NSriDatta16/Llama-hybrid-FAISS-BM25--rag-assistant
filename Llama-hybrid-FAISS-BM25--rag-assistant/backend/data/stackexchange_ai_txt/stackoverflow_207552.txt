I really liked EnderMB's answer , but I wanted to add to that: Cultivate an environment where discussion of code quality is encouraged rather than seen as sensitive or taboo. For example, I've worked on an open source project (a Python library) where new code and bugfixes are frequently discussed with the group. Not only is it OK to say "hey, I think it's better to do it this way" but that's actually encouraged and part of the process we use for maintaining high quality code. I realize not every environment is conducive to this kind of process, but it has really worked well for us. Every code commit doesn't have to be a committee meeting, but it should hopefully be perfectly acceptable for you to discuss questionable or non-optimal code and look for improvement. After all, better code is better for everyone on the team, and a major concept of teamwork is working together instead of as a loose group of individuals.
