There are proposed solutions to parametric hazard models. Take a look at these: Prieger, James, 2000."A Generalized Parametric Selection Model for Non-normal Data," Working Papers 00-9, University of California at Davis, Department of Economics. Boehmke, Frederick J., Daniel Morey and Megan Shannon. 2006. "Selection Bias and Continuous-Time Duration Models: Consequences and a Proposed Solution." American Journal of Political Science 50 (1): 192-207. There is code for the later paper in Stata, package "dursel" However, I am not aware of a solution for the semiparametric Cox model.
