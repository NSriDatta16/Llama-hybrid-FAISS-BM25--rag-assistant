I'm not sure exactly what your asking. Can you try clarifying the scenario a bit? But if you want to change a controls parent, all you need to do is make that control a child of the panel using the Controls property. myPanel.Controls.Add(target) This should update the parent of target to be myPanel. If you're attempting to do this via the designer, all you need to do is drag the target control onto the panel and that should take care of it.
