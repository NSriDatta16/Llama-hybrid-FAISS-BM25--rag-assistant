Events in Django

This might be a very dumb question but I can't find an answer anywhere. I was wondering how do you handle events in Django. I've read the tutorial in their webpage and I cant find a sign of explanation or I'm missing it. I work in ASP.NET webforms and the way to do that, as you probably know, is putting the event name in the ASP.NET control and calling a particular procedure. I know Django is a very different framework because it's MVC, but I have taken a quick view to a ROR tutorial and I think I've seen they use something similar to ASP.NET webforms, if I've understood correctly, something like embedding ruby code in the html interface and declaring an action there, which I suppose calls the respective function, something like this ,which calls a function 'def action1:' in the controller, similar (only in that sense) to asp.net, but webforms doesnt render a view with the name of the function among other things. So the question is simply that, how do you use events in Django. I hope I was at least a bit clear because it's difficult for me to ask these questions in english
