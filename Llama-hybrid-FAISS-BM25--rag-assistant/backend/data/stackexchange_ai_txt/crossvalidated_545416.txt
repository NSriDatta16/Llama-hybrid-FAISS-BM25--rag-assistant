I think that taking 45 pre\post to the paired t-test, can be in some cases, misleading. Take for example a case where 1 radiologist give very different scores (e.g. much higher) from all the others. In this case the results can be skewed towards this radiologist which can be an outlier. The same goes for averaging each case between the 3 radiologist and go to paired t-test with 15 averages. One option, in order to get full information, and then decide what to do with it is: Run a 3 paired t-test, one for each radiologist. Compute the $\mu, \sigma$ and t-test score for each. If they all agree then it is easy. If not, you can compute if there is a statistical significance difference between the different radiologists (i.e. are their $\mu$ are statistically significant different). Finally, if there is a contradiction between them, it is up to you to decide what to do. Do you take the majority vote?, do you have other considerations like: do you trust one more than others etc.
