Use a "bottom-swipe" gesture (starting in the bottom bezel region, drag up into the screen area). The app window will minimize itself, at which point you can click on its X widget to close it, or drag it up to "toss it" away. The basic gestures are described in the Getting Started guides , which all new developers should read (along with the associated docs , including the UI Guidelines and Development Guide). All these bezel gestures are reserved for the OS itself, except the "top-swipe" which is reserved for context menus and such in the apps themselves.
