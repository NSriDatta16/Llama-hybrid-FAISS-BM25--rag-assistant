Ending a Fragment

So I've about got down how to open a fragment . Here is my predicament. I have a list of the elements (periodic table elements) that is next to my view . When you select an element it shows it's information. My problem is that I need to be able to remove the view from the (what we'll call details fragment) and remove it from the stack that way I don't have a huge memory backup. How do I remove it from the stack when a new fragment is called to replace it?
