Why is it desirable to have linear separability in SVM? SVCs are inherently a linear technique. They find linear boundaries separating (as best possible) different classes. If there is no natural linear boundary for the problem, the choices are either to use a different technique, or to use SVCs with transformed features into a space where there indeed is a linear boundary. Ref to above image, clearly a circle can separate the two classes(left image). Why then take so much pain to map it to a function to make it linearly separable (right image) ? This is a classic example. The data classes are separated by a circle, but an SVC cannot find circles directly. However, if the data are transformed using a radial basis function , then in the resulting space, the classes are separated by a linear boundary.
