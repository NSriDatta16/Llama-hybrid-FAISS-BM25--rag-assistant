I don't think one is faster than the other, but one is BETTER to use than the other: SELECT (fields) FROM A INNER JOIN B ON A.ID = B.ID is definitely the preferred way of expressing this (and conforms to the ANSI SQL standard for join syntax). It's clearer, it's more obvious to the observer what exactly is happening here. Always use this syntax over the other - it's just easier and clearer! PS: SQL Guru Aaron Bertrand seems to agree :-) Bad habits to kick: using old-style JOINs
