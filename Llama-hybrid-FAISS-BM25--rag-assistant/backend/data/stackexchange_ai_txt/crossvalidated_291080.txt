Finding regions of high values?

I have an array of a million float values, and I seek to identify regions of abnormally high values. For instance, within [0.39, 0. 41, 0.4, 0.67, 0.7, 0.8, 0.37, 0.49] , [ 0.67, 0.7, 0.8 ] constitutes a region of abnormally high values. Are there standard algorithms/methods for addressing this type of problem? I was thinking about filtering for values that exceed say 2 standard deviations from the mean, but such a method does not take into account how these regions are preferably connected. Furthermore, 2 standard deviations is just an arbitrary threshold I conjured up. Maybe we could borrow a clustering method from machine learning?
