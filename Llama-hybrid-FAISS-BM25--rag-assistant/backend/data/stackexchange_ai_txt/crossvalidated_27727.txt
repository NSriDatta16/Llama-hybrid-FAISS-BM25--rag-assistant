You have correctly applied Bayes rule but this is a far cry from understanding Bayesian statistics. Bayesian statistics is a way of doing statistical inference that is different the frequentist approach. Suppose you want to get an interval estimate of the mean of a normal distribution. You first put a prior distribution on the mean then you collect data. Bayes' theorem is used to relate the prior distribution for the mean to the posterior distribution by posterior is proportional to prior times likelihood. The posterior distribution is then used for inference. An interval estimate for the mean that is the Bayesian analog of a 95% confidence interval is a 95% credible interval. You get this by picking points equal distant in each direction from the mean of the posterior distribution and far enough so that the integral from the lower endpoint to the upper endpoint is 0.95. This is what Bayesian statistics is about. It is much more than just Bayes theorem. Bayes theorem is an uncontroversial mathematical result in probability. Bayesian statistics is a paradigm for statistical inference and is somewhat controversial because it assigns probability distributions to unknown parameters.
