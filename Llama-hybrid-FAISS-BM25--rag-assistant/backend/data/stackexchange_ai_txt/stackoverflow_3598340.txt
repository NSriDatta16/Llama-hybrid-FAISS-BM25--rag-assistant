The dragon book is totally the wrong source because an assembler is not a compiler. The "grammer" of an assembler line is extremly simple (regular grammer - not context sensitive). The code generation part for an assembler is almost non existing. Get a good reference book about the opcodes of your target CPU and just generate the bytes as explained. There a few nice simple assemblers out there and you should look at them. Learning by code reading is a very effective way for a college project. You will need it because the Intel Assembler code is extremely ugly at least if you want target some of the extensions as well.
