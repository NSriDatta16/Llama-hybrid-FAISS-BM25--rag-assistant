How do I handle a callback in java

I have a servlet that request a geolocation from another server using an http get. The response is received via a callback from the other server and ends up in another servlet. Ideally I would like to return a map on the first servlet and make this asynchronous mechanism synchronous. All I can come up with at the moment is to poll a shared hashmap till the value is there, it seems like a bit of an ugly hack. Any ideas how I can implement this more elegantly?
