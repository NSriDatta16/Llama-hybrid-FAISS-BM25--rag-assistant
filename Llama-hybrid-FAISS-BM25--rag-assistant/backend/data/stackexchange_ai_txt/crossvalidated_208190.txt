Using metric MDS with non-metric distances and assessing the fit quality

I'm going to perform MDS by means of cmdscale function of standard R library. I spent several hours googling it and finally have a number of questions (some of them more general, some could be more specific to its implementations in R ). I have a matrix of non-metric distances, e.g. based on Sorensen-Dice coefficient . Can I use the matrix for cmdscale function? As I understand, the function will perform "metric MDS"; so, metric MDS for non-metric distances. How can I estimate the quality of my model? I've found the stress term and GOF component of output of cmdscale function, but I am confused with their interpretation. Could you clarify it for me please? Is there anything else? In PCA one often calculates the percentage of explained variance. Is this term applicable in MDS as well? How can I interpret it?
