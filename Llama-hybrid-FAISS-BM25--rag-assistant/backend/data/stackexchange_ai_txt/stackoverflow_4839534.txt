HTML (5ish): How to semantically interpose a gallery in an article

Typical article: I want to display an article that is primarily text with a few embedded images or media files. Typical Gallery: I also want to display an image gallery that is (loosely) related to the topic of the article. For the purpose of this question, let's suppose that the gallery is a 20 item flickr search on key words that are used in the article. The train wreck: The mini-gallery should cut the article right after the lead, and the article should continue below the mini-gallery. I was hammering out the html like so: yadda img's yadda When all the recent html5 excitement began telling me, "This is just wrong, what you are doing!" (to quote Heroku from Speed Racer). So.. after some searching... the question persists... is there a "follow from" DOM object or what?
