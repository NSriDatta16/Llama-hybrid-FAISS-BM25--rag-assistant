What you want to achieve by using class hierarchy can be achieved merely through namespacing. So languages that support namespapces ( like C#) will have no use of implementing class hierarchy of static classes. Since you can not instantiate any of the classes, all you need is a hierarchical organization of class definitions which you can obtain through the use of namespaces
