Multiple tables are one option. It's similar to object-oriented code, just with your database tables. Imagine you have a fruit object and the dropdown specifies what type of fruit: banana, apple, orange, watermelon. So your fruit table would have your ID, Weight, Color, Price, IsOrganic, etc. fields. Then Banana might also have FruitID, Length, RipenessLevel, Brand, IsBundled, etc. Apple would have FruitID, Flavor, IsBagged, IsWaxed, etc. Orange would have FruitID, IsWaxed, Flavor, IsBagged, etc. Watermelon would have FruitID, CutType, IsSeedless, etc. Obviously you could potentially add multiple levels here since apples and oranges have some common fields and that may or may not make sense, depending on your needs. This way, when you do a lookup of the fruit data, you look across both tables to get all data or just the Fruit table to get basic data.
