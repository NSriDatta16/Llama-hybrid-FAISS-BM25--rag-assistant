OpenMP - running things in parallel and some in sequence within them

I have a scenario like: for (i = 0; i Considering this is block A, Now I have two more similar blocks in my code. I want to put them in parallel, so I used OpenMP pragmas. However I am not able to parallelize it, because I am a tad confused that which variables would be shared and private in this case. If the function call in the inner loop was an operation like sum += x, then I could have added a reduction clause. In general, how would one approach parallelizing a code using OpenMP, when we there is a nested for loop, and then another inner for loop doing the main operation. I tried declaring a parallel region, and then simply putting pragma fors before the blocks, but definitely I am missing a point there! Thanks, Sayan
