How can I get a regex match to only be added once to the matches collection?

I have a string which has several html comments in it. I need to count the unique matches of an expression. For example, the string might be: var teststring = " Hi there "; I currently use this to get the matches: var regex = new Regex(" "); var matches = regex.Matches(teststring); The results of this is 3 matches. However, I would like to have this be only 2 matches since there are only two unique matches. I know I can probably loop through the resulting MatchCollection and remove the extra Match, but I'm hoping there is a more elegant solution. Clarification : The sample string is greatly simplified from what is actually being used. There can easily be an X8 or X9, and there are likely dozens of each in the string.
