The variable importance obtained by permutations is computed only by permuting values for a single variable. Thus, it computes some importance measure of the given variable in the context that all other data is fixed. I think it is reasonable to state that the importance measure includes in the measurement also interactions, if such interactions exists. I mean that I see VI as an impure measure, a measure influenced by the main effect of that variable and also interaction with others. Gini importance is found often to be in concordance with permutation importance, and I see it as a similar measure. There is however something called interaction which is measured in random forests, and this measures if a split on a given variable increase or decrease splits on other measure. This can be computed for each pair of measures. It looks like a 2 measure interactions. If one want to measure interactions with more than 2 variables than I suppose it is possible extending the given procedure, but soon becomes too computer intensive. Last thing called interactions is not implemented in R package randomForests as far as I know. Take a look on the brief description from the Breiman's page on RF here , and check for Interactions section.
