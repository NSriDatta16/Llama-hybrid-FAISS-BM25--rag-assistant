Variance is not even in the same units as the data. Population variance is the average squared-distance-from-the-mean. You would not expect it to relate in any direct way to the range. (It's sort of a bit like saying "I expected the area to be smaller than the perimeter" -- they're not even in the same units; a change of units - millimeters to meters, say - would change the relative size of the numbers without changing the actual meaning of their relationship.) However, the population standard deviation can't exceed the (population) range; indeed it can't exceed half the range. Aside from the effect of Bessel's correction, the same would apply to sample quantities. If your variance is 1108.74, then your standard deviation is about 33.3, and indeed that's less than half the range.
