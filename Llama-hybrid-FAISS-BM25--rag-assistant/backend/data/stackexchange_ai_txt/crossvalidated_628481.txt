Yes, "on average" (more precisely in expectation) the average value of the samples $X_1, \dots, X_n$ will be equal to the population parameter, regardless of the size of the samples. In the classic dartboard analogy, the estimates will not cluster away from the target, they might be inaccurate but they'll be evenly spread around the target. That applies regardless of the number of observations in the sample -- that will of course change the variance of each sample, so with smaller sample sizes you will get very imprecise (if unbiased) estimates.
