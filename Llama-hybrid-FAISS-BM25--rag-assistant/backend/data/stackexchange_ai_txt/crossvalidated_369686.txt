I may be misinterpreting the question. I doubt you can build up the linear regression equation by regression on residuals in the way OP specified . OP's method would only work if the predictors are independent of each other. To make it work, assume $y$ is the outcome vector, $X$ is the model matrix for the predictors already in the model and you want to include $x_1$ . You need to regress the residual of the regression of $y$ on $X$ against the residual of the regression of $x_1$ on $X$ to obtain the OLS coefficient for $x_1$ . Here's a simple example: set.seed(12345) n Fit model with OLS: coef(lm(y ~ x1 + x2)) (Intercept) x1 x2 0.001653707 1.037426007 0.996259446 Regression on residuals: coef(lm(residuals(lm(y ~ x1)) ~ x2)) (Intercept) x2 0.001219232 0.818774874 This is wrong, you need to fit: coef(lm(residuals(lm(y ~ x1)) ~ residuals(lm(x2 ~ x1)))) (Intercept) residuals(lm(x2 ~ x1)) -6.707350e-17 9.962594e-01 Which returns the right coefficient for x2, this aligns with expected differences in y given differences in x2, holding x1 constant (taking it out of both y and x1). That aside, in logistic regression, it would even be more problematic because logistic regression coefficients suffer from omitted variable bias even in the absence of confounded relations, see here and here , so unless all predictors of the outcome are in the model, one cannot obtain unbiased estimates of the true population parameters. Moreover, I do not know of any residuals from the model that would be amenable to a second logistic regression with all values lying between 0 and 1.
