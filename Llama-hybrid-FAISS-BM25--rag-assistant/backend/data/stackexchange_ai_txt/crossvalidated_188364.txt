Whether "nearly significant" makes sense or not depends on one's philosophy of statistical inference. It's perfectly valid to consider the alpha level as a line in the sand, in which case one should only pay attention to whether $p or $p>\alpha$ . For such an "absolutist", "nearly significant" makes no sense. But it's also perfectly valid to think of p values as providing continuous measures of strength of support (not strength of effect, of course). For such a "continualist", "nearly significant" is a sensible way to describe a result with a moderate p-value. The problem arises when people mix these two philosophies - or worse, are not aware that both exist. (By the way - people often assume these map cleanly onto Neyman/Pearson and Fisher, but they don't; hence my admittedly clumsy terms for them).
