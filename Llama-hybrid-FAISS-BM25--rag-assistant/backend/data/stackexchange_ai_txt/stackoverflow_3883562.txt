Drupal Views of nodes to show node comments

I've encountered a Drupal problem: I'm using the Views module for rendering nodes of a kind, based on the user id of it's author (it is a Content Profile actually). I want the view to show the comments for the node, just like in node/%. I could not find any option in views or any relevant module. Am I in the wrong direction and should reorganize stuff for this...? Any ideas, how can it be done? Regards, Laci
