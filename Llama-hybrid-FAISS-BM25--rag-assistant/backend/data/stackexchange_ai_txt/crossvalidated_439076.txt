Does a martingale difference sequence (mds) imply strong mixing?

I read this from an econometrics paper " The typical hypothesis which is imposed in the time series literature is that the $u_t$ 's are either independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) or a martingale difference sequence (m.d.s.). In this work, we do not impose such strong assumptions..... We only assume that it satisfies a strong mixing condition . " By strong mixing, the authors mean an $\alpha$ -mixing condition. Question: Does a m.d.s. imply strong mixing? Thanks P.s. I did some googling for a few days and I cant seem to find satisfactory answers.
