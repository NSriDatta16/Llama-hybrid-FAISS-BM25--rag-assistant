I had this exact issue using a Gtk::Fixed (actually gtk.Fixed -- pygtk -- but I think it's all the same underneath) and I was able to handle it quite easily by manipulating each widget's window. In my case, the widgets already are EventBox instances, and I just needed to make sure that the one I was dragging around was on top, because otherwise it slid underneath others, which looked quite wrong. The solution was as simple as calling "widget.window.raise_()" to raise the widget's underlying window when the widget was clicked to begin the drag. So I'm basically just reaffirming that the previous answer works, but I wanted to point out that it's actually pretty easy. It sounds like you may need to create some EventBoxes to hold your widgets, but after that it should just work. You can see the code I was working on at http://github.com/divegeek/BlockHead
