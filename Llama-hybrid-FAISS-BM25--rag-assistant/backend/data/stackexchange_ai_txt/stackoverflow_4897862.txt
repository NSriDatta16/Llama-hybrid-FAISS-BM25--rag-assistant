calculating time complexity of a algorithm

Possible Duplicate: Plain English explanation of Big O I have been doing programing for 4 years now, but i never paid attentions to what time complexity is closely. i have a interview tomorrow and i know they will be asking me questions on it.Can anyone help me understand time complexity in simple terms with example?By looking at the code how can we decide if its complexity is O(n) or O(log n) O(n) etc?
