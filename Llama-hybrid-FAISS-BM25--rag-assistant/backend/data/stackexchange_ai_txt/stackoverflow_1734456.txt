I've just released python-yql also available on pypi. It can do public, two-legged oauth a.k.a signed requests and facilitate 3-legged outh too. It's brand new so there may be some bugs whilst I work on improving the test coverage but should hopefully do what you need. See the source for some idea on how to use it. Installing to try it is as follows: sudo easy_install yql Bug/Feature requests can be filed here: https://bugs.launchpad.net/python-yql
