Adobe air: Navigate between .html pages?

I always thought of myself as being quite good at learning the most basic things with the help of Google and a cup of coffee, but when trying to get my head around basic Adobe AIR development, I have totally failed. Apparently there's plenty of tutorials about loading data from local storage as well as remote places (Ajax), but I have yet not seen a clear instruction on how to navigate between the .html pages in the Applications directory. Obviously isn't going to cut it, so my guess is that I need some DOM javascript magic to do it, which I yet not have seen. How can I navigate between .html pages in my applications directory properly? Thanks
