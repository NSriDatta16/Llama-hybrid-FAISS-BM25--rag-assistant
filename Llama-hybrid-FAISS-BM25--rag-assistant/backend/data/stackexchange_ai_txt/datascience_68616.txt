Machine Learning Out of test data forecast (XGBoost, ANN)

I see a lot of applications for machine learning techniques applied to time series. Unfortunately almost all kernels with XGBoost or ANN stop short in creating an actual forecast. The achieve a great fit as they have the test data exlcuded.Are there any kernels for XGBoost or ANN where an actual forecast is created? I do not understand how this is possible as the predict function always needs future values which are not given. When trying out with the testset you have the values but after this you dont have the forecasted values of all the features, so would is the point of making such models with a lot of features which have no future values. All the models are useless? Please prove me wrong but i do not understand. Thank you.
