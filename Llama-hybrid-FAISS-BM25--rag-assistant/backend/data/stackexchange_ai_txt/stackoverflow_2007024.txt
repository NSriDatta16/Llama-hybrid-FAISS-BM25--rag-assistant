Push my apk to /system/app

How can I push my application package to Android emulator "/system/app" folder? I've already tried to use: "adb push myApk.apk /system/app" and it gives me this: "failed to copy: ... No space left on device" Although from settings -> sdCard & Phone Storage, I get 37Mb of internal free space. The whole point of this need is related to permissions. I need to have INSTALL_PACKAGES permission and I know that by puting my application there, in /system/app, I get that permission.
