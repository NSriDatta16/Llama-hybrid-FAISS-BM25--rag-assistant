What about having two classnames? You add the class 'foo' to all your elements that require javascript modification. Your javascript has to check the dom only once for foo. var $foo = $('.foo'); Afterwards you can search within this array which should be way smaller than the complete dom. var $dragAble = $foo.filter('.fooDragable');
