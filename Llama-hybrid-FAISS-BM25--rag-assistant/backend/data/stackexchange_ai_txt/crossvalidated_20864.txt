Creating univariable smoothed scatterplot on logit scale using R

I am learning logistic regression modeling from the book Applied Logistic Regression by Hosmer. I need to create a plot named "create univariable smoothed scatterplot on logit scale", something like this one ( Figure 4.2 page 107 ): Can anyone help? Thanks. edit 01 Thanks for all the answers. I tried creating the plot, and discover that smooth.spline created the graph by using percentage ( nrow((df[df[,"dfree"]==1,]))/nrow(df) ), rather than logit ( log(nrow(df[df[,"dfree"]==1,])/nrow(df[df[,"dfree"]==0,])) ) when creating the y-axis. Yes, the graph looks similar, but I wonder if we can create an exact copy of that? Thanks. One more thing, when using logit, some of the logit value in the data.frame is -Inf and Inf , which is not allowed in smooth.spline . edit 02 I have further question concerning my edit: What if I manually dropped all Inf and -Inf in my data.frame and do smooth.spline on that data.frame? Is it appropriate?
