Java ME is something of an "embedded" environment, meaning amongst other things that there is generally not as much memory to run in or storage space. At one time there were application size limits. What this means is that instead of trying to dump big, fat, J2SE jars into a device with limited capabilities, perhaps you should try rethinking what you are trying to accomplish. Also consider that the version of Java that mobile phones run is fairly limited, so many 'regular' Java applications and libraries will not work there. You can include jars in your applications, by taking their contents and dumping them in the jar you create. In other words, you have to think differently about Java ME - it's not the bloated world that most Java stuff inhabits.
