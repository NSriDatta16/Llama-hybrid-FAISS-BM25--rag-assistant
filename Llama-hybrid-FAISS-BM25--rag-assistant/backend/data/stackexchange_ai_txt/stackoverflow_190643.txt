Has anyone used (or considered using) Sql Server Compact Edition?

I've been preparing to deliver a presentation on SQL Server Compact Edition 3.5 (SP1 - recently released) and I was wondering if anyone had designed (or contemplated designing) a system with SQL Server CE 3.5 (or earlier versions)? In particular, has anyone thought of (or experienced) using SQLCE as a solution for offline data storage (as part of a connected system design)? Version 3.5 looks to be pretty feature rich compared to its predecessors, is it ready for serious consideration (now that it supports LINQ to SQL, identity columns and an assortment of important T-SQL)? Would you consider using it if you had the need for a lightweight low-footprint file based database (especially if it needed to be supported on mobile devices and desktop systems), or are there better options?
