See the Wikipedia page , or a statistics textbook. The equation obtained in logistic regression is for a function of the probability, the log-odds (logit), not the probability itself. Other so-called "link" functions are possible in related generalized linear models, however, so check the manual for your statistics program to be sure you are doing standard logistic regression based on the logit.
