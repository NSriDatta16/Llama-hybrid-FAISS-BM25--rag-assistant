Most of the information in a logistic regression comes from the cases in the lower-prevalence category. Thus the "rule of thumb" for avoiding overfitting in a logistic regression is to have 10-20 lower-prevalence cases per model parameter evaluated. Under that "rule of thumb" you are on the low end of the range, but OK. That's unlike ordinary least squares, where the corresponding rule of thumb is for the total number of cases. I'm not familiar with your "rule of thumb" about 4/N for Cook's distance. If that comes from ordinary least squares, it's possible that in the logistic-regression context the N should be the number of cases in the lower-prevalence category rather than the total number of cases. That would give you a "rule of thumb" for excess influence of 0.016, with all of your cases less than half that level. Instead of relying on rules of thumb and diagnostic plots, let the data tell you how reliable your modeing process is. Repeat your modeling process on multiple bootstrapped samples of the data, examine the variance of your coefficient estimates among the multiple models (for inference), and evaluate how well the models work on the full data set. Under the bootstrap principle , that's a good way to estimate how well your model would work if applied to a new data sample.
