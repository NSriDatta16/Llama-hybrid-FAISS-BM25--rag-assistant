Sklearn Random Forest feature importance error bars

I'm plotting my RF feature importance using the method shown here . Where the error bars in the plot are defined by: std = np.std([tree.feature_importances_ for tree in forest.estimators_], axis=0) However, the resulting error bars are huge, and even range into the negative range. I'm not quite sure what my interpretation of this should be? . Does this mean that the inter-tree variation of this variable's importance is huge, and if so does that mean that the variable is in fact not a great predictor of the target variable?
