Do you by chance have this Firefox extension installed? http://www.teslacore.it/wiki/index.php?title=DragDropUpload I would be surprised if there is a solution without having to install an external plugin or extension. As someone mentioned that would be a security issue. A web site would be able to grab files from people's computers and upload them without their knowledge.
