So, what's the relationship between MLE and Baumâ€“Welch algorithm? Expectation maximization(EM) algorithm is more general and Baum-Welch algorithm is simply an instantiation of it, and EM is an iterative algorithm for maximum likelihood(ML). Then Baum-Welch algorithm is also an iterative algorithm for maximum likelihood. There normally are three optimization algorithms for maximum likelihood estimation(a frequentist approach): 1) gradient descent; 2) Markov Chain Monte Carlo; 3) expectation maximization.
