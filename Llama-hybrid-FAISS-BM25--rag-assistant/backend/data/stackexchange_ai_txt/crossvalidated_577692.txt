The original target variable (a stock price) is most likely unpredictable as it is roughly a random walk (RW) â€“ unless you have some weird stock, that is. By using moving-average smoothing on it, you are introducing predictability. The predictability is entirely an artefact of smoothing.* Thus, if you find that you are able to predict your smoothed target variable, you should not conclude that you are able to predict the underlying stock price. It is also not obvious for me why you would be interested in predicting a smoothed variable rather than the actual one. *You can check that by simulating a random walk and then smoothing it. Look at the autocorrelation function (ACF) of the increments of the original RW and the smoothed RW. You will see the former shows no predictability while the latter shows some (perhaps even considerable) predictability, depending on exactly what kind of moving average you have used for smoothing.
