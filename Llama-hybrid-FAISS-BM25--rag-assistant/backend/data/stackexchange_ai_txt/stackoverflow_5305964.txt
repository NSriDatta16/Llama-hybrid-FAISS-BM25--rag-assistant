How to get Application to Extension Mappings

I have an application that allows users to save files to Isolated Storage. The application will display all files, in similar fashion to the file explorer and will allow a user to double click the file in order to view it. Is there a way to grab all application-to-extension mappings from windows and fire up the right application whenever a file is clicked? This of course will be based on the extension of the file.... Thanks, Martin
