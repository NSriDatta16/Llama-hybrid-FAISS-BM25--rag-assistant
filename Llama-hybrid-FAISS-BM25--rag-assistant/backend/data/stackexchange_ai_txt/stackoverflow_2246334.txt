embedding an excel document in an intranet browser, and navigate to a sheet

It would make my user's lives much easier if I could do the following; Allow an Excel document to be viewed (not edited) in Internet Explorer 8 Facilitate jumping to particular sheets in that document I can embed the Excel file using an iframe which works, but I am utterly stuck when it comes to jumping to a particular named worksheet in that document. Is this possible? I'm thinking either some way to force the document to show a particular worksheet first, via the src attribute, or controlling the embeded doc via javascript.
