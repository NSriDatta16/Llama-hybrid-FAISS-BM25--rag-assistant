Highly customizable Listview for .Net?

do you guys know a .net ListView-Replacement which can be highly customized? I am developing an app which is similar to a "todo" list. I want to be able to customize almost every visual detail of the list so I get something like this: I want also to be able to reorder items by mouse + I need drag&drop. If you don't know any ListView, maybe you know how I could make my own listview like this one from scratch? Thanks for your ideas!
