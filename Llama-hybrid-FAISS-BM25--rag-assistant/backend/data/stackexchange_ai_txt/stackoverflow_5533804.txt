http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/date-and-time-functions.html#function_timediff TIMEDIFF() returns a time value. However, when you perform any numeric maths on it, it turns into a numeric value that is useless (just mashing the digits from the time in textual form). work out how much time it took per message. So you really mean, time / message-count . The divisor should be the count. What you got is the inverse, which is messages that could be sent per unit time , which is seconds . In other words, what you calculated is how many messages could be sent per second, on average. SELECT COUNT(id) AS message_sent, TIMEDIFF(MAX(msg_sent_datetime), MIN(msg_sent_datetime)) AS total_time_taken, TIME_TO_SEC(TIMEDIFF(MAX(msg_sent_datetime), MIN(msg_sent_datetime)))/COUNT(id) AS time_per_message FROM sent_txts_none_action_child GROUP BY parent_id; The resultant time_per_message column is measured in seconds. Reference: TIME_TO_SEC()
