When you log into the backend of Wordpress and go to your permalinks section try hitting the save button again. Once the page refreshes saying it saved it, scroll to the bottom of the page and there should be a paragraph telling you what the .htaccess file should have in it. ( It is usally a grey or yellow background paragraph ) Copy that and paste it into your .htaccess file instead of what you have now. This should help add the correct rules. It usually looks like this: RewriteEngine On RewriteBase / RewriteRule ^index\.php$ - [L] RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d RewriteRule . /index.php [L]
