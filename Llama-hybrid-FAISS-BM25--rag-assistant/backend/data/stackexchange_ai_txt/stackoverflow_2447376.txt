It turns out to be much simpler than you'd expect. Looking at the .trigger() method's documentation, no mention is made to the fact that one can also supply the original event as an argument and not just a string representation of the event type. Thus one can achieve delegated dragging more efficiently like so: $("ul#dynamiclist").delegate("li", "mousedown", function(event) { $(this).draggable({ helper: "clone", cursorAt: { left: 5, top: -5 }, cursor: "move", stop: function() { $(this).draggable("destroy"); } }); }); The ideal solution would have been for the UI library to have some method to perform this type of delegation natively for dynamic elements.... Note that this is applicable to jQuery 1.4.2 & jQuery UI 1.7.2
