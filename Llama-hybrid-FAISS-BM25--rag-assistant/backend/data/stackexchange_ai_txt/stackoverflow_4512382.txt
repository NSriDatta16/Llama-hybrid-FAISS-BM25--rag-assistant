CHARSET on column level in Mysql 5

My app has a table that has two columns needing utf8 and others are latin. Latin ones does not contain non-latin characters by definition and utf8 ones may or may not contain utf8 ones. One utf8 column is indexed and other is not. I have three questions: Is mixing charsets on a column level a good practice? If a row (on this table) contains only latin chars and no utf8 chars how are data storage and index size affected? Put another way, is a utf8 column data/index size same as latin without storing any utf8 text. Quantitively how are data and index storage affected on utf8 columns with respect to latin? Thanks
