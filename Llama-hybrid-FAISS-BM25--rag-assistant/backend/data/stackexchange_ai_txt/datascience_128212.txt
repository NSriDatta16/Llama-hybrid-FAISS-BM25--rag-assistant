In deep learning, during the training process, you typically monitor both the training and validation accuracy and loss to assess the performance of your model. Here's a brief explanation of each: Training Accuracy and Loss: Training Accuracy: This metric measures the percentage of correctly classified samples in the training dataset. It indicates how well the model is performing on the data it is being trained on. Training Loss: This metric represents a measure of how well the model is performing on the training data. It quantifies the difference between the predicted values and the actual values in the training dataset. The goal during training is to minimize this loss function. Validation Accuracy and Loss: Validation Accuracy: This metric measures the percentage of correctly classified samples in a separate validation dataset that the model hasn't seen during training. It provides an estimate of how well the model is generalizing to new, unseen data. Validation Loss: Similar to training loss, validation loss measures how well the model is performing on the validation dataset. It helps to identify overfitting or underfitting. Like training loss, the goal is to minimize this loss function, but its value might increase if the model starts overfitting to the training data. During the training process, these metrics are often plotted over epochs (iterations over the entire dataset) to visualize the performance of the model. Ideally, you want to see both training and validation accuracy increasing and both training and validation loss decreasing. If the training accuracy continues to increase while the validation accuracy stagnates or decreases, it might indicate overfitting. Similarly, if the training loss decreases while the validation loss increases, it might also indicate overfitting. Monitoring these metrics helps in tuning hyperparameters, selecting models, and understanding how well the model is learning from the data.
