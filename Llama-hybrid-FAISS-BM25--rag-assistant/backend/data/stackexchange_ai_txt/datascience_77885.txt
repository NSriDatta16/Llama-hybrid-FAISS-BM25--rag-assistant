Cable angle measurement (rotation)

I need to detect the rotation of a cable ( degree ) in the x-axis with high precision [0.2 (or more) degree detection] from its original state. Detailed description: I have a cable that is set in its original state. The system has rotated the cable in the x-axis. I want to know the degree the cable has been rotated from its original state. Example: There're following images for a specific cable in different rotation (angle) [0, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8]: 1) 2) 3) 4) [First image shows the initial state of the cable; the following three images show 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 rotation from its initial state respectively)]. Important facts: It is not possible to make pictures in better resolution. It is not possible to make pictures in better contrast. The cables may vary (different positions of the light strips on the cable). Can this problem be solved using computer vision, neural networks, or other methods/techniques?
