There are many ways to optimize performance and different databases handle data very different as well. SQL Server for example is protecting your data, it has to be sure the data is valid and on disk before it lets you know the insert has been succesfull. MySQL nor MongoDB is doing that, so they can be faster. So, what are you looking for? A RDBMS or some storage where you can afford it to loose some data?
