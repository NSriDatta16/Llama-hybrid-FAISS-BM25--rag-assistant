I'll keep it brief: Upgrade to the latest version (1.6.x). 1.5.x had speed optimizations as well. Make sure everyone is using the same version of TortoiseSVN which is built against the exact version of the server. We had many problems with guys updating on whim and then getting weird problems. Externals work between servers, repositories and folders on the same repo. So you can move the binaries to another repo/server altogether and just link to them with externals. Restructure the folders so that you can sparse checkout the project and still be able to work productively. Basically everyone checks out tops folder + children only then selectively "update to revision" the folders they need to checkout fully. Create scripts that export, build then commit (or prompt to commit). I have such scripts for my use. Before committing, I run the script and it exports my wc and then builds. NOTE: This will copy the full wc! So this is useful with sparse checkouts where the data size is small(er). Consider moving the binaries off of the repo (I don't recommend this, but it might be the sanest solution to get productivity up again). Remember, exporting doesn't create a wc, which means you save 50% disk space compared to checkouts. So if you restructure such that binaries and infrequently updated items may be exported instead of checkout, it would encourage more people to "get the full thing" and not try to skim some of it.
