Like most stages of the software development process its iteration works best. First find out who your users are -- the XYZ dept, Then find out where they fit into the organisation -- part of Z division, Then find out what they do in general terms -- manage cash Then in specific terms -- collect cash from tills, and check for till fraud. Then you can start talking to them. Ask what problem they want you want to solve -- you will get an answer like write a bamboozling system using OCR with shark technoligies. Ignore that answer and ask some more questions to find out what the real problem is -- they cant read the till slips to reconcile the cash. Agree a real solution with the users -- get a better ink ribbon supplier - or connect the electronic tills to the network and upload the logs to a central server. Then agree in detail how they will measure the success of the project. Then and only then propose and agree a detailed set of requirements.
