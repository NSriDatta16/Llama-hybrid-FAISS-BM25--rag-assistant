How to go about writing it Check how keyring handles the cross-platform issues (it's a python library which plugs into various autodetected keychain backends for storage) Growl isn't bundled with OSX you have to install it separately, OSX doesn't come with any built-in notification system. For unixes, you might want to hook into DBus as already mentioned (as a fallback, note that dbus might also be available in OSX), but both KDE and Gnome have Growl-like libraries. Respectively, KNotification for KDE and libnotify for Gnome. For windows, check out Snarl, fall back to notification bubbles if not available (using something along the lines of ToasterBox ) Do not ever even think of making notifications sticky. It's stupid, it's insensitive and it's freaking annoying. Also, due to people like you it's been made not available in most notification systems. Finally, even if there is no Python lib for any of these, you can probably use ctypes to access them.
