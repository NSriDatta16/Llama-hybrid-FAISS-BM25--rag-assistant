downcast and upcast

I am new to C# (and OOP ). When I have some code like the following: class Employee { // some code } class Manager : Employee { //some code } Question 1 : If I have other code that does this: Manager mgr = new Manager(); Employee emp = (Employee)mgr; Here Employee is a Manager , but when I cast it like that to an Employee it means I am upcasting it? Question 2 : When I have several Employee class objects and some but not all of them are Manager 's, how can I downcast them where possible?
