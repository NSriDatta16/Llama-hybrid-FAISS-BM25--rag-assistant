How to perform nonlinear regression on data with error?

Most of of physical measurements are associated with error, I am wondering how to perform nonlinear regression in this situation. In the linear case, there are few methods like Deming Regression, however, I have not seen any ref for nonlinear case. Just to put some context, assume we have a set of data $(y_i+ey_i,x_i+ex_i)$ where ex and ey are errors for our x and y measurements (not necessarily Gaussian). How do you take into account those error in the model? What is the best criteria to assess your model? Additionally, after you built your model, how do you predict for a given "x"? (I think you should take an average for prediction on [x-e,x+e] (e is error). I appreciate any reference.)
