The 5 number summary of the residuals that you see are the values that would be used to construct a boxplot . The residuals are not necessarily errors of the estimate, although you could think of them that way; it depends on what you are trying to estimate / predict. The value people typically use as a 'prediction' is $\hat y$. This is actually the predicted mean of the conditional distribution of $y$, that is $\mathcal N(\mu_Y|x_i, \sigma^2_\varepsilon)$. In this case, the residuals help you understand the rest of that conditional distribution (for example, its variance). Alternatively, you can use $\hat y$ as a point prediction for the value of a new observation when $X=x_i$. This is reasonable because, a-priori, the mean of a normal distribution is the single most likely point value to occur. However, you will nonetheless pretty much always be wrong. The distribution of your residuals can tell you how far off the value of a new observation will be on average from $\hat y$ (i.e., their SD). Residuals are also useful in helping you estimate properties of the sampling distributions of your sample statistics (specifically, your betas), and in diagnosing possible problems with your model. No matter how you think about / use your residuals, those values are simply a non-parametric summary of their distribution. (Note that the above discussion is generic, and is disregarding the fact that the model displayed in the question is a Poisson regression and the residuals displayed are deviance residuals.)
