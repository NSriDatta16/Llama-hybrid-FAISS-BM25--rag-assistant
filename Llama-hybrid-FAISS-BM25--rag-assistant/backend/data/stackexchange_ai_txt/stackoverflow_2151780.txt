Is multiple-producer, single-consumer possible in a lockfree setting?

I have a bunch of threads that are doing lots of communication with each other. I would prefer this be lock free. For each thread, I want to have a mailbox, where other threads can send it messages, (but only the owner can remove messages). This is a multiple-producer single-consumer situation. is it possible for me to do this in a lockfree / high performance matter? (This is in the inner loop of a gigantic simulation.)
