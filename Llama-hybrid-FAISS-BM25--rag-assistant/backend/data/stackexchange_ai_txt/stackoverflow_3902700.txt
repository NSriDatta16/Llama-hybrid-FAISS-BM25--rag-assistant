The meta tags are not sufficient. You need to add them as fullworthy response headers. The webbrowser relies on them. A Filter is helpful in this. Also, the Cache-Control header is incomplete (won't work as expected in Firefox, among others). Implement this in the doFilter() method of a Filter which is mapped on an url-pattern of for example *.jsp (if you want to cover all JSP pages). HttpServletResponse res = (HttpServletResponse) response; res.setHeader("Cache-Control", "no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate"); // HTTP 1.1. res.setHeader("Pragma", "no-cache"); // HTTP 1.0. res.setDateHeader("Expires", 0); // Proxies. chain.doFilter(request, response); This way the webbrowser will be forced to fire a real request on the server rather than displaying the page from the browser cache. Also, you should rather be using a Filter to check the presence of the logged-in user, not JSP/JSTL.
