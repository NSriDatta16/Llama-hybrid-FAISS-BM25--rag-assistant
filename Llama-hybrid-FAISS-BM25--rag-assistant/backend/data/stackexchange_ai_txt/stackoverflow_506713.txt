The company I worked at back in 2001 released a server product that implemented exactly the architecture you describe. We had very good success offloading the processing onto the clients. Furthermore, doing client detection using the HTTP user agent we were able to use the server side XSL processing to cater to very specific clients like Japanese cell phones. I think the sites/services/products that use this technique do it quite transparently to the clients. However, I think the trend lately is to do the processing server-side so that you do not have to rely nor test on the particular implementations of XSL for a variety of clients and you get support for some XSL extensions that you would not be able to use when supporting the vast majority of browsers. I know I'm not directly answering your question of naming some big name sites, but I hope I'm offering something of value to the problem. So, basically my point is that unless the performance saving of doing your template processing is more valuable than having to QA, support and development for three or four browsers without extensions, then you should stick with server-side processing.
