Some ideas to look into: I don't think cache is a valid Cache-Control directive. Try using a value of public instead, or private if that's more appropriate to your content. Check out RFC 2616 for more information. Perhaps you're sending more than one Cache-Control directive? Use a tool like Firebug or LiveHTTPHeaders to peek at the actual headers your browsers are receiving. Make sure they're not getting something you don't expect. It sounds like you might already be doing this though. Also make sure you're not also sending Pragma: no-cache . Try setting the Expires header in addition to using Cache-Control . It's also possible you're sending the browser conflicting Cache-Control / Pragma headers and IE chooses to take the Pragma headers as first priority for whatever backwards reason. Make sure IE is configured to allow caching! :) Control Panel > Internet Options > Temporary Internet Files > Settings > Check for newer versions of stored pages Try sending the PDF as a response to a POST request (via form submit). IE is allowing a cache to take place regardless of the headers in the response due to this requirement from RFC 2616 : "By default, a response is cacheable if the requirements of the request method, request header fields, and the response status indicate that it is cacheable." Responses to POST requests are NOT cacheable, so IE shouldn't include that header in it's request. Try sending the Content-MD5 and Last-Modified headers with consistent values (if they're not already being sent). This might help convince IE that the content of the PDF has not changed. I don't think this solution will work, because IE is obviously stubborn, but it's worth mentioning.
