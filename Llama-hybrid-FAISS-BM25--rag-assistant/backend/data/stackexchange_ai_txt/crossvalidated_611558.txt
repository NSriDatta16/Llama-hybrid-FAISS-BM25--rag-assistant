"The grey bars to the right of each panel show the relative scales of the components. Each grey bar represents the same length but because the plots are on different scales, the bars vary in size." Ref: https://otexts.com/fpp2/components.html , second paragraph below Figure 6.2. Below, I've scaled down the graph of the remainder component (in pink) so the scale bar is the same size as the scale bar of the data and overlaid it on the data. Now the bars are the same size, you can clearly see how the remainder component relates to the data. If you look at the seasonal component, you can see the bar is longer than that of the remainder component so the remainder component would have to be scaled up if it were overlaid on the seasonal component.
