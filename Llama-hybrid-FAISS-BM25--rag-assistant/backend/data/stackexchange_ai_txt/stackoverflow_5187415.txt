The sandboxing model for applications on the phone means that, 3rd party, applications can't run in the background, can only access IsolatedStorage not a shared file system, and can't directly interact with user data or phone functionality. Details of the account the application is running as cannot be accessed. You can't even get details of the owner of the phone.
