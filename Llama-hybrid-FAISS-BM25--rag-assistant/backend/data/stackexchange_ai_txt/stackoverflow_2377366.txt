Well, in PHP 5 $HTTP_SESSION_VARS is kept for compatibility reasons only. You are strongly encouraged to use $_SESSION instead. From the PHP manual: $HTTP_SESSION_VARS contains the same initial information, but is not a superglobal. (Note > that $HTTP_SESSION_VARS and $_SESSION are different variables and that PHP handles them as such) EDIT You say you "already know that"!? What's your question then? $_SESSION is NOT an object, after all, it's an ARRAY, a superglobal variable. No methods, no members. You can access it's values like you would with any other array: $_SESSION['key'] . You could write your own Session class that wraps around PHP's session management. Use the session_set_save_handler method to bypass the built in session management and implement your own logic. Regards.
