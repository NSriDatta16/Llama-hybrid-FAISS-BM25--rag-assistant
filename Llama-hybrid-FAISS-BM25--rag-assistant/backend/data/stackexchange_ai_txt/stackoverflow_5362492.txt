There are a zillion books on this subject in any given bookstore (in fact, more books on Excel VBA than any other single technology in the average bookstore), but if you're looking for the definitive Excel VBA book, go with VBA and Macros for Microsoft Excel by Mr. Excel (disclaimer: I have no affiliation to that company whatsoever). You don't need to know a thing about .NET to work with VBA. Your C++/C experience won't really come in handy all that much, other than just knowing how to ensure you don't have lazy VBA code. Your classic VB experience is what will help the most - but just keep in mind that it's really understanding Excel's object model that will be the learning curve here. Once you really get into it, it is pretty straight-forward though.
