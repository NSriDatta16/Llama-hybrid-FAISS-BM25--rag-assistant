Transforming a NSString @"123" in an (short)array[] = {1, 2, 3}?

I can't imagine a "clean" or efficient method of doing this. I would like to transform a string of numbers like @"1234" into an array of shorts for a calculator pet project*. I think of getting substrings and then the intValue of the substring but it sounds cumbersome and overkill. Would there be a more elegant way of doing it? Thanks in advance! * I know that there are more efficient ways to do maths and plenty of C libraries do this but it's for my own education :-).
