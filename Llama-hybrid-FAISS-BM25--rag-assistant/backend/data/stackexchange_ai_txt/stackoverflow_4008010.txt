Why is creating Servlets in Eclipse breaking my web.xml?

Being somewhat lazy, I was rather happy to find that I could create a new servlet source code by going New -> Servlet, instead of going New -> Class and then editing the class into a servlet. However, I have discovered that every time I create a new servlet in Eclipse, Eclipse modifies my web.xml. Specifically, it modifies the top element to: (Linebreaks mine.) This doesn't seem necessarily bad, but then it modifies various sub-elements by putting "javaee:" in front of their name, to indicate that these elements belong in that namespace. For example, it changes ShowLifecycles to ShowLifecycles After which eclipse then complains about all the elements it modified, giving me notations like: cvc-complex-type.2.4.a: Invalid content was found starting with element 'javaee:display-name'. One of '{"http:// java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee":description, "http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee":display-name, "http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/ j2ee":icon, "http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee":distributable, "http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee":context-param, "http:// java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee":filter, "http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee":filter-mapping, "http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/ j2ee":listener, "http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee":servlet, "http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee":servlet-mapping, "http:// java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee":session-config, "http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee":mime-mapping, "http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/ j2ee":welcome-file-list, "http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee":error-page, "http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee":jsp-config, "http:// java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee":security-constraint, "http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee":login-config, "http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/ j2ee":security-role, "http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee":env-entry, "http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee":ejb-ref, "http:// java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee":ejb-local-ref, "http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee":service-ref, "http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/ j2ee":resource-ref, "http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee":resource-env-ref, "http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee":message- destination-ref, "http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee":message-destination, "http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee":locale- encoding-mapping-list}' is expected. To make matters worse, when I use find and replace to delete all to "javaee:" which litters the file, Eclipse still complains about these even though they are no longer there. I must copy and paste the entire remaining file on top of itself to make these complaints go away. I am sure Eclipse is trying to be useful, anticipating some desire or need for this namespace. How can I do either one of two things: Make it stop doing this? Take advantage of whatever it is trying to do, and make it work for me instead of against me?
