Easier way to copy the path to a file or directory to the clipboard in visual studio?

To accomplish this I've been right-clicking the file or directory and then selecting Show in Windows Explorer, and then copying the path out of the address bar. Is there an add-on or macro that can make this task easier? I'm aware that you can drag a file from Solution Explorer into the editor and it will write out the path, but when doing web development I don't always want the server path, sometimes I want the local path.
