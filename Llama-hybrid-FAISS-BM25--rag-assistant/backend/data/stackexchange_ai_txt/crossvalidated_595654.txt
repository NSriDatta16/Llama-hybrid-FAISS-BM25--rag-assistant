Survival analysis allows for individuals who are lost to follow up or haven't yet finished 5 years of observation to provide data. It also provides information about time-to-event that a simple logistic regression can't provide. That said, such data are sometimes evaluated with a set of logistic regressions over a set of defined time intervals (e.g., each year out to 5 years). That's discrete-time survival analysis, which does provide information about time-to-event (at a coarse time scale) and incorporates some information from those lost to follow up or not yet ruching 5 years.
