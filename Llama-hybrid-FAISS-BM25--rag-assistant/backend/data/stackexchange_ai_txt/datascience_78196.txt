Train model for predicting events based on other signal events

I am trying to build a supervised ML-Model in the area of predictive Maintenance where the features are signal events , which can be represented with a gantt chart: So my feature data consists of events with signal_code (each row in the gantt chart represents all events of a certain signal code), startTime , endTime , status (represented as the color in the chart). There can be up to a few hundred different signal codes. I want to predict the likelyhood of an event (e.g. dark red in chart) say 30 minutes before it occures. How could I detect "malicious" patterns prior to those events? Are there existing best practices for a use case like that? I could find a lot information on time series ( related question ) but not for this kind of data. Obviously i will ne to apply some dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA or LDA, but what will a do beforehand in order to put the data into a one-dimensional representation? I welcome any advice on which algorithms or feature extraction methods might help! :)
