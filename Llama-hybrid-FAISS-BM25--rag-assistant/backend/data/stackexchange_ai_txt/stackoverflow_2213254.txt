Here is a good beginner's tutorial for mod_python. As far as I understand your question you have a mod_python-based script and you want to read a POST parameter. Therefore you only have to use the form object which is automatically provided by mod_python: myparameter = form.getfirst("name_of_the_post_parameter") You can find the documentation over here . Note that this solution is when your server is configured with PythonHandler mod_python.psp which will allow you to use "Python Server Pages" (special tags, automatically created variables like form , ...). If you're writing a normal mod_python handler , then it would look something like that: from mod_python import util def handler(req): form = util.FieldStorage(req, keep_blank_values=1) myparameter = form.getfirst("name_of_the_post_parameter") ...other stuff...
