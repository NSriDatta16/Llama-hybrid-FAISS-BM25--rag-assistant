Ruby RubyScript2Exe RubyScript2Exe transforms your Ruby application into a standalone, compressed Windows, Linux or Mac OS X (Darwin) executable. There's also a decent blog post about it Another possible option is the Shoes GUI framework , which can create Widows, Linux and OS X executables from your Shoes application. Python py2exe py2exe is a Python Distutils extension which converts Python scripts into executable Windows programs, able to run without requiring a Python installation. py2exe is used by BitTorrent, SpamBayes, and thousands more PHP Bambalam PHP EXE Compiler/Embedder Bambalam PHP EXE Compiler/Embedder is a free command line tool to convert PHP applications to standalone Windows .exe applications. The exe files produced are totally standalone, no need for php dlls etc. and is it possible to make it a Mac app easily too? Py2App py2app is a Python setuptools command which will allow you to make standalone application bundles and plugins from Python scripts. py2app is similar in purpose and design to py2exe for Windows. Also, there is a utility "Build Applet" included with the Developer Tools.. Drag-and-drop a Python script on to it and it becomes a .app . The utility is in /Developer/Applications/Utilities/MacPython 2.5/ Note , all of the above basically take your script, package it up along with a Python interpreter and any dependancies, and on launch run your script. If you use a GUI platform that does not work on Windows, running it through Py2EXE will not make it work! Also as Peter D mentioned, you need to be careful about dependancies - if your application requires a MySQL database, your users will have to install that separately to use your application, and every library you use will add size to your executables.
