Since what you want to do is to apply a pre-trained model and use the predictions on the client side, you have two options: Client-side application of the model: the extension would have to download the model file and store it, then it would need to compute the predictions from this model. This would probably require the SVM library used for the training to be available on the client side, this might be an issue. Server-side application of the model: the extension would have to upload the data to the server, then the server computes the predictions using the model, and sends the predictions back to the client. Usually option 1 is preferable since it doesn't require transfering the input data to the server and then sending back the predictions. It's also safer with respect to the user privacy, their data is not uploaded anywhere. However it requires the client to be able to compute the predictions, so probably requiring the SVM library to be installed and the extension must be able to communicate with it, so it might not be feasible.
