I would just do a regular bootstrap test: compute the t-statistic in your data and store it change the data such that the null-hypothesis is true. In this case, subtract the mean in group 1 for group 1 and add the overall mean, and do the same for group 2, that way the means in both group will be the overall mean. Take bootstrap samples from this dataset, probably in the order of 20,000. compute the t-statistic in each of these bootstrap samples. The distribution of these t-statistics is the bootstrap estimate of the sampling distribution of the t-statistic in your skewed data if the null-hypothesis is true. The proportion of bootstrap t-statistics that is larger than or equal to your observed t-statistic is your estimate of the $p$ -value. You can do a bit better by looking at $($ the number of bootstrap t-statistics that are larger than or equal to the observed t-statistic $+1)$ divided by $($ the number of bootstrap samples $+1)$ . However, the difference is going to be small when the number of bootstrap samples is large. You can read more on that in: Chapter 4 of A.C. Davison and D.V. Hinkley (1997) Bootstrap Methods and their Application . Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. Chapter 16 of Bradley Efron and Robert J. Tibshirani (1993) An Introduction to the Bootstrap .
