access numpy array from a functional language

My primary language is Python. Often when I need to do some cpu heavy task on a numpy array I use scipy.weave.inline to hook up c++ with great results. I suspect many of the algorithms (machine learning stuff) can however be written simpler in a functional language (scheme, haskell...). I was thinking. Is it possible to access numpy array data (read and write) from a functional language instead of having to use c++?
