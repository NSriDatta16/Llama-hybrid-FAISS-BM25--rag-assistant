Two phase commit isn't foolproof and is just designed to work in the 99% of the time cases. "The protocol assumes that there is stable storage at each node with a write-ahead log, that no node crashes forever, that the data in the write-ahead log is never lost or corrupted in a crash, and that any two nodes can communicate with each other." http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-phase_commit_protocol
