As the other comrades mentioned above, you have to use a composite-id, which is not a best but acceptable practice. On the other hand, you can simply write an update interceptor and make sure your Type = 1 within it. Here are some link about the topic to help you see clear in this. Elegant code : Implementing NHibernate Interceptors NHibernate Documentation : Interceptors Sample NHibernate IInterceptor implementation Enterprise .NET Community : NHibernate Part 2 (Scroll down to : Interceptors and Persistent Lifecycle ) NHibernate Interceptor Auditing Inserted Object Id (SO question) The main advantage of using interceptors over a composite key is that it doesn't break your DBRM and provides a definitely more flexible solution, without "polluting" your mapping file which will more precisely represent your model.
