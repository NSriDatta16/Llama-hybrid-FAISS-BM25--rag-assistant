Saving images in a HashMap Android

is it possible to save images from the MediaStore, based on a certain user action, in a key/value pair using Hashmap. what i mean is, if the app gets restarted, does the Hashmap retain the contents or would i have to perform the action again. what other solutions can i use to save the images for fast retrieval?.. shared Preferences or sqlite database, but i am assuming the latter might just be a waste. Hope i am clear on this. Thank you.
