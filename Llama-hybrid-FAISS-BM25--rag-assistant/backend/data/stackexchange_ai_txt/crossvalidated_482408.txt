You can force Stata to exclude an intercept with using ibn. prefix for the id variable (no base level) using noconstant option This means that everyone gets their own FEs and no one is dropped. If you had other categorical variable in your model, this becomes impossible. The alternative is that the omitted individual gets the intercept as his FE, and everyone else gets the intercept plus their own FE. This is what Stata will do by default. It does not matter whom you drop. The dummy variable coefficients will change, but not the actual value of the FE. The other coefficients should stay the same. The FEs are unbiased, but they are inconsistent, so don't take them too seriously at unit level. Their sample average, however, is a consistent estimator of the mean of the population distribution of heterogeneity. If you want to do a regression with the estimated FEs as the outcome, you can think of that regression as calculating a conditional mean, which may be OK.
