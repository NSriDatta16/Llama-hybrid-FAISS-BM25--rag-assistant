Some hints to help you through this: First, let's simplify the notation, letting $A$ stand for the 'sample mean' and abbreviating $Z_{obs}$ as just $Z.$ Then the main equation can be written as: $$Z = \frac{A -\mu_0}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}} = \frac{1}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}(A - \mu_0) = \frac{\sqrt{n}}{\sigma}A - \frac{\sqrt{n}}{\sigma}\mu_0.$$ Now, for the next step, you should know that $\mu_A = \mu_0$ and $\sigma_A^2 = \sigma^2/n.$ (A sample mean has the same mean as the population and the variance of the population divided by the sample size. You must have seen something like that recently.) Next, we're ready to find the mean and variance of $Z;:$ The mean of $Z$ is $\frac{\sqrt{n}}{\sigma}\mu_A - \frac{\sqrt{n}}{\sigma}\mu_0.$ (In your first paragraph, let $a = \frac{\sqrt{n}}{\sigma}$ and $b = -\frac{\sqrt{n}}{\sigma}.)$ So the mean of $Z$ simplifies to $0$ because $\mu_A = \mu_0.$ The variance of $Z$ is $\frac{n}{\sigma^2}\sigma_A^2.$ (From your first paragraph, the variance has only one term and $a$ gets squared.) So the variance of $Z$ simplifies t0 $1$ because $\sigma_A^2 = \sigma^2/n.$ Finally, we've shown that the mean of $Z$ is $0$ and the variance of $Z$ is 1. Also, because $A$ has a normal distribution and we have made a linear transformation of $A$ to get $Z,$ we know that $Z$ also has a normal distribution. So your final answer is that $Z$ has a normal distribution with mean $0$ and variance $1.$ That may seem like a long explanation to get the the end. Just take one step at a time, looking back in your text or class notes to help with each piece. I think there are two reasons for giving you this problem. One is to put these pieces together. The other is that it turns out to be very important to know that $Z$ has a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 1.
