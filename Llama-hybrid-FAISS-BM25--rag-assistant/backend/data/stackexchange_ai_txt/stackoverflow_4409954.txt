Depending on the size of your project it will save you compile time and make it possible to know all ressources etc. (unless you put everything into one single file). The better your header files are organized the less work your compiler has to do to apply changes. Also looking in a small header file to look up some forgotten parameter information is a lot easier than scrolling through a hole cpp file.
