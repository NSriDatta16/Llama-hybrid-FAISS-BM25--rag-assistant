Please see this documentation http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/uikit/reference/UIResponder_Class/Reference/Reference.html You can use touchesBegan, touchesMoved, and touchesEnded methods to find the start/end positions of the swipe. By finding the delta between the start and the end, you can get the swipe length. Maybe something like this. - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; gestureStartPoint = [touch locationInView:self.view]; } - (void)touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; CGPoint gestureEndPoint = [touch locationInView:self.view]; // compare gestureStartPoint and gestureEndPoint to determine swipe length }
