SVM low accuracy but significant p value

I'm also new at doing SVM... We have a data set of about 50 (25 in each group). We are trying to identify babies at a high risk of developing a disorder from babies that are low risk for developing a disorder. When I run SVM (LOOCV, linear kernal, ttest filtering), I'm getting really low accuracy levels (i.e. 24% in one case), but with statistically significant p-values. Can anyone help me understand why this is happening/what this could mean? Thanks!
