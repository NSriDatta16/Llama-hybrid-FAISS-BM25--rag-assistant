I agree with both Jaykul and Keith Hill - the answer is yes. There are several approaches you could use. But in general, I'd recommend you a) create key cmdlets as part of the UI for your app and b) you build the GUI on top of PowerShell (in the same way the Exchange team has done. Doing this follows Microsoft's lead (all applications have to have a PowerShell interface) that is also being taken up by others (e.g. VMware, and even Symantec leverage PowerShell in their applications. Creating cmdlets (and possibly a provider) is pretty straightforward - there's a great cmdlet designer recently released (see http://blogs.msdn.com/powershell/archive/2009/10/16/announcing-open-source-powershell-cmdlet-and-help-designer.aspx ) for this tool. Hope this helps!
