use the shell a lot, type "[prog-name] --help" a lot, type "man [prog-name]" a lot, and make notes on what works and what does not -- even if those notes seem obvious at the time. By tomorrow, they might not be so obvious, again. OTOH, in a couple of weeks they definitely should be! Have a gander at some of the many books on working with shells, like From Bash to Z Shell (which covers Bash and Z), slog through a shell-scripting tutorial , or Gnu's Bash manual.
