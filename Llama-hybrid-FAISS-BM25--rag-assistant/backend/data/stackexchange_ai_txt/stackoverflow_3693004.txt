How do you organize your code?

I'm not referring to the indentation or the directory structure but the actual file itself. Do you arrange your members and methods alphabetically? Maybe in their order of use or order of complex logic (either ascending or descending)? Is there any rhyme to your madness? I'm thinking about making the switch to alphabetically but some situations would just madden me: var _height var _properties var _width width and height should definitely be grouped together... but sometimes finding the right method in a larger file can be pretty disheartening. What do you do?
