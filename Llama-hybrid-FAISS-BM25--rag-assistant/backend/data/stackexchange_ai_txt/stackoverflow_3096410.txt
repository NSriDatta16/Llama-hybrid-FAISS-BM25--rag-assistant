MySQL supports a storage engine called "MEMORY", which you can configure in your database config ( settings.py ) as such: 'USER': 'root', # Not used with sqlite3. 'PASSWORD': '', # Not used with sqlite3. 'OPTIONS': { "init_command": "SET storage_engine=MEMORY", } Note that the MEMORY storage engine doesn't support blob / text columns, so if you're using django.db.models.TextField this won't work for you.
