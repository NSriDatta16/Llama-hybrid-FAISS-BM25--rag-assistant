How to select and highlight a window in another application?

I would like to send some keystrokes from a C++ program into another window. For that reason I would like to have the user select the target window similar to how it is done in the Spy++ utility that comes with Visual Studio (drag a crosshair cursor over target window and have target window highlighted by a frame). How is this dragging and selecting done in Windows? I am completely lost as to where I might start to look for a mechanism to implement this feature.
