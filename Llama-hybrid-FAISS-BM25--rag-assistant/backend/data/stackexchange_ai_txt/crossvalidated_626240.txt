Using both discrete and continuous moves in Metropolis-Hastings

I want to sample a continuous distribution $f$ using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Can I define my transition kernel as being sometimes discrete and sometimes continuous as long as I use the correct acceptance probability? I'm trying to make sense of continuous-state Markov chain theory so I apologize if I'm being confusing. For example, suppose $f$ is a standard normal distribution. Now suppose that 1) with probability $r$ I perform a random walk with a standard normal kernel $q$ and 2) with probability $1-r$ I perform $x\mapsto -x$ . The acceptance probability for 1) would be $$ \alpha(x, y) = \min\left(1,\ \frac{f(y)rq(y, x)}{f(x)rq(x, y)} \right), $$ where $y$ is the proposal, and the acceptance probability for 2) would be $$ \alpha(x, -x) = \min\left(1, \frac{f(-x)(1-r)}{f(x)(1-r)} \right). $$ How to properly define this Markov chain's transition probabilities (e.g. Can I use a Dirac measure for $x\mapsto -x$ ? Can I work with densities or in order to mix Lebesgue and discrete measures I should work directly with the transition kernel measure? In that case, what would the detailed balanced equation look like?) Is it ok that $q$ could technically (in a numerical simulation) propose $x\mapsto -x$ ? Normally, each move which result in the proposal should be summed in the acceptance probability. In that case however, I'm thinking that $-x$ has measure $0$ and both moves have essentially "disjoint proposal sets". Is this a valid Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, meaning that the stationary distribution is $f$ ? I feel like it should work as long as the continuous part of the proposal makes the chain irreducible.
