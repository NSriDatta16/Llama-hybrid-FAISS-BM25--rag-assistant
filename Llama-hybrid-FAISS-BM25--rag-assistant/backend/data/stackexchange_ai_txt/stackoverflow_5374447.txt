How to do queries on hdf5 time series

i store (non equidistant) time series as tables in hdf5 files using the H5TB API. The format is like this: time channel1 channel2 0.0 x x 1.0 x x 2.0 x x There are also insertions of "detail data" like this: time channel1 channel2 0.0 x x 1.0 x x 1.2 x x 1.4 x x 1.6 x x 1.8 x x 2.0 x x Now I want to store the data in another data format and therefore I like to "query" the hdf5 file like this: select ch1 where time > 1.6 && time I thought of several ways to do this query: There is a built in feature called B-Tree Index. Is it possible to use this for indexing the data? I need to do a binary search on the time channel and then read the channel values I create an index myself (and update it whenever there is a detail insertion). What would be the best algorithm to use here? The main motivation for an index would be to have fast query responses. What would you suggest here?
