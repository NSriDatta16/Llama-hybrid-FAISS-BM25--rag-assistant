I've been thinking about something similar recently. The best method I could come up with was to have several 'zones' on the page where items would be placed. In my case these were 3 columns. I gave each an identifier and used an Ajax call every time a block was moved to a different position to update the new position of that block. For example, a sample database table: tbl.blocks: userid | blockid | column | placement 1 | 2 | 1 | 3 Where column is a simple column identifier and placement is the placement within that column. I used a query at page load that loaded the blocks in order of placement, and then wrote them in. blockid refers to a table of blocks. Here's a tutorial I found that looks relevant: http://aymanh.com/drag-drop-portal-interface-with-scriptaculous
