Scaling equation for map so that scaling keeps user select center - Flash

ingredients: - one vector map - one masked viewing area - one slider taking the map from 100% to 600% - map is draggable - map movieclip center is the top left of the movieclip Let's say you zoom in, you drag the map so that the bottom right quadrant is in the viewing area, then you zoom out. The problem: Because the "center" of the map is the top left corner of the movie clip, scaling happens from that point. How can I keep the center point (while scaling) as the point which is centered on the view area?
