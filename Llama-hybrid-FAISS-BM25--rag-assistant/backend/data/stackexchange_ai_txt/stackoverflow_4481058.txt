Load and execute external js file in node.js with access to local variables?

Is it easy/possible to do a simple include('./path/to/file') type of command in node.js? All I want to do is have access to local variables and run a script. How do people typically organize node.js projects that are bigger than a simple hello world? (A fully functional dynamic website) For example I'd like to have directories like: /models /views ... etc
