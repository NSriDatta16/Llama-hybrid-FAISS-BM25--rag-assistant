It sounds like you need some authentication mechanism between the client and the server. How to best accomplish this will depend on the client technology. If you use ASP.NET you could consider one of the ASP.NET authentication mechanisms (e.g. forms authentication). Please check out something like: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/eeyk640h.aspx . This handles session state in e.g. a cookie or by appending url info. An other and perhaps more cool solution is to use OpenAuth which makes it possible for users to authenticate with their existing e.g. google/twitter accounts or similar. Please check out http://www.dotnetopenauth.net/ . I would not recommend writing your own authentication mechanism, but encourage you to use one of the existing frameworks.
