Alex Graves' way for handwriting synthesis with RNN + soft window?

In Section 5 of the paper "Generating Sequences With Recurrent Neural Network" , Alex Graves introduces a method to synthesize handwriting with given texts ( A demo ). To enforce the handwriting be exactly the characters of the input texts, a "soft window" is applied to RNN. My question is how does this "soft window" work? I don't quite understand the technical details in that paper (but I can understand all those things about RNN, LSTM and the pure, unconstrained handwriting prediction with RNN as described in Section 1 - 4). Any further explanations are welcome!
