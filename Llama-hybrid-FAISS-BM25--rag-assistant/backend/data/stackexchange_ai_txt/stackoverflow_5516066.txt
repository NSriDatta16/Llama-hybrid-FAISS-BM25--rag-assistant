How to display icons without alteration in an ImageButton/ImageView?

in my app, I have buttons with icons. The icons are provided as PNG images in the three densities in drawable-ldpi-v4/, drawable/ and drawable-hdpi-v4/. Here's a sample: Each icon is displayed in an ImageButton: Where the Shortcut style is: 65dp 45dp center @drawable/shortcut_background However, on certain devices/platform versions, certain icons get altered, blurred or something. I'm not sure that it's scaling, it's more like a rendering bug I think. I have tried to disable anti aliasing on the BitmapDrawable, but that didn't help. As shown on the image below, on Android 2.1 LDPI, one icon gets broken/cropped, and on both Android 1.6 MDPI and Android 2.1 HDPI an extra line seems to be randomly added at the bottom of the icon (look closely). In the manifest, I have an empty as recommended in the docs about supporting multiple screens in legacy apps . Adding anyDensity="true" doesn't help. Apparently, as of Froyo, things get better as you can see on the image above. But how can I solve this on Android
