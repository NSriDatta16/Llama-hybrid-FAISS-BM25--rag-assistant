You can use a Bayesian approach. If you have no votes at all then a na√Øve rating for an item would be based on the distribution of ratings/votes among all the items. That would be the prior distribution for the rating Then with more data/votes for the item you can update your estimate about the true distribution of ratings/votes for an item and compute an estimate for the rating. So you have observations of votes that are categorical $1,2,3,4,5$ . You could describe the prior for this by a Dirichlet distribution (whose parameters are estimated based on the items that you already know). Then the posterior will also be a Dirichlet distribution (since the Dirichlet distribution is the conjugate prior).
