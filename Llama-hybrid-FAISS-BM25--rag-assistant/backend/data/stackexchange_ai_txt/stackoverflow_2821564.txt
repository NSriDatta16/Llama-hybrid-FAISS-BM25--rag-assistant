PHP: I got hacked

I just checked my site it suddenly jumps me to this site: xxxp://www1.re*******3.net/?p=p52dcWpkbG6HjsbIo216h3de0KCfaFbVoKDb2YmHWJjOxaCbkXp%2FWqyopHaYXsiaY2eRaGNpnFPVpJHaotahiaJ0WKrO1c%2Beb1qfnaSZdV%2FXlsndblaWpG9plmGQYWCcW5eakWppWKjKx6ChpqipbmdjpKjEjtDOoKOhY56n1pLWn1%2FZodXN02BdpqmikpVwZWpxZGxpcV%2FVoJajYmJkZ2hwlGGXaVbJkKC0q1eum5qimZxx I found out that in the first line of my index.php file, that looks like this: How do I stop this? thanks! UPDATE: What kind of attack is this? is this really xss? No one really knows about my ftp password.
