I want to make a Google App Engine application; have a decent JavaSE/Swing + Javascript/(X)HTML + relational database (SQL) background

Can you refer me to a good starting place for learning GAE from what I already know? I plan to make a fairly elaborate application, and I'm not completely certain on where to start or how far I'll need to go (JavaEE?). I'd rather hear from someone who already knows what's involved than start off by guessing and stumbling.
