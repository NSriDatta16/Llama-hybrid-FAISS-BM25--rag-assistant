Can a ARIMA(0,0,0) model be stationary?

I have a time series of a stock and use its log differenced daily returns. I have conducted an ADF test for a presence of unit roots, a KPSS test as well and both confirms stationarity in the time series. However, when I use auto.arima or conduct a matrix letting BIC select number of terms, I get a ARIMA(0,0,0) model (when I let AIC select terms I get an ARIMA(1,0,2)). From what I have read an ARIMA(0,0,0) model can be interpreted as white noise and random walk. But can a random walk be stationary on variance? . I have attached a picture from a book, where it says that it can't be stationary. What can be a possible reason for the fact that my series seems to be stationary, but that the function still suggests ARIMA(0,0,0)? enter code here
