I would recommend you to use Dice loss when faced with class imbalanced datasets, which is common in the medicine domain, for example. Also, Dice loss was introduced in the paper "V-Net: Fully Convolutional Neural Networks for Volumetric Medical Image Segmentation" and in that work the authors state that Dice loss worked better than mutinomial logistic loss with sample re-weighting
