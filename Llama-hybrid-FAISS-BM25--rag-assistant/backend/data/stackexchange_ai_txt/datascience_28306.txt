Transform Categorical Variables into Numerical

I'm very new to machine learning approaches. I'm reading a tutorial for build a predictive model using random forests. One of the transformations implemented was transform categorical variables to binary. Imagine (short sample): Field_Desc Field_Value A 32 A 100 B 1 And then the developer pass this dataset into: Field_A1 Field_B1 Field_Value 1 0 32 1 0 100 0 1 1 What is the advantage to make this transformation for Random Forest Prediction? And for K-Means there will have any advantage? Thanks!
