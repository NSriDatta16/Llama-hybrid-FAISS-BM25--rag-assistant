Data augmentation or weighted loss function for imbalanced classes?

I have a CNN image classification problem with imbalanced classes. I could balance the dataset using data augmentation (Replication, mirror, etc.) on the minority classes. Also, imbalance could be handled using a weighted loss function that gives more importance to the minority classes. Is any of these methods preferred over the other and if so, why?
