Android: Lazy Image Loader causes Gallery to stutter

I'm using a lazy image loader, that sets an ImageView's bitmap. I can drag the gallery, and it drags smoothly until my images load in. Then while I'm dragging the gallery stutters, as if it's trying to recenter on the middle image and doesn't let me drag. I have to do a fling to get it to move and not recenter. Anyone else run into this issue?
