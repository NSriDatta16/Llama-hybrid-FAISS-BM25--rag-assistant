First thing I would say is that if you need a type to be an exact number of bits, then use a size specific type. Depending on your platform that could range from __s8 for a signed 8 bit type on Linux to __int8 in VC++ on Windows. Now, according to Robert Love in his chapter on portability in "Linux Kernel Development" he states that the C standard "leaves the size of the standard types up to implementations, although it does dictate a minimum size." Then in a footnote at the bottom of the page he says, "With the exception of char which is always 8 bits" Now I'm not sure what he's basing this on, but maybe it's this section from the ANSI C spec ? 2.2.4.2 Numerical limits A conforming implementation shall document all the limits specified in this section, which shall be specified in the headers limits.h and float.h "Sizes of integral types limits.h" The values given below shall be replaced by constant expressions suitable for use in #if preprocessing directives. Their implementation-defined values shall be equal or greater in magnitude (absolute value) to those shown, with the same sign. maximum number of bits for smallest object that is not a bit-field (byte) CHAR_BIT 8 minimum value for an object of type signed char SCHAR_MIN -127 maximum value for an object of type signed char SCHAR_MAX +127 maximum value for an object of type unsigned char UCHAR_MAX 255 minimum value for an object of type char CHAR_MIN see below maximum value for an object of type char CHAR_MAX see below maximum number of bytes in a multibyte character, for any supported locale MB_LEN_MAX 1 minimum value for an object of type short int SHRT_MIN -32767 maximum value for an object of type short int SHRT_MAX +32767 maximum value for an object of type unsigned short int USHRT_MAX 65535 minimum value for an object of type int INT_MIN -32767 maximum value for an object of type int INT_MAX +32767 maximum value for an object of type unsigned int UINT_MAX 65535 minimum value for an object of type long int LONG_MIN -2147483647 maximum value for an object of type long int LONG_MAX +2147483647 maximum value for an object of type unsigned long int ULONG_MAX 4294967295 If the value of an object of type char sign-extends when used in an expression, the value of CHAR_MIN shall be the same as that of SCHAR_MIN and the value of CHAR_MAX shall be the same as that of SCHAR_MAX . If the value of an object of type char does not sign-extend when used in an expression, the value of CHAR_MIN shall be 0 and the value of CHAR_MAX shall be the same as that of UCHAR_MAX ./7/
