Why I am getting bad result for the hypertuning parameters

I am trying to learn machine learning with 3 very common datasets ( Boston Housing Price , Red Wine Quality , and Bike ). I am using 3 ML models ( LinReg , Lasso , and Ridge ). The LinReg is the default of the Scikit-learn but for Lasso and Ridge, I am doing the hyper tuning. I have 3 accuracy metrics (MAE, MSE, R2). The overall accuracy is given below Dataset Model MAE MSE R2 House LinReg 2.96 19.60 0.74 House Lasso 4.58 47.44 0.39 House Ridge 5.39 65.25 0.16 Dataset Model MAE MSE R2 Wine LinReg 0.50 0.42 0.35 Wine Lasso 0.68 0.65 -0.0008 Wine Ridge 0.66 0.62 0.05 Dataset Model MAE MSE R2 Bike LinReg 106.56 20812.63 0.37 Bike Lasso 118.21 25732.92 0.23 Bike Ridge 136.31 31186.12 0.07 You can see, the MAE and MSE are always high for the Lasso and Ridge than the LinReg . Even, I am getting negative R2 for the Wine dataset and Lasso model. I did very basic data pre-processing and mostly not any feature engineering. As they are very basic datasets. I am using Optuna for hypertuning. At the time of hypertuning, I am doing 5 fold cross-validation , neg_mean_squared_error as scoring function and set direction="minimize" . For the Lasso and Ridge T am tuning only alpha and the ranges in between 1e-7, 1e2 . def lasso_objective(X_train, y_train, kfolds) -> Callable[[Trial], float]: def objective(trial: Trial) -> float: args: Dict = dict( alpha=trial.suggest_float("alpha", 1e-7, 1e2), ) estimator = Lasso(**args) scores = cross_validate( estimator, X=X_train, y=y_train, scoring="neg_mean_squared_error", cv=cv_method, n_jobs=-1 ) return float(np.mean(scores["test_score"])) return objective def tune(objective): study = optuna.create_study(direction="minimize") study.optimize(objective, n_trials=200) params = study.best_params best_score = study.best_value return params I am supposed to get better results for the Lasso and Ridge (as I am doing tuning here). Could you tell me why I am getting bad MAE and MSE for them? What should I do to get better results for them?
