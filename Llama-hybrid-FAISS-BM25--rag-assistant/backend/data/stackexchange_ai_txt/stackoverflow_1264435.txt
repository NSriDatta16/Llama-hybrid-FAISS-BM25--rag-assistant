Don't start off with the C statements and syntax. Start them with basic Boolean algebra, and then have them do a bunch of binary arithmetic by hand. Once they actually understand the math behind AND, XOR, NAND, etc, the programming syntax will be immediately understandable in any language. More importantly, they will be entirely familiar with useful transformations like de Morgan's laws, and other properties of bitwise algebra like transitivity that can be used to collapse long ops into shorter ones.
