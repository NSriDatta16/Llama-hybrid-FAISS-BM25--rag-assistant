How do we decide on how to fill missing values in data?

I have a data set with NA values in many predictor variables. How do we impute the best values ? I have 302 variables in total. Out of them 236 belong to some abstract category, 37 to other, 9 to other category. PS: I am solving the following regression problem from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/c/liberty-mutual-fire-peril
