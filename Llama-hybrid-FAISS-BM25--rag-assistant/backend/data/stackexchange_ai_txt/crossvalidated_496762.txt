Neural network to generate barcodes

I am working on a problem regarding barcodes. This is my first time using sequence models practically. Summarizing it: I have 681 32 character, case-insensitive, alphanumeric strings that are supposed to be code-128 barcodes. The strings appear to be random. I have to train a model using this data to produce 'n' unique, 32-character barcodes that follow the given data. Finally, use the generated codes to create Code-128 barcodes. This is all that I know about the problem. What I have done so far: Trained a text-generation LSTM model to generate text character-wise on all 681 given strings. The model's accuracy on the training data is 98%. Used the trained model to generate 1000 new codes that are unique (tested using pandas.DataFrame.duplicates()) Now, the confusions that I have: Does the 98% accuracy ensure the generated samples to be ~90% similar in pattern to the original codes? Is there any method to test it like some train/test split methods as used in CV, and the 98% metric looks like severe overfitting. How do I convert them to code-128 barcodes. Any links/forums will be very helpful. Let me know if more information is required.
