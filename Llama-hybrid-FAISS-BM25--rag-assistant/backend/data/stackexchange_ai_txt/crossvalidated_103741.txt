How to compute PCA scores from eigendecomposition of the covariance matrix?

Given a data matrix $\mathbf X$ of $12 \times 7$ size with samples in rows and variables in columns, I have calculated centered data $\mathbf X_c$ by subtracting column means, and then computed covariance matrix as $\frac{1}{N-1} \mathbf X_c^\top \mathbf X_c$. The dimensions of this covariance matrix are $7 \times 7$. After that I have calculated the eigenvalue decomposition, obtaining eigenvector matrix $\mathbf V$ with eigenvectors in columns. Now I want to know about projections (i.e. principal component scores in PCA): is it $\mathbf{V}^\top \mathbf{X}_c$ or $\mathbf{X}_c \mathbf{V}$? mean_matrix = X - repmat(mean(X),size(X,1),1); covariance = (transpose(mean_matrix) * mean_matrix)/(12-1); [V,D] = eig(covariance); [e,i] = sort(diag(D), 'descend'); V_sorted = V(:,i);
