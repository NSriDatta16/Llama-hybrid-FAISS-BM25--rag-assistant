Converted my comment into an answer, in the absence of another answer. That must be particular to NLP, but I see something like that most often being called an embedding. It's basically a function that takes a type of information (in this case, words) and translate it into something numerical that an ML algorithm can digest. Embedding functions are not trivial though, there's a lot of thought put into more complex ones. People don't like calling a bag-of-words an embedding due to its unrealistic assumptions and some confusion regarding embedding, but it really is a sentence embedding.
