Fiddler lets you capture traces from any executable running on your box. You should be able to just enable process level capture in Fiddler and get what you need. Look at the status bar down at the bottom... next to the capturing button. You can click on the Web Browsers button and change it to All Processes. You can also drag the Process Filter button that is on the top menu bar.
