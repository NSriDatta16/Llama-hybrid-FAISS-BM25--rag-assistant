What is wrong with this proposed Router for Vanity-URLs solution?

I recently posted a question about creating vanity URLs on my site and while I got many great answers, I am curious to see what was wrong with my original idea: Here is the problem: I currently have ugly URLs that look like this: http://www.hikingsanfrancisco.com/hiker_community/hiker_public_profile.php?community_member_id=2 What I want is something elegant like this: http://www.hikingsanfrancisco.com/alex-genadinik What my proposed solution is: Can I just store "alex-genadinik" in the database (instead of MVC controllers) and fetch the vanity URL when look up the person. And then I could redirect to the elegant-looking domain? Or will the redirection add a level of technical-awkwardness and inflexibility? Maybe I wouldn't have to redirect at all. I mean I'd be looking things up in the db instead of the server. I think thats the only difference. Thoughts? :)
