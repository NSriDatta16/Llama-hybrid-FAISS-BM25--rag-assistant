Why was the learning rate decreased for Roberta compared to LSTM?

I'm reading the codebase of a project that uses Bidirectional-LSTM. The learning rate for it is 0.02. Later, someone improved the project by replacing LSTM with Roberta and decreased the learning rate to 5e-5. Why did they decrease the learning rate ?
