Your first observation is correct. For the second, the hypothesis test is: $(Obs-H_0)/\sigma$ for a Normal distribution (attention that here you have less than 30 observations and you cannot use the Normal distribution but the Student distribution.) The previous stands to center and normalize your test such that you can use the tables. As it is a one-sided test (you are asked if the mean statistically increased ), you have to use the critical value pertaining to a 10% two-sided test for a Student distribution. Note that here you used the Normal distribution.
