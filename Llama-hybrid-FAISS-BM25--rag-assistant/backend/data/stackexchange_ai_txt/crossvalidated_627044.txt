I hope I understand the setup right but to me yes it does increase or decrease your chances of success on $Y$ . I always like to think of Conditional Probabilities as simply just changing/shrinking the sample space. Consider the figure below of the binary events $X$ and $Y$ after fixing $X=1$ , then surely your new sample space or the area you're thinking about will change and depending on the available information and you will be able to leverage the fixing of X to increase your chances. Although not the same problem but kinda reminds me of the Monte Hall problem.
