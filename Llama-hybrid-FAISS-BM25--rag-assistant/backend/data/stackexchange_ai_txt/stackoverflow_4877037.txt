Where should I place block icons and CSS in magento extension

My magento extension adds a new block (like the poll block for example) to the sidebar. I am using the same html structure as that used by the poll block to make the block look like its part of the system. i.e. __('block title') ?> ... I know that the icons on the poll block apear because of a CSS rule: .block-poll .block-title strong { background-image:url(../images/i_block-poll.gif); } that is returned from: /skin/frontend/base/default/css/widgets.css and I also know that the image itself is stored at: skin/frontend/default/default/images/ I have two Questions: What would be the appropriate way to add my own require CSS rule to show the icon near my block ? i.e. does .block-myblock .block-title strong { background-image:url(../images/i_block-myblock.gif); } go directly into some file ? and which file or is it added by the code of the block using some call like addCSS or something similar ? What would be the appropriate path for me to store the i_block-myblock.gif image ? please remember that this is all in the context of an extension, not local modifications to my own store.
