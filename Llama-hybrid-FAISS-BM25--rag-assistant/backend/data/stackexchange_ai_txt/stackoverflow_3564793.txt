Just watch not to do operations that requires the variable value when using it the first time, like the concatenate operator, .= . If you are a C++ programmer you must be used to declare all variables. Do something similar to this in PHP by zeroing variables or creating empty array if you want to use them. Pay attention to user input, and be sure you have registered globals off and check inputs from $_GET and $_POST by isset(). You can also try to code classes against structural code, and have every variable created at the beginning of a class declaration with the correct privacy policy. You can also separate the application logic from the view, by preparing all variables that have to be outputted first, and when it goes to display it, you will be know which variables you prepared.
