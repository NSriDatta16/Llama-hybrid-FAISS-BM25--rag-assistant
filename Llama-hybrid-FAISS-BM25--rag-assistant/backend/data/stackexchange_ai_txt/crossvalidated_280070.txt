I'd recommend that you have a read of the third edition of Hosmer, Lemeshow, and Sturdivant's "Applied Logistic Regression." Specifically, Chapter 4, section 4.2 provides a step by step approach to what they call the "Purposeful Section of Covariates" approach to logistic regression modelling. It essentially involves several steps: Univariate analysis of each independent variables Fitting a multivariable logistic model to all variables that passed the first round of univariate screning and reducing the model to include only those variables that produced statistically meaningful results Comparing the coefficients from the reduced model in step 2 with the full model in that step to verify that you haven't excluded certain variables that might have a dramatic effect on the other variables (and hence should be left in the model). Obtaining a preliminary main effects model (described in detail in the book) Assumption checking and verification of the main effects model Checking for interactions in the main effects model and developing a preliminary final model Performing adequacy checks of the final model. You can read Chapter Four (or at least parts of it online). Of course there are other approaches to building statistical models (including automated approaches -- but I'm not a fan of these) and each approach depends on exactly what you are trying to accomplish. So, I'd recommend that you start out by reading this material and some of the works referenced in the book. It should help you get a sense for popular model building and variable selection strategies.
