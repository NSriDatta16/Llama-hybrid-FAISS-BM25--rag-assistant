Let the true DGP (to be defined below) be $$y=\mathbf{X}\beta + \mathbf{z}\alpha + \mathbf{v},$$ where $\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{z}$ are regressors, and $\mathbf{z}$ is a $n \times 1$ for simplicity (you can think of it as an index of many variables if that feels restrictive). $\mathbf{v}$ is uncorrelated with $\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{z}$ . If $z$ is left out of the OLS model, $$\hat \beta_{OLS} = \beta + (N^{-1}\mathbf{X}'\mathbf{X})^{-1}(N^{-1}\mathbf{X}'\mathbf{z})\alpha+(N^{-1}\mathbf{X}'\mathbf{X})^{-1}(N^{-1}\mathbf{X}'\mathbf{v}).$$ Under the no-correlation assumption, the third term has a $\mathbf{plim}$ of zero, but $$\mathbf{plim}\hat \beta_{OLS}=\beta + \mathbf{plim} \left[ (N^{-1}\mathbf{X}'\mathbf{X})^{-1}(N^{-1}\mathbf{X}'\mathbf{z}) \right] \alpha.$$ If $\alpha$ is zero or $\mathbf{plim} \left[ (N^{-1}\mathbf{X}'\mathbf{X})^{-1}(N^{-1}\mathbf{X}'\mathbf{z}) \right] = 0$ , then $\beta$ can be interpreted causally. In general, the inconsistency can be positive or negative. So you need to get the functional form right, and include all variables that matter and are correlated with the regressors of interest. There is another nice example here . I think this might be a good example to give some intuition about when parameters can have a causal interpretation. This lays bare what it means to have a true DGP or the have the functional form right. Let's say we have a SEM/DGP like this: $$y_1 = \gamma_1 + \beta_1 y_2 + u_1,\quad 0 Here we have two endogenous variables (the $y$ s), a single exogenous variable $z_1$ , a random unobserved disturbance $u_1$ , a stochastic relationship linking the two $y$ s, and a definitional identity linking the three variables. We also have an inequality constraint to avoid dividing by zero below. The variation in $z_1$ is exogenous, so it is like a casual intervention that "wiggles" stuff around. This wriggling has a direct effect on $y_2$ , but there is also an indirect one through the first equation. Suppose a smart student, who has been paying attention to the lessons on simultaneity, writes down a reduced form model for $y_1$ and $y_2$ in terms of $z_1$ : $$\begin{align} y_1 =& \frac{\gamma_1}{1-\beta_1} + \frac{\beta_1}{1-\beta_1} z_1 + \frac{u_1}{1-\beta_1} \\ =& E[y_1 \vert z_1] + v_1 \\ y_2 =& \frac{\gamma_1}{1-\beta_1} + \frac{1}{1-\beta_1} z_1 + \frac{u_1}{1-\beta_1} \\ =& E[y_2 \vert z_1] + v_1, \end{align}$$ where $v_1 = \frac{u_1}{1- \beta_1}$ . The two coefficients on $z_1$ have a causal interpretation. Any external change in $z_1$ will cause the $y$ s to change by those amounts. But in the SEM/DGP, the values of $y$ s also respond to $u_1$ . In order to separate the two channels, we require $z_1$ and $u_1$ to be independent in order not to confound the two sources. That is the condition under which the causal effects of $z$ are identified. But this is probably not what we care about here. In the SEM/DGP, $$\frac{\partial y_1}{\partial y_2} = \beta_1 =\frac{\partial y_1}{\partial z_1} \div \frac{\partial y_2}{\partial z_1} =\frac{ \frac{\beta_1}{1-\beta_1}}{ \frac{1}{1-\beta_1}}.$$ We know that we can recover $\beta_1$ from the two reduced form coefficients (assuming independence of $z_1$ and $u_1$ ). But what does it mean for $\beta_1$ to be the causal effect of $y_2$ on $y_1$ when they are jointly determined? All the changes come from $z_1$ and $u_1$ (as the reduced form equation makes clear), and $y_2$ is only an intermediate cause of $y_1.$ So the first structural equation gives us "snapshot" impact, but the reduced form equations give us an equilibrium impact after allowing the endogenous variables to "settle." Given a system of linear equations, there are formal conditions for when parameters like $\beta_1$ are recoverable. They can be a DAG or a system of equations. But this is all to say that whether something is "causal" cannot be recovered from a single linear equation and some assumptions about exogeneity. There is always some model lurking in the background, even if it is not acknowledged as such. That is what it means to get the DGP "right", and that is a crucial ingredient.
