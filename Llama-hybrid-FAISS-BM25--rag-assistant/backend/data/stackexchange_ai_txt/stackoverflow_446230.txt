Use the -d switch ( which is surprisingly low profile on a google search ) Fitnesse20081201>run -p 8080 -d c:/projects/MyProjectNeedsAcceptanceTests This will create a subfolder in the specified folder called FitnesseRoot if it doesn't already exist, with all the stuff it needs to run. Fitnesse should be up. Switch to your browser. Go ahead and create your pages. You will have a subfolder for every Fitnesse page you create. Each folder would have a content.txt (which is the wiki content) and a properties.xml (which are the Fitnesse Properties for that page). All subpages would be subfolders under the folder for the parent page. Directories and Files...You're all setup for your first check-in to version control. Also set up your version control to ignore certain types of files FitnesseRoot/files FitnesseRoot/ErrorLog *.zip (The .zip files are how Fitnesse keeps track of edits to wiki pages.. a short term local version control. VCS like svn, git, cvs, etc.. should take care of this for us. So we don't need to check in the zip files) Hope that made sense.. If not I suggest you take 15 mins off to listen to the following screencast from UncleBob himself Source: Robert Martin - Version Control and Development Environment for Fitnesse
