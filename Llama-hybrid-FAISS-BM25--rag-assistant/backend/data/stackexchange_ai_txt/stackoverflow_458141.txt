Import XAML into WPF RichTextBox

I have a WPF RichTextBox that is dynamically built in a WPF web service. This web service accepts a xaml string that is extracted from the contents of a third-party silverlight RichTextBox control. This text is blue and bold. How do I insert this xaml into my WPF RichTextBox? I somewhat understand the concepts of the FlowDocument and Paragraph and Run so I can populate the WPF RichTextBox with text using the code below, FlowDocument flowDocument = new FlowDocument(); Paragraph par = new Paragraph(); par.FontSize = 16; par.FontWeight = FontWeights.Bold; par.Inlines.Add(new Run("Paragraph text")); flowDocument.Blocks.Add(par); rtb.Document = flowDocument; But what I really don't want to have to parse through the xaml myself to build a paragraph as it can get very complicated. Is there a way to just have the control know how to parse the passed in xaml?
