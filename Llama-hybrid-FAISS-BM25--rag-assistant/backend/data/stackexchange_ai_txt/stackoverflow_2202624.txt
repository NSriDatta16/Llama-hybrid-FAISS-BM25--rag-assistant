In Safari (on the Mac, at least), a file-chooser form element (Consisting of a "Choose..." button and a field showing the chosen file's name) is also a drag-and-drop target. (Contrast with Firefox, which treats the whole window as a drag-and-drop target, and will replace the current page with the dropped item.) Other places, I've seen an inset box, sometimes with a centered, grayed-out "Drag items here" text which disappears if anything is dragged in.
