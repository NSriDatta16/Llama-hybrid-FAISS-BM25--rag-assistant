First of all, you need scaling when the models are linear. For e.g. Linear Regression or Logistic Regression, NN. Now from your question, I understand that, you know about what scaling is. Second of all, you never scale the target variable. You always scale training data and then transform it over the testing or validation data. Third, scaling does improve the score in case of linear models. But in non-linear models like Decision tree or Random Forest, you don't need to do scaling. Lastly, why scaling needed. To answer that, I can say that, linear models needs their data to be in Gaussian format, or in normal format. Also, it needs data with no outliers etc. And these requirements can be fulfilled by using scaling. And that's why we use scaling. You can use the following: from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScalar, RobustScalar, StandardScalar scalar = MinMaxScalar() scalar.fit(xTrain) xTrain = scalar.transform(xTrain) xTest = scalar.transform(xTest)
