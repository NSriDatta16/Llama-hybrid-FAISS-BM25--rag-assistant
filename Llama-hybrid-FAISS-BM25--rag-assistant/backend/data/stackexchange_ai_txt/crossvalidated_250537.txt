you can use imputeTS package in R . I believe the data you are working on is uni-variate time series.The imputeTS package specializes on (univariate) time series imputation. It offers several different imputation algorithm implementations. Beyond the imputation algorithms the package also provides plotting and printing functions of missing data statistics. Well I recommend you to look into State Space Models for Missing Values .This package should help you with your analysis.
