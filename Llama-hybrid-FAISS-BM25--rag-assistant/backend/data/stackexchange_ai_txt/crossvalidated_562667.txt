These sound like team-level constructs (what Stapleton et al., 2016, called "shared constructs"), so hopefully the individuals responded to items that were worded that way. In this context, I would consider team member as "raters" of team-level constructs, and you will see me refer to interrater reliability (IRR) below. You should not "ignore nesting" (e.g., by running a person-level model with cluster-robust SE s and tests) because the constructs are characteristics of the team, not of individuals. In principle, you could calculate cluster aggregates (team means) from individual responses, but those are likely to contain a LOT of measurement error. It is usually not easy to measure cluster-level constructs with high reliability. I would run a multilevel CFA and check the assumption of measurement invariance (see Jak & Jorgensen, 2017, for details), and follow Lai (2021, p. 95, Eq. 17) to estimate reliability of team composites calculated by average individual scores across both items AND group members (i.e., simultaneously quantifying IRR and scale reliability). You may notice Stapleton et al. (2016, 2019, also referenced by Lai, 2021, in his Eq. 20) advocating for a CFA with saturated within-level structure to model shared constructs, but I disagree with this (Jak et al., 2021). However, Lai's (2021) Eq. 20 could still be interpreted similar to Eq. 17, and Eq. 20 would be more robust to any misspecification of the Level-1 model. References Jak, S., & Jorgensen, T. D. (2017).
