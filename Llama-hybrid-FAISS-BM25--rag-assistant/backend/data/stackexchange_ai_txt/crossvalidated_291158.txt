Data analysis with only dummy variables

I would like to find out whether there is a significant relationship between No-show rates and the part of the week (weekday/weekend), this in order to be able to suggest whether restaurants should allow or not allow reservations on certain days of the week. Am I right to think a logistic regression would be suitable for this? As you can see from the preview of my data I only have dummy variables available, and one continuous, which is making me confused about which type of regressions are possible. Or should I not use a regression at all? My main confusion I think lies in that I do not know what the outcome of my analysis should be, a yes/no answer, a p-value, i don't know :(
