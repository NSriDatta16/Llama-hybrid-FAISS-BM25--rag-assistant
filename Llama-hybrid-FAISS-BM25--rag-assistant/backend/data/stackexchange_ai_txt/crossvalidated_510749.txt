Can Neurons (Features) be repeated in Dense Layers

I was revising Convolutional Neural Networks and encountered the following question. If I were to classify a cat and a dog (the famous cats vs dog classifier), then assuming there are 2 Dense Layers after the CNN layers, and of course 1 output layer, the question is if the 2nd Dense Layer Neurons can have the same neurons as the first Dense Layer. More concretely, if Dense 1 has 3 Neurons (feature of the neuron = color, head, tail) and Dense 2 has 2 neurons, can the feature of the Neuron be color and head? Logically it should be okay, since Dense Layers serve as Feature Selector, whereby it selects the most relevant features.
