Characterizing relationship between two datasets

I have two data sets of electricity prices in a given region, one with data at 5 minute intervals and one with just the hourly values (which are almost, but not quite, averages of the 5 minute values within the hour). The hourly average data set goes back much further in time. I would like to study the variances of the 5-minute data vs. the hourly so I can make estimations or predictions as to the chance of the 5-minute price exceeding a given value if I only have the hourly average. How would you go about this? My Stats 101 approach has been to look at the standard deviation of either the ratio or the difference between the 5 minute and hourly data. But, now I'm realizing that that was assuming a normal distribution for the ratio/differences, which turns out not to be true. Given a large data set of mappings of 1 hourly value to 12 5-minute values, how can I estimate the chance that any hourly value maps to one or more 5-minute values >= some threshold?
