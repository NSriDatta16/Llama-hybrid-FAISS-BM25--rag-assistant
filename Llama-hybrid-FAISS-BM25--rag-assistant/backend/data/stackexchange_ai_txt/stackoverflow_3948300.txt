it is safe, a two-dimensional array is an array of arrays. Since an array occupied contiguous storage, so the whole multidimensional thing will too. So yeah, it's OK, safe and portable. Assuming you are NOT asking about style, which is covered by other answers (since you're using flags, I strongly recommend std::vector > myFlags(26) )
