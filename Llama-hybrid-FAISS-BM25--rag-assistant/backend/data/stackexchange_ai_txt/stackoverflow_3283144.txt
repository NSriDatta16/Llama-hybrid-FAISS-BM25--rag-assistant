LINQ to SQL using dynamic tables

I am developing application VS 2008, .NET 3.5 and I am trying to use LINQ To SQL. I drag & drop tables on the designer to generate the .dbml file. The problem I have that I have some dynamic tables for search indexing. I know the structure of table, only the application creates new tables like this: Files_1_1, Files_1_2, ... Files_m_n DataSearch_1_1, DataSearch_1_2, DataSearch_m_n In this case, m and n are integers in the name of the table. I statically define which columns are available but not the name of table, so I need a way to do this on the fly. Of course, this would also have to include associated tables. I haven't been able to get good idea about it. I would also be satisfied with just being able to generate LINQ To SQL class for this tables. Has anyone come across a solution to this problem? I have been looking through blog posts and forums for the past one days in vain. Any sample code is great for me.
