Zero-inflated ordered logit model interpretation

Consider this Stata code and selected results: use https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/stat/data/hsb2, clear generate honcomp = (write >=60) logit honcomp female read science Iteration 0: log likelihood = -115.64441 Iteration 1: log likelihood = -84.558481 Iteration 2: log likelihood = -80.491449 Iteration 3: log likelihood = -80.123052 Iteration 4: log likelihood = -80.118181 Iteration 5: log likelihood = -80.11818 This is a listing of the log likelihoods at each iteration. (Remember that logistic regression uses maximum likelihood, which is an iterative procedure.) The first iteration (called iteration 0) is the log likelihood of the “null” or “empty” model; that is, a model with no predictors. At the next iteration, the predictor(s) are included in the model. At each iteration, the log likelihood increases because the goal is to maximize the log likelihood. When the difference between successive iterations is very small, the model is said to have “converged”, iteration is stopped and the results are displayed. The above is from https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/stata/output/logistic-regression-analysis/ . There is also an option of fitting a zero-inflated ordered logit model. . ziologit tobacco education income i.female, inflate(income education i.parent) Iteration 0: log likelihood = -15977.364 (not concave) Iteration 1: log likelihood = -13149.83 (not concave) Iteration 2: log likelihood = -12467.245 Iteration 3: log likelihood = -11039.218 Iteration 4: log likelihood = -9929.2298 Iteration 5: log likelihood = -9715.1143 Iteration 6: log likelihood = -9703.2464 Iteration 7: log likelihood = -9703.2168 Iteration 8: log likelihood = -9703.2168 This output is from https://www.stata.com/new-in-stata/zero-inflated-ordered-logit/ . There appears to be one model computation being performed here, since there is only one iteration output. Is there just one model being fitted here that provide simultaneously all the coefficients for the tobacco and inflate portions? If this is correct how is this done? What relevance is “not concave”? Does it matter if it is or is not concave? In the link, there is also /cut1, /cut2 and /cut3. What do these represent?
