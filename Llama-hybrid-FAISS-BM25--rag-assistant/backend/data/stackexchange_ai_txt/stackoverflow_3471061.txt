LINQPad: LINQ to SQLite DataContext via System.Data.Sqlite

I'm fairly new to LINQ and trying to find a more elegant way (other than ADO.Net) to query and manipulate data in a SQLite database. I'm using System.Data.SQLite and wondering if there is a DataContext class or a way to use DataContext class to work with SQLite. I believe LINQPad uses the same assembly for its SQLite/MySQL driver and with it I can execute C# expressions like so: from c in Collection where c.Length > 3 select c What can I do to use those same LINQ expressions with my SQLite databases in my applications?
