Is there a good deployment module using Golang's amazing single binary compilation model?

From my limited understanding, it's quite annoying trying to deploy models like PyTorch. So one would need something like ONNX. But another approach like Golang with a single binary is VERY attractive. I have used Golang before and it's reasonably fast and compiles to one binary easily. For Rust, compiling to a single binary is a nightmare. So I wonder if anyone has seen work that translates XGBoost trees to Golang and uses arrow as the data exchange format? That way, it makes deployment super easy, wouldn't it?
