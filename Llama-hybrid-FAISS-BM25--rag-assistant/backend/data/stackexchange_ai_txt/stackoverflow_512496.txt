I have too. I usually create small FSMs (with few states) because bigger ones become maintenance nightmares, but sometimes an FSM is a very simple and elegant design for a given task. As a real-world example, I created a little utility to repair a certain type of file once. There were only 3 or 4 possible interaction paths with the user: show a little message, select file (maybe cancel and start over), repair file (maybe cancel and exit with error message), show a confirmation message. Creating the state machine made those paths apparent and easy to implement.
