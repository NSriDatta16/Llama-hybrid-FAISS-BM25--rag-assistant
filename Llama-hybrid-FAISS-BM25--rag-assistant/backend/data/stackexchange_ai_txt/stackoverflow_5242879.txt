How to Add REGION in Visual Studio in aspx Files

I use asp.net with code behind and c#. So I have two file for every .aspx page in VS 2010. In .aspx.cs page I am able to add regions in my code using: #region Name Region #endregion My questions: How to do it in file .aspx? #region seems working only in .cs file. Do you know any other useful tag to help me to organize better my code both for .aspx and .cs file? Do you know the keyboard shortcuts to expand or collapse all my region in my code? Thanks for your help.
