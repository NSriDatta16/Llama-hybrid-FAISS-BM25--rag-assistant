Although it isn't encouraged by the ASP MVC default template, I think that it will become a recommended practice to place all of your site's static content within a single directory. You can then disable the ASP pipeline for said directory and allow IIS to serve the content without passing the request to ASP.NET at all. This practice has been written about on Steve Sanderson and Kazi Manzur Rashid's blogs. It is also recommended in ASP.NET MVC in Action .
