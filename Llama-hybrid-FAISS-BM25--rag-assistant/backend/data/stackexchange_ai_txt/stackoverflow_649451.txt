You need a data sourceâ€”AFAIK, you can't make this happen with Bindings alone. The unfinished Adium Xtras Creator, which is under the BSD license, includes an array controller that you can set as the data source to get drag-and-drop in a Bindings-powered table view . This requirement may not apply to NSOutlineView and NSTreeController. I haven't tried that.
