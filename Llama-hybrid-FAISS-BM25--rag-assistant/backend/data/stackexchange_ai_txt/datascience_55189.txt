Problem On Class Imbalanced Data

I am getting an F-Score of 0.99 on the train_test_split data, but only getting 0.40 for a competition's test data. I am oversampling with random forest (after oversampling both of the classes have 95469 data). Before oversampling the data was 0 - 95469 and 1 - 193 respectively.
