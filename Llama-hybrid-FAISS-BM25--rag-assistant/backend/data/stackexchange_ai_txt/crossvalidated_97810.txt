Yes, it is possible to have a value of 2.21 if the sample size is not infinitely large (or large enough...). This is, in fact the motivation behind the development of Parallel Analysis as an augmentation to the eigenvalue 1 rule. I cite Valle 1999 on this answer and have italicized the part speaking directly to your question. Selection of the Number of Principal Components: The Variance of the Reconstruction Error Criterion with a Comparison to Other Methods â€  Sergio Valle,Weihua Li, and, and S. Joe Qin* Industrial & Engineering Chemistry Research 1999 38 (11), 4389-4401 Parallel Analysis . The PA method basically builds PCA models for two matrices: one is the original data matrix and the other is an uncorrelated data matrix with the same size as the original matrix. This method was developed originally by Horn to enhance the performance of the Scree test. When the eigenvalues for each matrix are plotted in the same figure, all the values above the intersection represent the process information and the values under the intersection are considered noise. Because of this intersection, the parallel analysis method is not ambiguous in the selection of the number of PCs. For a large number of samples, the eigenvalues for a correlation matrix of uncorrelated variables are 1. In this case, the PA method is identical to the AE method. However, when the samples are generated with a finite number of samples, the initial eigenvalues exceed 1, while the final eigenvalues are under 1. That is why Horn suggested comparing the correlation matrix eigenvalues for uncorrelated variables with those of a real data matrix based on the same sample size.
