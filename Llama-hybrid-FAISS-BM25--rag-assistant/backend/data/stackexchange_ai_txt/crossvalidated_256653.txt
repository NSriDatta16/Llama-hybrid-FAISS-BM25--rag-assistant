If you need metrics for tightness of clustering, you can present Within-Group-Sum-of-Squares (WGSS) value for clusters. It would be better if you have any baseline to compare these number with. If you want to go for a visual representation, I would recommend using dimensionality reduction using PCA and then visualising the clusters in the first two or three principal component space.
