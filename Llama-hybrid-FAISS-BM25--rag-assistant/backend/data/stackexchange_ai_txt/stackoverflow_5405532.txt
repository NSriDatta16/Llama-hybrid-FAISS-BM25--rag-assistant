Putting key-values into map conditionally, what are the concise ways?

What are the concise/ elegant ways to put into a map key-value pairs for which the corresponding conditions are true? That is to translate [condition1 condition2 ...] [key1 val1 key2 val2 ...] or [condition1 condition2 ...] [key1 key2 ...] [val1 val2 ...] or [condition1 key1 val1 condition2 key2 val2...] into {key-for-true-condition1 val-for-true-condition1, key-for-true-condition2 val-for-true-condition2...} I think to use "reduce" with "if" in its lambda but interested in more concise/ beautiful/ elegant/ idiomatic ways.
