Virtual file drag drop on linux Operating systems

I need to make a native gtk application which has the functionality of virtual file drag and drop. What i mean here is that when we start dragging a file from the native application then that file actually doesn't exist there but is either generated or downloaded from some remote location and is finally available at the drop location. The virtual drag drop is possible in windows , visit the below given link http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/03/19/8080215.aspx
