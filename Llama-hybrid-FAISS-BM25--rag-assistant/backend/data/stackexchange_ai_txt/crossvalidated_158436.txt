Stata automatically tests collinearity for logistic regression?

I'm using Stata for logistic regression. This software automatically checks for collinearity and remove (drop) some variables as we can see below: . logit I A B C D XX note: XX omitted because of collinearity Iteration 0: log likelihood = -289.73552 Iteration 1: log likelihood = -230.69547 Iteration 2: log likelihood = -203.22756 Iteration 3: log likelihood = -198.37658 Iteration 4: log likelihood = -198.27812 Iteration 5: log likelihood = -198.27791 Iteration 6: log likelihood = -198.27791 Logistic regression Number of obs = 418 LR chi2(4) = 182.92 Prob > chi2 = 0.0000 Log likelihood = -198.27791 Pseudo R2 = 0.3157 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ I | Coef. Std. Err. z P>|z| [95% Conf. Interval] -------------+---------------------------------------------------------------- A | 8.694651 1.250269 6.95 0.000 6.244168 11.14513 B | -1.384168 .5934295 -2.33 0.020 -2.547269 -.221068 C | .1348553 .1269632 1.06 0.288 -.1139881 .3836986 D | -.2188249 .1664487 -1.31 0.189 -.5450583 .1074085 XX | 0 (omitted) _cons | 1.956985 .3378121 5.79 0.000 1.294886 2.619085 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Note: 0 failures and 14 successes completely determined. I think Stata only checks for perfect linear relationship between independent variables (100% correlation). Is this true? If the answer to that question is yes, is this true based on theoretical framework? We should only consider perfect collinearity?
