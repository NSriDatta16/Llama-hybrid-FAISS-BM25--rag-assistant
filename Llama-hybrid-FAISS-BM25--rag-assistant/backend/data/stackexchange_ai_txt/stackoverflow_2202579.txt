SQL Server Reporting Services Round() function

there is some bizarre thing happening with my report generated in SQL Server Reporting Services and I hope I am not being too stupid. I use the Round function to get integers. Sometimes a 4.5 will round to 4 and a 5.5 will round to 6. Is this because of the rounding method? I am using this: Round(Fields!GroupAverageAssessment.Value,0) How can I make a regular rounding (4.5 to 5, 3.5 to 4, 6.5 to 7 and so on...) Thanks
