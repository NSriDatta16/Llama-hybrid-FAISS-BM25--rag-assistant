Ignacio's example is correct but depends on your console being able to display Unicode characters, which on Windows it usually can't. Here's the same thing with only safe string escapes (reprs): >>> '\xe3\x81\x82'.decode('utf-8') # three top-bit-set bytes, representing one character u'\u3042' # Hiragana letter A >>> u'\u3042'.encode('shift-jis') '\x82\xa0' # only requires two bytes in the Shift-JIS encoding >>> unicode('\x82\xa0', 'shift-jis') # alternative way of doing a decode u'\u3042' when you're writing to eg. a file or via a web server, or you're on another operating system where the console supports UTF-8, it's a bit easier.
