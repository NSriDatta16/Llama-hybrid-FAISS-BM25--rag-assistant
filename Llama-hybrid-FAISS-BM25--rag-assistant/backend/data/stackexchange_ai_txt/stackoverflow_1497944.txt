From the limited info you present it is difficult to recommend an option, because the method depends on your usage of the tables. Storing the data is one thing, but using it is a completely different issue. All three store the data is a way possible to retrieve it, however what queries will you need to construct to load it, aggregate it, and search it? I would implement each method, populate with a small set of data and try to write a few queries to gather data as your application would. Any problems or difficulties in using the table design will become apparent then. You should always design your tables so data retrieval is fast and easy. You shouldn't have to fight your tables to get your data out. If do you find yourself fighting with your tables to get the data out, then you designed them poorly. Your table structure should make your life easier not harder.
