Tfs 2010: how to set up a corporate source server?

I'm looking for guidance in setting up a corporate source server, but when I google this topic the best I can come up with is articles and walkthrough concerned with configuring VS to use microsoft's public symbol servers for use with debugging .NET assemblies. Provided for background info, the environment I'm concerned with using is Vs2010/Tfs2010. Basically, the workflow I'm looking to facilitate is this: 1) customer reports problem with application 2) application of the appropriate version is installed on a virtual machine 3) developer repros bug attaching to process on virtual machine and leveraging source server (symbol server?) on corporate domain. This is the step I'm concerned with. 4) developer pinpoints problem fixes bug in workspace. 5) developer performs a dll swap on VM to test changes? (side topic, not sure on this) 6) normal development/source control workflows. Any advice is welcome! Edit: since writing this, I have stumbled on this article , which is a nice writeup on the configuration of source server for TFS 2008. Has anyone adapted this for Tfs 2010?
