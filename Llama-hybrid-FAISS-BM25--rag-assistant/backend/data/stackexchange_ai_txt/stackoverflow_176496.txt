unfortunately this is pretty average with flash. You can check out this post on actionscript.org which talks about splitting up your project so save on compile time. Back in the AS2 days an open source compiler called MTASC which dramatically reduced the compile time . It has since turned into Haxe with AS2, AS3, Javascript, PHP, and Neko virtual machine all using the same syntax. The syntax used is similar to C++. ** EDIT ** Sorry I read the above as 10 seconds, not 10 minutes... sorry. ^_^
