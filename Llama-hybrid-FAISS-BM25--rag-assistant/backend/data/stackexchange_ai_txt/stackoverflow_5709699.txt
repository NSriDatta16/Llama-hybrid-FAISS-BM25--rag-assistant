JAVA: Does anyone have a working link to this old drag and drop demo?

the web demo is here: http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorialJWS/uiswing/misc/examples/DragPictureDemo.jnlp the old tutorial link was here http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/uiswing/dnd/examples/index.html obviously the tutorial link isn't working anymore, but i was wondering if maybe had something saved in your favorites that replaced this, or something similar? tyia
