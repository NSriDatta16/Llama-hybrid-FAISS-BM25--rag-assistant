If you want to accept only secure connections, create a separate service for port 80 that only redirects to HTTPS. Ideally, you would preserve the requested path in the HTTP redirect. If you simply want to encourage HTTPS connections for browsing (and don't care about robots, e.g.), add this to your pages: if(location.protocol=='http:') location=location.toString().replace(/^http:/,'https:');
