App crashes but still says "running..." in the debugger console

It's a scroll view based app with paging, that plays a sound when each page is scrolled to. For some reason it will randomly crash mid-scroll sometimes, but the debugger doesn't say it crashed. It still says "GDB: Running..." Any general advice on how to narrow the problem down? scrollViewWillBeginDragging: does finish (checked with NSLogs), and then it just freezes.
