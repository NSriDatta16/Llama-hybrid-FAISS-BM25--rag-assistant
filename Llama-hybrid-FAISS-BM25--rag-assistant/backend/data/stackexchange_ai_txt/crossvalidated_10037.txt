Fitting the moving average model

let v to be forecasted value for periods 1 through T and $v_{t}$ be its forecasted value at time $t$. We express $v_{t}$ as the sum of two terms, its mean at time $t$, and its deviation from the mean at time $t$, $\epsilon_{t}$. In other words, $$ v_{t}= \overline{v_{t}} + \epsilon_{t} $$ The $\overline{v_{t}}$ are chosen based on the arguments. The $\epsilon_{t}$ term is assumed to be a normally distributed random variable with mean zero and standard deviation $\sigma (ε_{t})=0.234$. The moving average formation of order q is choosen, MA(q) where q is the number of lagged terms in the moving average. We use the following moving average specification: $$\epsilon_{t} = \sum^{q}_{i=0}{\alpha_{i} \mu_{t-i}} $$ where $\mu_{t-i}$ are independently distributed standard normal random variables. To ensure that the standard deviation of $εt$ is equal to its pre-specified value, we set the $$\alpha_{i}= \frac{\sigma(\epsilon_{t})}{\sqrt{q+1}}$$ Note that $\epsilon t$ depends on $q+1$ random terms. the R-code that i have used for above model q=31 iter=10000 for(i in 1:31){alpha_i[i] I am wondering that, $\alpha$ is changing through time? and also i never get the same output as in the figure 2 The end of world Population growth Nature, v412, 543 the parameter for figure in the paper are: Note: MA(30), (31 terms), $\sigma(\epsilon_{t})=0.234$, 31 initial values of $\mu=0$, 10,000 simulation Am I missing any thing?
