I'd be tempted to suggest elaborating a bit on what you've tried and what results you got as this may have changed a bit but here are my initial suggestions: Is it any tests or comprehensive tests? Some may code blindly and do zero tests, but this is rather rare, IME. Usually there are some tests done but not enough to cover most of the cases that would be comprehensive testing. Group dynamics may help. I'd assume he is part of a team and that the team's view may be of some help here. In a way this is trying to get peer pressure which is usually a bad thing but sometimes it can be used in good ways. How well spelled out were the warnings? In a way this can seem childish but there is a chance that what you think of as testing may not be the same as his. Do you want nUnit tests, an excel spreadsheet, logs from his computer, or something else as proof of the existence and use of tests? From what you've described there isn't anything to confirm that he did understand what you meant, was going to use tests and provide evidence of doing so. Check-in policy question. Some places, such as my current workplace, encourage committing often which can mean that one does commit code without tests. Is there a known, accepted and well-followed policy where you are? That's another aspect here.
