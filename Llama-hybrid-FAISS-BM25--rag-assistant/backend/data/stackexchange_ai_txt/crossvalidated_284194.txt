In a time series context you can take a look at non-parametric predictive distribution estimation for $p(X_{t+1} \mid X_t, X_{t-1}, \ldots)$. For this I suggest to look at hard LICORS , mixed LICORS, LICORS cabinet , and Hilbert space embeddings of predictive state representations -- to name a couple (disclaimer: I have been working on the first 2.) As a pure regression framework, I just finished work on "Predictive State Smoothing (PRESS): Scalable non-parametric regression for high-dimensional data with variable selection" , which makes almost no assumptions on the distributions for $y \mid \mathbf{X}$ and estimates an optimal Kernel smoother. As others have already pointed to npreg or other kernel smoother implementations, I want to highlight that PRESS does not suffer from curse of dimensionality. In the paper I show examples of a kernel smoother for an $\mathbf{X} \in R^{60,000 \times 784}$, i.e., $784$ covariates with $N = 60,000$ observations. PRESS can estimate the kernel smoothing matrix for that within a couple of seconds. Traditional kernel smoothers break down (or just won't work) for more than a couple (5-ish) dimensions.
