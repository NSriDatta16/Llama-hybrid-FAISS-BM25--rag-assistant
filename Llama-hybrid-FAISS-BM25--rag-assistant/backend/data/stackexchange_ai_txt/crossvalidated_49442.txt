Recommendations for learning probability and Bayesian statistics?

I have been very interested lately in learning Bayesian Statistics, but I have only a little bit of background in the frequentist statistics, only one term at University. Some of the books that I have seen are extremely mathematically oriented like: Bayesian Theory, Jos√© Bernardo. Probability and Statistics, Degroot (this is actually a nice book, but it jumps too much between chapters in the examples, making the process of reading pretty sequential in all the book) The topics that I would like to learn are: Bayesian inference. Generation of independent samples from distributions. Monte Carlo integration, importance sampling. Posterior distribution with numerical quadrature or Laplace expansion. MCMC methods: Gibbs and Metropolis-Hastings sampling. Auxiliary variable methods in MCMC. EM algorithm. Multi-model inference. MCMC theory. I have tried to find something in Coursera but nothing. What books or online courses do you recommend?
