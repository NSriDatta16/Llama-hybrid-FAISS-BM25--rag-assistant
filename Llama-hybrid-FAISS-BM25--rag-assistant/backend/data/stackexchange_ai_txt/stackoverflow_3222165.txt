Found the problem! You don't show quite enough code around "where you use the model" but it looks like you are re-using the same object for each insert. You've got this object, you set its attributes from what comes out of the DB, and then you stash it in the list. Well guess what: It's the same object every time, so it's bound to have the same value every time! If you want different values in your list, you'll need to use distinct objects. Don't worry, this is a common enough beginner's mistake. A sensible way to do this would be to construct a new appointmentDate for every DB record. You may want to initialize the data right in the constructor. Finally, note that if appointmentDate is a class name, it should (by convention) begin with an uppercase letter! Finally (some more): LinkedList is efficient at inserts, but performs horribly at retrieval, i.e. the get(n) thing. I'd expect there to be a lot more scrolling and displaying from your list than inserting, so I'd use the List implementation that's much better performing here: ArrayList . It works the same, is only marginally slower at inserts and much faster at retrieval. But that's just additional information for you. Performance isn't so important for a small project like this.
