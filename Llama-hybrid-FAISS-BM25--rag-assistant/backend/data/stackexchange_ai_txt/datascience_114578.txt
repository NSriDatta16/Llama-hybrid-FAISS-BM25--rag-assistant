I'm not sure there can be an objective answer to this question. Be careful, the fact that these are called "neural networks" in ML is just an analogy: artificial neural networks are not the same as biological neural networks. It's tempting to imagine that one can straightforwardly apply what we know from biological neurons to ML neurons, but there's no evidence that things can work like this. To take a ridiculous comparison, it's as if one tries to study how trees work in nature to improve decision trees. In general, there are various apparently intuitive ideas about following how nature works to improve technology which have been proved wrong in the past. Also there is still a lot that that we don't know about how the brain works, afaik. Finally there is a crucial reason why artificial neural networks can't work like the brain: they don't have any way to experience the world , they can only mimic the training data.
