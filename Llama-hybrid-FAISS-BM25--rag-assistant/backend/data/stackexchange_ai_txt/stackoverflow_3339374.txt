Drag-drop: How to draw a "ghost" control that represents data being dragged?

I have searched a lot and the nearest thing I have found is this . The question is exactly about what I want to code, but there's only one vague answer. Searched code.google.com for GiveFeedback implementations, but none about what I want. Any idea, please?
