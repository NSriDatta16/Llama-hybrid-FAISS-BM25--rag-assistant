You should put additional attention to this line: ((Activity) mContext).startActivityForResult(storeIntent, Miner.REQUEST_STORE) Are you sure mContext is the correct activity? I suspect it's not the current activity but the reference to another activity instance, the first one that was closed before. Can you use "this" instead of mContext?
