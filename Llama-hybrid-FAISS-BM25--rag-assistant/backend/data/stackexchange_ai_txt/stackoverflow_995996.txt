There are many ORM tools (as Cody C suggested) that will generate code and do the mapping for you. But from the sound of the question, I am thinking that would be overkill for your application. If this is all you need, run your query with your perfered data access (dynamic sql, stored proc, views, etc) and then simply map the values in the returning data to your object. This is certainly not the most elegant solution, but introducing a 3rd party tool may be more than you need.
