I generally reference the class and method name, with the expectation that the reader can use that to track down the documentation. Perhaps that's a little arrogant. I don't know. If I'm trying to make a point about which signature of a method to use, I'll usually provide sample code. This is mainly because I find it easier than writing out the description long-hand.
