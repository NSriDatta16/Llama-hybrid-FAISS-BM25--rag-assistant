So, the problem is how to cluster texts. Firstly, an alternative approach to representing document meaning, you can use Doc2Vec and compare similarities between document embeddings ( https://medium.com/wisio/a-gentle-introduction-to-doc2vec-db3e8c0cce5e ). Secondly, if you are unsure about the ideal number of clusters, instead of using k-means, you can use agglomerative clustering, which is essentially bottom-up method which clusters individual document embeddings by a distance metric to eventually merge all of the clusters to a "mega-cluster", containing all documents. You can then see how the documents cluster together using a dendrogram. Here is a good resource on agglomerative clustering : https://stackabuse.com/hierarchical-clustering-with-python-and-scikit-learn/
