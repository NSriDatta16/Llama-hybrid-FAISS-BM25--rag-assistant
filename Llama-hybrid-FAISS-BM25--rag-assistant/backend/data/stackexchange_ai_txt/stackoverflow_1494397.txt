The only thing I can think of that might work without resorting to server side scripting is to allow directory browsing and use a hidden frame to load the directory in the browser and then use JavaScript to parse the HTML of the hidden frame and get the information you need from that. But this is a hack and not a very good solution. Plus it may violate your no directory browsing stipulation - while the directory isn't directly viewable by the average user, because it is indexable and because you are displaying it in a hidden frame, it wouldn't take much for someone to figure out how to view the contents of that directory.
