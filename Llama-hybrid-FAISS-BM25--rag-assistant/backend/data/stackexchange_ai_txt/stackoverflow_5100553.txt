How to generate RDF/XML using a template in javascript?

I have some working Javascript code that generates an RDF/XML document using variables picked up from HTML fields: ... peopleDoap += " " + person_name + " \n"; if (person_url != "") { peopleDoap += " \n"; } if (person_pic != "") { peopleDoap += " \n"; } ... It's hard, looking at this code, to get any sense of what the output will look like (especially as this code is scattered amongst sub functions etc). I'm wondering if there is an easy way that would enable me to have something like this: ... %person_name% ... And then some substitution code. One slight complication is if fields are left blank, I will want to not generate the whole element. Ie, if person_url='', the above should generate as: ... %person_name% ... I guess I could do this fairly naively by defining the template as a huge string, then performing a bunch of replaces on it, but is there anything more elegant? Mild preference for native Javascript rather than libraries, but happy to be convinced... (Btw, yes, since this is RDF/XML, maybe there is a smarter way using some kind of RDF library. If you want to address that of the question instead, that's ok with me.) Code is here . Also, this is a widget running on a Jetty server. I don't think server-side code is an option.
