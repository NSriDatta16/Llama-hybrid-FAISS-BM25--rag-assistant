I knew I needed to be disillusioned when I saw someone suggest to someone to use oracle instead of MySQL and thought, "Why in the world would you want to do that?!" Because your company has been using Oracle for the past ten years, or because you equate enterprise usage with 'must be good' and open-source with 'free crap'. That's just about the only reason. Everyone I know who has worked with Oracle loathes it. Everyone I know who has worked with MySQL, assuming they don't love it, at least consider it a better alternative to Oracle in almost every regard. SQL RMDBs are so complex though, that in almost every respect there's something one DB does that another doesn't. It is also, unfortunately, a fact of comparing databases that people quote statistics without using properly configured servers. If you have two default configurations for a server, one might be better than the other, but that's about as far as the comparisons usually go. They don't reflect the fact that these gigantic applications have a million little switches and toggles you can use to speed certain things up, increase reliability and generally screw up bad science.
