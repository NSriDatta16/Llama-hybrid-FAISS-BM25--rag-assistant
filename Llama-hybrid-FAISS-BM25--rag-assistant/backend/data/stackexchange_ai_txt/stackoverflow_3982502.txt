SHA2 password storage with Java

I'm attempting to make a XML-RPC call that requires HmacSHA-256 hashing of a particular string. I'm currently using the Jasypt library with the following code: StandardPBEStringEncryptor sha256 = new StandardPBEStringEncryptor(); sha256.setPassword(key); sha256.setAlgorithm("PBEWithHmacSHA2"); On trying to use sha256.encrypt(string) I get this error: Exception in thread "main" org.jasypt.exceptions.EncryptionInitializationException: java.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException: PBEWithHmacAndSHA256 SecretKeyFactory not available at org.jasypt.encryption.pbe.StandardPBEByteEncryptor.initialize(StandardPBEByteEncryptor.java:597) at org.jasypt.encryption.pbe.StandardPBEStringEncryptor.initialize(StandardPBEStringEncryptor.java:488) at org.jasypt.encryption.pbe.StandardPBEStringEncryptor.encrypt(StandardPBEStringEncryptor.java:541) at nysenateapi.XmlRpc.main(XmlRpc.java:52) Caused by: java.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException: PBEWithHmacAndSHA256 SecretKeyFactory not available at javax.crypto.SecretKeyFactory.(DashoA13*..) at javax.crypto.SecretKeyFactory.getInstance(DashoA13*..) at org.jasypt.encryption.pbe.StandardPBEByteEncryptor.initialize(StandardPBEByteEncryptor.java:584) ... 3 more I downloaded the JCE Cryptography extension and placed the jars in my buildpath, but that doesn't seem to have done anything. I've tried using a number of combinations in setAlgorithm above, including "PBE", "PBEWithSha"(1|2|128|256)?, "PBEWithHmacSha", etc. I also tried using BouncyCastle but I didn't have any luck there either. Any help or guidance appreciated!
