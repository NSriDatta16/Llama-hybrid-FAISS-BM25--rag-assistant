How do I index an array of jQuery objects elegantly?

I find myself starting to write this: $($("a-selector-which-returns-multiple-objects")[index]).SomejQueryFunctionForExampleShow() Because I have one query which returns multiple objects, then the [index] operator returns the DOM object, not a jQuery object, so I convert it back to a jQuery object with the outer $() . This is working fine, but seems inelegant, and I feel I'm missing something about indexing into sets of jQuery objects - what's the proper way to do this?
