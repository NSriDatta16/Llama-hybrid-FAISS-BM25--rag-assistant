Why is the data on two seperate databases? Do you really mean that they are on seperate databases - or that they are on seperate instances of MySQL ? A single mysql instance can provide multiple database, and you can write queries that pull in data from each one, e.g. SELECT activity.* FROM mysql.user user, audit.activity activity WHERE activity.user=user.user If you want to collate data from seperate MySQL instances, then as others have suggested, you will need to create 2 db connections, fire a query against one connection, then dynamically build and execute queries against the second (note you'll get significant performance benefits by using a prepared statement for the iterated query). Another approach is to expose the second instance directly in the first instance of MySQL using the federated storage engine
