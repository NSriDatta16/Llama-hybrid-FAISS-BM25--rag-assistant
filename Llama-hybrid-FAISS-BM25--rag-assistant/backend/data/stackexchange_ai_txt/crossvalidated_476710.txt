Interpret WAIC value

I am trying to figure out how to interpret the WAIC value computed based on two different Bayesian models. Is the value only used for comparing the models, such that the predictive capabilities of the model with a higher WAIC value is superior? Or does the value in itself say anything? I have looked at BDA by Gelman and A student's guide by Lambert, but I still do not really get it.
