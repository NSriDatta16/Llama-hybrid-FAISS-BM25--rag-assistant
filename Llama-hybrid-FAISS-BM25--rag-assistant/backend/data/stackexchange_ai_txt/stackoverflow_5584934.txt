Dynamically adding images to Gallery

The basic user action is dragging/dropping an image from a Gallery to a dropspot. The image that is dropped into the dropspot will populate another Gallery with the same image that was just dropped. How would I add these "dropped" images into the new Gallery array? Right now I have standard ImageAdapters linked to each Gallery, with the same array of images in each...would I use an Arrayadapter for the second Gallery instead?
