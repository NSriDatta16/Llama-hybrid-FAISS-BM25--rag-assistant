For something like a highest-density prediction interval it tells you about the probable range of outcomes. If it is really wide then there is quantifiable uncertainty indicating that is very difficult to predict what is going to approximately happen. In other words, it tells you how precise to expect the model to be in terms of quantifiable uncertainty. One of the applications of prediction intervals is resource planning under uncertainty. Suppose you are forecasting the amount of resources you are going to need. You could use the conditional expectation, but the upper bound of a 99% prediction interval can give you some sense of the greatest amount of resources you'll probably (in the sense of 99% PI) need. It is more robust to risk to probably have enough resources than to have enough resources on average.
