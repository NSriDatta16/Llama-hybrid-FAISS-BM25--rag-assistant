multiple tsne (and pca) transforms on one plot

I'm reviewing a paper, in which the researcher fitted different t-sne transforms and plotted them on one plot, showing clusters in 2-d after dimensionality reduction (t-sne). Each cluster was fitted separately. Since the transforms were fitted separately- it looks to me that this plot is faulty- there is no meaning at looking over them together. Can you find a meaning for such a plot? (additional info- let x be an embedding (d=100) calculated from 10 different input types. resulting in 10 embeddings of dimension 10. Then, the researcher transformed them to 10*2 through 10 tsne different transformations and plot the 10 groups in 2d, showing 10 clusters) Thanks!
