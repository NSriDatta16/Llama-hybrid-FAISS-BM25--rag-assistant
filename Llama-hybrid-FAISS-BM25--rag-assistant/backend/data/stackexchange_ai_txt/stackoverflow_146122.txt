However you find it easiest to read! Seriously, you'll get a billion and five suggestions but you're only going to like a couple of methods. Some things I shall say though: Breaking a CSS file into chunks does help you organise it in your head, but it means more requests from browsers, which ultimately leads to a slower running server (more requests) and it takes browsers longer to display pages. Keep that in mind. Breaking up a file just because it's an arbitrary number of lines is silly (with the exception that you have an awful editor - in which case, get a new one) Personally I code my CSS like this: * { /* css */ } body { /* css */ } #wrapper { /* css */ } #innerwrapper { /* css */ } #content { /* css */ } #content div { /* css */ } #content span { /* css */ } #content etc { /* css */ } #header { /* css */ } #header etc { /* css */ } #footer { /* css */ } #footer etc { /* css */ } .class1 { /* css */ } .class2 { /* css */ } .class3 { /* css */ } .classn { /* css */ } Keeping rules on one line allows me to skim down a file very fast and see what rules there are. When they're expanded, I find it too much like hard work trying find out what rules are being applied.
