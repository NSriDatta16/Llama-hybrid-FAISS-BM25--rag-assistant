Neural Network - Classification from Time series

I'm a .Net programmer who is fairly new to neural networks, but I know some of the concepts. I have connected .Net to my copy of Mathematica 10 This is a classification Our business problem is that we have these charts that have 2 or more lines (series) on them. Depending on what the lines are doing over time (increase / decrease, speed of increase / decrease) (and they vary independently), and how they vary with respect to each other, we have human analysts working here who can look at those charts and say "normal operation" or one of several types of exception conditions. They do this informally but quite accurately. So, my questions is, what kind of neural network is this, that can classify this multiple time series data?
