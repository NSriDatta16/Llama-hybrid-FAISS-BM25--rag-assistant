In unmanaged code the most effective way from the performance side will be to use Memory-Mapped Files instead of reading the file in buffer. I am sure that the best results can be achieved only in the way, especially if the file which you want to scan could be a file from the remote storage (a file from the server). I am not sure that the usage of the corresponding .NET 4.0 classes will be in your case exactly the same effective.
