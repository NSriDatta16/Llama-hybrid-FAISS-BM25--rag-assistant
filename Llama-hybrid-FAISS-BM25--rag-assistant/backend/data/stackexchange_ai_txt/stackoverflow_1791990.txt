I would pay the most attention to scaling (if the user makes it bigger and reorients it, then they are likely interested. Probably more interested if they let it sit for a while and then move it again.). Depending on the nature of the content, you might be able to derive popularity or depth of interest. For example, if there is scrolling text, do they scroll all the way to the bottom? How many times does a single user scroll? If it's possible to flip over, dig into deeper information, how often is this done. You should be careful to normalize this against user testing. You don't want to decide that no one cares about a particular piece of content without first making sure it's easy and intuitive to access.
