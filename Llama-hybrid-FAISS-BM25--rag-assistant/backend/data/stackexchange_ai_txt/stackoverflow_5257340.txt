First of all you should initiate the Google Analytics account using the Web-property ID given to you at the time of creating an account in Google Analytics site. Then you must add the following code to start the tracking and set the dispatch time. Then only you could view the analytics count in your account in Google Analytics online account. Here is the initiating code for that. [[GANTracker sharedTracker]startTrackerWithAccountID:@"UA-xxxxxx-yy" dispatchPeriod:10 delegate:nil]; You should also make sure, you have included the following code in the dealloc in the AppDelegate. [GANTracker sharedTracker] stopTracker]; Hope this will work fine. Thanks.
