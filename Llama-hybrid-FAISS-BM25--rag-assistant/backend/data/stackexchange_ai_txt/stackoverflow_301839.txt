UnitTest how do you organise your testing files?

Currently, I am splitting all my tests by package (projects). So if I have 12 projects, I will create 1 more project for Unit Test with 12 classes that will test all my package. Do you do the same way or do you have 1 testing class by class? How do you organize all your test?
