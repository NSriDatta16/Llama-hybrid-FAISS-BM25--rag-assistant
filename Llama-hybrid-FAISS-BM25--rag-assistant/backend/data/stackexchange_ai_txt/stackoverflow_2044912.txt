If you can't put a Dragon in A then you will need to create another table and another link table. The problem is creating a unique set of data that needs to be stored (another table) that cannot be the same set as A. Since it isn't the same set then you can no longer use the link table (AtoB) which has foreign keys that ensure that the link is a reference from set A. So you could create a tables like this: imaginary_creatures id name imaginary_creatures_to_b imaginary_creatures_id (link to imaginary_creatures table) b_id (link to zoos table) Later when you want to get all creatures in a zoo you can do a UNION SELECT A.Name FROM A where A.ID IN (SELECT AB.A_ID FROM AtoB AB WHERE B_ID = (SELECT B.ID FROM B WHERE B.Name = 'Zoo Name')) UNION SELECT i.name FROM imaginary_creatures i i.id IN (SELECT ic.imaginary_creatures_id FROM imaginary_creatures_to_c ic WHERE ic.b_id = (SELECT B.ID FROM B WHERE B.Name = 'Zoo Name')) There may be a better way of writing that, but it should work for your purposes.
