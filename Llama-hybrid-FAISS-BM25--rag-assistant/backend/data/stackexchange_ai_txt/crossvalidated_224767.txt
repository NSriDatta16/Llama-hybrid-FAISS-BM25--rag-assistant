Number of false positives after Bonferroni or FDR

Let's say I am doing 100,000 tests. If the tests are independent, at an alpha of 0.05, we would expect (on average) 5000 of these tests to be false positives. The Bonferroni method would penalize alpha by the number of tests being conducted. So, for 100,000 tests, I would have a very small (corrected) alpha (0.05/100000) for each of the tests. FDR would control for the proportions of false positives. One would sort all the observed p values and then check if the p value is less than (rank number/100000)*0.05. In both the above case, we get a corrected alpha value which we use for individual tests. However, what is the expected number of false positives that I would get at the end, after the correction? (I believe I am making a rookie mistake in understanding the concept here. Would be glad if someone could point out what that is...)
