Override dependency property value

I would like to know the best way on intercepting a DP value and scale it by a certain factor in a way as XAML friendly as possible, without subclassing the control. Just to explain better, I'm working on a behavior that manages zoom on canvas ( and derived ) objects, and I want being easy to "unscale" certain DP ( for example line thickness ) by the current scale factor, so I would like some XAML friendly way to let the user specify which property unscale, and let me intercept to apply the proper scaling factor, that I know as the agent who is providing the zoom. Thanks in advance,
