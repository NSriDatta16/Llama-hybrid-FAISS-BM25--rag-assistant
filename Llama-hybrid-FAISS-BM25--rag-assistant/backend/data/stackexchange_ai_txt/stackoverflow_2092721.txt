Is there a reason CSS doesn't support applying styles from within styles?

In CSS2 and even in the upcoming CSS3, I can't find something that would be completely natural and time-saving - applying CSS styles from within other styles, rather than from HTML. For example: .awesome-image { border: 1px #000 solid; margin: 2px; } .super-awesome-image { .alwesome-image; // or something like that - this is similar to a function call in a functional language padding: 2px; } Oftentimes, one doesn't have access to generated HTML, so modifying CSS is the only choice. This sort of inheritance support would make life a lot easier because we'd be able to treat CSS rules as "functions" and reuse the code rather than duplicate it. Or am I missing something and CSS does support this (I've never seen it before?) or plans on supporting it? Enlighten me please. Edit: Consider another example which shows that declaring .awesome-image, .super-awesome-image {common rules} is not elegant: .border5 { border-radius:5px; -moz-border-radius:5px; -webkit-border-radius:5px } I would much rather not pile up every other class that would want to have a border radius in the same definition. Alas, that's what needs to be done without functional support (I mentioned a lot of times there's only access to the CSS file and not the HTML itself).
