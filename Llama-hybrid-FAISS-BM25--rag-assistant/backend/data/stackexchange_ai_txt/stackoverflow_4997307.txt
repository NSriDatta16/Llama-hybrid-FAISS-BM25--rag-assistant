Integrating DotNetNuke with an existing web site

As part of a redesign for one of my clients I'd like to move them to DotNetNuke to gain the CMS and blogging features. Their existing site has some custom ecommerce functionality that an off-the-shelf package just can't handle, so I'm inclined to leave it and just re-skin to match the new site. The challenge is making this all fit together. I could create two physical web sites in IIS, for example: www.website.com and shop.website.com This would keep things isolated, but I see a problem with the SSL certificate. It's tied to www.website.com , so now I'd either need two -- one for www. and one for shop. -- or I need a wildcard certificate. Either adds ongoing expenses for the client. Can you think of any other, more elegant approaches? I could try to encapsulate the existing site into a DNN module, but that seems like a lot of work. I could also try doing something tricky with iframes, but again I think this would just further complicate things. Hopefully one of you can think of something I haven't. Thanks!
