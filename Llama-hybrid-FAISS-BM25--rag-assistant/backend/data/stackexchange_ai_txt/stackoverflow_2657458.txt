Obey the MediaBox/CropBox in PDF when using Ghostscript to render a PDF to a PNG

I've been using Ghostscript to convert my single figure plots rendered in PDF to PNG: gswin32c -sDEVICE=png16m -r300x300 -sOutputFile=junk.png ^ -dBATCH -dNOPAUSE Figure_001-a.pdf This works in the sense I get a PNG out and it contains the plot. But it contains a huge amount of white space as well (an example source image: http://cdsweb.cern.ch/record/1258681/files/Figure_001-a.pdf ). If you view it in Acrobat you'll note there is no white space around the plot. If you use the above command line you'll find the plot is only about 1/3 of the space. When doing the same thing with an EPS file I run into the same problem. However, there is the command-line parameter -dEPSCrop that one can pass to get the PS rendering engine to pay attention to the BoundingBox. I need the similar argument for rendering PDFs. I was not able to find it in docs (nor even the -dEPSCrop , actually).
