Faster R-CNN - why do we need a classifier after the region proposal network?

It is my understanding that the region proposal network performs both classification, to find out if a certain box contains foreground or background, and regression, to fine tune the locations of the boxes. In that case,why do we need an additional classifier after the RPN? The classification has already been performed.
