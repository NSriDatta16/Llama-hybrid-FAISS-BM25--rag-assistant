If you analyse the data using an ordinary generalised linear model this is what you get: > y group summary(glm(cbind(y, 15 - y) ~ group, binomial)) Call: glm(formula = cbind(y, 15 - y) ~ group, family = binomial) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -2.37472 -0.51306 -0.08459 0.80810 1.57631 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 0.4501 0.1059 4.250 2.14e-05 *** group2 -0.4661 0.1479 -3.151 0.00163 ** --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 (Dispersion parameter for binomial family taken to be 1) Null deviance: 51.401 on 49 degrees of freedom Residual deviance: 41.403 on 48 degrees of freedom AIC: 200.93 Number of Fisher Scoring iterations: 3 As you can see, the deviance of 41.4 is smaller than it's expected value of 48 under $H_0$, so if anything, this indicates a slight tendency for these data to be underdispersed. Such underdispersion would be expected if there is little heterogeneity between test takers within each group (say, no heterogeneity for the sake of the following argument) but heterogeneity instead between questions. The variance of the score would then be $$ \operatorname{Var}(\sum_{j=1}^{15} I_j)=\sum_{j=1}^{15}p_j(1-p_j) \le 15\bar p(1-\bar p), $$ where $\bar p=\frac1{15}\sum_{j=1}^{15}p_j$ (the average probability of correct answer across all questions), that is, smaller than expected based on the binomial model. This assumes that all test takes are given the same set of questions. Also note the significant group difference.
