Text-based one-on-one chat with Flash interface: what to power the backend?

I'm building a website where I hook people up so that they can anonymously vent to strangers. You either choose to be a listener, or a talker, and then you get catapulted into a one-on-one chat room. The reason for the app's construction is because you often can't vent to friends, because your deepest vulnerabilities can often be leveraged against you later on. (Like it or not, this is a part of human nature. Sad.) I'm looking for some insight into how I should architect everything. I found this neat tutorial, http://giantflyingsaucer.com/blog/?p=875 , which suggests using python & stackless + flash. Someone else suggested I should try using p2p sockets, but I don't even know where to begin to look for info on that. Any other suggestions? I'd like to keep it simple. :^)
