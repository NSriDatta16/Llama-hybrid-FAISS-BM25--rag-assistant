We at the Softwareschneiderei have several XFDs in place: - a lamp (no lava) - a portable fountain - a led bar - loudspeakers - wall-mounted displays - the infamous USB rocket launcher you can read about them on our blog: http://schneide.wordpress.com/category/extreme-feedback/ So far, we find the lamp the most useful, but the portable fountain is considered the "coolest" one. The led bar is the device needing the least explanation. The rocket launcher is battery powered and needs the most attention (reloading!). This year, we introduce at least one new device.
