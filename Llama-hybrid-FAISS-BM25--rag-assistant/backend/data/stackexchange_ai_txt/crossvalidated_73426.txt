Growing Self-Organizing Map for mixed-type data

I am trying to write code to build a growing SOM for mixed-type data. I came across a paper Growing Self-Organizing Map with cross insert for mixed-type data ( http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568494612001731 ). It was very interesting and handled both categorical and numeric data in a unified way. However, my dataset has variables/attributes that can have multiple values (for example: attribute "interests" can have more than one value - movies, sports, and so on...). I got stuck at handling such attributes. Any inputs how to handle attributes with sets of values in a mixed-type dataset? References to material that talk about this problem would be greatly appreciated.
