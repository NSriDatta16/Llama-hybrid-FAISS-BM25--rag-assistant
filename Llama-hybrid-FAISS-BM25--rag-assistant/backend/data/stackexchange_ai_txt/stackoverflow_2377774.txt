How to get List view like Vista/Windows7

Using: Visual Studio 2005, .net 2.0 Can we get the features of list view as seen in Vista/Window7 OS (file/folders details view): When mouse is over a row its highlighted. Problem: if i set HotTracking = true, the items are shown underlined, also mouse cursor changed. Dragging select multiple items. Problem: [Multiple Select = true, FullRowSelect = true] Only the first column allows to drag-select items. Other columns doesn't. The nice look and feel. How to get these facilities ?
