Having now done some more study on this problem I have found that this is actually a distribution that has received quite a lot of attention in the mathematical literature. The general problem is called the "classical occupancy problem" and the resulting distribution of the number of occupied groups is called the "occupancy distribution". This distribution has been studied in detail (see e.g., Johnson and Kotz 1977; Kolchin et al 1978). The mass function is: $$p_K(k) = \frac{(m)_k \cdot S(n,k)}{m^n} \quad \quad \quad \text{for all } 1 \leqslant K \leqslant \min (m,n),$$ where the values $(m)_k = m (m-1) \cdots (m-k+1)$ are the falling factorials . This distribution is included in some books on discrete distributions, but it is more obscure than the standard discrete distributions, and as a result, it is not well-known. Nevertheless, the distribution has been studied in great detail and its moments and generating functions are known. Moments: The form of the distribution leads to a simple formula for the expected falling factorials: $$\mathbb{E}((m-K)_r) = (m)_r \Big( 1-\frac{r}{m} \Big)^n.$$ Since $(K)_r$ is a polynomial of degree $r$ in $K$ , this leads to corresponding results for the raw and central moments. These get very messy for the higher-order moments, but the formulae for the mean and variance are fairly simple: $$\begin{equation} \begin{aligned} \mathbb{E}(K) &= m \bigg[ 1 - \Big( 1-\frac{1}{m} \Big)^n \bigg], \\[8pt] \mathbb{V}(K) &= m \bigg[ (m-1) \Big( 1-\frac{2}{m} \Big)^n + \Big( 1-\frac{1}{m} \Big)^n - \Big( 1-\frac{1}{m} \Big)^{2n} \bigg]. \\[6pt] \end{aligned} \end{equation}$$ Asymptotic results: There are various well-known limiting results that look at the asymptotic form of the distribution as $m \rightarrow \infty$ and $n \rightarrow \infty$ . Results depend on the "domain of convergence", but for a broad limiting domain the distribution of the number of empty cells converges to either a normal distribution or a Poisson distribution (see Kolchin et al 1978, Ch 4). For finite parameter values the Poisson approximation suffers from the fact that it constrains the variance, so it it a poor approximation except for very large $n$ . Nevertheless, for very large $n$ we have: $$m-K \sim \text{Pois}(m \cdot e^{-n/m}).$$ The normal approximation is generally a preferable approximation, since it allows freedom of the mean and variance. For large $n$ and $m$ we have the approximation: $$K \sim \text{N}(\mu = \mathbb{E}(K), \sigma^2 = \mathbb{V}(K)).$$ References Johnson, N.L. and Kotz, S. (1977) Urn Models and their Applications .
