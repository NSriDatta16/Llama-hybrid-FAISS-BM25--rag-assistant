According to this benchmark: http://www.dragonsteelmods.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=6120&Itemid=38&limit=1&limitstart=4 (Last image on the page) On an Intel Q6600, inter-core latency is 32 nanoseconds. Network latency is measured in milliseconds which 1,000,000 milliseconds / nanosecond. "Good" network latency is considered around or under 100ms, so given that, the difference is about the order of 1 million times faster for inter-core latency. Besides latency though there's also Bandwidth to consider. Again based on the linked bookmark, benchmark for that particular configuration, inter-core bandwidth is about 14GB/sec whereas according to this: http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gigabit-ethernet-bandwidth,2321-3.html , real-world test of a Gigabit ethernet connection shows about 35.8MB/sec so the difference there is smaller, only on the order of around 500 times faster in terms of bandwidth as opposed to a 1,000,000 times in latency. Depending on which is more important to your application that might change your numbers.
