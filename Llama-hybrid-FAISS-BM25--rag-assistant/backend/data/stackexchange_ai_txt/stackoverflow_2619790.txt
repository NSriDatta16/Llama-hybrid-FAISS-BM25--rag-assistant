I've been using VMs as a development environment for a long time. There's nothing inherently wrong with it, and it presents lots of benefits. Ensuring a consistent environment Separating file systems for different backup scenarios Added security Potentially gives developers access to more raw computing power. There is a lot of innovation in the VM world, as evidenced by the growing popularity of VM farms, hardware support for virtualization, and controlled "turnkey" solutions, like MS's VirtualPC images for testing browser compatibility and the TurnKey set of appliances . As others have said, your issues are probably due to insufficient hardware or sub-optimal configurations. Development environment runs slower than normal (host OS is windows XP so memory is limited) This should not be noticeable. XP vs. Windows Vista or Win7 is a marginal comparison. I would check the amount of physical RAM allocated to the VM. Switching between DEV machine and Email/Office machine is a pain, simple things like cut and paste are made harder. This is less efficient from a usability perspective. There are VM-specific optimizations/configurations that can make these tasks seamless. I would consult your VM maintenance staff. Mouse in particular doesn't seem to work properly using VMWare player or RDP. Again, should be seamless, but consult VM staff. Need a separate login to Dev/Test network/domain I would see this as a business decision: your company could obviously set up virtual machines with the same domain poicies as your own personal workstation, but may have other (big brother?) purposes for forcing you to login separately. As far as using VM's as an agent of control, I think there are better solutions, like well-designed authorization controls around the production machines. There's nothing like paper trails to make people behave themselves.
