I would highly recommend to use a Repeater instead of datagridview and render as many columns as you want. .aspx code .aspx.vb code rptDayHeaders.DataSource = daysList rptDayHeaders.DataBind() where dayslist needs to be an array of the number of columns you want. We have used the same approach to generate a complete Gantt Chart
