What is your or your company's programming process?

I'm looking for process suggestions, and I've seen a few around the site. What I'd love to hear is what you specifically use at your company, or just you and your hobby projects. Any links to other websites talking about these topics is certainly welcome! Some questions to base an answer off of: How do users report bugs/feature requests to you? What software do you use to keep track of them? How do bugs/feature requests get turned into "work"? Do you plan the work? Do you have a schedule? Do you have specs and follow them? How detailed are they? Do you have a technical lead? What is their role? Do they do any programming themselves, or just architecture/mentoring? Do you unit test? How has it helped you? What would you say your coverage is? Do you code review? When working on a tight deadline, does code readability suffer? Do you plan to go back later and clean it up? Do you document? How much commenting do you or your company feel comfortable with? (Description of class, each method and inside methods? Or just tricky parts of the code?) What does your SCM flow look like? Do you use feature branches, tags? What does your "trunk" or "master" look like? Is it where new development happens, or the most stable part of your code base?
