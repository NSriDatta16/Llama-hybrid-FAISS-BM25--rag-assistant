How to find straight line minimizing the sum of squares of Euclidean distances from the points?

I have recordings of intensities of two fluorescent antibodies on a 2d image $2^{10} \times 2^{10}$ pixels in size, giving me $2^{20}$ pairs of numbers. What is the best way to find the best straight line approximation in the plane, in the sense that the sum of squares of Euclidean distances from the points to the straight line is minimized? Is this given by PCA? What is "orthogonal regression"? Is PCA the same as "orthogonal regression"?
