multiple column selection with aggregate function in LINQ dictionary

I was unable to cope with converting this Sql Query to Linq Expression SELECT IdVehicle, AVG(Kilometers) FROM [Fuel] GROUP BY IdVehicle, CONVERT(NVARCHAR, Fuel.Time, 102) Rows are inserted into this table when someone fills fuel into vehicle. Kilometers are read from tachograph. It's possible to fill fuel twice a day so I need average value. Ideally, LINQ result would be Dictionary. I would really appreciate any suggestion.
