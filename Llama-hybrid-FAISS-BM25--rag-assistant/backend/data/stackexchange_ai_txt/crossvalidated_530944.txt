What test to use in order to conclude that a number of seeds/experiments is enough?

When performing a series of replicas for an experiment with a stochastic component (e.g. a Monte Carlo experiment, training a machine learning model, etc.) and averaging the results - how can I determine that I can stop at that number of replicas? Is there a statistical test to determine, say, that after running n replicas of an experiment and getting the result μ n ±σ that the results of running N replicas (with N>>n ) would average μ N such as μ n -σ N n +σ with probability p ?
