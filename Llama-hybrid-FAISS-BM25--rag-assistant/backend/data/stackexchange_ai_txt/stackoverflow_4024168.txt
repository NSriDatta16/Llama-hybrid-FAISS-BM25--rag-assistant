rendering a photoshop style brush in openGL

I have lines that are programmatically defined by my program. what I want to do is render a brush stroke along them. the way I think the type of brush I want works is, it simply has a texture, mostly transparent, and what you do is, render this texture centered on EVERY PIXEL in the path, and they blend together to create the stroke. now assuming this even works, I'm going to make a bet that it will be WAY too expensive (targeting the ipad and other mobile chips, which HATE fillrate and alpha blending) so, what other options are there? if it could be done in realtime (that is, the path spline updating every frame) that would be ideal. but if not, within a fraction of a second on the ipad would be good too (the splines connect nodes, the user can drag nodes around thus transforming the spline, but it would be acceptable to revert to a simpler fill for the spline while it was moving around, then recalculate the brush once they release it) for those wondering, I'm trying to get it so the thick lines look like they have been made with a pencil. it should look as real life as possible. I considered just rendering the brushed spline to a texture, but as the spline can be any length, in any direction, dedicating a WHOLE rectangular texture to encompass the whole spline would be way to costly... the spline is inevitably broken up into quads for rendering, so I thought of initially rendering the brush to a texture, then generating an optimized texture with each of the quads separated and packed as neatly as possible into the texture. but two renders to texture... algorithm to create the optimized texture, making it so the quads still seamlessly blend with each other... sounds like a nightmare, and thats not even making it realtime. so yeah, any ideas on how to draw thick, pencil like lines that follow a spline in real time on the ipad in openGL?
