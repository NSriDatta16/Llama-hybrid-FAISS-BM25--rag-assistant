Future proof file storage

I accept file uploads from users. Each file has a pointer in the db which has info on the file location in the filesystem. Currently, I'm storing the files in the filesystem non categorically, and each file is currently just named a unique value. All categorisation and naming etc is done in the app using the db. A factor that I'm concerned about is that of file synchronization issues. If I wanted to set up file system synchronization where, for example, the user's files are automatically updated by bridging with a pc app, would this system still work well? I have no idea how such a system would work so hopefully I can get some input. Basically, is representing a file's name and location purely in the database optimal, especially if said file may be synchronized with a pc application?
