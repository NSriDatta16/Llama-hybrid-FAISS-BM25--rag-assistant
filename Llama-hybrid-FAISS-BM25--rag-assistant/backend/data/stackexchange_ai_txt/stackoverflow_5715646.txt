Cassandra public IP not connecting

I'm using cassandra in ubuntu server. when I try to connect using CLI with public IP address, It returns connection refused. whereas If I tried with localhost, its working fine. I made the configuration changes in cassandra.yaml and storage-conf.xml. but still I have the problem. What change should be done ? Thanks in advance.. s..I have connecting the server using ssh.
