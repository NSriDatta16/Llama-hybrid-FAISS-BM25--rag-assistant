You need to do use { } around the things that you are embedding into the SQL that are PHP. I think this should work. I always do this as I have found it saves me time debugging as it seems to pop up somewhat frequently. $result = mysql_query("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM accounts WHERE registration_ip = '{$_SERVER[REMOTE_ADDR]}' AND created > ".({time()} - 3600)); If this doesn't work, save your query into a variable, echo it to the page to see what it is sending. $sql = "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM accounts WHERE registration_ip = '{$_SERVER[REMOTE_ADDR]}' AND created > ".({time()} - 3600)"; echo $sql;
