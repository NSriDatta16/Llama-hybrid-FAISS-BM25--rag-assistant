Entity Framework DDD using partial class -persistance ignorance -testability

I want to use Entity Framework and autogenerated classes in my application. I'm not interested on: persistance ignorance testing I only care about one thing: keep the application well organized keep things simple I read about Domain Drive Design and I'm interested on it because it claim to simplify complex applications. But when I read code from real application example I get shocked by the complexity of this approach. My idea is to use partial classes to extend the classes generated from EF. Ther is someone that try this approach and can give me some advice?
