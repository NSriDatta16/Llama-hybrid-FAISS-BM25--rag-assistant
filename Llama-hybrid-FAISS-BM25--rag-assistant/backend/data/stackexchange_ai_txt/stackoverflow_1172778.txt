For Q query words of average length L bytes on large texts of size T bytes, you need something that's NOT O(QLT). You need a DFA-style approach which can give you O(T) ... after setup costs. If your query set is rather static, then the setup cost can be ignored. E.g. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aho-Corasick_algorithm which points to a C-extension for Python: http://hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu/~dyoo/python/ahocorasick/
