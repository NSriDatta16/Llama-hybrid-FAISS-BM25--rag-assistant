SELECT AVG(NumQuestions) FROM ( SELECT COUNT(*) AS NumQuestions FROM Questions WHERE ResponseID IS NULL AND Question_Date >= '2010-06-01' GROUP BY Question_Date ) AS MySubquery On second thought: This is silly. If you want to know the average number of questions per day since a given day, you may as well just count the number of questions (simple) and then divide by the number of days that have elapsed since then. Also, the above query gives inaccurate results if there are days on which nobody asked a question.
