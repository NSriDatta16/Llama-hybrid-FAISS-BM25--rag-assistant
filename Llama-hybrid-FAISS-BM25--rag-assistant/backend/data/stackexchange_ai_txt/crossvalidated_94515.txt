Validating assumed distributions in parametric models

When using a model that assumes a specific distribution of data, I get confused about how seriously I need to check for the assumption. For example, if we use some statistical test (e.g., based on p-value) for the validation, I think we should almost always reject null if sample size is large. For example, no matter how well the size of some organisms may follow a normal distribution, it is not a normal distribution for a variety of reason (e.g., it cannot be a negative value; measured values are never truly continuous because of the precision of measurement tools, etc.). I want to know what the correct attitude is for the validation of parametric assumptions.
