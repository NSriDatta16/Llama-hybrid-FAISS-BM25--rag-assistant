Why is my data not normally distributed while I have an almost perfect QQ plot and histogram?

I am doing a thesis and I am stuck with my statistics on time series data. And when I run a Shapiro test, or any test, it says: Statistics=0.998, p=0.000 Sample does not look Gaussian (reject H0) And that it is not normally distributed. But when I look to my QQ plot and histogram the data looks normally distributed. And even when it would not pass the test, it is strange that it results in p = 0.000. I also have two other groups where the QQ plot and histogram looks way worse than this one, but the tests say those are normally distributed. I am looking in my script, but I canâ€™t find any mistakes so far. Is it likely that there is something wrong or is it very normal for this data to be nonparametric (even with this graphs)? I am using Python btw, not R. QQ plot: Histogram: PS. I also have a box plot:
