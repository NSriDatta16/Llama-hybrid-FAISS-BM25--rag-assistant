First of all, I love WPF! I don't see any elegant/immediate way to achieve the same functionality and flexibility for designing interfaces in WinForms... That said, it is very sad to see that WPF is not anymore in favor inside Microsoft. Actually some people, including 'insiders' have stated that MS has shifted focus form WPF, and the Silverlight is now THE Windows Phone 7 application framework (not something to supplant Flash anymore): http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/09/09/microsoft_html_5/ Many people, including the current WPF Leader, denies this, but I see that this may actually have some truth behind. HTML5 is certainly going to become the "de facto" standard for rich (web)client interfaces. It overlaps so much with WPF, and does many other things too. It can "easily" be extended to work for non-web rich-client applications, and I believe MS will invest in that to have the lead in development tools for both web, mobile and windows targets. I would not fear abandonment if I was already in the middle of a WPF project, but I wouldn't start one in WPF either as many have already said: it is not that simple to abandon something like WPF without giving a migration path and supporting it for many years. So, current alternatives for WPF in the MS world? I don't think we have one already, maybe using its subset in Silverlight is the way to go for now. But, in the upcoming years HTML5 will probably be THE alternative to WPF.
