I agree with Mark Byers, it's a bit too ambitious for a 1-month project. Anyways, you may want to check out NERO (Neuro-Evolving Robotic Operatives), which is a game based on Ken Stanley's algorithm NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies). You may also want to have a look at Stanley's papers: Evolving Neural Networks Through Augmenting Topologies (PDF) Efficient Reinforcement Learning Through Evolving Neural Network Topologies (PDF) Real-Time Learning in the NERO Video Game (PDF) Several implementations of NEAT exist for different languages, so that may be a start.
