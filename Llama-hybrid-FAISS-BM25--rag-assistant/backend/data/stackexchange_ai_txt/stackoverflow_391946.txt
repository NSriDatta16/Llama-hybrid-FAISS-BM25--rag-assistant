Where to find good examples or Templates for Configuration Management Plans?

Documentation is not the favorite area of a developer but an important area to fulfill if you want to have standards in the organization. We are trying to put together a new Configuratio Mgmt Plan to setup Change Controls, Backups strategies and other fun things, like the process from development, staging to production. I will like to have your opinions on good examples or probably a good start for CMP process.
