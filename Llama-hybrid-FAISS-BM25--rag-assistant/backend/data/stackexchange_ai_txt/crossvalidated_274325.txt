How to test the statistical significance of the difference between two ARPPUs?

I have run an A/B test on the ARPPU (Average return per paying user) of two versions of a checkout page and hence I now have two ARPPUs, say x and y. The question is whether or not the difference between x and y is large enough to call it statistically significant. As I did the test via Google Analytics I do not have the raw data generating the two ARPPUs and hence the t-test and the Mann-Whitney U test are not feasible. What to do?
