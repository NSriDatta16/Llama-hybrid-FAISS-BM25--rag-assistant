How is plot of p-values distribution related to calculation of the false discovery rate?

I'm running t-tests for all combinations of pairwise comparisons of average length of stay for patients among 30 hospitals. My first approach was to use a Bonferroni corrected significance level of .05/(30*29/2) = .05/435 = .00011. However this is setting the bar a bit high for rejection. Therefore, as suggested in Schweder and Spjotvoll's 1982 article, I first estimated the number of true null hypotheses by plotting the ranked values for (1 - p-value) from all 435 t-tests and then fit a regression line on the linear portion of the plot (the first 100 scores). This required some eyeballing - not terribly rigorous. The resulting line gives me an estimate of about 140 true hypotheses (where the regression line intercepts the x = 1.00 axis), for a more liberal significance level of .05/140 = .00036. I know later research by Benjamini & Hochberg have built on Schweder and Spjotvoll's simple approach. How is estimation of the false discovery rate related to the p-value plot technique I've described, or are they equivalent?
