ondragstart is an IE-only event, that's why it is not firing in Firefox. UPDATE : it is more complicated than this, read more here: Javascript ondrag, ondragstart, ondragend if ondragstart were available in FF, you could catch it with x.ondragstart=..., it works in FF too. addEventListener is just a nicer way of assigning event handlers, it allows you to attach more than one handlers for an event to an element. IE has a sorf-of-equivalent called attachEvent. About your problem: in non-IE browsers, to make an object unselectable, you have to catch the onmousedown event and prevent the default behavior.
