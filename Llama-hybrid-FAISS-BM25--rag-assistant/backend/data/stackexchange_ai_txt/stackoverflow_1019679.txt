Why not store it using HTML Tables? It might not be the best, but you could then, very easily, view it in a browser. Edit: I just re-read the question and you're asking for data model, not a storage model. To answer that question... It all depends on how you're going to be reporting on the data. For example if you're going to be doing a lot of pivoting or aggregation it might make more sense to store it in column major order, this way you can just sum a column to get counts, for example. It'll help a lot if you explain what kind of information you're trying to extract.
