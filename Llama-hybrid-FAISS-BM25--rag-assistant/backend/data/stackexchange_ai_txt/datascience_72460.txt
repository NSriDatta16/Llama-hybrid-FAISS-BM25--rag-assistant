Machine Learning: Missing Data in Dataset and Imputer

I am a newbie in ML, and I am learning how to fill missing data in a dataset using Imputer. These are the few lines of code that I came across from sklearn.preprocessing import Imputer imputer = Imputer(missing_values = 'NaN', strategy = 'mean', axis = 0) imputer = imputer.fit(X[:, 1:3]) X[:, 1:3] = imputer.transform(X[:, 1:3]) Now I am not able to understand what is the role of the fit and the transform function. It will be great if someone can help. Thank you.
