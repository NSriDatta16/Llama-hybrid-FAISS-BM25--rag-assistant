What are assumptions for logistic binomial regression if all independent and independent variables are dichotomous?

I have three independent and one dependent variables of the dichotomous type and I am trying to use logistic binomial regression. I have 117 observations in total. When I read the literature, some of the assumptions of logistic regressions, where I am stack right now, are: - larger sample size (if I understood it correctly, the sample size should not be less than 500 according Sample Size Guidelines for Logistic Regression from Observational Studies with Large Population: Emphasis on the Accuracy Between Statistics and Parameters Based on Real Life Clinical Data ) - linearity of independent variables and log odds My question would be: What should I do if I am restricted to those 117 observations and can not have 500 samples? Is there any approach to handle this situation? Am I still allowed to use logistic regression? If not, is there any other tool? What assumptions do I need to test? Do I have to test linear dependency of independent variables to log odds, even if I am having categorical variables (with outcomes yes or no)? I appreciate your input.
