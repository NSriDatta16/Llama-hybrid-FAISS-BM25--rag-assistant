Cron job set up on multiple instances of magento

Does anybody have any experience with Magento module level cron jobs across multiple instances of the application? I know Magento adds the cron records to the cron_schedule table - would each instance of the Magento application add it's own call to the module level cron? All application instances are looking at the same database. Thanks for any insights.
