If you're building a website around photos then forget the database. If it will become popular your database is going to be hit hard and the majority of its time will be spent delivering photos. Also databases don't scale very well. There are so much more advantages in keeping them on the file system. And you can scale very well, having static content servers, using services for content delivery. Also, Amazon S3 or other cloud providers do have their advantages. For instance S3 + Amazon CloudFront will provide good performance. CloudFront caches your files on servers around the world so they'll be very easily/fast accessible from anywhere. BUT if we're talking pictures and the site becomes popular your bills might be quite high. For S3 Amazon charges per storage and per transfer in/out of the cloud. For CloudFront per transfer .
