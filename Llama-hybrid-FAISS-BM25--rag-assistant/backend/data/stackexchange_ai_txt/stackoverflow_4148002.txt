I simply want to view the contents of shopping cart in Magento

I have an observer that is ran when you view the contents of the shopping cart in Magento. I simply want to var_dump the list of product ID's. I know it probably seems like a dumb question but I can't figure it out and it will help me work out how Magento works. Thanks in advance Alex
