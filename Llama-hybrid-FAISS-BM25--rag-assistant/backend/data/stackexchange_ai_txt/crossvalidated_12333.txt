No, unfortunately you can't simply add the odds ratios. If you look up any text or reputable source on logistic regression you'll find formulas with which to estimate either the logit or the odds or the probability (depending on what's most useful to you) of admission to a given hospital, given certain values on the predictors. I agree with @Simon and would add that for multinomial regression you must have a single variable that takes 4 different values depending on the hospital--not 4 binary variables.
