Your model for estimator $\hat{p}$ is actually of a single system that was operated $n_i$ times in year $i$, $1 \leq i \leq T$, and failed $d_i$ times that year. Presumably the system was successfully repaired and restored to perfect working condition before the next time it was operated. Your model for estimator $\bar{p}$ is that of $n_i$ independent copies of Model $i$ of the system being put in operation in year $i$ and $d_i$ of those copies failing independently. You wish to estimate the average failure rate per year over $T$ years.
