What is the impact of windowing function on time series

Greeting I would like to know what is the impact of windowing functions like Hanning,... on a time series. Is it possible to finde anomalies using windowing functions? EDIT I have a time series, which contains integer values (470,471,472,472,473,471,...) I try to find anomalies in this vector of value. As I have understood, with Wavelet transform , FFT, and moving average . As I know any discontinuity between the 1st and last time sample (i.e., a jump in the value ) will contribute to the frequency spectrum in FFT, but we should use windowing to detect these anomalies. It means, I should calculate FFT for my time series and then I should run a window function like hanning or etc. on the result to find anomalies, Is it right?
