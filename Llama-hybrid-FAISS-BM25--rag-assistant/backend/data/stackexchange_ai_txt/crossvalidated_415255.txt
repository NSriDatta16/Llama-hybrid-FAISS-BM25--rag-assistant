There are several choices which must be made before running PCA on time series. First, PCA should be run using the covariance matrix and not the correlation matrix, according to what most reports suggest when running PCA on time series. The choice of covariance vs. correlation will typically introduce slight amplitude as well as phase shift differences in the resulting PC scores. Second, the standardized (scaled) PC scores should be used and not the non-standardized (unscaled) PC scores. Standardized scores are based on the loadings, which will scale the scores to the inverse of the eigenvalues, i.e., $1/\sqrt{\lambda_j}$ . The raw scores can have much larger range and scale, and for the jumpy data you have, results could yield large transitions, whereas the standardized will be tighter with much lower range. Overall, it is not recommended that you simply generate PC scores without specifying the choices described above.
