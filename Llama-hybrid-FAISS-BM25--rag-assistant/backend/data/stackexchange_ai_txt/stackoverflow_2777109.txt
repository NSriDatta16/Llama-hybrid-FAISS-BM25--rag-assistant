A good guideline is: say what you mean, unless there is good reason to do otherwise. This allocator is a global static object, and should be declared as such. Now if its state needs initializing, I would do that in the code that initializes the dynamic memory allocator -- since this is in fact part of the work of initializing the memory allocation system, this again falls under the heading of saying what you mean. That would avoid the inelegant conditional check on every call.
