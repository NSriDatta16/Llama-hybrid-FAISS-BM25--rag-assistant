Multi-part clothing store in Magento

EDIT: This has been resolved thanks to: http://www.brimllc.com/2010/12/magento-grouped-products-containing-associated-configurable-products/ The guy who runs this blog was very, very helpful. We can now add configurable products to a grouped product. Problem solved. I'm trying to do something very simple, but can't figure out how to execute. We've got a Magento store that sells lingerie. Tops and bottoms that each have their own size. So a customer could order a top in small and a bottom in medium. On the front end, I need to customer to see: Product name Top: S, M, L (dropdown) Bottom: S, M, L (dropdown) Just can't figure out how to do this in the Magento admin. Each product is entered as a simple product with the attribute "size" defined: "Small" for example. But, when I create a configurable product and select the attributes "sizes_tops" & "sizes_bottoms" it only allows me to select products that have both defined, so obviously that won't work. How on earth do I do this simply in Magento? We could also have a situation where there are two types of bottoms to choose from, like full and g-string. If there wasn't the restriction on adding simple products to a configurable product with only one of the attributes defined I'd be all set (I think anyway). Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance. EDIT: I have seen this post: How to Have a Bundled Configurable Product in Magento? classyllama.com/configurable-bundle-module - "Note: At this point, we are selling this bundle as-is. ie, we are not providing implementation support for this module. If you purchase the module and it doesn't work for your needs, we can deactivate your license and refund your money." - So it seems there is no support for the product, not very promising. mag-manager - Site does not load tinybrick- Does not fit the requirements
