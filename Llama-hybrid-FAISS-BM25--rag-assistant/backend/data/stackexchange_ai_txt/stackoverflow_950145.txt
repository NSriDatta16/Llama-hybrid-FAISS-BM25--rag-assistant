Embedding a 3-D editor (such as Blender) in a wxPython application

Is it possible to embed a 3-D editor inside my wxPython application? (I'm thinking Blender, but other suggestions are welcome.) My application opens a wxPython window, and I want to have a 3-D editor inside of it. Of course, I want my program and the 3-D editor to interact with each other. Possible? How?
