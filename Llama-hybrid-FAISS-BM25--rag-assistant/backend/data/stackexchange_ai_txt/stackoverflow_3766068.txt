the latest sdk that runs with leopard would be 3.1.3. If you install that one ( http://developer.apple.com/ios/download.action?path=/iphone/iphone_sdk_3.1.3__final/iphone_sdk_3.1.3_with_xcode_3.1.4__leopard__9m2809a.dmg ) you probably run into problems when installing the app on the phone because the old organizer does not work with newer devices. Since the 4g ipod may not be downgraded either, you're only (free, besides upgrading to snow leopard) option would be to compile the app, then ask a friend with snow leopard to install it on your ipod. Maybe your university will offer some macs to use for that, since not everyone has a mac?
