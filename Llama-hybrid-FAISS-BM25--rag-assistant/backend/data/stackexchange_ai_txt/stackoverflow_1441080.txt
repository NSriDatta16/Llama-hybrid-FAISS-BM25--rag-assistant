You're misusing the WSGI API . Please create a minimal ("hello world") function that shows this error so we can comment on your code. [Don't post your entire application, it may be too big and unwieldy for us to comment on.] The os.environ is not what you should be using. WSGI replaces this with an enriched environment. A WSGI application gets two arguments: one is a dictionary that includes 'wsgi.input' . In your code... def application(environ, start_response): try: f = cgi.FieldStorage(fp=os.environ['wsgi.input'], environ=os.environ) Per the WSGI API specification ( http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333/#specification-details ), don't use os.environ . Use environ , the first positional parameter to your application. The environ parameter is a dictionary object, containing CGI-style environment variables. This object must be a builtin Python dictionary (not a subclass, UserDict or other dictionary emulation), and the application is allowed to modify the dictionary in any way it desires. The dictionary must also include certain WSGI-required variables (described in a later section), and may also include server-specific extension variables, named according to a convention that will be described below.
