Yes this is possible, take the very basic example: say you conduct a logistic regression analysis, where you predict the binary (discrete) given a level of some toxin in the blood (continuous), so the model is $$ \Pr(Y = 1) = \mathrm{logit}^{-1}(X\beta) $$ We would use such logistic regression model to learn something about the conditional distribution $f(Y \mid X)$, so obviously, there is also $F(Y \mid X)$. If such distribution didn't exist, we wouldn't be able to deal with mixed-type data in probability and statistics (what would lead us to discovering it...).
