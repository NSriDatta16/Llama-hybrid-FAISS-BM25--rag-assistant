If you are working with tabular data where there is only a shallow data hierarchy, than an RDBMS system is probably your best choice. This is the main use for RDBMS systems, and the documentation and tool support is very good. For more nested data like xml, a document database should provide faster access to your data. Also, the storage model more closely resembles that of the data, so retrieval should be more straight forward.
