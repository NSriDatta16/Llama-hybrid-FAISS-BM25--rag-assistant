The tongue in cheek type of example is a random walk model. The asset prices in finance , or more precisely their returns $r_t$ , are often modeled as a random walk: $dr_t= \sigma^2\xi_t$ where $\xi_t\sim\mathcal N(0,1)$ . In discrete time you would say $r_{t+1}=r_t+\xi_t$ . However, this doesn't directly address your question. The reason is that causal/noncausal in time series are discussed in the context of stationary models, see e.g. these notes p.9. Here, AR(1) model such as: $x_t=\phi_1 x_{t-1}+w_t$ will be causal when $|\phi_1| and noncausal when $|\phi_1|>1$ and both cases are stationary, despite the latter being explosive . Random walk is AR(1) with $\phi_1=1$ is non stationary, so causality in this sense is meaningless to talk about, although it is not causal, neither it is noncausal . Hence, the better answer would be to point you to "bubble studies" in asset pricing literature. Frankly, I haven't seen anything that would convince me in the existence of them, but some folks look at them from different angles. The one that might be inline with what you're looking for is "Rational Bubbles in Stock Prices?" at NBER by Diba and Grossman (1988), see section 1. They start with a typical consumption model, and come to a special case where $B_t=(1+r)B_{t-1}+xi_t$ in Eq(5), where $B_t$ is the explosive component of asset prices that is usually assumed to be zero. You can also see how they deal with nonconvergence of the sum that I mentioned above: they make past finite! There's time zero of inception of stock market, see Eq(7) If you look up in Google Scholar the paper that cite this one, you'll find pretty much all bubble studies to date, e.g. Jarrow's "How to detect a bubble" gives you DIY instructions, and also claims that post IPO LinkedIn price was a bubble.
