Ok, so Likert scales are often used in psychology as continuous variables. From your question, it sounds like this is the case. What comes after really depends a LOT on what your question asks. Do you want to compare question categories in different conditions (stylized vs not) or compare emotions in different conditions (stylized vs not). Can the question categories be combined or not. This affects the way you are combining the groups together in order to calculate your sums of squares. You say that you want to compare the means of the individual questions across conditions. In which case a student T test will do. But i'm guessing the question expects more. So, if you want to calculate question categories across conditions (again, be sure that this is what you want to do), then here is a rough guide. First calculate your grand mean for each question category across both the conditions. Now take your individual values and subtract them from the grand mean. Now square it. Now add those results together. That is your total sums of squares. Next, you'll want to calculate your treatment sums of squares (sometimes called between sums of squares--i.e. between treatments). Average all the values in one question category of one condition. (adding the means of each question and dividing by how many questions is the same as adding all the individual values and dividing by the number of people, you can confirm this for yourself). Subtract your grand mean from it. Square it. Times it by how many people who have answered that question category. Repeat it for your other condition. Now add them. Now take your total sums of squares and subtract your treatment sums of squares. This is your Sums of squares error (sometimes called sums of squares within) With these three values you are ready to do an F test. Take your sum of squares treatment and divide it by (the treatment degrees of freedom) how many groups you have minus one. Now this goes on top of a fraction. Now work out the bottom of the fraction. Take your sums of squares error and divide it by (the error degrees of freedom) how many groups you have times one less than how many people you have (m*(n-1)). Work out the fraction. Now with this number, go look up an F table at 0.05, where the first degree of freedom is the treatment degrees of freedom, and the second degree of freedom is the error one. If your number is bigger than that then you have significance. Your null hypothesis from what you've written is there is no difference in mean of question categories between conditions. You reject that, and say there is a difference. This allows you to say that the question category is different across conditions. You don't know exactly which question set it off, but you might not want to know that, you just want to be able to say that, overall, there's a difference in there somewhere. You might want to planned contrasts to see where exactly that difference is. i.e. t tests. (this is why i think ANOVAs are useless because you always end up doing the contrasts anyway, so why not just do them from the start, but that's another story, courses always teach ANOVA and you will always have to learn ANOVA) Again, I wish to stress I am only going of what you've written, it is entirely possible to group them up in different ways. e.g. emotions across conditions sounds very plausible. Either way, Khan academy should really help you out, here he literally calculates an F statistic the way I have described by hand just to show you.
