No, you'll find that the compiler will automatically restore any disabled warning once it's finished parsing a source file. #pragma warning disable 649 struct MyInteropThing { int a; int b; } #pragma warning restore 649 In the above example I've turned of warning CS00649 because I intend to use this struct in an unsafe manner. The compiler will not realize that I will be writing to memory that has this kind of layout so I'll want to ignore the warning: Field 'field' is never assigned to, and will always have its default value 'value' But I don't want the entire file to not be left unchecked.
