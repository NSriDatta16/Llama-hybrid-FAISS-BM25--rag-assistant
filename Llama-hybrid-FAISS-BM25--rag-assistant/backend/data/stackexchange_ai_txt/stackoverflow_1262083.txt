PHPUnit getMock() with namespace

My quest of starting to use namespaces in PHP keeps continuing. This time PHPUnit gives me problems. My setup() method is like this: $test = new \MyNamespace\NonPersistentStorage(); // works $mock = $this->getMock('\\MyNamespace\\NonPersistentStorage'); // doesn't work The getMock() method only results in PHP looking for a NonPersistentStorage class. Not within the namespace. Q: What do I need to change to get the getMock() method look for the class in the namespace? Edit: The double backslash is not the problem. Also see: the manual : (quote) 'Inside a single-quoted string, the backslash escape sequence is much safer to use, but it is still recommended practice to escape backslashes in all strings as a best practice.' edit: What worked for me is in the comments of the answer of Ignace R.
