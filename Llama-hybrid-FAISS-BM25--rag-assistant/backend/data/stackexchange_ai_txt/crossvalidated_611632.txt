One concern is, since users' span of activity do not universally cover the observed periods that the assumption of parallel trends is violated - or would that only be the case if the span of activity differs between the groups? Neither is necessarily true. I would imagine coverage is limited at the edges of your panel, but I can't verify this without more information. In a perfect world, you want lots of observations around the intervention months. In many studies, it's common to observe wider confidence intervals on the period-specific effects as we progress through time. Oftentimes this is because users may attrit as we move farther and farther away from the immediate intervention month. I'm still curious about a few things. How many users subscribe late? What proportion have no pre-intervention usage data? Must a subscriber show some usage before they receive the intervention? These questions aren't being posed to engender confusion. Rather, you should start thinking about how much coverage is going to be a concern in your study. That being said, in a setting with over 20,000 users, I wouldn't worry about it too much. Another concern (but from my understanding it should be handled by the fixed effects approach) is that a user's group assignment is to some degree influenced by BaseUsageScore . The individual fixed effects already adjust for users' base usage scores. Should I be trying to control for this disparity outside of the model above? The individual fixed effects adjust for all time-constant attributes of the individual users. This allows for the selection of users into treatment on the basis of time-invariant characteristics (e.g., race, gender, height, etc.). Age is a constant change regressor and won't offer you much traction, especially with less than two years of data. You also won't be able to hold apart age from any other factor that is changing at a constant rate as well, a point already made quite elegantly here . On the other hand, grouping users (e.g., age cohorts) and estimating heterogeneous treatment effects by age may be worthwhile, but outside the scope of your question. And note that even though you're "adjusting for" stable user demographics (even those you haven't thought of), this does not absolve you from demonstrating parallel outcome paths before the intervention. Though average "level" differences in any one month are allowable, you still must convincingly argue that the level differences in base scores do not affect trends over time. Put differently, while average usage between the treatment and control group may be higher or lower in any one month, their evolution through time (i.e., month-over-month) is what really matters. The group trajectories over time should be reasonably similar.
