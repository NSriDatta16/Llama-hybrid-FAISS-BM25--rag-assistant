Old thread but I'm adding this for others who may come across it. Cross correl is a fantastic tool for observing whether peaks in one series kind of 'lead' peaks in another series, so if you think there may be a predictor and response, but syncopated. For 24 observations it's fine, but your critical values (to be judged significant) are just higher, like with p-values for t-tests. Very useful but since the two datasets can't be a predictor and different variable response, maybe not in this case. For short time-series, arima needs 16 observations. It does show seasonality, dependance on adjacent observations, moving averages, etc. brilliant tool and spss has good tutorials. Minitab and SPSS pretty easy to use. Don't be put off by expertise, just give these things a try if you have time to read up, and they help you understand you data even if you don't use the eventual models.
