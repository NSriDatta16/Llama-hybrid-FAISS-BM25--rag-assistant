This question seems like a mix-up between two situations Conjugate prior available: The marginal distribution is known and we have it (of course in some situations, you have some integral in there when you talk about some general conjugate prior for a GLM). No conjugate prior available: The marginal distribution is usually not available analytically, but this does not matter so much if we do MCMC sampling, which only requires the likelihood and the prior density. Of course people sometimes introduce the general situation (and have in my that for practical problems you'll end up doing MCMC sampling) by starting with conjugate priors. They will then sometimes not go into all the nice properties/analytical solutions/what you can do with mixtures of conjugate priors etc., because in practice you can rarely use these things - even if in the particular situation they would be applicable.
