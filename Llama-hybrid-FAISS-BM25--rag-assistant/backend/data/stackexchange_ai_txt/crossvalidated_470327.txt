Use deep learning to predict the continuation of one time series given another

I have this problem I'm trying to solve.. I have 2 highly correlated time series (lets call them $A$ & $B$ ), however past a certain date I only have data for A. I would like to use $A$ to predict what happened to $B$ during that time.. I've seen many times RNNs (mostly LSTM) are being used for time-series prediction, however its always prediction of the same time series... Is there a way to use deep learning (maybe combined with something else) in order to make a prediction for $B$ but still use the useful data we have from $A$ in the process? To continue this discussion..lets say I have 1000 pairs of time series: $S_1 = (A_1,B_1),.......,S_{1000} = (A_{1000},B_{1000})$ . In all of them $(A_i,B_i)$ are highly correlated and $A_i$ has 20 (just as an example) more days then $B_i$ These time series are not all going on at the same time but I want to use the knowledge learned from each pair of time series to train a hypothetical model. There is also some measure of similarity between all $S_i$ s to tell given a new series, $S_{1001}$ , how relevant is each of the previous $S_i$ s towards making prediction for $B_{1001}$ 's missing values. Can I use all this to make a deep learning model to predict $B_{1001}$ 's 20 missing values (given $A_{1001}$ )? Is the problem now more suited for deep learning?
