If your goal is to show group differences on an outcome (Y), there's no benefit to including a covariate unless it's relevant to (correlated with) Y. But you have to carefully think things through. There are times when controlling for a covariate serves to "equalize," making for a fairer comparison (in addition to increasing the precision of an analysis). There are other times when, regardless of any purely statistical results, attempting to equalize creates a bizarre scenario (and this relates to @Jeromy's last point). Suppose we simplify by saying that controlling for a covariate entails adjusting each group so that it is treated as if it were average with respect to the covariate. But what if Group A could never be average on that variable without losing something that is essential to "Group A-ness"? This is a tricky area of statistics and a controversial one. Recipe-oriented textbooks--those that focus on procedures at the expense of concepts--tend to gloss over it. I'll bet the Pocock et al. article is a good one; I'd search around for others, or look into books by reflective authors like James Davis, Geoffrey Keppel or Elazar Pedhazur. There's also good info on this topic at this thread
