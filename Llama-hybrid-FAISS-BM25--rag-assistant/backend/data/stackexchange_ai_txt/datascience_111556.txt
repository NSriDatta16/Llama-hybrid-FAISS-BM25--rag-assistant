Merging two datasets with different features for machine learning prediction

I'm trying to create a model which predicts Real estate prices with xgboost in machine learning, my question is : Can i combine two datasets to do it ? First dataset : 13 features Second dataset : 100 features Thé différence between the two datasets is that the first dataset is Real estate transaction from 2018 to 2021 with features like area , région And the second is also transaction but from 2011 to 2016 but with more features like balcony, rénovation, and Much more features which are not present in thé first dataset The idea is that i need the first dataset because it's New and actual with New prices inflation And i need the second because i need to include balcony and more features like 5 features only in my prédiction. Can i do that ? And what is the best approach to replace the missing features in first dataset which exist only in the second dataset
