Make sure the exclusiveTouch property is set to NO. NO is the default, though. The 'userInteractionEnabled` property can also "turn off" touch handlers for a given view. I believe this also affects its subviews though... you would have to check. lastly, you can override the touch handlers, touchesBegan:withEvent: etc., to pass their touch events to the views below it. (this is much more work however) In practice, a top level view that holds the buttons seems like the most practical thing to do, especially if you don't have to worry about things moving around underneath you.
