It depends on which kind of task you want to perform at the end. From what I understood from your question, you have emails with same pattern occurring in the beginning as well as at the end. You want to perform a classification tasks on the emails based on the real sense of email excluding subject and conclusion. There are multiple ways you can do this, for example as follows: You can use Active Learning in order to classify the emails based on little human intervention for each batch or iteration. Before that you will have to first properly preprocess the emails using any regex library. Active learning need some of user input in order to control the model understanding for each batch of emails. You can also use an unsupervised learning methodology like Topic Modeling (LDA, LSA) which yields an cluster of emails with patterns detected by the model as topic. The topic is full proof or evidence for model to cluster those email. I think this is what you actually need. Topic model . You can use a Bidirectional context extraction model like BERT or ELMO to get document representation and later you would map to its' label. I hope this explanation will help to you.
