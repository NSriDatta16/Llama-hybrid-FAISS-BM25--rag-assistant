Is it possible to calculate a standard deviation from the gini coefficient and mean?

I am looking to create an analysis showing how many people in a given country have more than than X dollars in income. I know the average income, population count, and Gini Coefficient of income disparity. Is it possible to back into X with those three data points? Thank you so much in advance and apologies is this is a stupid question. -Andrew
