Synthetic data generation - GANs vs Simulator?

For synthetic data generation, does the GAN perform better than a simulator? If so, what are the limitations of the simulator? If we consider Conditional GANs, we could generate data based on the condition provided to CGAN. So, in this case, is it still better to use GANs instead of a simulator? Thanks in advance.
