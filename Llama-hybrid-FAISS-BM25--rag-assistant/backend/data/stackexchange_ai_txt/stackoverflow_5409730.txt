wpf TabControl, possible to organize each tab in a different class?

Basically on my mainWindow Class it's getting crowded. My main question would be how to add the events on another class ? So I tried adding a tabControl ... and wondering if each tabs control can be in a separate xaml and/or class. an example would be much appreciated ;P Thanks
