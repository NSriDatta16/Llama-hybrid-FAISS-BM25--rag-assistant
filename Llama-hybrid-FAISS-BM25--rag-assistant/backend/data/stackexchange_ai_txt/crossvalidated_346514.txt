Tagging NA value in a continues variable

I'm using Random Forest model to predict academic success. As far as I know RF doesn't work with NAs. One variable is a grade in a certain course, which is not mandatory for the students, thus some don't have a grade at it. Now, this variable is important to me because I want to find whether this specific course have any effect on the academic success. But, 0/1 dummy variable is not good enough for I need to distinguish between the grades of those who did participate. So far, the only solution I can think of is to put "-1" value instead of the "NA", however, I never saw anyone doing such a thing - can it cause issues? How can I solve this problem?
