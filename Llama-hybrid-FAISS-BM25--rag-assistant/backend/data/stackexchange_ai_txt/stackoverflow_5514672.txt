NetBeans is no longer generating a JAR file for code that it used to

Two years ago I wrote a simple upload applet using Java, developed using NetBeans. When I first hit "Clean and Build" back then, and for some time afterwards, it worked perfectly. It would run through the build process and produce a JAR file that I could then upload to my web server, and the applet worked great. Now, as I'm going back in and making some slight modifications to this applet, it no longer produces the JAR file when I hit "Clean & Build." The actual code changes I made are so minute that I can guarantee they would have no bearing on this (literally just changing the contents of a few strings). I know that since the time I originally built this applet my NetBeans has upgraded itself a couple of times (right now I'm on version 6.9.1), so I wonder if the newer versions are now somehow buggy. Don't know if this helps, but this class is "self-signed" (in the "Web Start" tab of the Project Properties), and below I've included the output of the "clean,jar" pane on the bottom of NetBeans. I noticed that it says jar: and then doesn't say anything else but skips right to BUILD SUCCESSFUL . I'm assuming that something should happen in between there? init: deps-clean: Updating property file: C:\NetBeansProjects\MyApplet\build\built-clean.properties Deleting directory C:\NetBeansProjects\MyApplet\build clean: init: deps-jar: Created dir: C:\NetBeansProjects\MyApplet\build Updating property file: C:\NetBeansProjects\MyApplet\build\built-jar.properties Created dir: C:\NetBeansProjects\MyApplet\build\classes Created dir: C:\NetBeansProjects\MyApplet\build\empty Compiling 1 source file to C:\NetBeansProjects\MyApplet\build\classes C:\NetBeansProjects\MyApplet\src\MyApplet.java:189: warning: [unchecked] unchecked conversion found : required: java.security.PrivilegedAction Object doPrivileged = AccessController.doPrivileged(new PrivilegedAction() { C:\NetBeansProjects\MyApplet\src\MyApplet.java:189: warning: [unchecked] unchecked method invocation: doPrivileged(java.security.PrivilegedAction ) in java.security.AccessController is applied to ( ) Object doPrivileged = AccessController.doPrivileged(new PrivilegedAction() { 2 warnings compile: Created dir: C:\NetBeansProjects\MyApplet\dist jnlp: Deleting: C:\NetBeansProjects\MyApplet\helper.txt Going to create default keystore in C:\NetBeansProjects\MyApplet/build/nb-jws.ks Generating Key for nb-jws sign-jars: generate-jnlp: Copying 1 file to C:\NetBeansProjects\MyApplet\dist Deleting: C:\NetBeansProjects\MyApplet\dist\launch.jnlp_ generate-html-preview: Copying 1 file to C:\NetBeansProjects\MyApplet\dist jar: BUILD SUCCESSFUL (total time: 1 second)
