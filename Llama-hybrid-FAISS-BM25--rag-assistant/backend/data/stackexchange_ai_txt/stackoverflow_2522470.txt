Discovering maximum packet size

I'm working on a network-related project and I am using DTLS (TLS/UDP) to secure communications. Reading the specifications for DTLS, I've noted that DTLS requires the DF flag (Don't Fragment) to be set. On my local network if I try to send a message bigger than 1500 bytes, nothing is sent. That makes perfect sense. On Windows the sendto() reports a success but nothing is sent. I obviously cannot unset the DF flag manually since it is mandatory for DTLS and i'm not sure whether the 1500 bytes limit (MTU ?) could change in some situations. I guess it can. So, my question is : "Is there a way to discover this limit ?" using APIs ? If not, what would be the lowest possible value ? My software runs under UNIX (Linux/MAC OSX) and Windows OSes so different solutions for each OS are welcome ;) Many thanks.
