Absolutely. Take a look at this post about the Vancouver Olympics: http://csharperimage.jeremylikness.com/2010/02/vancouver-olympics-howd-we-do-that.html That's just one example of a business application in the "real world" being used to drive a massively complex operation. I posted that just to draw attention to the "business" side of Silverlight, but be sure to click the link to the original post to see the other partners and contributions to the project. I've been building enterprise/business applications with Silverlight for over a year now. So the answer is an emphatic "Yes, you can" and "Yes, it's been done" and "Yes, it's been done on a large scale with large companies, and very successfully."
