Clustering customers by their orders sequence patterns

I have dataset with clients orders. Example: Customer_1 07.06.2017 Order_1 Product_1 Customer_1 15.06.2017 Order_2 Product_2 Customer_1 01.09.2017 Order_2 Product_1 Customer_2 07.05.2017 Order_3 Product_3 Customer_2 07.06.2017 Order_4 Product_2 Customer_2 25.09.2017 Order_5 Product_3 Customer_2 05.12.2017 Order_5 Product_1 .... Customer_N How can I cluster these customers behavior? This dataset looks like time series. But It's difficult for me to find the right way for solving this problem. The history of each customer has different length. And I can't use simple clustering algorithms. My major aim is to distinguish different customer behaviors, find persons who have started buy more frequently, who have changed their preferences in products (started buy other products), who have tried new for them products but back to previous products. How can I cluster patterns of behavior?
