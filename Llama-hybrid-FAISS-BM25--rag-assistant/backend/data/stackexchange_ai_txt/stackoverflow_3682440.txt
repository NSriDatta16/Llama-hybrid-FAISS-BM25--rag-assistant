If your shop system doesn't use Cookies for sessions, carrying the session ID in the URL is in fact the only way to continue the session. However putting the session ID into the E-Mail is not very elegant. The session ID will become invalid at some point, and it makes the URL long and ugly. I would consider activating Cookie based authentication for those clients that accept it.
