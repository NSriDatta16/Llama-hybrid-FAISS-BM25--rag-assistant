Different File Formats are stored differently

This might be a really trivial one. Is File storage OS dependant ? Why do text Files change when moved from Dos to Unix, is it that the Editor in Unix interpret certain characters differently or does the File itself change when moved from Dos to Unix and hence the utility Dos to Unix. Why a Java Class File can be moved from Dos to Unix and that does not change ? What is Platform Independent storage ?
