Nested ULs wrapping

I got an HTML string that I need to parse (to be used in Flash), by wrapping nested UL tags by a span with incremented left-margin value based on nesting level. Before: Item one Item two: One Two One Two Item three One Two Item four After: Item one Item two: One Two One Two Item three One Two Item four Note the incremented value: 0, 30, 60... I did a (nasty) ActionScript solution, but I think there must be some elegant way to do it.
