Using Poisson GLM for visits to a historical monument - Am I using the right method?

Dependent variable - number of visitors to a historical monument by day Independent variables - Daily average temperature, relative humidity, number of tourists visiting the state by day, etc. My task is to understand the key drivers that influence the number of visitors. So far, I have done the following: 1) Fitted a multiple regression in R with LN(Number of Visitors) ~ Independent variables using MASS package lm() function. I transformed some of the independent variables too per recommendation from BoxCoxTrans() from caret package. The resulting regression diagnostic look pretty decent to me. The R-square was approximately 25%, which is satisfactory to me, given the data that I have. 2) I have also tried fitting a glm.nb() function from MASS package because the dependent variable showed over-dispersion per a test for over-dispersion. The resulting regression diagnostic look pretty decent to me. The residuals are pretty much well-behaved in both cases, given that it's a real world data. However, the results from the two models are vastly different in terms their respective coefficients of determination, e.g., increase in temperature by 1 degree causes increase in the number of visitors by 10% per the regression model and 30% per the GLM model with Poisson or quasi-Poisson distribution. I would like to cross-validate with the community to make sure that I am not using an inappropriate techniques for the type data I have and which one of the techniques is more suited for the given data. Thank you!
