One other possible thing to keep in mind: C was created at a time when tape storage was common, so random seek or going backwards through the current file or even other files was not really feasible (which also explains why you have to put some stuff (i.e. forward declarations) before other stuff (i.e. usage of functions) even though the compiler should be able to figure it out on it's own).
