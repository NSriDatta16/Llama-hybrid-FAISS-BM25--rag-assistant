Thinking about this some more, maybe Matrix and/or lme4 ? Matrix does a lot of trickery with efficient representation of sparse matrices so this may be a worthwhile (though possibly heavy) example. Else, given that all of BioConductor is done in S4, some of it is bound to be better than average :) I am sure Martin Morgan will pipe in with good examples.
