#include ... int target_thread_num = 4; omp_set_num_threads(target_thread_num); unsigned long times[target_thread_num]; // Initialize all the times #pragma omp parallel { int thread_id = omp_get_thread_num(); times[thread_id] = start_time(); std::cout Obviously you need ot provide the two timer functions, but that's the gist. The OMP functions are pretty self-explanatory. Also make sure that your environment is set up properly and that you're compiling with the proper mechanisms. g++ option is -fopenmp. On Visual Studio go to project settings, C++, Language, and enable "OpenMP Support".
