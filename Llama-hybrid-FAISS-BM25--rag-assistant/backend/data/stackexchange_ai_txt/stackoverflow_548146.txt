Without looking too deep at the code, one thing that catch my attention is: if (number>0); cost_unit = cost * 1.4; total = cost_unit*number; Probably you would like this: if (number>0) { cost_unit = cost * 1.4; total = cost_unit*number; } BTW, I've seen this before..... but I'm not quite sure where...
