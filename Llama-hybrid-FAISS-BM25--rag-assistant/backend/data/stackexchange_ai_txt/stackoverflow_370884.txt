Permissions within views in ASP MVC

I understand that you can use forms authentication to grant/deny access to certain pages based on the criteria of your choosing. However I wish to go in a little more specific than that and say, have different buttons appear for users based on thier permissions. I know I could do something like if(((User)ViewData["CurrentUser"]).IsEmployee)..... But that doesn't seem very elegant and could get messy very quickly. Are there any guidelines/tools/framework features that could help me out here?
