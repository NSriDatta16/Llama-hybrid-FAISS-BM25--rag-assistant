I was looking for the same table, which I never found. I ended up writing this blog post about time complexity of machine learning algorithms , where I focused on the most common algorithms (random forests, regressions, SVMs, kNN...). It turns out that theoretical arguments such as yours and complexity evaluated on some implementations of some models can be quite different (sometimes due to default parameters, or to the different solvers that are being used).
