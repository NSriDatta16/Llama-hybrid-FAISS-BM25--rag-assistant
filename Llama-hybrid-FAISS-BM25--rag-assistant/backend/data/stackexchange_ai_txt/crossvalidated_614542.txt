Unless the experiment or study result showed a parameter was exactly equal to the Null Hypothesis, then you do have some evidence against the Null. If you have establish a threshold for the p-value was is "sufficient" evidence and that p-value is greater than you threshold , then you have "insufficient" evidence. The p-value is really a feature of the data. It is was Neyman and Pearson who formulated hypothesis testing as an accept-reject paradigm. Up to that point (1940's ???) The Fisherian formalism was to report the p-value and let that speak for itself. Fisher attacked the N-P formalism vociferously. And that didn't end the argument because the Bayesians were yet to be heard. I think it’s interesting that this is generating some discrepant responses. So far 6 upvoted and 7 downvotes. I thought it was a well established principle that the Null was almost never “true”.
