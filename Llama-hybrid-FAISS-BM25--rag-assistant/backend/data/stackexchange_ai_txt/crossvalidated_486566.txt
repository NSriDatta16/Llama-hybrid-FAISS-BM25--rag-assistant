Akaike Information Criteria applied on Random Forest

I am implementing a Random Forest model for predicting a variable "A" which is function of other 4 variables: $$A = f(B,C,D,E)$$ I developed a good RF model (i.e. high accuracy, good generalisation and extrapolation capabilities...), but I want to compare the accuracy of the results with a linear regression model: $$A=2B+3C+4D+5D+6E+ao$$ I have used the Nash-Sutcliffe eficiency coefficient (NSE) and the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) for comparing the accuracy of RF and linear regression models. However, I would like to use the Akaike Information Criteria (AIC). Is it possible to use AIC for this purpose? Thanks in advance.
