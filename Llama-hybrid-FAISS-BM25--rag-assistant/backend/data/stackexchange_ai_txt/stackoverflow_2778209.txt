Built-in precedence for Expression Trees?

I'm unable to find the .NET FCL built-in concept of precedence to leverage while constructing Expression Trees . Ref System.Linq.Expressions Namespace . Is this something that must be handled manually in code, or is it somehow implicit and I'm not recognizing it, maybe through helper methods or classes? I want to apply it to math operations to ensure 3 + 5 * 10 results in 53 instead of 80.
