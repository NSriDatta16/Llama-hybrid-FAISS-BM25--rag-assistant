Misca, You shouldn't hard code the directory of the sdcard like that. Its typically at /mnt/sdcard/ but this is never assured. You should also always check if the sdcard exists and is mounted first! You want to use the following: if (!Environment.getExternalStorageState().equals(Environment.MEDIA_MOUNTED)){ Log.d(TAG, "No SDCARD"); } else { webComp.loadUrl("file://"+Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory()+"/FMS/1/message.html"); }
