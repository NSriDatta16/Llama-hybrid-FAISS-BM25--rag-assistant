Just ask for money. I would advise to expend more time thinking of marketing and less worrying about code obfuscation. One approach I like is the one used by jamroom.net. They are fairly open, providing full code to subscribers, changes/customizations are allowed and encouraged to some extent. No efforts wasted on obfuscating code. They cash-in with extensions, installation/maintenance/ops services. I don't know how well they fare. Seems that a respectable sized community builds around their product. By community I mean both customers and third-party developers. That's a bonus, their Biz model even scales!
