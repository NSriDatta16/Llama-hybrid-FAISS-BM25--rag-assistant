How to get HTTP Headers (Authorization) in a Lotus Domino Java Agent?

I have an external application (non-Domino) that post data to a Domino Java agent. I'm able to read the data by using the REQUEST_CONTENT CGI variable, all is good. However, since I want to prevent anybody from running this agent, a username/password is sent in the HTTP Header ("Authorization" in Basic Auth, base64 encoded). Now, I want to read this, decode it and validate manually if the username/password provided are OK (from a database containing all access, custom database, not a domino directory). My question is, how can I access the HTTP Headers in a Java agent, mostly for the "Authorization" one? By the way, all our Domino servers are using "Form Authentication" (SSO), so I kind of want to fake a Basic Authentication using my custom solution. Is it possible? Thanks for your help!
