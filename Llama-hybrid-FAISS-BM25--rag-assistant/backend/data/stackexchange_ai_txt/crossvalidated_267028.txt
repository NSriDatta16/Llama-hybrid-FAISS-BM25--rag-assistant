Retrain best model on train and val data

I do certain classification task (machine learning, XGBoost), I do it according to kind of basic rules by splitting dataset into train/val/test sets (let's say 60%/20%/20%). I choose the best model parameters depending how well it performs on val set. Would it be beneficial to retrain said best model on train and val sets concatenated or even on all data train+val+test ? Any papers on that subject ? Any advantages/disadvantages ?
