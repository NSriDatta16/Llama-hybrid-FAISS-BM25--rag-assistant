Matrix completion approaches for healthcare big data

I am working on a prediction problem that leverage sparse clinical datasets. Missing data rate is in the range of 80%. 1- I am wondering if there is any example of application of matrix completion to clinical or other datasets with such a missing rates. 2- Currenlty exploring glmnet, pcaMethods and SoftImpute pacakages. I am also looking for R packages/SAS routines that can handle such sparse clinical data matrix and perform matrix completion. 3- I would like assess the reliability of my filled-in values, is there any metric or score to assess the quality of the matrix completion. Thanks in advance !
