So I ended up just downloading the source to the compiler, searching through it to find that warning, commented it out, and re-compiled the compiler. This is against the version tagged for gumbo beta2. Index: modules/compiler/src/java/flex2/compiler/css/StylesContainer.java =================================================================== --- modules/compiler/src/java/flex2/compiler/css/StylesContainer.java (revision 10941) +++ modules/compiler/src/java/flex2/compiler/css/StylesContainer.java (working copy) @@ -198,11 +198,11 @@ { // [preilly] This restriction should be removed once the // app model supports encapsulation of CSS styles. - ComponentTypeSelectorsNotSupported componentTypeSelectorsNotSupported = + /*ComponentTypeSelectorsNotSupported componentTypeSelectorsNotSupported = new ComponentTypeSelectorsNotSupported(getSource().getName(), lineNumber, selector); - ThreadLocalToolkit.log(componentTypeSelectorsNotSupported); + ThreadLocalToolkit.log(componentTypeSelectorsNotSupported);*/ return true; } Not the most elegant solution...but those warnings were really getting annoying.
