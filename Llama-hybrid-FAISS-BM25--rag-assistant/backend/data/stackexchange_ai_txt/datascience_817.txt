Data scientist (to me) a big umbrella term. I would see a data scientist as a person who can proficiently use techniques from the fields of data mining, machine learning, pattern classification, and statistics. However, those terms are intertwined to: machine learning is tied together with pattern classification, and also data mining overlaps when it comes finding patterns in data. And all techniques have their underlying statistical principles. I always picture this as a Venn diagram with a huge intersection. Computer sciences is related to all those fields too. I would say that you need "data science" techniques to do computer-scientific research, but computer science knowledge is not necessarily implied in "data science". However, programming skills - I see programming and computer science as different professions, where programming is more the tool in order solve problems - are also important to work with the data and to conduct data analysis. You have a really nice study plan, and it all makes sense. But I am not sure if you "want" to call yourself just "data scientist", I have the impression that "data scientist" is such a ambiguous term that can mean everything or nothing. What I want to convey is that you will end up being something more - more "specialized" - than "just" a data scientist.
