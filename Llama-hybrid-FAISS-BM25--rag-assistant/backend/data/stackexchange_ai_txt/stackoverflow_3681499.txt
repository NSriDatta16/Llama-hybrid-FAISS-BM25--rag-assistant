Ok, so what you what is to rotate the quad, but not the texture, right ? You can do this easily in your shaders (some parts are missing, like the sampler declaration) Vertex shader : out vec2 UV; main(){ gl_Position = MVP * Position; UV = gl_Position.xy / gl_Position.w; } Fragment shader : in vec2 UV; main(){ outColor = texture(sampler, UV); } What's more, you don't even have to provide texture coordinates : they are computed at run-time. Another possibility, less invasive if you don't have shaders, is to re-compute your UVs so the same way as in the vertex shader. Yet another possibility is glBitmap, but this is some very old piece of API...
