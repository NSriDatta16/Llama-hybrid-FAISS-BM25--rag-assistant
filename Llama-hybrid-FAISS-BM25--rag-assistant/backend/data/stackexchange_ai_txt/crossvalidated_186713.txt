The degrees of freedom differ because areg makes a different assumption about what happens to the number of districts. It assumes that they stay fixed as the number of houses grows.* Clustered regress does not. Thus it seems areg is more suitable to your problem (as long as these districts are not made up by real estate agents, like Parkwanus or Rambo in New York city). *The number of districts, however, is included in the degrees of freedom used in the finite-sample adjustment of the clusterâ€“robust VCE estimator.
