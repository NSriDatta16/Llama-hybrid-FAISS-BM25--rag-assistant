I assume you use a relational database like Mysql, Ms sql, Sqlite, Postgresql or Oracle for storage? Gedcom is a standard for information exchange so you know how many columns you will have. Maybe the standard is extended with new properties in the future but it probably wont be a lot of new properties. You can easily extend a table with a few new columns. I would use a 'horizontal' table and not a entity-attribyte-value-system (vertical table). Vertical table systems tend to be slow. They can't be properly indexed and confuse the query optimizer. It becomes a different story when your users can define new properties in their profiles like eye colo(u)r or favourite colo(u)r themselves. How flexible do you want those profiles to be?
