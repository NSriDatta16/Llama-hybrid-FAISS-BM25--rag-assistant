Are two coin flips conditionally independent if we know that the coin is biased towards heads?

Suppose Alice (A) and Bob (B) each flip the same, potentially-biased coin. Then, P(A=H) Now instead suppose that we already know that the coin is biased towards heads. Now is it true that P(A=H) much it is biased, and B=H still suggests that it is more biased than if B=T. To be more precise, regardless of the prior $P(\theta)$ we pick (where $\theta$ is the odds of heads), the posterior $P(\theta | H)$ will still be shifted right. It doesn't matter whether the prior is uniform on [0, 1] (example 1) or (0.5, 1] (example 2). But this post at The Queen Mary University of London (and this answer at Math SE ) seems to suggest otherwise: Now suppose both Martin and Norman toss the same coin. Again let A represent the variable "Norman's toss outcome", and B represent the variable "Martin's toss outcome". Assume also that there is a possibility that the coin in biased towards heads but we do not know this for certain. In this case A and B are not independent. For example, observing that B is Heads causes us to increase our belief in A being Heads (in other words P(a|b)>P(b) in the case when a=Heads and b=Heads). In Example 2 the variables A and B are both dependent on a separate variable C, "the coin is biased towards Heads" ( which has the values True or False ). Although A and B are not independent, it turns out that once we know for certain the value of C then any evidence about B cannot change our belief about A . Specifically: P(A|C) = P(A|B,C) In such case we say that A and B are conditionally independent given C. What am I missing? Edit : This is increasingly striking me as a frequentist vs Bayesian issue. In scenario 1, we're behaving like a Bayesian (incorporating our knowledge about the parameter into our estimate) and scenario 2 like a frequentist (treating it as a fixed value and therefore not updating it based on data). I think what's confusing me is that there seems to be no principled reason to switch between the two paradigms, other than a subtlety of wording ("there is a possibility that the coin in biased" in the first scenario). A strong frequentist should apply her paradigm to both cases, and likewise a Bayesian. Would you agree?
