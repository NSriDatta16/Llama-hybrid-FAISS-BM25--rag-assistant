You need to provide more information. What extra storage is available? Where are you supposed to store the result? Otherwise, the most general answer: 1. load the fist half of data into memory (2MB), sort it by any method, output it to file. 2. load the second half of data into memory (2MB), sort it by any method, keep it in memory. 3. use merge algorithm to merge the two sorted halves and output the complete sorted data set to a file.
