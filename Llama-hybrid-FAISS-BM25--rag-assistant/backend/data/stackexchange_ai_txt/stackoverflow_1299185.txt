For usability sake the profile should be part of the user model, or you should create your account and at least the base of your profile all in one go, as a user I i registered and then had to fill in another form I think I would be pretty annoyed. The upside of this is that either way you can do this with one form. I'd look at the railscasts on complex forms and if you can handle a very modest financial outlay then the pragmatic programmers series on Mastering Rails Forms is a total winner.
