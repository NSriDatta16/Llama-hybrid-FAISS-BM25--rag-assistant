INSERT queries don't return a result, so there's nothing to fetch. Despite that your query is syntactically wrong: string values must be wrapped in quotes, numeric values must not. db_query("INSERT INTO {test} VALUES (4, '%s')", $form['name']['first']); As of Drupal 6 db_query("INSERT ...") is discouraged. drupal_write_record() should be used instead. $record = array('id' => 4, 'firstname' => $form['name']['first']); drupal_write_record('test', $record); For more information please refer to the docs .
