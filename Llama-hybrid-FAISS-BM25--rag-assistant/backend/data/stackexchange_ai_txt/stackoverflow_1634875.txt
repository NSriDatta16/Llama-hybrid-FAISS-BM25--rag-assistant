Initialization vector uniqueness

Best practice is to use unique ivs, but what is unique? Is it unique for each record? or absolutely unique (unique for each field too)? If it's per field, that sounds awfully complicated, how do you manage the storage of so many ivs if you have 60 fields in each record.
