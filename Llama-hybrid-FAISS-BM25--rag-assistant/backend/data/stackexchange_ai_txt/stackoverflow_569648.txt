Flash Builder Pros better debugging and profiling visual designer for MXML because of Eclipse: support for other languages (eg. with Aptana, PDT...) and usage of plug-ins for the Eclipse Platform with features not shipped with FlexBuilder (code snippets with CFEclipse "Dynamic Snippets", "auto-code" for getter/setters with Monkey scripts...) support of virtual folders/files (links to external files/folders handled intern by Eclipse, so also working on Windows) refactoring (renaming of classes, functions, properties with automatic changing of dependencies) Cons Commercial license Big and because of Eclipse problematic with newer Eclipse versions for the FlexBuilder plug-in version (eg. not working with Eclipse Ganymede 3.4.1) adding and configuring the missing features with Eclipse plug-ins needs time and searching in the Internet (which plug-in? settings etc.) Code assist only average and sometimes buggy eg. if correct imports are missing ("java.lang.NullPointerException") missing of a code formatter or automatic get/setters (but there are solutions with other Eclipse plugins like Monkey Scripts, CFeclipse, Flexformatter "FlexPrettyPrintCommand"...) sometimes a bit sluggish if background tasks in Eclipse are working no package explorer AS2 and AS3 only - no Haxe FlashDevelop Pros free and Open Source (developed with C#) lightweight and snappy best available Code Assist for ActionScript supports all flash languages - AS2, AS3, haxe "auto code" for automatic getter/setter, variables, code for event handlers code snippets with integrated snippet editor extendible with plug-ins support for asdoc comments package explorer (show classes, symbols from a SWC file) basic refactoring multiple source code folders per project useful plugins : ANT integration, SWC creation, mini map, quick navigate Cons only for Windows no visual designer for MXML no support of virtual folders/files inside the project weak refactoring changing classpaths must be done manually plug-ins often not working in newer versions and many plug-ins are only rarely updated limited support for debugging Haxe applications Common Pros projects for full range of flash apps : websites, AIR (desktop, mobile) debugging of FP/AIR apps with breakpoints and stepping debugging with watch windows and locals support for ASDoc comments automatic adding of imports and organizing of imports class wizard SVG/GIT integration Cons no editing of graphics or animation (use Flash IDE for that) Summary For debugging, visual design of MXML forms : Flash Builder For coding AS2/AS3/Haxe projects under Windows : FlashDevelop
