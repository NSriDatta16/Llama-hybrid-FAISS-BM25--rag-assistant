Reading page 7 here: http://www.cs.princeton.edu/picasso/mats/PCA-Tutorial-Intuition_jp.pdf they note that PCA assumes that the distribution of whatever we are explaining can be described by a mean (of zero) and variance alone, which they say can only be the Normal distribution. (Basically in addition to Cam's answer, but I don't have enough reputation to comment : )
