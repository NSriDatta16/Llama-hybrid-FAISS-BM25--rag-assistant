I think you have to bring in the question of whether you're creating tests as well. You should be defensive in your coding, but as pointed out by JaredPar -- I also believe it depends on the language you're using. If it's unmanaged code, then you should be extremely defensive. If it's managed, I believe you have a little bit of wiggleroom. If you have tests, and some other developer tries to decimate your code, the tests will fail . But then again, it depends on test coverage on your code (if there is any).
