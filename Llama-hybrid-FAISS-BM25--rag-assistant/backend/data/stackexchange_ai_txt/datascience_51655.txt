How to label a dataset for Machine Learning?

I have a collection of educational dataset. The dataset consists of a username and their review for the course. I want to analyze the data for sentiment analysis. How can I label the data to train the model for my supervised machine learning model? Do I need to label manually (Positive, negative, neutral) to train the model?
