Time Efficient Method of Asymmetric Laplace MLE of Location Parameter

Reviewing " Tests of fit for the asymmetric Laplace distribution " under "Maximum Likelihood Estimation", the proposed method of determining the $\hat{\theta}$ seems problematic from a processing time perspective. Without any shortcuts - assuming an approximately mean-zero distribution with a static set of size $N$ , it would take approximately $N(N/2)$ iterations every time new data comes in on a sliding time series window. What sort of shortcuts can I take in order to minimize the number of iterations on the dataset to locate $x_r$ ? I already have some empirical statistics like mean, median, the four standardized and unstandardized central moments, quartiles, a sorted set, etc.
