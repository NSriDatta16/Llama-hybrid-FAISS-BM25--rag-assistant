Predict upcoming coordinates

Given sequences of points that define similar lines amongst each others, e.g: Where the blue lines are similar to each other, given the red point sequence and assuming that it will follow the same behaviour as the blue ones , I want to be able to determine what are the next red points. Therefore my question is three fold: i) Is it possible to use machine learning approaches to address this problem? ii) Should I use machine learning approaches to address this problem? iii) Which known machine learning approaches are most suitable to address this problem? Thank you for your time.
