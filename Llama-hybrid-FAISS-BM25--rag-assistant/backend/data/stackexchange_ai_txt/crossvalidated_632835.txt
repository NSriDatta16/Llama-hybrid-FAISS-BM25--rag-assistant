How to include a nominal independent variable two or three times in a regression model?

So my logistic regression model aims to predict the likelihood of a severe accident (yes/no) based on the characteristics of drivers, car types and other factors. I have data which has all this information for the past three years. When looking at car type, I'm unsure how to include it in my model since there are at least two drivers who each have a car type. I thought about having a multitude of binary variables which state whether there was at least one car type a,b,c,d etc involved in the accident. The problem I'm having trouble with is having dealt before with categorical variables within logistic regression before - I normally only have one car type that would be listed as 1 (yes) with all the others as zero. Here, there is a potential for 1's existing 2 or 3 times. I'm not really sure how to deal with this. Does it work within the logistic regression equation? Or is there some sort of relationship going on within the variable? Or does some sort of interaction when combining car type 1 and car type 2 have some effect rather than independently?
