Are there nonparametric generative models for datasets?

Typically when I see generative models, e.g., Latent Dirichlet Allocation ( JMLR ) or Linear/Quadratic Discriminant Analysis ( wikipedia LDA ), they are probabilistic models that belong to the exponential family ( stackexchange regularity conditions , wikipedia exp fam ). Recently, I read in Murphy's Probabilistic Machine Learning textbook ( Probabilistic ML ) about the principle of maximum entropy ( wikipedia maxent ) and the relationship to exponential families. It turns out that exponential families maximize entropy given certain constraints on the cumulants, but I am still chewing on this idea. Maybe this reason alone is why exponential families are popular in generative models? However, if we are most interested in the covariance structure of a generative probabilistic model for certain datasets , is there a nonparametric generative model that might model certain data better than a parameterized (perhaps exponential family) generative model? Perhaps this is a really bad question, and if I knew more about nonparametric statistics, bayesian statistics, and copulas ( wikipedia copulas ) the answer would be clear. Any insights into a nonparametric generative model in general, or specific to modeling covariance structure in datasets would be greatly appreciated! Background : This question came up while trying to think about assumptions for second order moments for measuring association: stackexchange second order moment question . If I am most interested in modeling a complex covariance structure in a dataset, and want to use a continuous (regarding CDF) generative model, then is the principle of maximum entropy strong enough to only consider a multivariate normal distribution (when we assume finite second order moments)? Or is there a nonparametric generative model that may model complex covariance structure more robustly? Are copulas considered nonparametric models? Related stackexchange questions that do not exactly answer the question as I understand it are: Generative Models and regression problems Markov Random Fields and Exponential Families (This seems very relevant to me, however I still do not think it answers the question involving a nonparametric generative model. Unless I am mistaken, a mixture distribution is still a parameterized distribution.) Bayes and Generative Models Bayesian Posterior and Generative Models
