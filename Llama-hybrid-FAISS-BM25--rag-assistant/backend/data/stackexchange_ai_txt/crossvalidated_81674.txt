Improving a linear regression prediction

I'm trying to create a prediction model. I have about 10,000 samples comprising of about 100 predictor variables and the response variable. At the moment I'm using a method which is apparently known as principal component regression (PCR). It's working ok, but I'm wondering whether we can do better. But I'm not a statistician and I'm having trouble keeping afloat in the sea of acronyms. I don't care about what the model looks like, I just want good predictions. Can you help direct where I should be looking? Some information about my data: A scatter plot of each predictor against the response generally gives an ellipse of points (some long and thin, some almost circular). Does this imply that a linear model is the right choice? The predictors are measuring wildly different things, and some are multi-correlated. This is why I've normalised them and thrown them through a PCA. Some predictors are probably completely useless. There are errors and outliers in the predictors and the response. I've tried to manually get rid of outliers, but not too aggressively.
