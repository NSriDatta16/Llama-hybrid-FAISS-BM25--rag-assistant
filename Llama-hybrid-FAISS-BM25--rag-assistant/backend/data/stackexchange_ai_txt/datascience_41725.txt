Machine learning algorithm for Low dimension input to high dimension output

I am plaining on training a network for body generation, i.e. given some specific measurement,(5 features) the output will be the a set of vertices representing the obj of the bodies. I am wondering what kind of machine learning algorithm is best suited for this scenario.
