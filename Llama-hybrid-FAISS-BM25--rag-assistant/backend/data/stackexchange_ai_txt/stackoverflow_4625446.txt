Let x, v, a be instantaneous position, velocity, and acceleration, and t the time. Use _0 for the initial and _f for the final. We have at a general time t (eq. 1) x = x_0 + v_0 t + 1/2 a t^2 for constant acceleration a, and (eq. 2) v = v_0 + a t At the end, i.e. t = t_f, you want x = x_f and v = v_f = 0. The latter condition gives v_0 = -a t_f (insert v = 0 into (eq. 2)). Inserting this into (eq. 1) at time t=t_f gives a = 2 (x_0-x_f)/t_f^2 and thus v_0 = 2 (x_f - x_0) / t_f which is simply a derivation of the basic kinematic equation saying that the average of initial and final velocity is the average velocity ((v_0+v_f)/2 = d/t, again for constant acceleration) where we've set v_f = 0. [Actually, you can get the above within a constant factor just by noting the units: velocity has units of [length/time], so the final answer should probably look like the displacement divided by the time..] I think using the incorrect formula (v *= 'a' ) produces a smoother animation because that equation doesn't correspond to a constant acceleration (which has a jerk of zero, where jerk is the time derivative of acceleration the same way that acceleration is the time derivative of velocity) but a variable one which is smoother (because v ~ 'a'^t). If you really do want a smoother, non-constant acceleration -- i.e. the one given by your v *= k approach -- it's straightforward to work out the details in that case too, but this was the easier one to explain.. Update: oh, what the heck. If v = v_0 * k^t, then as Al Brown noted, the velocity isn't ever going to go to zero in your situation, so you'll have to live with some small v_f > 0. We then have v_f = v_0 * k^t_f as one equation and x_f = x_0 + v_0 k^(t_f) / log(t_f) -- integrate the velocity equation to get this -- as the other; solving is left as an exercise for the reader.
