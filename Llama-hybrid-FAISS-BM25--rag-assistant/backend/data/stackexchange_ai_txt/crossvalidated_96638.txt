The paper you most likely read came from the work of Keogh and Lin et al and possibly talked about Symbolic Aggregate Approximation SAX The best answer i can give is to cite a paper below: "Data Adaptive representations: in this category, a common representation will be chosen for all items in the database that minimizes the global reconstruction error". – "Non-Data Adaptive representations: in contrast, these methods consider local properties of the data, and construct an approximate representation accordingly" Experimental Comparison of Representation Methods and Distance Measures for Time Series Data XiaoyueWang · Hui Ding · Goce Trajcevski · Peter Scheuermann · Eamonn Keogh In addition in the Master-Thesis von Irina Alles - September 2013 https://team.inria.fr/zenith/files/2013/11/ia_ma_thesis_final.pdf Complete descriptions with examples are given :-) Non data-adaptive representation - Page 14 Non data-adaptive techniques use the same set of parameters for dimensionality reduction regardless of the underlying data. One of the early works on this topic was achieved by Agrawal et al. [1993], who used the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) ..." "Data-adaptive representation - Page 15 This category of time series representations assembles techniques which take into account the underlying data and adjust their parameters accordingly. Almost any non-data adaptive approach can become data adaptive by adding a parameter selection step [Esling and Agon, 2012]. Vlachos et al. [2004],Struzik and Siebes [1999] realised this idea for DFT and DWT...."
