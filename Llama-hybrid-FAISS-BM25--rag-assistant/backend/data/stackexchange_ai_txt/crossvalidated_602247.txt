Multiple testing adjustments for Bayes Factors

I manage an platform that has succesfully gotten a Bayesian approach to experimentation in production. One new feature we want to implement is to do inference for multiple metrics (e.g. conversion rate and revenue). I know that one way to solve this is a model to infer paramenters for all metricss e.g. follow the approach of model from this. However, this is impractical for our use as we have ~100s of , and want to do inference on 5-6. Below is an small example of what I am thinking about. (Adapted from this question. ) Scenario: Web users are split into two groups to test if users cancel less under the new design. Since the designs are new, I'll use an uninformed prior (1,1). After running the split test for a few days, I have the following results. Results can only be cancel/not-cancel ('success'/'failure'), so looking to use a binomial-beta. Data: Sample 1: n = 1000 cancel = 20 don't-cancel = 980 Sample 2: n = 2000 cancel = 30 don't-cancel = 1970 But in this case we also want to measure pauses on the same set of users . In that case we have the following set of data: Sample 1: n = 1000 pauses = 50 non-pauses = 950 Sample 2: n = 2000 pauses = 130 non-pauses = 1870 I can use the following code to calculate the bayes factors: Cancelation data: theta1=rbeta(10000,20+1,980+1) #taking 10,000 random draws from distribution with sample 1 theta2=rbeta(10000,30+1,1970+1) #taking 10,000 random draws from distribution with sample 2 theta_dif = mean(theta1>theta2) #Find the posterior probability that someone from sample 1 will convert more than someone in sample 2 bf_1 = theta_dif/(1-theta_dif) Pause data: theta1=rbeta(10000,50+1,950+1) #taking 10,000 random draws from distribution with sample 1 theta2=rbeta(10000,130+1,1870+1) #taking 10,000 random draws from distribution with sample 2 theta_dif = mean(theta1>theta2) #Find the posterior probability that someone from sample 1 will convert more than someone in sample 2 bf_2 = theta_dif/(1-theta_dif) My question is: is there any post-inference proceedure I need to do to adjust my Bayes factors (or theta_diff ), to account for reusing the data and doing multiple tests on it? E.g. I could divide theta_diff by 2, meaning the Bayes factor calculation now is: (with $ p = \text{theta_diff} $ ) $$\frac{p/2}{1 - p/2} = \frac{p}{2 - p}$$ I'm honestly confused
