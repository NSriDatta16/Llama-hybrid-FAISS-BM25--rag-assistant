It depends on your categorical variable being used. For ordinal variables, say like bad,average and good, it makes sense just to use one variable and have values 0,1,2 and distances make sense here(Avarage is closer to bad and good). However, if there is no order, you should ideally use one hot encoding as mentioned above.
