I do not know of one, and a search on Google didn't yield any obvious results. One easy, kludgy solution is to create a function that cycles through every event and sets it to null , such as function removeEvents(obj) { obj.onblur = null; obj.onchange = null; obj.onclick = null; // ... } Call this function as follows: removeEvents(myElem) . A complete list of JavaScript event handlers can be found at http://www.elated.com/articles/events-and-event-handlers/ . Undoubtedly there is a more elegant way to write this function, but I don't know if there is a more elegant way to solve this problem. It would be lovely if someone knows of one. If you are binding events through a JavaScript library, such as jQuery, there may be other, better options.
