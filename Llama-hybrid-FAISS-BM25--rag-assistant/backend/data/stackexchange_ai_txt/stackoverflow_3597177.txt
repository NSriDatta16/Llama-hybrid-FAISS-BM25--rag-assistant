Haystack + Whoosh IndexError: Index was created on an architecture with different data sizes

When rebuilding my indices via ./manage.py rebuild_index I get this error: Traceback (most recent call last): File "manage.py", line 11, in execute_manager(settings) File "/Library/Python/2.6/site-packages/django/core/management/__init__.py", line 438, in execute_manager utility.execute() File "/Library/Python/2.6/site-packages/django/core/management/__init__.py", line 379, in execute self.fetch_command(subcommand).run_from_argv(self.argv) File "/Library/Python/2.6/site-packages/django/core/management/base.py", line 191, in run_from_argv self.execute(*args, **options.__dict__) File "/Library/Python/2.6/site-packages/django/core/management/base.py", line 218, in execute output = self.handle(*args, **options) File "/Library/Python/2.6/site-packages/haystack/management/commands/rebuild_index.py", line 13, in handle call_command('clear_index', **options) File "/Library/Python/2.6/site-packages/django/core/management/__init__.py", line 166, in call_command return klass.execute(*args, **defaults) File "/Library/Python/2.6/site-packages/django/core/management/base.py", line 218, in execute output = self.handle(*args, **options) File "/Library/Python/2.6/site-packages/haystack/management/commands/clear_index.py", line 38, in handle sb.clear() File "/Library/Python/2.6/site-packages/haystack/backends/whoosh_backend.py", line 197, in clear self.setup() File "/Library/Python/2.6/site-packages/haystack/backends/whoosh_backend.py", line 105, in setup self.index = self.storage.open_index(schema=self.schema) File "/Library/Python/2.6/site-packages/Whoosh-0.3.18-py2.6.egg/whoosh/filedb/filestore.py", line 48, in open_index File "/Library/Python/2.6/site-packages/Whoosh-0.3.18-py2.6.egg/whoosh/filedb/fileindex.py", line 94, in __init__ File "/Library/Python/2.6/site-packages/Whoosh-0.3.18-py2.6.egg/whoosh/filedb/fileindex.py", line 173, in _read IndexError: Index was created on an architecture with different data sizes
