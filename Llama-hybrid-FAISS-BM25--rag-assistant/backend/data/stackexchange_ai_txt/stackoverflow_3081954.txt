Ok I worked out a way (Not particularly elegant in my opinion but it works). Added the previous query in as a view Then did:: select a.col1, a.col2, b.col1, b.col2, c.col1, c.col2 from view a, view b, view c where a.col3 = 1 and b.col3 = 2 and c.col3 = 3 also had to link up the primary key which I've excluded from here for simplicity. I think this is pretty much what potatopeelings was suggesting. Thanks for your help guys, if anyone thinks of a better way of doing this please advise as I'm very much an amateur at the moment and well aware of that fact
