Comparing unevenly spaced time series

I have multiple sets of time series data. However, the spacing of observation times is not constant within a time series itself, nor is it consistent between different time series. For example, series A might have observations at 0900, 0930, 1100, 1200, 1330 . Series B might have observations at 0800, 0815, 0830, 0925, 1300, etc . I'm trying to use this data to look for crossovers between series based on their time and the value at that time. For example, given Series A = [(0900, 25), (0930, 31), (1100, 22), (1200, 25)] Series B = [(0815, 23), (0830, 27), (0925, 31)] We could say that there's a crossover at A: (0930, 31) and B: (0925, 31) - their times are relatively close and their values are the same. I understand how to compare series that have a common frequency of measurement, but I'm completely stumped as to how to deal with unevenly spaced series. Can anybody point me in the right direction?
