Intuitive explanation of unit root

How would you explain intuitively what is a unit root, in the context of the unit root test? I'm thinking in ways of explaining much like I've founded in this question . The case with unit root is that I know (little, by the way) that the unit root test is used to test for stationarity in a time series, but it's just it. How would you go to explain it to the layperson, or to a person who has studied a very basic probability and statistics course? UPDATE I accepted whuber's answer as it is what most reflect what I asked here. But I urge everybody that came here to read Patrick's and Michael's answers also, as they are the natural "next step" in understanding the Unit Root. They use mathematics, but in a very intuitive way.
