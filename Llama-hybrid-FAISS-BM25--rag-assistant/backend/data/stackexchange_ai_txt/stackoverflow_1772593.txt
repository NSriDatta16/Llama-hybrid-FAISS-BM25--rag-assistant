Sounds like an NLP problem to me. As for the information about documents and cites, http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu should be a good starting point. For each paper, there are several citations which refer to the paper. At the very minimum, you have to scan the abstract of the paper and that of the citations and run your own algorithm to figure if any citation is of the opposing opinion. Maybe your professor can give you hints on some approximate heuristic, but as far as I know it is a really hard problem. I would be watching this thread for more interesting approaches.
