I'm not sure that I agree that your responses are ordinal. They actually seem more like an interval-censored logarithmic response. Consider: your zero means something real and the intervals are roughly exponential. If you elect to treat them as ordinal, I would suggest that you apply a forward-continuation-ratio logistic regression. See Agresti or O'Connell . An excellent alternative to ordinal would be Brunner, Domhof, and Langer nonparametric methods which would bring mixed models to bear.
