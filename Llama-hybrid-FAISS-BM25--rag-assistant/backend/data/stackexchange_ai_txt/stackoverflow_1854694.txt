You need to be looking directly at the security framework, introduced in 10.4, I think, and been the main authorization source since 10.5. OSX still works within PAM (like Linux), but /etc/authorization now supersedes this. Apple does have one or two samples of code on how you could pragmatically create a class/entry for someone to authorize themselves against (or preauthorize/be preauthorized like folks who are allowed to print).
