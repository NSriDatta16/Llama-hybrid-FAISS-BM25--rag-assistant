Software Development is a VERY small subset of Computer Science. People sometimes seem to think the two are synonymous, but in reality there are so many aspects to computer science that the average developer rarely (if ever) gets exposed to. Depending on one's career goals, I think there are a lot of CS graduates out there who would probably have been better off with some sort of Software Engineering education. I value education highly, have a BS in Computer science and am pursuing a MS in it part time, but I think that many people who obtain these degrees treat the degree as a means to an end and benefit very little. I know plenty of people who took the same Systems Software course I took, wrote the same assembler I wrote, and to this day see no value in what they did.
