Pragma No-Cache on the page hosting the silverlight application will prevent the the browser from caching the xap, instead it will read it by streaming from the web server. That will make it harder for peeps to get the xap. Obfuscation will make it harder still. Also make sure the app is hosted in https, have authentication take place outside the main application. This way the xap stream is encoded on the way down.
