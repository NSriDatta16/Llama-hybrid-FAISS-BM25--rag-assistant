Why do probability distributions matter in data science and predictive modeling?

I am trying to learn data science and have heard a lot of people talk about the importance of understanding the main types of probability distributions and being able to identify which distribution fits your data. I understand that distributions are very important because they are fundamental concepts in Statistics, but don't understand how knowing the distribution can help you form a better predictive model. From what I understand, we can assume the coefficient estimates of the independent variables are pulled from a normal distribution regardless of the distribution of the independent variables themselves due to central limit theorem. So it doesn't seem like knowing the distribution of the independent variables would influence the way you form a model. When people say it is important to know your distribution, are they talking about the dependent variable? And how can this help with prediction?
