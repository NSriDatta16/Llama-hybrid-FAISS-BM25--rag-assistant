Stars and Machine Learning

Ok So I have been dying in interviews lately. Need to Brush up more. Maybe you can help me with this interview question (multiple Choice). If you tell me good sources to look at to learn more about these algos that would be great. Heres the Q: You want to create an algorithm that finds the stars that form Greek Constellations as seen from earth. Which of the following are appropriate algorithms. a) K means with euclidean distance b) K nearest Neighbors with cosine similarity c) K means with Cosine Similarity d) K Medoids e) None are correct, i would do something else. I know that Kmeans is clustering, and KNN is a classification. I also know that the cosine similarity shows how similar 2 vectors are by leveraging the dot product of the 2 vectors (a.b=|a||b|cos(theta)). Suggestions and help would be great.
