What the "best" regression to use is will depend on many factors. And, as @SmallChess has noted, I've never heard of "Poisson Logistics" despite doing an awful lot of disease related research, so I'm going to guess and give you three options for what I think you mean: Logistic Regression: Conventionally, in clinical and epidemiological studies, logistic regression is used to study case-control data with rare outcomes, as in that case the odds ratio obtained from logistic regression approximate the relative risk you would obtain from a cohort study. You don't specify if your data is a case-control study or not. If it is, and you use logistic regression, in your case the odds ratio does not approximate the relative risk . Binomial Regression: Binomial regression can be used in a cohort of patients with binary outcomes to direct estimate the relative risk. If you can use binomial regression, it's good to try it. Unfortunately, unlike logistic regression, binomial regression models are often sometimes poorly behaved, and have trouble converging. Approximation of a Binomial model using Poisson regression: Poisson regression with a robust variance estimate can be used to approximate what you'd get from a binomial regression model, and is likely better behaved. See Zou G. A modified Poisson regression approach to prospective studies with binary data. Am J Epidemiol. 2004;159(7):702–706. for a theoretical treatment of the topic, and Rivers, C., M.S. Majumder and E.T. Lofgren. Risks of Death and Severe Disease in Patients With Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus, 2012–2015. Am J Epidemiol. 2016;184(6): 460-4. for an example of using this in practice.
