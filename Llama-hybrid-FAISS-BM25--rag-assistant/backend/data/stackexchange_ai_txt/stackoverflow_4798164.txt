Both HTML5 and HTML+RDFa 1.1 are still in development, it implies that everything we say her now might be subject to change. There are two sides of your questions: Is it valid? Will it create interoperability issues? For the validity, you might check at regular pace the implementation status of specifications in the W3C validator . It has an experimental HTML5 validator built into it. Namespaces in HTML5 are still pretty much in debate. They create issues leading to a different DOM from what is really intended, which leads to my second question: interoperability issues. You can test how the markup is handled with a Live Dom Viewer or use something like Opera Dragonfly to explore the DOM representation of the document in the browser. If you want to explore the topic of HTML5 DOM and RDFa a bit more, you might want to read Jenni's blog post . Your markup so far is not really an issue, but if you involve javascript, you will have to be careful about namespaces and values with columns.
