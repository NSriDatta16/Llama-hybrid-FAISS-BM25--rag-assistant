Basic ZXING library application

I am trying to produce public Button.OnClickListener mScan = new Button.OnClickListener() { public void onClick(View v) { Intent intent = new Intent("com.google.zxing.client.android.SCAN"); intent.putExtra("SCAN_MODE", "QR_CODE_MODE"); startActivityForResult(intent, 0); } }; public void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent intent) { if (requestCode == 0) { if (resultCode == RESULT_OK) { String contents = intent.getStringExtra("SCAN_RESULT"); String format = intent.getStringExtra("SCAN_RESULT_FORMAT"); // Handle successful scan } else if (resultCode == RESULT_CANCELED) { // Handle cancel } } } Using the libraries therefore not needing to install the software, I have had a look at the application that comes with it, and added CaptureActivity.java to my project to see if I can locate the core scanning loop but it kept just requiring more and more files (ended up with about 28 in total) and after I had no errors it still didn't work. I am not looking into doing anything fancy, just on a button click open the capture layout, scan a code, return the code. There are a few examples on how to decode local files but not the actual scanning side of it to detect a actual barcode. So, what I help with is embedding the scanning code Thanks
