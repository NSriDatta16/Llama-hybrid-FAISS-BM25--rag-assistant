Move to FeedAPI. The only disadvantage to this is not having immediate blocks for different feeds. However, it's possible to set these up using nodeblock and embedding a view in the feed node of the feed items, which also allows you to use Views and feedapi mapper to determine which information is displayed in each feed. Aggregator is just a bad module for any heavy lifting with feeds. It offers no flexibility, and doesn't play nicely with Views. If you're serious about building an entire site for aggregation, switch to feedapi, and then use views to control the display of the nodes that can be created from the feeds. It will take some work up front, but in the long run, you will save yourself the headache of trying to find the mystical feed aggregator solution that likely does not exist.
