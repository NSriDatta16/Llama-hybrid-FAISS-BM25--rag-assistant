Is it possible to Drag-and-Drop images between Web sites (applications)?

There are a number of questions on stackoverflow about drag-and-drop but I can't see that any relate to this question specifically. Question: Is it possible to drag-and-drop an image from one Web application (or site) to another Web application (not the same window etc.)? I'm not looking for specific technologies that may help one achieve this, just if it is possible with Web application security restrictions. For example, I've read that it's not possible for one Web application's Javascript to mess with the DOM of another Web application (for obvious reasons). I just want to be able to drag an image displayed on one Web page into a Web application on another page (and for that application to have full access to the image). Thanks, Ashley.
