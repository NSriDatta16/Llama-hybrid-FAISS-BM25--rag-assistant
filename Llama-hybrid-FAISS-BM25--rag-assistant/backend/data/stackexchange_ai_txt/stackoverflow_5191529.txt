It can be a problem if you have two headers in a project which use the same include guard, e.g. if you have two third party libraries, and they both have a header which uses an include guard symbol such as __CONSTANTS_H__ , then you won't be able to successfully #include both headers in a given compilation unit. A better solution is #pragma once , but some older compilers do not support this.
