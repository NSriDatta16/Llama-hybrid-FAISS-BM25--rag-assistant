Summing the values of an array of hashes in Ruby

I am having trouble figuring out the elegant way to add an array of hashes [{:a=>1,:b=>2,:c=>3},{:a=>1,:b=>2,:c=>3},{:a=>1,:b=>2,:c=>3}] should return [{:a=>3,:b=>6,:c=>9}] I know it would probably involve mapping/reducing, but I can't figure out the right syntax, doesn't help that ruby-doc dot org doesn't match my version I am using 1.8.7
