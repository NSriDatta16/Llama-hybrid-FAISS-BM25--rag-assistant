I suspect it's in the state it's in for several specific reasons: 1.) The HTML5 standard that defines it does not define what it should output, leaving every implementation to decide for themselves. 2.) The editor doesn't know whether you want an accurate representation or a semantic one. These are often trade-offs. 3.) It looks like Mozilla dragged it's old Netscape Mail/Composer code into its designMode implementation then dragged that into contentEditable. It's still using the same dotted outlines and little red handles that existed 10 years ago and I suspect a huge amount of legacy code. 4.) It looks like Internet Explorer did pretty much the same, and IE never did anything properly in the first place. It's still dragging its legacy along in the form of quirks and "compatibility" modes. 5.) It's really only used in CMS systems and forum/comment boxes, and usually these have fairly heavy wrappers around the implementation. I haven't seen much usage elsewhere, especially 'bare-bones' ones. 6.) There are few successful online word-processors and fewer still WYSIWYG or page layout applications. The pressure to create accurate editors just isn't there. Worse still Microsoft sell offline software like Word and Expressions that would definitely be harmed by the growth on online editors, especially high-quality free ones. 7.) Microsoft has a legacy of creating tools that generate invalid and bloated HTML code that still exists today in Outlook 2010 and the Office suite. 8.) Sometimes the same selection and editing command could be applicable to several possible objects occupying the same space and the editor can't ever really know which one you meant to alter. Also an editing command could cause an element to split in an undefined or unexpected way (again, it won't know which you would prefer). I don't believe contentEditable will ever be as good as cutting your own HTML or using a dedicated tool. I'd just focus on running some basic cruft/repair tools (like HTMLTidy) over the result and call it a day.
