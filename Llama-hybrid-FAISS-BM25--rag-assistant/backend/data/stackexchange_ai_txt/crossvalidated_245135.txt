How can I effectively test for overfitting when using Random Forests

I'm aware that Random Forests are extremely sensitive to overfitting so I'd like to be cautious and make sure I'm checking any outlet possible to avoid it. I've already split my data into training and test sets but I'm not sure what else to do. Any information would be much appreciated.
