I know its not FCKEditor or SubTexts one, but TinyMCE has a flag that will format the HTML properly for you in its HTML view. apply_source_formatting : true and it will format all the HTML psuedo-properly. Not brilliant but better than the usual drag it all on to one line and make it really hard nigh impossible to read.
