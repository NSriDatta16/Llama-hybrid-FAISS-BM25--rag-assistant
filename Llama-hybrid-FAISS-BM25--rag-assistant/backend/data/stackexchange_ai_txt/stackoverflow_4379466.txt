Crazy Demo: Multiple Microsoft Agents

I am creating an extreme and kinda silly demo for a presentation I am giving. I was hoping to use some type of API to display multiple actors and was planning on using Microsoft Agent. Is it possible with Microsoft agent to display 2 or more agents at the same time? Using multiple threads or processes is not a problem and it by no means has to be pretty. To make working with COM easy I am using PowerShell V2 and my current code looks something like this: $agent = new-object -com agent.control.2 $agent2 = new-object -com agent.control.2 $agent.connected = 1 $agent2.connected = 1 [void] $agent.characters.load("Merlin") [void] $agent2.characters.load("Robby") $merlin = $agent.characters.character("Merlin") $robby = $agent2.characters.character("Robby") # Insert silly demo with our actors Merlin and Robby here! EDIT: I am by no means sold on Microsoft Agent. If you have a better way of doing the same or similar thing I would love to hear about it.
