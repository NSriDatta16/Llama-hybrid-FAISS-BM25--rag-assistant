JavaEE6 DAO: Should it be @Stateless or @ApplicationScoped?

I'm currently creating an EJB3 Data Access Class to handle all database operations in my Java EE 6-application. Now, since Java EE 6 provides the new ApplicationScoped annotation, I wonder what state my EJB should have, or if it should be stateless. Would it be better to let the DAO be a @Stateless Session Bean, or an @ApplicationScoped Bean? What about @Singleton ? What are the differences between these options related to a DAO? EDIT: I'm using Glassfish 3.0.1 with the full Java EE 6 platform
