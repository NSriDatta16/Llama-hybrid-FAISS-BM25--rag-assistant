Running a Windows service, and cobertura

I'm trying to run a windows service with cobertura. The only problem is cobertura reports results when the shutdown hook is executed. I am unable to directly modify the code for these results, so I was wondering if it is possible to run a java application as a windows service and still gather cobertura results. I instrument the code, add it to the classpath, but when reporting, I get nothing. When viewing a trace file, it fails to load/save any cobertura information. This leads me to believe that shutdown hooks never get executed, otherwise I would get results. Thanks for the assistance!
