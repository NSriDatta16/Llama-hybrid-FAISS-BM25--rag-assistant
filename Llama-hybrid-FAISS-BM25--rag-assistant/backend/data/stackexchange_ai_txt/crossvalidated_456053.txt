If you want to find a linear boundary, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is a good choice Wikipedia page on 'Linear Discriminant Analysis' . Logistic regression would also probably yield a similar result. You can add polynomial features to either of these methods to find nonlinear boundaries, but interpreting the results could get more complicated. I think your instinct to start with logistic regression and inspect the coefficients is not a bad idea.
