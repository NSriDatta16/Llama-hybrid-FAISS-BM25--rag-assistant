Question 1 : by automatically (and very efficiently ) they mean that just by shifting a memory pointer around (cutting the top off the stack), all memory used there is reclaimed. There is no complex garbage collection necessary. Question 2 : the stack is just a contiguous chunk of memory delimited by a start and an end pointer. Everything between the pointers belongs to the stack, everything beyond the end pointer is considered free memory. You allocate and deallocate memory by moving the end pointer (the top of the stack) around. Things are much more complicated on the heap, where memory use is fragmented.
