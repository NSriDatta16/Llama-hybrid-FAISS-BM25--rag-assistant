In my opinion these are two distinct questions, please add any citations that might clarift I find the question quite interesting 1) Difference between dimensionality reduction and clustering eg in PCA The core difference between the 2 is: a. Clustering = group rows together (often with useful properties eg i want group X elements to be similar to each other). = so for dataset size N with dimensionality D at the end you will have M size ( -> reduce number of rows (data points) b. Dimensionality reduction -> reduce the number dimensions ( = columns ). columns are not same as rows ie a vector with 2 or 3 dimensions and a vector with 1 dimension are both valid data - points. 2) But for non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques like auto-encoders, can the reduced dimensions, itself be clusters that indicate different modes of operation example for industrial components. The autoencoder neural network architecture performs dimensionality reduction in its latentspace (assuming smaller number of neurons than input layer ) BUT one could add further constraints to tranditionl MSE loss function. Such a constraint could to force the latent space to be a one-hot vector forcing 1 neuron to be close to the scalar value of 1 and the rest to 0. Which can be considered a form of clustering. Further thoughts Dimensionality reduction and clustering are problems algorithms can be modified to solve many problem. AE in particular has been used as a component to more complex architectures (and with one layer AE performs linear mapping) that solve many different problems so keep an open mind before putting it to "boxes".
