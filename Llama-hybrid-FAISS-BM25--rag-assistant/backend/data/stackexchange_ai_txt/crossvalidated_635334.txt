The sampling frequency or sampling period for financial time series in doing DFT

The discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is widely utilized in computer engineering, and its formula is as follows: $$X(k)=\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}x[n]e^{-i\frac{2\pi}{N}nk},$$ where the result $X(k)$ refers to the Fourier coefficient and it reveals the amplitude and phase at each frequency. I try to apply DFT or FFT to financial time series, and most financial time series are daily data. I have a question in drawing the frequency-amplitude gram, I know the amplitude for $k$ th frequency is $\frac{1}{N}|X(k)|^2$ , but calculate the frequency needs sampling period or sampling frequency, how can we define the sampling period or sampling frequency for daily financial time series? Thanks!
