What knowledge do I need in order to write a simple AI program to play a game?

I'm a B.Sc graduate. One of my courses was 'Introduction to Machine Learning', and I always wanted to do a personal project in this subject. I recently heard about different AI training to play games such as Mario, Go, etc. What knowledge do I need to acquire in order to train a simple AI program to play a game? And what game do you recommend for a beginner? This is what I know in Machine Learning so far - Introduction to the course and to machine learning. K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm, and K-means algorithm Statistical Inference Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and Expectation Maximization (EM) Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) model, including generalization bounds and model selection Basic hyperplane algorithms: Perceptron and Winnow. Support Vector Machines (SVM) Kernels Boosting weak learners to strong learners: AdaBoost Margin-Perceptron Regression PCA Decision Trees Decision Trees pruning and random forests
