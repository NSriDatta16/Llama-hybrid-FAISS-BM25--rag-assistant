Is time series problem properly formulated?

I have to predict time series that has unequal time steps using RNNs. Just to see if the approach is correct, I'm trying to predict (sine curve) using RNN with input as time and trying to predict f(t). The important to notice is that time steps intervals are not equal. 0.006 0.224 0.322 0.347 0.418 0.45 0.462 0.471 0.499 0.501 Corresponding input and output are as follows: 0.006,0.0059999640000648 0.224,0.22213145663397 0.322,0.316464401053724 0.347,0.340078150505108 0.418,0.405933460875763 0.45,0.43496553411123 0.462,0.445739322869916 0.471,0.453777627075545 0.499,0.478547716475827 0.501,0.48030288130708 Actually, as you can see in this image, the function is sine: Now my question is, if I feed the following type of input to LSTM RNN, 0.006 0.224 0.322 0.347 0.418 0.45 0.462 0.471 0.499 0.501 And output as: 0.48030288130708 is it correct? That is, I'm feeding 10 timesteps as inputs, and 1 output value (output at 10th step as output of the series) and this forms one example. Next example will start from 2nd value (0.224) and will be 10 time steps, and output will be sine value of 10th step.. and so on. And then I'm applying padding and masking and then trying to predict. Is my approach correct? Any pointers will be helpful. And broader question is can we use time steps as input to predict unequal step time series using RNNs. Thank you.
