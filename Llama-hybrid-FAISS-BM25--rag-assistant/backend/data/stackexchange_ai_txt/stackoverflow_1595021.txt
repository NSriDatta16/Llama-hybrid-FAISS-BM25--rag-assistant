I would recommend using a resource file to store the string constants. This increases elegance and code readability. Also, quotes and special characters can be displayed without messing around with too many escape sequences. You can create a resource file entry like, String Name(Key) => FormFieldControl Value => This can be used in code like const string fieldName = "Strasse"; Console.WriteLine(ResourceFile.FormFieldControl, fieldName, fieldName);
