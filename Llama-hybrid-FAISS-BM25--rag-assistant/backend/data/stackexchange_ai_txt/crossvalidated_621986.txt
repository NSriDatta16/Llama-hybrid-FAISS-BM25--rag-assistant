single node tree explanation

solution: you have a single node tree and you have this explanation. "Because of the inability to split the dataset on any variable, the average of the entire data set is applied as the estimate for all predictions." For a single node tree, I know that you cannot make a split. You have a training set. let's say you have 6 observations. Then, from the quote, do you take average of the 6 observations and average all the predictions? can you please tell me if this is what the solution is saying? If you have multiple terminal nodes, then you can make a split. Then, can you please advise me how the solution may say ?
