An interesting approach to consider is doing time-to-word conversion on the client side with javascript. This can keep your pages cacheable while still presenting relative times to the end user. Darragh Curran has released a javascript implementation of just such functionality and written up a short explanation of how to use it in a Rails application. Another interesting advantage of this technique is that you can dynamically update the description of the time without the user leaving the page.
