Dependent variable coding for logistic regression in R

Given the outcome variable in a dataframe is a factored/categorical variable, when regressing the dependent variable (DV) onto a set of independent variables (IVs), what is the model predicting? The probability that the DV is the first level of the factor? Or the second? A related question: I know that given a numerical column of $1$s and $0$s, a logistic regression would model the probability of the higher order variable (i.e., value=$1$), so I have been attempting to recode the factor "character" variable into a numerical one. I am coming from a SAS background, so I am entirely to used to if var = "yes" then var_num = 1; else var_num=0; That's clearly wrong. What's the most efficient way you have found to recode such variables?
