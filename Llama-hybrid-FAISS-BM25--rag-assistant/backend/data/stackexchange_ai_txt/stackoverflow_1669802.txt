Can you post your Storyboard? It sounds like you have some kind of Binding in the Storyboard definition. Ok so, as I suspected, it's because you're using a Binding in your Storyboard . You can't do this because WPF attempts to freeze all the resources leveraged by a template for efficiency and when you use a Binding on a Freezable , in this case the Storyboard , it prevents it from being able to be frozen.
