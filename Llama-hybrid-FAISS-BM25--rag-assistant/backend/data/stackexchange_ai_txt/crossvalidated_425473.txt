How to name a machine learning algorithm where we used very small amount of labeled data?

I have to describe a machine-learning algorithm that needs only very small dataset. I cannot say it is unsupervised because I already used the labels in the training. Also, I cannot say semi-supervised because I did not mixed ublabeled data with small labeled data. I cannot say also weakly-supervised because the labels are precise. I know that it is supervised but I would like to have an adjective that describe better that I used only small amount of labeled data. I would like to attract attention that my algorithm only need small amount of labeled data What is the best adjective to use?
