Imagine I have a set of ten observations* (the original data has more digits): x y 1 1.66 3.64 2 5.30 4.91 3 4.75 5.32 4 2.07 1.58 5 2.88 4.25 6 3.53 4.59 7 1.75 2.37 8 1.42 2.10 9 2.82 4.35 10 1.81 3.90 and I want to bootstrap the correlation to try to assess how stable (or how uncertain or how 'variable') the sample correlation is. *(ten is much too few for the bootstrap to be much use, but this is just for illustration) The idea is to resample the data - by sampling rows (with replacement) from the original data to obtain new pseudo-samples of size 10. This is very easy with the boot package - most of the work is in writing a function for 'boot' to call. With the above data in mydata : > print(head(mydata,3),digits=3) x y 1 1.66 3.64 2 5.30 4.91 3 4.75 5.32 ... you can do this in R as follows (following the help on boot ): mycor producing: The magenta line is the original sample correlation.
