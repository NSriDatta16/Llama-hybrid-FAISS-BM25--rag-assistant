What about this? If (Some Condition) Begin Set @SomeVariable = SomeValue ELSE Set @SomeVariable = @SomeVariable --or dummy/default value? End Does your code return 2 different recordsets (columns and types) based on this variable? If so, you'll have to split the stored proc into 2 Also, I found a KB article that explains why. Edit: Change the branch into inline code... Set @dtSomeDate = CASE WHEN ISDATE(@vcSomeDateOrAgeInDays) = 1 THEN @vcSomeDateOrAgeInDays ELSE NULL END
