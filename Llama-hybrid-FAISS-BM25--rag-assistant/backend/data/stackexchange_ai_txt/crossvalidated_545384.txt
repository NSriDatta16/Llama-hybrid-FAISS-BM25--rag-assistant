ADF test with large time series dataset (over 1m rows) python

I am currently working on two stock price data. The dataset has over 1m rows, consisting of a minute wise change for 2 years. To check if the two stock price change movements are related, I want to conduct cross correlation. Before I do normalized cross correlation, it seemed stationary check is required. I tried KPSS and ADF test, but ADF test gives out an error regarding out of memory while KPSS had no problem. I processed the dataset to reduce memory spending, but then it takes forever to get the result. (I waited 40 min. still not seeing the result.) I guess, ADF test python library is not for large dataset like mine. I would like to know if there's a workaround to deal with memory and speed problem when doing ADF test in python. Also, if there's another way to test trend stationary like ADF, I would like to know what it is.
