Flash content in eLearning: one SWF vs. many?

We are designing a Flash-based language course, and I am not sure which architecture we have to choose. The content won't be uploaded to the Internet, it will be used only locally. Possible architectures: 1) A single SWF with all the data stored internally - it seems a rather clumsy and inefficient way (or it's not?). 2) To make a Flash-based interface, and to keep the data saved in a MySQL database. It presumably allows to organize the content better, avoiding self-repetitions. The problem is that the language teacher (who is not an IT specialist) will have to install additional software to handle MySQL. 3) To make a number of separate SWF files, and to make a simple HTML-file with the index. (and some other solutions I didn't think of) Which is the right architecture, most usable for the teacher and most elegant from the IT point of view?
