Can I move an existing Subversion repository into a new parent repository (and retain the history)?

Currently I have a root-level repository set up for each project, like so: Project1 Project2 Project3 Project5 Project5 I'd like to reorganise this so that rather than a repository for each individual project, I just have one for each logical grouping, and then the projects would just be folders within those 'group repositories', e.g: WebSites Project1 Project2 DesktopApps Project3 Libraries Project4 Project5 Is this at all possible while retaining the history of the existing repositories? I've looked around quite a bit but all I can find is stuff on moving folders about within the same repository, and moving folders out of a repository into a new repository. It's only for personal stuff anyway, so it's not the end of the world if it's just a straight 'no' - but it would be nice to know so I'm not just banging my head against a wall :)
