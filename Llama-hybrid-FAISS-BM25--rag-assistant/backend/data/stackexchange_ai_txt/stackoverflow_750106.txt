No, not really. It's got nothing to do with polynomials. It's about decomposing a vector (the initial sequence of numbers) into a different basis. It's just that this basis has a series of very useful properties: (1) It's orthogonal -- the vectors don't mix, and determining the transformation back to the original basis is exceedingly simple. (2) The Fourier basis vectors are eigenvectors of the shift (or circular shift, for the discrete case) operation -- a Fourier basis function, after shifting the vector indices, is still the same function (times a number). That's what makes convolutions and the solution of a large class of differential equations very simple in Fourier space. (3) And finally, the entries are roots of unity -- this gives raise to the F FT, one of the most elegant algorithms ever discovered, reducing the N^2 operations required for a change of basis to N log N.
