If you use Log4j, there is a specific mechanism for handling this type of logging pattern, split between two classes org.apache.log4j.NDC and org.apache.log4j.MDC ('Nested and Mapped Diagnostic Contexts').

Here's another link which describes MDC use in a bit more practical detail: Build Flexible Logs With log4j - O'Reilly Media Note that underlying storage mechanism MDC/NDC uses (I believe) is ThreadLocal anyway.
