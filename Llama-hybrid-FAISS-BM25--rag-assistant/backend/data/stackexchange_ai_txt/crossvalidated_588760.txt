Yes, setting $\mu_0=\bar y$ absolutely is circular. The Bayesian model cannot be justified unless you genuinely do have information about $\mu$ that is separate to the data. Based on what you have said here, the reviewer is correct to say that your approach is not statistically valid. You will be overstating the amount of data information that you have because you entering the same data twice, once as the prior mean and once as the observed mean. It is possible in some contexts to estimate prior distributions from the data using empirical Bayes approaches, but empirical Bayes cannot be done with one sample in isolation as you are doing here.
