Document specification in markup language?

I am not sure if this makes sense so apologies before hand: is there a markup language specifically for creating document specifications? For example, if instead of giving people a template Word document for a given document they need to create, supply them with the specification in the markup language on what the document has to contain and how it should be structured. I am thinking this could be possible just by using XML but I wanted to know if there is something smarter that this: A short introduction about yourself ... Thank you edit: Thank you for the replies. I think the above example is best said with an example. In order to release data to a third party in my organization, they need to fill out a security policy which contains some information on how they will make sure the data is kept safe on their end. In the majority of cases, people will download the Word template for it, fill it out and send it back. I want to create a formal specification of what that document should contain, in a markup language, so people can potentially build tools or other things around the creation of the document. I realized that the example above was wrong, its a specification so should not contain any actual "contents" of the document.
