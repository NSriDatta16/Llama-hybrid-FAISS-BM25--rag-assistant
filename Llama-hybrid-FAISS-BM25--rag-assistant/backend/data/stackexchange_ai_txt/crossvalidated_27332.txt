How to know if a time series is stationary or non-stationary?

I am using R, I searched on Google and learnt that kpss.test() , PP.test() , and adf.test() are used to know about stationarity of time series. But I am not a statistician, who can interpret their results > PP.test(x) Phillips-Perron Unit Root Test data: x Dickey-Fuller = -30.649, Truncation lag parameter = 7, p-value = 0.01 > kpss.test(b$V1) KPSS Test for Level Stationarity data: b$V1 KPSS Level = 0.0333, Truncation lag parameter = 3, p-value = 0.1 Warning message: In kpss.test(b$V1) : p-value greater than printed p-value > adf.test(x) Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test data: x Dickey-Fuller = -9.6825, Lag order = 9, p-value = 0.01 alternative hypothesis: stationary Warning message: In adf.test(x) : p-value smaller than printed p-value I am dealing with thousands of time series, kindly me tell how to check quantitatively about stationarity of time series.
