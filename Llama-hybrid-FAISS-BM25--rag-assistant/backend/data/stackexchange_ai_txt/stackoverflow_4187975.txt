swf file to html-css-js

I don't know if stackoverflow is the correct place for this question. If not, feel free to move it in the correct site. I have two swf files: http://www.austintxgaragedoor.com/special-mail.swf http://www.austintxgaragedoor.com/special.swf My client wants to convert them to something so the text will be in the html code. I thought to use two gif files. When the user hover the specific div then the second gif replace the first and gives the effect. The text will be positioned with css. I am not sure if this a proper way to do it, or there is a better way. What is your opinion?
