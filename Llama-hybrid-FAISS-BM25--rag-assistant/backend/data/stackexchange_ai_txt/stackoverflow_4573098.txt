Write an int_proxy class that is implicitly convertible to int and is assignable from int . You'll need at least two member functions: operator int(); int_proxy& operator=(int); In this proxy class, store whatever information you need to be able to retrieve and set the value in the container. Do the retrieval in the conversion operator and the assignment in the assignment operator.
