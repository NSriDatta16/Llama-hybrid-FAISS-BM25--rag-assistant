Having read the blog post, I think the author is saying that we shouldn't use randomness in models of the real world because the real world is not random, since everything (such as a coin flip) actually has a cause. This makes probability theory the science of last resort. Only after truly exhausting your ability to investigate causal factors and processes should you indulge in probabilistic thinking. Doing otherwise is a cop-out, one that dangerously feels “scientific.” However, I do not agree with this. I would say that probability is simply a way of quantifying what you don't know, or even just stating that you don't know something. Treating something as random is the same as saying that you don't know it. So if you insist (as some people do) on never using probability theory, then you are assuming that you know everything relevant to the problem under investigation, which seems to me to be even more of a cop-out than straight-up admitting that you don't know some things. Whether your lack of knowledge is quantified as "what if things had gone some other way?" (frequentist) or "I'm not sure about the underlying state of the world in the first place" (Bayesian) isn't so important. What is important is that, whatever answer you come up with, you shouldn't be certain that it's correct. That's just crazy! As Lewian says in the answer above, "All models are wrong, but some are useful" also applies to probability itself. Expressing uncertainty in terms of probabilities is a model of the real world, and it's often useful.
