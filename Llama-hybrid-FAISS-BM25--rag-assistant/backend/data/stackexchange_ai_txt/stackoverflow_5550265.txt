I freezed on this problem in python with winpcapy (1.9.2009) and WinPcap 4.1.0.2001. I solved it simply by creating copy of packet data array (as suggested by memcpy mentioned in question). pkt_data = pkt_data[:header.contents.len] Not sure if it's correct but works for me at the moment. And based on answer at winpcap papermail this what pkt_data references to should persist until next call of pcap_next_ex (or other dispatch method). If i got it right, because it uses one buffer for more/all packets and so it can be reused for other/last packets? Q.
