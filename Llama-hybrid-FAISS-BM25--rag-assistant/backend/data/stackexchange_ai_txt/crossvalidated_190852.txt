What is effect on PCA of having too many zeros in the data?

I want to use Principal Components Analysis to derive dietary patterns. However, my data have many zeros (no intakes) for many observations. I'm unable to find relevant literature to know how biased my results would be as result. There are some papers related to environmental sciences that have described this, but my data are food intakes. Zero intake means no intake. It cannot be substituted by other numbers in contrast to the way it's done in other fields.
