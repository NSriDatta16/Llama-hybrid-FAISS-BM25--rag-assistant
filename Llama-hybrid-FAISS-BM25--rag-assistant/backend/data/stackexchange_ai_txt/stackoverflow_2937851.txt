And for Oracle (see JYelton's answers for MySQL and MS-SQL), the command would be: sqlldr username@server/password control=loader.ctl The CTL file will have details about the file you need to import. It is necessary that you have convert the excel file into CSV format. Sample entries in Control file. load data infile 'c:\data\mydata.csv' into table emp fields terminated by "," optionally enclosed by '"' ( empno, empname, sal, deptno ) More details as ORAFAQ for SQL Loader . You can also use UTL_FILE . Or, think of creating an external table with CSV file as data and manipulate details on them. Sample CREATE statement below: CREATE TABLE countries_ext ( EMP_ID VARCHAR2(5), EMP_NAME VARCHAR2(50), DEPT VARCHAR2(50) ) ORGANIZATION EXTERNAL ( TYPE ORACLE_LOADER DEFAULT DIRECTORY ext_tables ACCESS PARAMETERS ( RECORDS DELIMITED BY NEWLINE FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' MISSING FIELD VALUES ARE NULL ( employee_id CHAR(5), employee_name CHAR(50), department CHAR(50) ) ) LOCATION ('employee.txt') ) PARALLEL 5 REJECT LIMIT UNLIMITED; Details here: Oracle documentation for External Tables .
