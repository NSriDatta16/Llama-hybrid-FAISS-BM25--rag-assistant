It's because in your drop function, you are arbitrarily pulling $(".ui-draggable") which is any class on the page that matches this, not the child object of the object being dropped. From the docs I found (http://jqueryui.com/demos/droppable/#event-drop) you can access the element that was dropped with ui.draggable
