This looks like the kind of answer you're looking for: http://people.dsv.su.se/~henke/papers/bostrom07c.pdf The author looks at using average votes vs average probabilities from the ensemble members as well as a few other approaches to approximate impurity in the leaf nodes. For example, even if you do grow the trees to a maximum depth (as mentioned in the comments) the "Laplace Approximation" could be used to get a non-zero probability for each class by simply adding one to the count of observations of each class in the leaves. Empirically speaking, the author concludes by saying that using averages of relative class frequencies (on 34 datasets) is better than using average votes (i.e. polling), though it is not better than using some "adjusted" probability average like the Laplace Approximation. The difference looks pretty slight to me, but take a look at the "Accuracy and AUC" table on page 5. That might convince you one way or another.
