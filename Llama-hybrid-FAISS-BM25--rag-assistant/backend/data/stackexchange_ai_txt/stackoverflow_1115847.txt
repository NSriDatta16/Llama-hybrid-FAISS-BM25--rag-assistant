First, the code above is not threadsafe. Second, while it works in theory, I doubt there is a realistic scenario where it pays off. Think about it: In order for this to be useful, the map's contents would have to be: Big enough so that their memory usage is relevant Able to be recreated on the fly without unacceptable delays Used only at times when other parts of the program require less memory - otherwise the maximum memory required would be the same, only the average would be less, and you probably wouldn't even see this outside the JVM since it give back heap memory to the OS very reluctantly. Here, 1. and 2. are sort of contradictory - large objects also take longer to create.
