What Eric J. said. Also, try to fight the urge to have some centralized piece of code that acts as the master control for everything. It's also a good idea to try to have your services organized vertically (based on separate business responsibilities, each with a full vertical stack) vs horizontally (where each service calls 'down' into a lower layer). they should act more like peers than layers.
