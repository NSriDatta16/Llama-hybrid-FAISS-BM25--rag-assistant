Comparing logistic regression models with same number of parameters

What would be an appropriate way to compare two logistic regression models with the same number of parameters (i.e., model 1 is not nested in model 2)? In my case, I cannot compare the models to a superset model with all predictors of both models, because including the differing parameters of both models results in nonidentifiability due to multicolliniearity.
