I asked a related in spirit question after doing some research I can pretty confidently say no. There are some tools for Silverlight 1.0 and 2.0 you can find with a simple google search ( terms: html to xaml converter) but nothing specifically for Silverlight 3.0 The xaml exporter for Infragistics may be helpful if you've used Fireworks to design your sites, if not you may be out of luck.
