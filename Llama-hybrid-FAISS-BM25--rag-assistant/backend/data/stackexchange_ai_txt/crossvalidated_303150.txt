How to analyse unbalanced panel data with attrition and defiers?

I'm working with a panel data from a quasi-experimental study with the following characteristics 1) Unbalanced covariates between the control and the treatment group (according to Hotelling's T-squared test), though I've read that it's not cause for concern ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4310023/ ); 2) High level of attrition, though similar in rate for both the control and treatment group, and no statistical difference in covariates between drop-outs from the two groups (Pearson chi2 for each covariate) but significant using Hotelling's T-squared test; 3) Treatment assignment at the regional level, participants were randomly selected in three random towns within a region; 4) Defiers in both the control and the treatment group; 5) Most likely heterogenous effects by region. I was thinking of using a DID analysis, given that the control and treatment groups' covariates and key indicators differ, and then use a LATE approach to estimate the average treatment on the treated. I was wondering if: a) that would be the correct approach? b) I read somewhere that DID is ATE, and that for LATE, I would need to estimate the ITT. How can I estimate the ITT? c) can I estimate ATT on DID? d) any suggestions on different approaches, given the type of data (i.e. FE, PSM)?
