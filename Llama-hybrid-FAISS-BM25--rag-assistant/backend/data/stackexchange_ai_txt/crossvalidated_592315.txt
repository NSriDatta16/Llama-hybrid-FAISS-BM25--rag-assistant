A couple quick points to add on to what has already been said: Multilevel models are not mutually exclusive from logistic regression. You can have a multilevel logistic regression model. If you have the ability to do some basic simulation, I would highly recommend it to understand multilevel models (or statistical models in general). This can be done relatively simply in software such as R. The general idea is that you have to set up a model to simulate observed data similar to that you're seeing in the dataset of interest. It forces you to think differently about what parts are systematic ("the fixed effects" you mentioned) and what parts are random ("random effects"). The utility of a multi-level model becomes apparent very quickly
