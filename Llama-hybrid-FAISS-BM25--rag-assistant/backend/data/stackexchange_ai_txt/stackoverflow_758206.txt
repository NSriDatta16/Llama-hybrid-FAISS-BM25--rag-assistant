There is a pretty straight-forward method for T-SQL , although I'm not sure if it is prestanda-effective if you're skipping a large number of rows. SELECT TOP numberYouWantToTake [yourColumns...] FROM yourTable WHERE yourIDColumn NOT IN ( SELECT TOP numberYouWantToSkip yourIDColumn FROM yourTable ORDER BY yourOrderColumn ) ORDER BY yourOrderColumn If you're using .Net, you can use the following on for example an IEnumerable with your data results: IEnumerable yourSelectedData = yourDataInAnIEnumerable.Skip(nubmerYouWantToSkip).Take(numberYouWantToTake); This has the backside that you're getting all the data from the data storage.
