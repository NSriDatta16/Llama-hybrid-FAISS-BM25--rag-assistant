Is it possible to use Spearman Rank Correlation to analyze two time series that exhibit cyclic behavior

I am extremely new to statistics so pardon me if this question is really easy to answer. I am trying to analyze two time series that should be physically related (wind speed and temperature). Since both time series are cyclic, I figured that a linear correlation technique like Pearson would not work and instead something that studies the monotonic relationship of the data would be better. However, from my understanding Spearman would require the sorting of data to assign ranks which would remove the cyclic behavior of both time series. Is it possible to study the monotonic correlation between both time series without having to sort the data?
