It's really difficult to say, what makes your drag events to work slow, without code examples. Sluggish effect can be due to some heavy operations you are running inside event execution. Event system in the browser is really interesting. It's synchronous. Which means, the event will be not triggered again, until the current execution is finished. That means, you have two possibilities: 1. optimize your code inside event, so that it takes less CPU time or 2. make your event asynchronous and implement your own mutex/semaphor logic. The second one you can do, by using setTimeout functionality. If you do setTimeout,((code),1) your event will continue asynchronously, so the next event will be dispatched without awaiting for your code to complete. Well, take in advance that in that case you have to start thinking about locking and queuing. By queuing I mean, to queue all dispatched events for future use. Long time ago, I did also some asynchronous event dispatching, because of some heavy code execution. It worked for me. Maybe it will work for you too.
