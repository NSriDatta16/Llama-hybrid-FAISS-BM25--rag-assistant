matched cohort with 1:n pairs - correct stratified logistic model

In this hypothetical example we have access to a database. In it cases are people with children and controls are those without kids. We want to measure the association between having children and Lung cancer. We match each case to 'n' controls based on a given criteria. Shown below is the fantasy results obtained. In the example, n varies from 1:3 (first case matches with 2 controls, the second case matches with 1 control, etc). We then wish to develop a stratified (by pair identifier variable) logistic model to predict lung cancer based on our matched case-controls. My question attains to the correct manner in which we are to deal with the 1:n pairs. Do we ... 1: set the pair identifier number equal for each 1:n (LHS below) or 2: duplicate each case such that it is repeated n times for each control (RHS below) The resultant (conditional) logistic regression model is then developed (in R) using somewhat of a code: clogit(lung_cancer ~ case + strata(Pair_ID) + smoker, data) So with respect to the strata(Pair_ID) command, which of the diagrams below is most relevant?
