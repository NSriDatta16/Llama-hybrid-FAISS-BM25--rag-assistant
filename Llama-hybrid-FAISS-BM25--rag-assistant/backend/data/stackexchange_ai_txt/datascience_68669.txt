First, how do you classify your failures? Are they these giant peaks? If so, you should probably employ a logarithmic scale first. Second, your data looks extremely periodic, I'd say you have systematic failures. Don't you think it's better to use more simple methods that do not involve complex ML. Try to calculate the frequency of events first and see if it's constant. One more thing is to add some mean-based features such as, for example, the average over a particular time interval (10 reads, 100 reads etc.). Also, regarding some of the comments, since the data is from a sensor, it: is a time series meaning you can introduce an artificial time feature. can't be shuffled. UPD. This looks like a rare event prediction problem, check these links: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.10717.pdf Regression model to predict probability of rare event https://machinelearningmastery.com/lstm-model-architecture-for-rare-event-time-series-forecasting/ https://www.kaggle.com/general/28441
