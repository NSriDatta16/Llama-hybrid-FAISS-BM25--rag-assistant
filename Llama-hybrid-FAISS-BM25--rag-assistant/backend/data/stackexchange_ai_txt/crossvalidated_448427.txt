Proof of a causual (line) Bayesian graph model

Given a simple Bayesian graph model, and $A$ is observed. A The joint model is $$ p(A,B,C) = p(A\mid B,C)p(B\mid C)p(C), $$ which is true. But I don't understand why people use $$ p(A\mid B,C) = p(A\mid B) $$ such that $$ p(A,B,C) = p(A\mid B)p(B\mid C)p(C) $$ For example, https://frnsys.com/ai_notes/foundations/probabilistic_graphical_models.html or https://ermongroup.github.io/cs228-notes/representation/directed/ says it uses belief net's conditional independence assumptions . But why? Are they really equal? How to prove this?
