The " Inline Formatting Context " section of the CSS 2.1 spec says: When the total width of the inline boxes on a line is less than the width of the line box containing them, their horizontal distribution within the line box is determined by the 'text-align' property. If that property has the value 'justify', the user agent may stretch spaces and words in inline boxes (except for inline-table and inline-block boxes) as well. When an inline box exceeds the width of a line box, it is split into several boxes and these boxes are distributed across several line boxes. If an inline box cannot be split (e.g., if the inline box contains a single character, or language specific word breaking rules disallow a break within the inline box, or if the inline box is affected by a white-space value of nowrap or pre), then the inline box overflows the line box. So, the text-align property is only used in cases where the line box length is less than the block width. If the line box is wider than its containing element then the text-align property isn't considered.
