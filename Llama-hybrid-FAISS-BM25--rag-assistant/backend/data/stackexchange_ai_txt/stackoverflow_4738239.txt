From what you've posted it looks like your using Load Time Weaving which incurs a startup penalty because the system has to weave all the classes as they are being loaded. If your primary concern is startup time, then I would suggest you switch to Compile Time Weaving. You can find instructions on how to do this in the spring documentation (Chapter 6, Section 8) or in at the AspectJ site (http://www.eclipse.org/aspectj/docs.php) Switching to Compile time weaving with the AspectJ compiler is relatively stragiht forward: Remove the notation from your context file. Add a aspectJ compile step to your build file. On the AspectJ site you should be able to find an ant plugin, codehaus has a maven plugin. Here are examples of how to us both. For Maven: org.codehaus.mojo aspectj-maven-plugin 1.3 true 1.6 1.6 1.6 true org.springframework spring-aspects compile For Ant
