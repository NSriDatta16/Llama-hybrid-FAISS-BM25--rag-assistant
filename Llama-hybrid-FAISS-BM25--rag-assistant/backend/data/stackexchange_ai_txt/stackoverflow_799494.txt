Drag'n drop between two unrelated web applications

Assume you have two web applications running in two different tabs/windows in your browser. Is there a predefined interface in IE, Firefox or Google Chrome to pass data between the two windows? If so it should be possible to implement drag'n drop, right? Because I don't think this is possible I wonder if the same could be achieved with Flash. This sums up to the following question: Is it possible to implement cross-application drag'n drop behaviour with Javascript/DOM or Flash?
