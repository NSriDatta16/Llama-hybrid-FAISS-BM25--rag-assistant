Is MLE a theoretically sound method for uncertainty estimations?

I'm reading Evidential Deep Learning to Quantify Classification Uncertainty and it mentions that MLE is a flawed metric for evaluation uncertainty as it is a "frequentist" algorithm, but in this post Entropy is a measure of uncertainty and in thermodynamics they use entropy as a measure of uncertainty, which you can ascertain learning a distribution from MLE(Like Cross Entropy). My intuition is that uncertainty stemming from MLE is uncertainty about a point given the data it is trained on. Is MLE a theoretically sound method for uncertainty estimations?
