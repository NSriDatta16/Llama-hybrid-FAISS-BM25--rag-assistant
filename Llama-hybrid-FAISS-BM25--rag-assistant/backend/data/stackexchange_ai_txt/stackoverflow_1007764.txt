What you are talking about is not a 'limited resources' project, but instead a rushed and unplanned project. A few items in your list I take issue with: Strict bureaucratic process for off-spec work Change request budget may be small or non-existent Actually, these should be the norm for most projects. Who's requesting and paying for the changes, you or the client? Can’t do any content management or data entry for client No budget for writing user documentation or manuals. If that's not part of the contract, why are you doing it? Have to go for ‘good enough’ coding solutions At some point, you have to stop at 'good enough', or else you are going to be polishing from now until the end of time. Something I would add to your list are: Office supplies become scarce or go under lock and key. Corporate supplied food/beverages disappear Down time disappears. 100% of your time on your time sheet must be dedicated to project work. The printer/photocopier is running full-bore printing other staff member's resumes. The Boss' door is shut for 90% of the day.
