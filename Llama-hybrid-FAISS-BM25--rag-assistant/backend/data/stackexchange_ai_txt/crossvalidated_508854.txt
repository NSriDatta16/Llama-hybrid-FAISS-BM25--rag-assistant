Comparing the discriminative ability of two comorbidity indices for mortality: should I go for ROC and AUC?

Different comorbidity indices are widely used tools for describing patients' comorbidity statuses. A large score = many illnesses, and vice versa. I would like to compare two such indices to examine which better predicts one-year mortality. Studies have used different estimates to describe "discriminative ability". Which of them should I choose for my goal? Plotting a ROC and calculating AUCs for both indices? Recommendations for R packages are also very welcome. Finally, are there any good Bayesian ways?
