There is a very large statistics literature on this topic. In the face of non-proportional hazards (non-PH), the hazard ratio is a kind of average, and we know the weights that are used as shown in some of the references and R software appearing here . The weighting is not as simple as what you wrote, but you have the right idea. When there is strong non-PH such as when curves cross, it is not very fruitful to interpret Cox regression coefficients. And switching to mean survival time brings in other problems and leaves us with a hard-to-interpret result (e.g., the mean life length for subjects who died within 3 years was 2.4) and is too dependent on the choice of time horizon. Instead I recommend flexibly modeling what you don't know. See Section 20.7 of this especially the Breslow et al reference. Fit non-PH directly and get time-specific hazard ratios. You can also get cumulative incidence at a specific time estimated from this extended Cox model. If the hazard ratios of all the predictors converge to 1.0 as $t \rightarrow \infty$ you should switch to an accelerated failure time model instead. The above link to the RMS course notes goes into detail about that.
