one class SVM modelling

I have some doubts about how to model a system based on one class SVM, which I plan to use for detecting outliers or anomalous data. For example, when I used a neural network or SVM model the procedure I followed was roughly the following: Normalize if needed both train and test data Shuffle the data Divide the data into train and test data with their respective labels Apply model I have not used one class SVM before and I want to measure some rare events. So I have a dataset that contains the normal behaviour of an event, lets called data1. Also, I have a small dataset that also belongs to data 1, approximately 20% of the size of data1, but it contains rare events or what could be considered as outliers and lets called data2. I have followed these steps for the one svm model: Normalize both datasets Divide the data into train and test set, here I do not have labels Train the model with the train data or data 1 and test it with data 2 I was wondering if there is the need to shuffle the data as it was done in the supervised models or can I train and test them without doing that step. It might sound rather a simple question, but I was not able to find any information about how to do it, and in some examples on the web they do not perform this step. Thanks for your help.
