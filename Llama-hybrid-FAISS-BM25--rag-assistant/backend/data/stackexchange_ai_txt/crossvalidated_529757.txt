How to compare clustering results between "raw" and normalized data

I have a dataset and I would like to apply a clustering algorithm to find some groups. I do not have any label, so it is just wondering if I can find relevant clusters. If it may help, it is information about some players (say age, height, weight, and some other performance metrics - the point is there are features with different scalings...). Also, although I think my question applies to any clustering algorithm, I am currently using K-Means. Now, I just applied a K-Means with 5 clusters on my data and I calculated some very standard performance metrics: inertia and silhouette score (overall average, and average per cluster). Then, given that scaling data is considered a best practice, I decided to standardize every feature (z-score) and apply again K-Means with 5 clusters. I computed the same metrics. I expected inertia to be lower (it is a sum of squared distances...) but surprisingly all the silhouette scores were lower, too! I expected silhouette to improve on scaled data. ¿Why wasn't that the case? This led me to ask some questions: ¿is it enough to conclude that in this case it is better not to scale the data or am I missing something? Can we actually compare these two silhouette scores, despite being computed on data with different scalings? If not, which would be a better approach to evaluation / comparison? Thank you in advance for any answer / suggestion / thought. Cheers!
