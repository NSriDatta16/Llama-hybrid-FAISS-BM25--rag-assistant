Why does the logistic model for binary logistic regression return the probability that the outcome was in class/category 1?

In the context of simple binary logistic regression ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression ) we have $p(x)=\frac{1}{ 1 + e^{\beta x}}$ , where $p(x)$ is interpreted as the probability that the observation $x$ has $y=1$ , i.e. $x$ belongs to category/class 1. My question is: Why does the fitted model return the (conditional) probability for category/class 1; why not category/class 0 instead? Or differently asked: How can one determine whether the fitted model returns the (conditional) probability of category/class 1 as opposed to category/class 0? I would like to see answers that show where in the defintion of the logistic model the assumption that $p(x)= p(y=1 \mid x)$ is made explicit.
