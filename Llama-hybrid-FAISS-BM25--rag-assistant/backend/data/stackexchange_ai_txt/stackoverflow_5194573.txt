Crash using variables declared __declspec(thread)

I have a DLL (written in C) that uses static thread local storage ( __declspec(thread) ), and I want to use this DLL from a Visual Basic graphic interface. Unfortunately, when running the interface on Windows XP that DLL which use static thread local storage crashes when it try to acess its thread variables. How can I solve this problem? Thanks, Regards G.B. PS I would like to not modify the DLL.
