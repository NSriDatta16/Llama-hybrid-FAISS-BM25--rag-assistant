APC decreasing php performance??? (php 5.3, apache 2.2, windows vista 64bit)

I have an Apache/2.2.15 (VC9) and PHP/5.3.2 (VC9 thread safe) running as an apache module on Vista 64bit machine. All running fine. Project that I'm benchmarking (with apache's ab utility) is basically standard Zend Framework project with no db connection involved. Average (median) apache response is about 0.15 seconds . After I've installed APC (3.1.4-dev VC9 thread safe) with standard settings suddenly the request response time raised to 1.3 seconds (!) , which is unacceptable... All apc settings looked always good (through the apc.php script: enough shm memory, no cache full, fragmentation 0%). Only difference was to disable the stats lookup (apc.stat = 0). Then the response dropped to 0.09 seconds which was finally better than without the apc. IIRC, it's expected and obvious that the stat lookup creates some overhead, but shouldn't it still be far more performant compared to running wihout the apc extension at all? Or put it differently why is the apc.stat creating so much overhead?
