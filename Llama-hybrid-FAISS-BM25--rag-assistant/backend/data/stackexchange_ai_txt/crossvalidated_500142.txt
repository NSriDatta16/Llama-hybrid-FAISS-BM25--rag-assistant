The sample size is very low and the variance is very large. Meaning that although the average difference is pretty large (and positive, actually), such a thing can still happen by accident if there is no real difference. So in fact your result is correct and your intuition is wrong. The differences are not significant. ("Insignificant" means that the data are compatible with the null hypothesis, and actually they are. Obviously that doesn't mean that the null hypothesis is true.) "Is there another parameter I should be using? I want to prove that there is a significant difference between before and after (hopefully a negative difference too)." No, you have done the right thing, so all you can do is to accept a result that apparently you don't like. Note by the way that trying out another test because you didn't like the result of the first one will be invalid, whatever test you use, because the theory behind tests doesn't allow for the test you run to be chosen conditionally on the data.
