Filtering out bursts with a consistent range from a time series

I have time series of bursts that look like this: … and zoomed in: Now, there are also spurious bursts (which I call noise ) in the data, which look like this: … and zoomed in: As you can see, the main characteristics of the noise is that it has a more consistent range. I want to filter out this noise. So far, I defined a moving window of length 10 and whenever the standard deviation of the data within the window was smaller than some threshold, I suppressed it. However, this method could not filter out all noise and also filtered out some real bursts. I am looking to use some kind of statistical model (and not machine learning) to accomplish this.
