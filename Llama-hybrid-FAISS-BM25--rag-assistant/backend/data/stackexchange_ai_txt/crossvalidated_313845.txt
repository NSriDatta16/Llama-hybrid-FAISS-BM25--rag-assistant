AR models are linear and thus of limited flexibility when it comes to approximating nonlinear time series, but they are simple, easy to explain, and quick to estimate. LSTM are nonlinear and hence flexible, but they are complicated and computationally intensive. Therefore: When you need fast estimation or ease of explanation, or have little data, or your phenomenon is well described as a linear function of past values, use AR. When you do not care much about estimation speed and transparency, have lots of data, and the process is likely to be nonlinear, use LSTM.
