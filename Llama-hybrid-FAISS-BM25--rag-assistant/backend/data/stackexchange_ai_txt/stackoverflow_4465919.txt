Project Directory Tree on TFS 2010

I'm migrating from VSS to TFS 2010 and using that as a good opportunity to review how we organize projects in the company. Our company deals with two market segments, let's say Sports and Industrial Inspection. Since there's a low likelihood of sharing projects or code from one codebase to another, I created two project collections, one for sports and one for inspection. The thing is that developers are used to the VSS way of organizing projects by creating a directory tree where the projects go. How that concept migrates to TFS?
