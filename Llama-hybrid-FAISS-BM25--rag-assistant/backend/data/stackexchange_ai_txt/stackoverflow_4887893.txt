Just to round out the examples, here's one using Nokogiri without XSLT: require 'nokogiri' src = Hello world ! This is another line. And a paragraph with a heading. Third line. EOS doc = Nokogiri::HTML(src) if (doc.errors.any?) puts "doc.errors:" doc.errors.each do |e| puts "#{ e.line }: #{ e.to_s }" end puts end doc.search('//p/*').each do |n| n.replace(n.content) unless (%w[i b].include?(n.name)) end puts doc.to_html # >> doc.errors: # >> 6: Unexpected end tag : p # >> 8: Unexpected end tag : p # >> # >> # >> # >> # >> Hello world ! # >> This is another line. # >> # >> # >> And a paragraph with a heading. # >> Third line. # >> # >> Notice that Nokogiri is not happy with the markup and did some fix-up. And, that the actual code to strip the tags was only three lines and could have been written on one.
