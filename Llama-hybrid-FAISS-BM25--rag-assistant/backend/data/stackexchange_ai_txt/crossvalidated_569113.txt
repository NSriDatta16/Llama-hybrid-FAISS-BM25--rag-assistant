Confusion over probabilities and densities in a Bayesian Data Analysis textbook question

In Gelman's "Bayesian Data Analysis" question 1.5a), we are asked to estimate the probability of a tie in an election. The question: Probability assignment: the 435 U.S. Congressmembers are elected to two-year terms; the number of voters in an individual congressional election varies from about 50,000 to 350,000 . We will use various sources of information to estimate roughly the probability that at least one congressional election is tied in the next national election. Use any knowledge you have about U.S. politics. Specify clearly what information you are using to construct this conditional probability, even if your answer is just a guess. and the solution give here states that: For a given Congressional election, let $n$ be the total number of votes cast and $y$ be the number received by the candidate from the Democratic party. If we assume (as a first approximation, and with no specific knowledge of this election), that $y / n$ is uniformly distributed between $30 \%$ and $70 \%$ , then $$ \operatorname{Pr}(\text { election is tied } \mid n)=\operatorname{Pr}(y=n / 2)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll} \frac{1}{0.4 n} & \text { if } n \text { is even } \\ 0 & \text { if } n \text { is odd } \end{array} .\right. $$ If we suppose that $y$ is uniformly distributed with $U[0.3n, 0.7n]$ conditional on a specific value of n, then $\frac{1}{0.4n}$ is the probability density function. At a specific point, the continuous distribution has probability 0. How to reconcile this with the probability of a specific event $y=\frac{n}{2}$ in the solution?
