Use name attributes for form controls (such as and ), as that's the identifier used in the POST or GET call that happens on form submission. Use id attributes whenever you need to address a particular HTML element with CSS, JavaScript or a fragment identifier . It's possible to look up elements by name, too, but it's simpler and more reliable to look them up by ID.
