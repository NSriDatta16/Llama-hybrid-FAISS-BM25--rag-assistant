Conjuring JQuery Deferred with monadic incantations

Inspired by this (excellent) discussion of using Promises in javascript, I'm trying to work out how I could use Deferred to chain together async and non-async functions, to avoid paying the callback tax when using my ' Global storage ' code. I've got a few questions related to this, but I'll ask them together here, because the context is the same. One thing I can't work out is how I can make a deferred out of something that isn't asynchronous - that is, how do I take a value, wrap it in a promise, and return it directly? ( a -> M ) Also, how can I take an asynchronous function and wrap it so that it returns its result directly, but wrapped in a promise? ( (a -> b) -> (a -> M ) ) Last question, for monadic freaks - is there a standard name for this function? [a] -> (a -> M ) -> M
