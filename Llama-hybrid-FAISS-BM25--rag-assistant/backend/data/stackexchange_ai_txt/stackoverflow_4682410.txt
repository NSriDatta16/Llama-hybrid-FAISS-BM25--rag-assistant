UI not displaying spinner instantly

Hey, I'm creating an iOS app that requires the user to login using a username and password, this username and password is then sent to a web server to be authenticated. While it sends the request and waits for the response I show a UIActivityIndicator. The problem I get is that sometimes the UIActivityIndicator appears straight away on the button press and other times it appears only after a few seconds have passed. Am guessing its because the OS is executing another thread before updating the UI but I would like to know if anyone knows for sure what could be causing this sometime delay or is it just that my code is at fault. My code below: -(void)loginPressed:(id)sender{ if ([self validateForm]) { [self startLoadingAnimation:@"CONNECTING"]; [Session theSession].authenicatedUsername = usernameTextField.text; [Session theSession].authenicatedPassword = passwordTextField.text; usernameTextField.text = @""; passwordTextField.text = @""; [self setUserDetailsBasedOnUserID:[Session theSession].authenicatedUsername password:[Session theSession].authenicatedPassword]; }else { UIAlertView *alert = [[UIAlertView alloc] initWithTitle:NSLocalizedString(@"MISSING_LOGIN_DETAILS_TITLE", @"") message:NSLocalizedString(@"MISSING_LOGIN_MESSAGE", @"") delegate:self cancelButtonTitle:NSLocalizedString(@"OK_BUTTON", @"") otherButtonTitles:nil]; [alert show]; [alert release]; } } Thanks
