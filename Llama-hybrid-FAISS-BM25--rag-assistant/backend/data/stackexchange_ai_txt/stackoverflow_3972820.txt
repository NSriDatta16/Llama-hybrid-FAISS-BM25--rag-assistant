I would suggest you to try with Processing , which is able to do such things with Java in zero time.. home page here . You can easily embed a Processing frame inside your app, but remember that they are based on AWT so they are heavy weight and don't like being overlayed (for example in a JInternalFrame ) By the way what you seem to want to draw is a Gantt chart right? You can try with JFreeChart too (see demo here ), it's quite customizable and works fine.. homepage here
