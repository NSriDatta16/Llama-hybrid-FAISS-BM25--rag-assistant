It can be easier intuitively instead of dropping to think about including the lags, then it'll become obvious that you do not need to include every lag between the lags that are included. For instance, consider a typical seasonal time series specified with a baskshift (B) operator notation: $$(1-B^{12})(1-B)x_t=\varepsilon_t$$ $$x_t=\phi_1x_{t-1}+\phi_{12}x_{t-12}+\phi_{13}x_{t-13}+\varepsilon_t$$ You see that only three lags are present. The rest were not dropped , they were not included .
