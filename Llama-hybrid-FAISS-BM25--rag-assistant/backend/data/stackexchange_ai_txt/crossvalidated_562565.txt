Working with modalities (sensor data) with different frequencies

Accelerometer data: 119 Hz. Gyroscope data: 119 Hz. Magnetometer data: 20 Hz. I would like to build a 2D-CNN. I have sensors with different sampling rates. Rather than extracting a feature, how I can feed my data with different sampling rates to CNN?
