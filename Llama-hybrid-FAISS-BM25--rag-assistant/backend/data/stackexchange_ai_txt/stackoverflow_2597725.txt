Keep a HashMap of {account_number, occurrences} in memory (initially empty), and traverse the file only once, setting or incrementing (in the HashMap ) the number of occurrences of each account number you encounter during the traversal. If you also have to print full information about the duplicate account numbers, then perform a second traversal of the input file, this time printing full details about each account number where the corresponding number of occurrences in the HashMap exceeded 1 during the previous traversal. In terms of memory usage, even if all account numbers in a 500k-line-file are distinct you will only require roughly 1M integer storage (assuming account numbers are integers) plus HashMap overhead, which should all fit comfortably in a few megabytes of memory.
