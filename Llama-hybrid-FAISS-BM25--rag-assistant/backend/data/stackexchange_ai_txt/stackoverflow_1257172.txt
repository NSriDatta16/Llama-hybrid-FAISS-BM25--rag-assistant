Although it seems to be very popular, href='#' is not a magic keyword for JavaScript, it's just a regular link to an empty anchor and as such it's pretty pointless. You basically have two options: Implement an alternative for JavaScript-unaware user agents, use the href parameter to point to it and cancel the link with JavaScript. E.g.: When the noscript alternative is not available or relevant, you don't need a link at all: Close
