As @Macka writes , the left and right values are not foreign keys to tree nodes, so they don't have to be the same type. They can be integers while the tree node primary key is a GUID. Celko also wrote " Trees and Hierarchies in SQL for Smarties " which goes into more detail about Nested Set Model, and other solutions. Reading this book will save you a lot of time and a lot of mistakes. There are other solutions to storing hierarchical data in a database. See my answer here: What is the most efficient/elegant way to parse a flat table into a tree?
