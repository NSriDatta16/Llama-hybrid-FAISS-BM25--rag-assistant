I like the use of an extended character-set when writing dummy code in text. The LaTeX fonts for code and math markup work well. A good example would be using a left arrow for assignment or binding rather than = . The best examples of code in books I have seen has been things like the Dragon Book or TAOCP. I think a mixture of mathematical etymology due to the ability to render those characters and a relation to common syntax is great. A mixture of the usual fixed-courier type fonts and advanced math markup available through Computer Modern in LaTeX I think works well for readers of a mathematical disposition ... and it can look very nice.
