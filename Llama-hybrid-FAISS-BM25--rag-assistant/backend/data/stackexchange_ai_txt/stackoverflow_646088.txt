Excuse me, but it seems to me you've got it wrong. Remember, "SELECT is not broken" and Microsoft won't modify such a critical piece of their engine without advertising it strongly due to conversion problems. the table you're quoting comes from decimal and numeric storage in MSDN , which are basically more than int If you're using a strict alias, Using special datatypes strongly hints that a int -based type takes four bytes and no more. If you're using a CLR type, there be dragons, or more overhead. Anyway, You can verify the footprint of your datatypes by looking into sys.types
