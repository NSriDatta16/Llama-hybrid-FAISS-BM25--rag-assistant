How does Neural Collaborative filtering (NCF) handle new users (cold start)?

I am building model with NCF and i know NCF has great power to handle sparse data, and find great representation for users and items. However, I don't know how would NCF handle new users? my structure is : users_id -> embedding items_id -> embedding -> GMF + MLP -> concat() -> output In this structure, if a new user_id appear in inference data, embedding layer may error out and I don't know whether NCF will apply "global mean" value to that new user_id. In another word, how do you handle cold start users in NCF?
