Create your own interpreter in vb.net

I have a Vb.net program which is a financial application. It is a charting program that means it loads stock market data and shows charts. I need to create a small interpreter so that users can write code and execute. For e.g. if user wants to apply a technical tool such as moving average then he can type, Dim M as Integer. M= MovingAvg("Simple",10) Stuff like that, it should support statements like variable decl, arrays, for next, do loop, calculation like addition, subtraction, multiplication & division. Plus other statements that are specific to my software. There is no need for going lower level or thinking on exe terms as I am not building a standalone windows application. Before I begin I would like to take advice from you guys. How should I go about it and what important things I should keep in mind ? I did consider language like LUA, that I could embed but it was too much of a task plus Lua's style of programming would be complex for non-programmers. Thats why I want to stick to BASIC language style. Any comments or recommendations or pdf (ebook) to refer to will be appreciated. Thanks, Greatchap
