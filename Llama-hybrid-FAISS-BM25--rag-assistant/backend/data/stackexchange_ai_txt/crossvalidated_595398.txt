Assuming $i$ indexes individuals, and $t$ indexes times of measures within individuals: $$\begin{align*}Y_{ti} & = \beta_{0,ti} + \beta_{1,t}X_{ti} + \epsilon_{0,ti} + \epsilon_{1,ti}X_{ti} + \mu_{0,i}\\\\ \text{where, for example}\\\\ \left[\begin{array}$\epsilon_{0}\\\epsilon_{1}\end{array}\right]&\sim \Omega\left[0,\begin{array}{llr}\sigma^2_{\epsilon0}\\\sigma_{\epsilon 01} & \sigma^{2}_{\epsilon2}\end{array}\right]\text{, and }\sigma^2_{\mu}\sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^{2}_{\mu})\end{align*}$$ You will also need to make choices about how you want to estimate the variance/covariance matrix for $\epsilon_{0,ti}$ and $\epsilon_{1,ti}X_{ti}$ (e.g., constrain covariance $\sigma_{\epsilon 01}$ to zero and assume independent variances $\sigma^2_{\epsilon 0}$ & $\sigma^2_{\epsilon 1}$ , constrain covariance to zero and assume equal variances, estimate covariance without constraints, etc.). MLwiN can estimate this kind of model using IGLS or a Bayesian MCMC model (as can BUGS, JAGS, etc. for the latter). The term $\beta_{1,ti}$ estimates the average effect of $X$ on $Y$ across all times. The terms $\sigma^2_{\epsilon 1}$ , and if constrained or estimated to be zero, the terms $\sigma^2_{\epsilon 0}$ and $\sigma_{\epsilon 01}$ are combined in a quadratic function of $X_{ti}$ to model variation in $\beta_1$ across values of $X_{ti}$ (i.e. this is a model of complex variance of the effect of $X$ give your repeated measures structure). My answer is making assumptions about the sufficiency of your sample size, the particulars of your study design (e.g., does $t=1$ or $t=24$ mean the same thing for all individuals?), normal or multivariate normal errors, etc.
