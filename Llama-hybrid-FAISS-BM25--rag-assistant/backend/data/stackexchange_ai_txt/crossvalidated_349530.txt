Interpreting residual plots from a regression problem using CNNs on image data

My dataset consists of 799 images and each image is associated with a real number. I have split my dataset into 3 parts (80-10-10 split) randomly. I have trained my model using split1. The values follow a gaussian distribution. I have trained an CNN model to output a real when an image is fed to it. These are my $R^2$ values and Residual plots for each of the dataset split. Split1: The split of the dataset that I trained my model on. $R^2$ = $0.9857076788979228$ Residual plot: Split2: $R^2$ = 0.7396153728584336 Residual plot: Split3: $R^2$ = 0.7290908907070102 Residual plot: I think that my model is biased, probably overfitting ( high $R^2$ value on Split1 ). I don't understand why the $R^2$ values of Split2 and Split3 are nearly same and the Residual plots look similar. What is the next step for me ? Should I reduce model complexity ? EDIT: I have tried to reduce model complexity by reducing nonlinearities. The $R^2$ values decreases drastically for Split2 and Split3 by 0.3. And the residual plots are getting even more clustered. I'm stuck with this, I would greatly appreciate help at this point.
