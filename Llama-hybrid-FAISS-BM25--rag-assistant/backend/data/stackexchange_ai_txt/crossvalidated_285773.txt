That is simply regression to the mean! The averages will always be less disperse, less heterogeneous than the specific observations. In a regression model, however, it is good to assess the adequacy of the straight-line approximation obtained in linear regression. Calculating averages over the domain of one or more regressors is a very good exploratory analysis, but I would not compare the sample correlation to the aggregate correlation because there will be regression to the mean.
