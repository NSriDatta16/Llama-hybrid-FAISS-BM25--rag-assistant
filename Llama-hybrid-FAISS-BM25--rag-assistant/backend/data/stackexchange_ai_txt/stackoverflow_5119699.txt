How to read a file which is opened in c#?

Possible Duplicate: Read file which is in use? I have an mvvp-wpf aplication.. And I use infragistics to read the file. When the file is open..and if I try to read the file through application I get an exception. One way to solve this is ...ask user to close the file . Is there any other solution ? Thanks in advance !
