Inputstream from WAP server, parse parts

I have asked this question countless times on various forums. Ultimately all I need is a recommendation for a book or website. Hopefully an API can be recommended. I can code anything I just dont know where to look. I have Googled to the end of the web. Looked over several Java packages including the wireless toolkit. Ive seen python APIs to parse mms messages. I am using Java. I currently have various algorithms to attach an inputstream to an mms message on a WAP server. The message on the server is an SMIL message? XML? I would parse the inputstream into XML? Then I could go through the nodes of the xml looking for an image part? Can I just parse the raw inputstream looking for an image? Where do I begin? Maybe someone can reply with a consolidating paragraph of how to read a raw mms inputstream and parse the contents into discrete objects which can then be subsequently processed. I know how to process the image and anything else the part may contain, I just need to know how to get to the image. Ultimately I just want to attach an inputstream only on the image and then I'm good to go. What book will teach me where to begin? What APIs can be recommended?
