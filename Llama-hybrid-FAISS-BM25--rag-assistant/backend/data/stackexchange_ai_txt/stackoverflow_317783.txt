I don't think you'll be able to truly disable the keyboard just like you cannot truly disable the keyboard when you browse a webpage via a PC or Mac. One trick would be to add JavaScript to intercept the OnKeyPress (or OnKeyDown) event to intercept the key stroke and cancel it based on the User Agent. I haven't tried it against the iPhone specifically but it has worked for other applications when I want to restrict the type of input on an enabled text box (i.e. canceling alpha characters in a phone number field). Since the "OnKey" events are still valid on the iPhone (as determined by sites with autocomplete like Google), the method should work.
