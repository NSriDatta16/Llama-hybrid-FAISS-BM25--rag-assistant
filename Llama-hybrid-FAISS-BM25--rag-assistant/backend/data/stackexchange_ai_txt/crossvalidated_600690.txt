Featrue importance according to logistic regression. in python

I've trained a logistic regression over my data. I checked feature importance: from matplotlib import pyplot features = X_train.columns importance = Model.best_estimator_.coef_[0] plt.bar(features, importance) plt.title("Feature Importance according to logistic regression") plt.ylabel("Improtance") plt.show() and the importance could be seen also here Model.best_estimator_.coef_[0] array([1.09365005e+00, 7.50386093e-01, 4.29639078e-04, 5.99721148e-01]) My question is what is the meaning of these results? what are those numbers? I thought it was percentages before but 1.09365005e+00 means more than 100% importance, so it can't be percentages
