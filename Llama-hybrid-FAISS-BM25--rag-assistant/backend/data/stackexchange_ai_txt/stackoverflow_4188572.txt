core dump segmentation fault with C++

I am a newbie to the C/CPP application and analysing an issue with a piece of C/CPP code. I came across a Segmentation Fault error and I am not to identify the root cause of the segmentation fault. Please find the scenario below: union Value { int value_int; float value_float; RWCString *value_string; } void setValueString(const RWCString &value_string_arg) { *(value.value_string) = value_string_arg; //value is a reference to UNION Value. } when an application makes use of this piece of code, then it generates a segmentation fault at runtime and terminates. I placed few console output statements and understood that the segmentation fault may be due to *(value.value_string) = value_string_arg; line. Could anyone please validate my identification of the segmentation fault? Also, I am not pretty sure as to get around this issue. Please let me know if a anyone has got thoughts on the same. Any help is much appreciated. Thanks ~Jegan
