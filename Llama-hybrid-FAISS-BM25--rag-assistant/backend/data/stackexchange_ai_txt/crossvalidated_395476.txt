Assumptions you listed (and some other) are the ones in the wiki page, yes. Many machine learning algorithms have some assumptions by the way; some of them are restrictive and some not. And, OLS is a simple Machine Learning algorithm. It's not out of the scope. It also has more general versions such as Generalized Linear Model, Weighted Least Squares , which are also ML models. It's not that we always prefer complex ML models, some problems may be cracked via OLS, some others (possibly many) cannot be.
