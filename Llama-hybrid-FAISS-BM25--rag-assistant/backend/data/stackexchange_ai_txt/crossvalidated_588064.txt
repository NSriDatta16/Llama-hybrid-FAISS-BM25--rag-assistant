If your time series exhibits 'anomalous behavior' in more recent observations, you necessarily have to remove or at least 'adjust' the data. Otherwise, your model performance will suffer for future events that don't relate to the previous outlier interval. In this thread Rob Hyndman gave following advice that appears to be straight forward - although there may be more/better alternatives: For non-seasonal time series, outliers are replaced by linear interpolation. For seasonal time series, the seasonal component from the STL fit is removed and the seasonally adjusted series is linearly interpolated to replace the outliers, before re-seasonalizing the result. STL refers to Seasonal and Trend Decomposition using LOESS . Hope this helps towards solving your problem.
