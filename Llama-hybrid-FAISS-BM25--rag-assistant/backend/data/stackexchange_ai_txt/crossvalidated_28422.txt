Macro is right that it depends on how you define income per person. Let's assume for simplicity that the income per person in a family is gotten by taking the family income adn dividing by the family size. Call ci the per person income for the ith family and ni the number of family members in the ith family. Suppose we have a total of M families. How would we define the average family income? It would be (∑ni ci)/ (∑ni) . Each sum goes from 1 to M. Now what your friend suggests is the average family size which is Fs=(∑ni)/M multiplied by the average monthly income per person which is Fs (∑ci/M) = (∑ni)(∑ci)/M^2 Then compare (∑ni ci)/ (∑ni) to (∑ni)(∑ci)/M^2 They are not the same even algebraically.
