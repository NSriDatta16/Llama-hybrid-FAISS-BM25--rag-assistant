So your tradeoff is saving CPU cycles by storing the file versus saving disk space by always generating it. I would recommend saving CPU cycles because adding disk storage is cheap and easy (can be done without taking the server offline). Adding CPUs is relatively more expensive and usually requires taking the server offline (depends on your environment). Option 1: Create the PDF on first request Advantages: PDF is not created unless someone downloads it, so no wasted CPU on creating PDFs nobody wants. PDF is a file, so IIS can transmit it to the client as a file, it is available for IIS caching strategies, etc. Disadvantages: PDF file takes up space on disk. Need to mark the PDF (or delete it) if the content is changed, otherwise the PDF version could be out of sync with the article. Option 2: Create the PDF on every request Advantages: PDF is always up-to-date with the latest version of the article. Disk space is minimized. Disadvantages: Heavy CPU load on the server if many users request a PDF download. Unable to use IIS or other web server caching strategies.
