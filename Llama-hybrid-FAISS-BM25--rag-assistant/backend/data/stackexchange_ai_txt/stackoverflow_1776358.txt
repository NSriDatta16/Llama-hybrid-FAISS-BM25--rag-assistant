EDIT: never mind, answering another question I realized that this manual used gas (also called AT&T) syntax, this is not what you want if you want an equivalent of the Intel reference manuals. I had not paid attention because I use gas myself. What about this one , courtesy of Sun? I've used it. Also I am not sure I understand what your problem is, but maybe that's because my pdf reader can search keywords directly in the PDF. You would solve this problem and more if you found one for Linux with a similar feature.
