Compare several binary time series

What is the best method to compare several time series taking into account not only the overall number of overlapping points (as Hamming distance does), but also to catch somehow the fact that the behaviour is similar. E.g. given 3 time series A = [0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0]; B = [0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0]; C = [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0]; Using Hamming distance and other similar metrics, A and C would be the most similar. However, in terms of behaviour A and B are similar. Is there any metric that can catch that?
