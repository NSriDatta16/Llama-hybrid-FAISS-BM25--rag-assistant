Best way of transferring MySQL data to page javascript via PHP?

This question is a bit messy, so I'll try to stick to the basics of my problem. When users logs into my site, their site preferences are fetched from the database. The preferences could, for instance, represent a certain visual layout, customized by the user himself/herself. Let's say the user can choose to show or hide 3 "info"-boxes that are, by default, shown on the webpage. The preferences are stored like this in the db: ---------------------------------- | user_id | box_1 | box_2 | box3 | ---------------------------------- | 23 | true | false | true | ---------------------------------- This data has to be fed into the javascript on the page, in order for the user to get their personal visual layout. So I would do something like this: Is this the best solution to implement? Or is there a more elegant way? My concerns are also that this would be messy when a user has 100+ preferences. EDIT: I'm sorry, I don't think I wrote my question clearly enough. I'm aware of PHP's JSON encoder, but the PHP code is not my concern here. What I'm wondering is if this is the best way to inject external data into javascript? Should it be done otherwise?
