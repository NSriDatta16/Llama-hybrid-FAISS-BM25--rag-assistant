I just did a quick search on my C specification and word "stack" appears exactly 0 times. As you might expect, the existence of a stack is an implementation choice. I've never heard of an implementation that didn't have a stack, mind you. Using a stack is just the easiest way to use & reuse space for variables with automatic storage duration, I guess. Your compiler could just as easily allocate global space for every automatic variable in your program if it wanted to, but it would increase your memory footprint pretty quickly. It would probably cause you some hiccups if you had a recursive function, too.
