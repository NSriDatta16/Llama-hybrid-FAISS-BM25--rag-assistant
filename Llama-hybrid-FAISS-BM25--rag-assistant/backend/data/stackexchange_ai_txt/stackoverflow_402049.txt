Change your web garden setting to 10 or greater. Then watch your CPU and memory utilization on the web server. Continue to increase the web garden setting until either the app is completely responsive with less than 5% average utilization OR you have actually maxed your web server's memory. UPDATE It's not about diagnosing, it's about properly configuring the IIS server. Web Gardens are one of the top misunderstood features of IIS. By increasing the available threads to handle new requests you remove the appearance of contention at the web server level and place it squarely where it belongs. In this case at your database. Instead of masking a problem it actually highlights exactly where the problem is.
