How to estimate training time prior to training? (Machine Learning & Neural Networks)

I'd like to know ahead of time if my training will take 8 hours, 8 days or 8 weeks. (The 8 was an arbitrary number I chose obviously). Is there a reliable way to estimate the time it will take? Can I extrapolate the time it takes to train 200,000 as roughly double the time it takes to train 100,000? It would be helpful to be able to estimate whether it will take a couple hours or a couple days or even weeks because then I can tweak the parameters ahead of time.
