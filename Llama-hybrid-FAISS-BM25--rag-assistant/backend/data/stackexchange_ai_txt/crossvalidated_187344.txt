How to determine which variable agrees best with a gold standard?

I have a dataset of 100 patients. Each patient has 3 lab tests: Lab Test 0: "Gold Standard" test which will serve as my reference standard Lab Test 1 Lab Test 2 I want to compare the differences between Lab Test1 and Lab Test 0 and then Lab Test2 against Lab Test 0, with the aim at looking what the difference is between the values, and which one comes closer to Lab Test 0 on average.
