Yes, you could use WebStart for this. Permission: If you need permission to the file system, you have to sign your jars and put the all-permissions tag in your jnlp. Arguments: Arguments can be provided by using the arguments elements in application_desc . Folders: I'm don't think you can include folders in the WebStart application, but you could put the config files in a jar and read them from there, or extract them on startup. ClassNotFoundError: We have intermittently received ClassNotFound exceptions when running the JAR from the server which looks like Windows dropping the network connection with only part of the classes from the JAR loaded Does not sound plausible to me. per default, all jars will be downloaded before the application starts. If you set "download" to "lazy", the jar will be downloaded when first needed, but I would guess it will be downloaded completly then.
