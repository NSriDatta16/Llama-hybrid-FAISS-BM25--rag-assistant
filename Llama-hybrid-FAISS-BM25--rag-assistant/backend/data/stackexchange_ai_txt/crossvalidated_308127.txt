You can absolutely use both words or characters. But if you cannot segment the text into words accurately it is better to use characters. However if the text is relatively too long I'd recommend words provided a sound segmentor is available since too long text may lead to bad network performance. If the vocabulary is too large when you use words you can use large corpus to pretrain the embedding employing a task such as language model(corpus can be numerously large).
