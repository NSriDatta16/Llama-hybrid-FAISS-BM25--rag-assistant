scikit learn Feature selection for time series forecasting

heres the link to sklearns feature selection/engineering http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_selection.html I was wondering if these methods are actually useful? I have around 20/30 features (all numerical) in total and was wondering how these methods are able to help? Shall i perform analysis with and without FS/FE and compare?
