Tackling Cross-Browser Compatibility and CSS w/ IE6/7

I'm having serious problems with CSS floats in this wordpress theme in IE6/7: http://032b4a6.netsolhost.com/WordPress/ This is the first WP theme I've coded, and while I've learned some great lessons for the future, the code is inelegant. It works fine in modern browsers, but it is highly likely that a large number of visitors to this site will not have updated browsers. It seems to me that there is a core issue that is repeated throughout the styling and if I can discover what that is, then I'll be a good bit closer to fixing the theme. I found this page , which seems to offer some suggestions but, ultimately, makes my task sound impossible. Are there other resources or common suggestions that are offered for fixing cross-compatibility float issues with IE? Even more importantly, if you are able to look at the site in IE6 or IE7, do you have any specific suggestions for how I might fix the floating issues?
