At a previous job at a large old computer company we had a CRT process. I wouldn't say it was a completely awful over the top idea since the software product involved high-availability computing and was thus very risk averse. But it was annoying at times and certainly slowed down development. Basically, the system was, after having your code peer reviewed by 3 people, you filled out a CRT form (which at some point I converted to a web application). The CRT (Change Request Team) would review all the requests a few times a week and discuss with management, team leads and the coder in question to ensure all the hoops had been jumped through: All the tests written... appropriate people had reviewed it... QA informed of new tests... etc. Thankfully the web application version was well accepted and the old manual form, which was really detailed and over the top, was dropped. At least from our organization...
