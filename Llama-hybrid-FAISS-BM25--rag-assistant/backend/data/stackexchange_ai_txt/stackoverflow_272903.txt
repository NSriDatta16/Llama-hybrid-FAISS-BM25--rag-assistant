Others all gave you a good and reasonable ideas, but still - if you're using files for temporary storage and if those files will always be created first (it doesn't matter if there is a leftover file with a same name already on the disk as you'll overwrite it anyway) then processid_threadid approach is completely valid. Use GetCurrentProcessID and GetCurrentThreadID Win32 calls to access those two IDs.
