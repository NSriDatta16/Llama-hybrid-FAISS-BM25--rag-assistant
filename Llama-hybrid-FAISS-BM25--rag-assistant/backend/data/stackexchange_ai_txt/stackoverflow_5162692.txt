Just a side note. The form handle is not even created yet: Form frm = new Form(); if (frm.IsHandleCreated == true) { // Doesn't get here } Graphics graphics = Graphics.FromHwnd(frm.Handle); Maybe you are looking for something like: Form frm = new Form(); frm.HandleCreated += (s, ev) => { if (frm.IsHandleCreated == true) { Graphics graphics = Graphics.FromHwnd(frm.Handle); // FIXME not sure what you want to do, but drawing into this still won't work. } }; frm.Paint += (s, ev) => { ev.Graphics.DrawLine(Pens.Black, 10, 10, 100, 100); }; frm.FormBorderStyle = FormBorderStyle.None; frm.WindowState = FormWindowState.Maximized; frm.TransparencyKey = Color.Magenta; frm.ShowDialog();
