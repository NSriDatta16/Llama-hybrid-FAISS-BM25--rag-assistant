Perhaps one variable which people overlook in these cases is the availability of expert support. Okay, so currently there's an oversupply of people who can help you with db issues, efficiency issues, disaster recovery etc. However this may not be always the case in the future, and it's the applications you use it for that may be the defining issue. Are there people in your organization who have experience in one or more of the relevant databases? (as it happens I believe that someone's who's become proficient in say Oracle, can become fairly competent in Sql*Server or Mysql in a fairly short space of time) You state it's going to be used for your financial systems - perhaps you really need input from a consultant who's worked on implementing and/or supporting financial systems - for example I understand that Sybase is popular in City type firms. Or perhaps there's an off-the-shelf package that utilises a preferred database? Try and define exactly what your system(s) needs to do first.
