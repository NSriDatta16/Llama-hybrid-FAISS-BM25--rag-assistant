"Машинное обучение" (Machine learning) and "Анализ данных" (Data analysis) are the terms used to refer to data science in russian. Also a term "распознавание образов" (pattern recognition) also used, but it s a bit outdated. Term "наука о данных" is rarely used and references more to science and less to industry. I never encountered term "даталогия" in community. A few references: term "Машинное обучение" is used in native-russian Coursera course . main data mining resourse in russian is www.machinelearning.ru you can use the main hiring russian resource HeadHunter and check usage of different terms if you are not sure.
