EDIT: My previous assumption that XLSWRITE wouldn't work was wrong. I just tried the following in MATLAB: xlswrite('xltest.xls',{'1' '2' '=SUM(A1,B1)'}); and when I opened the file in excel, the function was in fact there! The limitation on this would be that you would have to use only the functions that are in Excel. Unfortunately, I don't believe XLSREAD can read the formulae into MATLAB (it appears to just get the result). PREVIOUSLY SUGGESTED OPTIONS: You may want to check out the Spreadsheet Link EX software on the MathWorks website, although I'm a bit unfamiliar with it and am not sure if even that can do what you need. Something else that you should look into is MATLAB Builder EX , which "lets you integrate MATLAB® applications into your organization's Excel® workbooks as macro functions or add-ins". Sounds promising...
