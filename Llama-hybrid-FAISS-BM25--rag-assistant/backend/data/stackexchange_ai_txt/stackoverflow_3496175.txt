Supporting multiple screens - Blackberry

When developing a blackberry app originally, I didn't pay much attention to being able to support multiple screen resolutions. So, I ended up with code that runs fine on a 320*240 resolution but messes up completely on other screens. How do I go about fixing this? Or in general, how would you support multiple resolutions without making one build for each res? Thanks, Teja.
