The first step you should take is to write out the steps your programme will take. e.g. start running load the dat file do the calculations use the results of the calculations stop running Each of those tasks could be broken down into smaller tasks, so you should do that too, until you're at a point where you can write some code. Not knowing anything about your file format, the calculations that need to be done, or what you intend to do with the results of your calculations means that I can't really explain any more. Some basics: Loading a file using(StreamReader sr = new StreamReader("filename.dat")) { //use your file here //e.g var lines = sr.ReadToEnd().Split(new [] {Environment.NewLine}, StringSplitOptions.None); //will read all of the lines in your file into an string[] } Simple calculations using System.Linq //other code //given that numbers is IEnumerable double average = numbers.Average() double sum = numbers.Aggregate((tot, n) => tot+n); double sumOfSquares = numbers.Select(n => n*n).Aggregate((tot, n) => tot + n);
