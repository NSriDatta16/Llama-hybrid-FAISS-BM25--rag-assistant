I also had difficulties with exceptions in workflows - mostly determining why they occurred, the source, and a description or message. I got better at this as I gained more experience, and if I began another workflow project I'd be able to debug it far more efficiently. It's just a different paradigm and so can't be approached the same way as straight code. Another issue I had with WF 4.0 was unit testing with WorkflowInvoker ; the specifics escape me but mocking dependencies and parent/child workflows was a real headache. Generally I really like WF 4.0, a massive improvement over 3.5. Running in debug mode can be very slow, debugging in the designer is more trouble than it's worth, but the framework is great and very usable.
