Maximum Likelihood estimation for ARMA(1,1) in R

I have written the following code in R to estimate the parameters of a ARMA(1,1) process. armacoeff Now, as far as I understand this code should give me the Maximum Likelihood Estimates for $\mu, \phi$ and $\theta$ but they do not align with the estimates given from the arima function. Namely, the AR1 estimate from arima corresponds to $\theta$ and the MA1 estimate corresponds to $\phi$ . According to my derived likelihood function this should not be the case. Can anyone point out my errors? I have attached the following results for a example time series called "test" ARIMA estimate arima(test, order=c(1,0,1)) Call: arima(x = test, order = c(1, 0, 1)) Coefficients: ar1 ma1 intercept -0.0735 0.1030 1e-04 s.e. 0.2799 0.2815 4e-04 sigma^2 estimated as 0.0005476: log likelihood = 8311.68, aic = -16615.36 And now the result for armacoeff h=armacoeff(test) > h $par mu phi theta 1.944046e-05 9.743507e-02 -7.261513e-02 $objective [1] 1.943927 $convergence [1] 0 $iterations [1] 11
