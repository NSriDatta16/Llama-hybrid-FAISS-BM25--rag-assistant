Having a button animate whilst being dragged

I have a button that gets dragged around the screen. Upon moving it above a certain point, it grows in size, but unfortunately because it doesn't auto-update the position as it's animating, it appears stuck for the animation time, and is just jumpy. Anybody got any idea how it can continue to follow the user's finger whilst still growing?
