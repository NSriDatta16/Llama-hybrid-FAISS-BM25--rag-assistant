Computing Conditional Probability - $P(A|B^c)$

I'm terribly out of practice in even the most basic rules of probability, any help with the following question is appreciated. Essentially, I am having an issue with the application of the conditional probability calculaiton $P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}$ towards finding the probability of $P(A|B^c)$. When I implement the formula, the $P(B^c)$'s are cancelling out in the numerator/denominaor, resulting in a probability value for $P(A|B^c)$ which betrays my intuition. As an example, 3 events involving cupcakes: $P(A) = 0.7$ - A cupcake passes frosting inspection. $P(B) = 0.2$ - The cupcake is sent for re-frosting. For example, the cake part was alright, but the frosting failed to pass inspection, so the cupcake gets returned to the decorating table. $P(C) = 0.1$ - The cupcake is thrown away entirely. It may have been burned or crushed or dropped on the floor, etc. If we ask the question, Given that a cupcake is not sent for re-frosting, what is the probability it will be thrown away entirely? , and I fill in the terms of the formula by reflex, using the value of $P(B^C) = 0.8$, I get: $$P(C|B^C) = \frac{P(C \cap B^C)}{P(B^C)} = \frac{(0.1 )(0.8)}{0.8} = 0.1$$ The solution above is of course incorrect, it is underestimating the true share of cupcakes thrown away in the subset of cupcakes not sent for re-frosting. In a situation where $10$ cupcakes are undergoing frosting inspection, the subset of $0.8$ which are not sent for re-frosting would experience throw away at the same rate as the rest of the population, at a probability of $0.1$. Intuitively, and possibly with the help of a Venn Diagram , we know that the actual probability value we are looking for surrounding these 10 cupcakes is: $$P(C|B^C) = \frac{1}{8} = 0.125$$ Where, how, and how badly have I butchered the application of this otherwise simple approach? Any help assisting me in applying formal probability rules towards this issue is greatly appreciated. The general hope for this question is that some formalized routine for this exists, and I am simply missing it. Thanks.
