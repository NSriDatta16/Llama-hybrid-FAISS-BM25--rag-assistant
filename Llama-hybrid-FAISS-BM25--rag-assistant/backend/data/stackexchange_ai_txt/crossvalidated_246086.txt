Time series grouping for detecting market cannibalism

I'm dealing with daily sales of products in a supermarket. Together with the historical data I have promotions for each product and weather data. What I lack is data about stock in and stock out of products. In particular the stock out I miss for a product $i$ at time $t$ (say Pepsi ) $Y_{i_t}$ could correspond to a spike in sales for a similar product $j$ at the same time $t$ (say Coke) $Y_{j_t}$ , where $t$ denotes a day. Basically I want to find clusters of the same kind of products so that I know how to redistribute the items over similar products, avoiding other stock outs of the similar products, what is called Market Cannibalism I don't have data on the amount of time the supermarket need to restock the items stocked out, but I hope they don't restock the items daily, since at that point I could not use the information for forecasting. Thank you :)
