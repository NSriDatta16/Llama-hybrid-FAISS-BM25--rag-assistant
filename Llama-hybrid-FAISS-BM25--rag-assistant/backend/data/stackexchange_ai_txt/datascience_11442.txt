Retail Store Testing

I am an analyst who is new to retail store testing (for example: customer response to a store new layout or a new product or process in one or 2 stores). Any suggestions for a good book/blog/any source where I could learn about this. The challenges I see are - the sample size is usually one or 2 stores for the test so how do you do statistically significant testing with such a small sample; test stores or control stores are matched 1-1 but often not selected randomly. Any guidance in learning about the data science in this area is greatly appreciated. Thanks!!
