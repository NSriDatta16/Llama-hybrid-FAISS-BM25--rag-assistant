silverlight The type exists in both and DataContractSurrogates

I'm using silverlight 4 with ria serivces .. I got an error said : The type 'eLab.Web.SessionsHWFile' exists in both 'eLab.Web.dll' and 'DataContractSurrogates_c96b3601-cd13-4049-93bb-e7b3f59a4fd9' where eLab.Web is the aspx web project that hosts the silverlight project, and SessionsHWFile is an edmx entity ,it's not a real table in DB, it's VIEW. I dragged a grid from the data source and doped it in XAML user control, and used a query to get the data from stored procedure in DB, but I'm getting the above error when I debug the code and expand the results view : (source: 0zz0.com ) I did this ,adding a view and getting the results from SP in DB, like a million time and nothing happened until this time ..
