Consider the function $\text{hardmax}(z)^Tz$ for $z = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]$ where hardmax is a hard version of softmax, which returns 1 for the maximum component and 0 for all the other components. Then we will have $[0, 0, 0, 0, 1] ^T [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] = 5$ . On the other hand, softmax of $z$ will be $[0.01, 0.03, 0.09, 0.23, 0.64]$ so $[0.01, 0.03, 0.09, 0.23, 0.64] ^T [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] = 4.46$ . As you can see, softmax causes a weighted average on the components where the larger components are weighted more heavily.
