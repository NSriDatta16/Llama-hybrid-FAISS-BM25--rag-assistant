Android GPS Only Communicates After Google Map Runs

I looked for the answer but didn't find one - my question(s) follow: I wrote code that works with the emulator (I send local coords vis DDMS). The code also works on the device BUT , only after running Google Map. I'm guessing there's something missing in either the manifest or in the code but I don't know what it is and I could use some advice/suggestions. Here are snippets of the relevant portions of the Code: (I wasn't able to figure out how to properly embed this stuff so it looked intelligent/organized but, I think you get the point...) homeboy = (LocationManager)getSystemService(Context.LOCATION_SERVICE); locationListener = new MyLocationListener(); Location recentLoc = homeboy.getLastKnownLocation(LocationManager.GPS_PROVIDER); I also have a LocationListener method (shown w/o it's four methods of checking for enabled, changed,...etc) private class MyLocationListener implements LocationListener { ... etc. I include this in the manifest file near the top: So, what's missing? Also, how to get location from wifi (as in getting the location by any means available short of saving the last location to a file and retrieving it). Thanks for any input
