It kind of sounds like you're looking for a dependency parser. Such a parser will give you the relationship between any word in a sentence and its semantic or syntactic head. The MSTParser uses an online max-margin technique known as MIRA to classify the relationships between words. The MaltParser package does the same but uses SVMs to make parsing decisions. Both systems are trainable and provide similar classification and attachment performance, see table 1 here .
