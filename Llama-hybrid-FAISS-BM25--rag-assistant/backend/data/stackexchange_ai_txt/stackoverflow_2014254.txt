Date Picker / calendar UI Component with draggable date ranges

I'm looking for a datepicker control (HTML + JavaScript / Flex) that allows selecting a range of dates by dragging along the calendar dates (just like in Google Calendar or Outlook) It can be open source (preferable obviously) or commercial, and should be server technology agnostic.
