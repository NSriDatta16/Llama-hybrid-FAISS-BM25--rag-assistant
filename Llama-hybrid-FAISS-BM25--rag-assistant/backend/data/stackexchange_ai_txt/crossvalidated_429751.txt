The significance of 'significant'

I am writing up a paper where I report the results of a set of analyses using Bayesian parameter estimating but am really struggling to come up with synonyms for significant. Take this sentence. "The analysis presented above allowed us to estimate whether people given decaffeinated coffee and told truthfully that it was decaffeinated still experienced a significant reduction in caffeine withdrawal." All my training in stats has been using NHST and the language that goes along with it. The problem is that 'significant' is a perfect word to capture effects that are noteworthy without sensationalising them with adjectives like 'pronounced' or 'large'. So in co-opting the word 'significant' and giving it a specific meaning frequentism has also prevented its use by other statistical traditions as a neutral descriptor of noteworthy effects Does anyone have some suggestions? p.s. 'noteworthy' does not seem to work to my ears.
