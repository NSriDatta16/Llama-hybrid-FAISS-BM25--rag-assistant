Pragmatic General Multicast on Winsock

Has anyone any experience of using PGM at the winsock (not MSMQ) level on Windows? It looks like a useful reliable multicast protocol (a la TIBCO Rendezvous) and I assume that it would be possible to make something like this really fly if run over native completion-port based I/O. I've dabbled with it, at a C++ level, by writing some boost::asio support and also got it going in C# via SocketAsyncEventArgs, but alas my meagre home-office set-up lacks a true LAN to test it out properly, and I wondered if anyone has spent anytime on it and has any observations?
