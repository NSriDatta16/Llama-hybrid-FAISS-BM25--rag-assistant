You don't mention continuous integration, but one good thing to start with is to give developers a rapid feedback if the build is broken. Once you have it you can add code quality metrics to encourage them to correct warnings or bad use of generics. Only with all that in place you should start working on their productivity by showing them how to hot deploy, debug, use an IDE and so on... And good luck :)
