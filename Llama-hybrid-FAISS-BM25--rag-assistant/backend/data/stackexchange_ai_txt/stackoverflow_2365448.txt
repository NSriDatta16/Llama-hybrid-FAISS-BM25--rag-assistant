Draggable and hide

For a project I need a box, which often can find in Desktop application Editors. The box has three areas. One Content area, a tilebar and a sidebar. If a person drag the tilebar, the sidebar grow up. The sidebar need a minimal widht. By a cklick on the tilebar the sidebar dissapear. The contentarea use allways 100% of the available width... I saw that in an other direction in the chatbar here http://drop.io/hgjw8fb I draw that here: What i Want http://img411.imageshack.us/img411/6174/sodragandhidearea.gif Can anyone tell me how to make this with minimal markup or where I can find a plugin in Jquery for this? I use jquery and jqueryUI
