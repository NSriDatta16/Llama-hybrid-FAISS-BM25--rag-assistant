why not create another column in your mysql table to store integer value of the position where is. You'll calculate this value in your script and store this value at same time when you insert the html generated by tinymce. Then in later retrievals use the value in that column to select the substring from 1 up to the value. This should make your query simpler and maybe improve query performance?
