How to inverse-difference time series data?

I'm preparing a time series model with LSTM, I noticed that the time series data is not stationary so I used diff(period=1) in pandas . I fitted the LSTM model and it looks good. I invert the difference operation using original data. When we are forecasting in real time, how to invert the predictions because the original data is not available? How I inverse-transformed is pred = model.predict(x_test_diff) y_test_inv_diff = y_test.shift(1) + y_test_diff pred = y_test.shift(1) + pred I have the original dataset y_test , so I was able to inverse-difference predictions. What to do when I'm making forecasts in real time?
