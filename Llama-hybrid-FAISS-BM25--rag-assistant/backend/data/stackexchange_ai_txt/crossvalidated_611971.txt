First you should consider whether you would like to do this at all . A good start would be to read this even more recent (2022) paper by Costello and Watts to learn about the various theoretical pitfalls associated with hypothesis testing in a Bayesian framework. One of the most serious problems they see with the usual t-test null hypothesis of $\mathcal{H}_0: \Delta\mu = 0$ is that this is a "point-form null hypothesis". As $\Delta\mu$ is a real number, and its distribution is continuous, the probability $\mathrm{Pr}(\Delta\mu = 0)$ will unfortunately be exactly 0. Now, "if the null hypothesis is always false, whatâ€™s the big deal about rejecting it?" -- they ask in the paper, quoting Cohen (2016). After showing that the currently used "Bayesian t-test" is equivalent to its "classical"/frequentist counterpart (thus offering no obvious advantages), Costello and Watts also propose a different testing procedure which is supposed to be more informative. See the paper for details. Disclaimer : I haven't done such an analysis yet (just reading myself into the subject). I would be rather curious to know if there's someone who has some practical experience with what Costello and Watts propose.
