Either: make having the actual time an essential feature of your app. This way the users will have a need to keep the time of the device current and can't go back three weeks Or: mark the code as expired and save this information before the app informs the user. This will stop most user from setting the time back. Most will try once or twice, see that the app stays disabled and will give up. You can also save the timestamp of the last successful execution and if that is more than a reasonable time frame in the future (remember summer/winter time) then consider it a "hack attempt". Put a CRC check (or whatever obscure idea you come up with) on that timestamp and save it too and you will stop a large number of script kiddies. You can never stop the diehard hacker who search actively for every trick you might have put into the app. Just focus on the "average" user.
