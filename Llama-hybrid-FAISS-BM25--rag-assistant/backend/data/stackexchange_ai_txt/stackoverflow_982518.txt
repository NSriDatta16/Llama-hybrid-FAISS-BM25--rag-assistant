Call a protected method from outside a class in PHP

I have a very special case in which I need to call a protected method from outside a class. I am very conscious about what I do programmingwise, but I would not be entirely opposed to doing so in this one special case I have. In all other cases, I need to continue disallowing access to the internal method, and so I would like to keep the method protected. What are some elegant ways to access a protected method outside of a class? So far, I've found this . I suppose it may be possible create some kind of double-agent instance of the target class that would sneakily provide access to the internals...
