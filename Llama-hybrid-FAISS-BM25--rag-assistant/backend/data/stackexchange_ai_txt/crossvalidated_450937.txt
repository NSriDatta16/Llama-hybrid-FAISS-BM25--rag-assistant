How to evaluate the ratio of (large) gamma functions in the normal inverse gamma marginal likelihood?

I am doing some Bayesian modeling where I am using Normal-Inverse-Gamma as prior for the unknown mean and variance, and Normal for likelihood. In my application, I need the marginal likelihood, where mean and variance are integrated out, for some downstream analysis. From Murphy page 17 ( https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/Papers/bayesGauss.pdf ), the marginal likelihood contains the term: $$\Gamma(a_o+n/2)/\Gamma(a_o)$$ where $a_o$ is the first parameter of the Inverse-Gamma prior, and $n$ is the number of samples. My question is, how is this ratio evaluated in practice when you have hundreds of data points without numerical overflow? As far as I can see, even a moderate $n$ will shoot the gamma function to infinity. I tried to search online and found an approximation: $$\Gamma(a+n)/\Gamma(a)=a^n$$ But still, in my case, any hyperparameter $a_o$ larger than 1 and a moderate sized sample will make this to infinity. This should be a fairly simple problem for know-how computational statistician, but I am very new to this, so any advice is much appreciated!
