Non-censored percentage values as Dependent Variables, which regression model?

Im working with percentage values for the first time and I looked at which models apply here. In the justification for e.g. logistic regression for percentage data I see the fact mentioned that percent values are censored/ only exist between 0 and 1. Looking at my dataset I have Return on Assets (ROA) as the dependent variable which means that its possible that my values can go below 0 and above 1. Negative ROA in a company is certainly possible. My question therefore is how this influences my choice of model? Can I use simple regression since my data is now basically normal interval values? Or might there be a more fitting regression type? Cheers
