EDIT - Its a server thing, I am not exactly a Tomcat expert,but here goes. When the server loads, read the db config file, it it doesnt exist, catch the exception and redirect the user to the install page (pre created of course, depending on your front end), get the data, create the config file and save. Next time, the config file will be there, and the user wont see the install page. (My only concern would be some Tomcat constraints that may act up in trying this solution) You should mark this as a server question to gain attention of tomcat specialists.
