How do I show plots when using Graphlab?

Sorry, if this topic is not connected directly to Data Science. I want to understand how the Graphlab tool works. Firstly I want to execute the toy examples from the Gallery site. When I try to execute the example code, everything is OK except one command: I can not see the graphlab plot after show() . The command show() returns to me some kind of object in IPython and nothing in the IPython Notebook. If the example code has the plot, which depends directly on the matplotlib module, I can produce the real plots and save it on my machine. Consequently, I suppose the main error depends on the graphlab (or object from its class). If somebody already used this tool and rendered the plot, can he/she tell me, how I can execute the plots command? In [8]: import graphlab In [9]: from IPython.display import display from IPython.display import Image graphlab.canvas.set_target('ipynb') In [10]:import urllib url = 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/GraphLab-Datasets/americanMovies /freebase_performances.csv' urllib.urlretrieve(url, filename='freebase_performances.csv') # downloads an 8MB file to the working directory Out[10]: ('freebase_performances.csv', ) In [11]: data = graphlab.SFrame.read_csv('remote://freebase_performances.csv', column_type_hints={'year': int}) ... ... ...
