To me, I still have that impression of Dreamweaver being drag and drop for web "designers" and creating horrible html output that does that validate sometimes. If this still happens with DW CS4, then I would definitely go with Zend Studio. Zend Studio actually supports with all the Eclipse Plugins that I would like to add for unit testing and continuous integration.
