Managed to find a way around this, pretty much by accident. The content that's loaded into my RichTextBox is just stored (or inputted) as a plain string. I have subclassed the RichTextBox to allow binding against it's Document property. What's relevant to the question, is that I have an IValueConverter Convert() overload that looks something like this (code non-essential to the solution has been stripped out): FlowDocument doc = new FlowDocument(); Paragraph graph = new Paragraph(); Hyperlink textLink = new Hyperlink(new Run(textSplit)); textLink.NavigateUri = new Uri(textSplit); textLink.RequestNavigate += new System.Windows.Navigation.RequestNavigateEventHandler(navHandler); graph.Inlines.Add(textLink); graph.Inlines.Add(new Run(nonLinkStrings)); doc.Blocks.Add(graph); return doc; This gets me the behavior I want (shoving plain strings into RichTextBox and getting formatting) and it also results in links that behave like a normal link, rather than one that's embedded in a Word document.
