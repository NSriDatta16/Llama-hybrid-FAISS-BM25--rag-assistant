What is the difference between MCMC and Gauss-Legendre quadrature for integration? Can one substitute the other?

Both MCMC and Legendre quadrature are numerical methods for integration. Method 1: MCMC $$E[g(X)] = \int f(x) g(x) \, dx$$ Method 2: Gauss-Legendre quadrature $$\int_{0.5}^{1.5} e^x \cos x \, dx$$ $$= \sum_{i=1}^{k} c_i\cdot f(x_i)$$ where $f(x)=e^x \cos x, \text{ with weights } c_i, \text{ and nods } x_i$. Example: Gauss-Legendre (requested in comments) Suppose I want to integrate at 3 points on, $f(x) = e^x \cos x$ 3 Nods are: $x_i =[0.7746, 0, -0.7746]$ 3 Weights are: $w_i = [0.5556, 0.8888888888888888, 0.5556]$ Thus, $$\int_{0.5}^{1.5} e^x \cos x \, dx = \sum_{i=1}^{3} c_i\cdot f(x_i)=1.275$$ You can also refer here: https://math.okstate.edu/people/yqwang/teaching/math4513_fall14/Notes/gaussian.pdf So, which method to use to integrate out $\theta$? $$f(x) = \int f(x,\theta) p(\theta) \, d\theta$$ My goal is to calculate the marginal distribution. I am using Gauss-Legendre, but can I also use MCMC? What's the difference? I am a bit confused.
