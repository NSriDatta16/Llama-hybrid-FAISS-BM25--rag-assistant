Adding values to a magento dropdown or multi-select product attribute while adding a new product

I'm wondering if anyone has found or written an extension that would allow a magento website administrator the ability to add values to their products attribute while adding the product. For example, if I sell books and want the book author to be in a drop down list so that it would be used in layered navigation, it seems odd that I would have to add the author via the attributes section before adding the product. From a workflow standpoint it really makes sense to have an "add new value" button next to the drop down on my add product screen. Anyone have any thoughts or insight?
