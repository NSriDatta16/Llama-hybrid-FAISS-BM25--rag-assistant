The package 'tsoutliers' implements the procedure described in by Chen and Liu (1993) [1]. A description of the package and the procedure is also given in this document . Briefly, the procedure consists of two main stages: Detection of outliers upon a chosen ARIMA model. Choose and/or refit the ARIMA model including the outliers detected in the previous step and remove those outliers that are not significant in the new fit. The series is then adjusted for the detected outliers and the stages (1) and (2) are repeated until no more outliers are detected or until a maximum number of iterations is reached. The first stage (detection of outliers) is also an iterative process. At the end of each iteration the residuals from the ARIMA model are adjusted for the outliers detected within this stage. The process is repeated until no more outliers are found or until a maximum number of iterations is reached (by default 4 iterations). The first three warnings that you get are related to this inner loop, i.e., the stage is exited after four iterations. You can increase this maximum number of iterations through the argument maxit.iloop in function tso . It is advisable not to set a high number of iterations in the first stage and let the process move on to the second stage where the ARIMA model is refitted or chosen again. The warnings 4 and 5 are related to the process of fitting the ARIMA model and chosen the model, respectively for functions stats::arima and forecast:auto.arima . The algorithm that maximizes the likelihood function does not always converge to a solution. You can find some details related to these issues, for example, in this post and this post [1] Chung Chen and Lon-Mu Liu (1993) "Joint Estimation of Model Parameters and Outlier Effects in Time Series", Journal of the American Statistical Association , 88 (421), pp. 284-297.
