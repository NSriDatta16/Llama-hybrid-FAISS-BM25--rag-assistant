There are no two definitions or usage of the term. The only valid way of understanding "i.i.d. data" is the second "frequentist", as you call it, way. The only thing that could have distributions that could be independent are random variables. The only things that could have conditional distribution, or joint distribution, that makes a likelihood function in a Bayesian setting, are random variables. It is not data that is independent and identically distributed, but the random variables that we consider the data to be the realizations of which. On the referred page 26, the the author uses the following example to illustrate it: Because our data set $\mathbf{x}$ is i.i.d., we can therefore write the probability of the data set, given $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ in the form $$ p(\mathbf{x}|\mu,\sigma^2)=\prod_{i=1}^n \mathcal{N}(x_i|\mu,\sigma^2) $$ So each $x_i$ follows a normal distribution and their joint distribution is a product because $x_i$ s are independent . They need to be random variables for that. Also, notice that the Bayes theorem tells us that we can obtain $$ p(\mu,\sigma^2|\mathbf{x}) \propto p(\mathbf{x}|\mu,\sigma^2)\, p(\mu)\, p(\sigma^2) $$ You can condition only on random variables, so if $\mathbf{x}$ would not be a random variable, the conditional probability would not be possible.
