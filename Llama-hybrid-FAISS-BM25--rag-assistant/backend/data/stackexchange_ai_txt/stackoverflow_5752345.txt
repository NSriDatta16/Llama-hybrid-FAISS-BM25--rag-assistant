Does facebook support oEmbed?

Anyone know whether Facebook supports oEmbed for embedding videos (or other media) when a link is shared. I googled but cant get a definitive answer for this. My question Facebook developer forum has no answer. http://forum.developers.facebook.net/viewtopic.php?pid=334549
