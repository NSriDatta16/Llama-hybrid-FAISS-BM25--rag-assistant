time series terminology question

Suppose I have a time series $x_1, x_2, ..., x_{10}$ . I apply the augmented Dickey Fuller test to my data an conclude the data are non-stationary with (say) lag = 2. With lag = 2, the tested data are $x_3, ..., x_{10}$ . My question is: Did I conclude that $x_1, ..., x_{10}$ are non-stationary, or did I conclude $x_3, ..., x_{10}$ are non-stationary?
