We use code coverage to assure that we have no major holes in our tests, and it's run nightly in our CI. Since we also have a full set of selenium-web tests that run all the way through the stack we also do an additional coverage trick: We set up the web-application with coverage running. Then we run the full automated test battery of selenium tests. Some of these are smoke tests only. When the full suite of tests has been run, we can identify suspected dead code simply by looking at the coverage and inspecting code. This is really nice when working on large projects, because you can have big branches of dead code after some time. We don't really have any fixed metrics on how often we do this, but it's all set up to run with a keypress or two.
