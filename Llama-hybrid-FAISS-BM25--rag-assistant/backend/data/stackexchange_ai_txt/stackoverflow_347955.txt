IMO I would suggest getting hold of the frame buffer somehow and drawing to it directly if possible or using D3DM or use the drawing services provided by the Native Platform (GDI) through APIs like DrawGradient() etc from coredll.dll and since you are on WM you might be able to leverage aygshell.dll to draw widgets. Here are some links... 1) Using gradient fill from dot net 2) Using gradient fill directly 3) Other native GDI functions
