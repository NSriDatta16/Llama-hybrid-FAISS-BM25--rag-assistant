Since $A_i$ are disjoint and their union is the entire space $\mathcal{X}$ , clearly you cannot construct a set $B$ such that $B$ is a strict subset of any $A_i$ using complimentation or union. Since no such set can be constructed, it immediately follows that the $\sigma$ -algebra generated by them, defined as containing any set that can be expressed as a countable union or compliment of these $A_i$ , cannot contain a strict subset of any $A_i$ . For if it could, that would contradict the observation in the prior paragraph. Hence all $A_i$ are atoms of the given sigma algebra. To see why no strict subset can be constructed, draw a diagram of a space and partition it into disjoint parts. It should be clear you cannot construct a strict subset of any the parts using the others (though you can construct any $A_i$ itself by complimenting the union of all other $A_j, j \neq i$ . If such a strict subset could be constructed, it would imply that some $x \in A_i$ also belongs to another $A_j$ , contradicting the disjoint property of $A_i$ 's.
