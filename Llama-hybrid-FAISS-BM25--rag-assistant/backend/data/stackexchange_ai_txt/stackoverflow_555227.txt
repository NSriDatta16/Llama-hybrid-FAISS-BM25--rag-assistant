This isn't really a permissions issue. SharePoint doesn't really provide a mechanism for moving content between libraries / sites. If you're running Windows I'd suggest using 'view in explorer' under the tools menu for both libraries and drag the files between the two windows. This should be available to contributors on the site*. unless someone has mucked with the definition of 'contributor'..
