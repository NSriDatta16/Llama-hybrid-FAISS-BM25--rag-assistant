We track all users activities on all of our systems. Being a health care organization we are required to protect patient information and track all accesses to any information that could be considered patient data. There's also a marketing aspect. We want to know what our employees are responding to on our intranets and what they are not. And lastly, there's a legal aspect in terms of providing a safe workplace. Anonymous forums can open the door to harassment and such. Sucks, but yes it happens.
