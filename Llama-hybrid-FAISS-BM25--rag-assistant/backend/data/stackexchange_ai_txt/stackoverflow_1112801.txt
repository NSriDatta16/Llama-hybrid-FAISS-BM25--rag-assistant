Mod_rewrite - how to 301 redirect an old URL to a new one

I need to grab some of my website's old URLs and do a 301 redirect to the new ones, since they are already indexed and we don't want to loose relevance after the change. The old URL is in fact very ugly and for some reason everything I try to do to rewrite it does not work. Here it is: http://www.mywebsite.com/ExibeCurso.asp?Comando=TreinamentoGeral&codCurso=136&Titulo=Como%20Estruturar%20um%20Sistema%20Gerencial%20de%20Controles%20Organizacionais,13 Basically, I need to translate it into something like: http://www.mywebsite.com/curso/136 From the old URL I need to check if the user typed "ExibeCurso.asp"; then I know I must send him here: /curso. I must also grab the integer that was in the querystring parameter "codCurso" (136). What is the regular expression I must use for this. I am using ISAPI_Rewrite 3, which basically implements htaccess on IIS, so there should be no difference in terms of syntax. Thanks.
