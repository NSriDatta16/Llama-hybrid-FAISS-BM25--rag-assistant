Why might UCINET and R return different results for a QAP Logistic Regression (on the same data)?

I'm trying to run a QAP logistic regression to predict the odds of a tie in a social network (represented as a binary adjacency matrix) given two independent variables (also binary matrices) but am getting opposite results depending on whether I run the analysis in R or UCINET. All three matrices are rectangular (30 x 75). The 30 rows are people I've interviewed and the 75 columns are the entire population (including the 30 interviewees). All matrices include the person IDs as row and column names. Running the analysis in R (see code at the bottom of the question), I get the following output: Estimate Exp(b) Pr( =b) Pr(>=|b|) (intercept) -5.298525 0.004998961 0.0001 0.9999 0.0001 indep1 1.797138 6.032358591 0.9693 0.0307 0.2393 indep2 3.194162 24.389724184 1.0000 0.0000 0.0030 But after exporting the variables to .csv files and re-running it in UCINET, I get: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Coef OddsRat Sig SD Avg Min Max P(ge) P(le) ------- ------- ------- ------- ------- ------- ------- ------- ------- 1 Intercept -3.931 0.020 0.000 0.540 -2.785 -3.931 -1.783 1 0.000 2 indep1 2.391 10.925 0.003 1.508 -0.239 -5.089 15.437 0.003 0.998 3 indep2 1.458 4.296 0.000 0.504 -0.026 -15.991 1.458 0.000 1 Any ideas why this might be happening? In case it's important, the (QAP) correlation coefficient between the two independent variables is 0.382 I've only included the 30 interviewees in the matrix rows because they are the only people from whom there might be a tie. The networks and QAP regressions are directed. Incidentally, if I run the QAP logit using full 75x75 adjacency matrices (all people in the columns also appear as rows), I get the same output in both programs. I also have a related question... A colleague suggested I could run the analysis using the 75x75 matrices but replace the rows of people I haven't interviewed with NAs. This gives me the same results in R and UCINET. Does this seem like a sensible approach, rather than using rectangular matrices? Thanks! Reproducible example in R: library(sna) # row and column labels rowIDs
