How to strip the basedir from an absolute path to get a relative path?

In the build.xml of my project I have a property defined: The value of ${somedir.dir} will be an absolute path: /home/myuser/my_project/some_dir . What I need is just the relative path ./my_project/some_dir without the ${basedir} value /home/myuser . How can I achieve this using Ant? So far I found a solution by converting the property to a path and then use "pathconvert", but I don't think this is a nice solution: Any other (more elegant) suggestions?
