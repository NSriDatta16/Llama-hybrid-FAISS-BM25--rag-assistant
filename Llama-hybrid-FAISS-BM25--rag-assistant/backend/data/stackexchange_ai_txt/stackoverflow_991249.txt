With all of one hundred entries involved here, use an array containing the grade letter code and [array objectAtIndex: i] offset into the array based on the integer grade value. Done. With Cocoa, you can either build this array directly in the code, or load the array from backing store (arrayWithContentsOfFile:) and allow Cocoa to sort out the storage. You can one-plus this particular design by permitting the user to adjust the grade ranges by rewriting the saved grade array, and the code itself doesn't change.
