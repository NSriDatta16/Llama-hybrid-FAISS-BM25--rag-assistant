You are describing a classification problem, where each 'class' is a person. You are trying to learn the hand->person mapping. Having two inputs map to the same output if they are similar enough is exactly what it means to 'classify' an input. The way you're framing your question matches it perfectly with a basic task of machine learning, multi-class classification. I have no idea if hand recognition software actually works this way - it would need to learn your hand from a single example or a very few, so I expect there is some 1-shot learning sorcery in the mix when used 'in the wild'. Edit: The adversarial part is particularly interesting. There are techniques for training neural networks to be robust to attacks, for example you might read about Generative Adversarial Networks , where a second network feeds inputs into the first to try to trick it.
