1) Does PHP already have functions that use the FOUND_ROWS() feature? I'm using php 5 with mysqli and mysql 5 with innodb storage engine. I thought mysql_num_rows does it, but after a little browsing I think I might be wrong. UPDATE: Yes, I'm wrong :) 2) The application I'm building already has it's own data access object that wraps the mysqli library. It is responsible for generating commonly used CRUD queries. Should I edit this object to include the SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS on all SELECT queries? What complications might exist? SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS will try to calculate number of rows that would be returned be there no LIMIT clause in your query. This will utilize metadata in one and only one case: When your table uses MyISAM engine, AND When your query has no WHERE clause. In other cases SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS will count the rows one by one, impacting performance. Don't append it to each and every query.
