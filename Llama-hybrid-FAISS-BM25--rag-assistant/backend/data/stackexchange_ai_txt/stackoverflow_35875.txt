For a typical desktop app, I'd store everything on the current session, and maybe store info messages for the past n sessions or up to x in size. I'm assuming that your messages are organized. We use 4 categories; errors, warnings, info, and trace. We're still figuring out what goes at which level. As I'm getting used to parsing log files, I generally say "log more". Don't sweat readability, you're probably gonna have to process the log file a bit before you can use it. In the end, find a good logging framework that allows you to control your spool usage on lifetime and storage space, and a proper api that minimizes the effect on your code. Ideally you just type info("waaah") or warning("waah") and the API does all the fancy tagging for you.
