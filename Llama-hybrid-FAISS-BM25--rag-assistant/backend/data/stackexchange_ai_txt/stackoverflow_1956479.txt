The way to get line breaks in display math, while using only standard LaTeX, is to use \begin{array}...\end{array} within the display math environment $$...$$ . (Yes, I know that $$ is deprecated but I still like it.) There are many alternatives in different extensions, including AMSLaTeX's align and align* environments. My personal favorite is Didier RÃ©my's mathpartir package, which gives a display-math environment that is more like paragraph mode, plus a set of tools for typesetting logical inference rules and proof trees.
