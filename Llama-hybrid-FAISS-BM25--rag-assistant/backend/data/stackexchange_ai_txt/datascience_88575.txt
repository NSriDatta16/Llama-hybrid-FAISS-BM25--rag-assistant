Without having complete knowledge of the features on that website, I would say: Data visualisation is only one part of data the scientist (ds) pipeline from data understanding thought model validation and model production as per CRISP-DM . That site seems to be focused only on that visualisation part. Introductory courses on data science, most of the time, work with "ready to use" data frames (Iris, Titanic) that do not reflect the natural way in which data must be preprocessed and aggregated to the correct level (ex., you may have accounts level data that needs to be aggregated to user's level to predict user's default) also, in many cases you have multiple sources of data stored in a variety of places like relation tables or non-structured information that will need to be queried and joined beforehand. The latter role is commonly attributed as a "data engineer"; however, the line between the two parts is less discernible in small to medium projects. However, it is essential to note that this line should be fuzzy, as more often than not, choices made by data scientists require work from a data engineering perspective - as other answers below have touched more upon. And this gives a wrong impression of the simplicity of the task. Besides, the above step would need for you to have at least a basic understanding of the data you are working on to create "meaningful" features that otherwise will end just by aggregating by min, max and average (sometimes helpful but not sufficient) Finally, a trained model in a notebook would hardly be helpful if you cannot use that model in an ultimately deployed way (having an AWS lambda, for example)
