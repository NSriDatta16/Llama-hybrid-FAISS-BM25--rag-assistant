You say "The full time series model, therefore, underestimates the external event, but puts more weights on our intervention effect." . I say you must have the wrong model. Please post your data and your assumption about the time and type of intervention and I will try and provide you with a more appropriate model. The approach would be to implement the work of http://www.unc.edu/~jbhill/tsay.pdf and to incorporate robustly identified ARIMA structure.
