The portal_historiesstorage tool can eat a lot of disk space. Any content type set to save revisions saves them here, and by default Plone keeps all revisions (see the portal_purgepolicy tool). I want all revisions on the production Data.fs, but after taking a copy for development the first thing I do is purge portal_historiesstorage. The procedure is: Go to your Plone site in the ZMI Delete the portal_historiesstorage tool Go to portal_setup, Import tab Under 'Select Profile or Snapshot' choose 'CMFEditions' Select the step with handler Products.GenericSetup.tool.importToolset Uncheck 'Include dependencies?' Hit 'Import selected steps' to re-add portal_historiesstorage Pack the Data.fs and delete the resulting Data.fs.old from the filesystem On my 3G Data.fs, this little sequence removes 2.5G! I have only ever done this on a development Data.fs. Without advice from someone who really knows, I don't recommend doing this on your production site.
