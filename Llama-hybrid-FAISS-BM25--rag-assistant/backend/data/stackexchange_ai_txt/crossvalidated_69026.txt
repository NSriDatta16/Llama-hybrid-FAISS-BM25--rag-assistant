How would the drug discourage people from drinking? Wouldn't drinking less be an effective way to avoid hangover and, as such, a useful effect of the drug? Could the participants know/guess to which group they were assigned? In any case, I don't see any major difference with a regular clinical study. Importantly, “Did you get drunk?” seems just as subjective as “Do you feel X?” Also, I don't know how the questions were presented but I don't see any a priori reason why you would necessarily have missing data on the second question. Even people who did not drink any alcohol, let alone “get drunk”, can meaningfully report that they are not feeling hungover. You could therefore look at it as a study with two equally subjective outcomes (“remembering getting drunk” and “feeling something like the effect of drunkenness”). If you want to compare the subjective experience of people who were exposed to the same amount of alcohol, you would have to ask about what they actually drunk or, better yet, observe/measure/manipulate that yourself as recollections seem especially problematic in this context. Incidentally, asking about specific symptoms (headache, etc.) would seem preferable as partying/lack of sleep could also have unpleasant effects and the question as currently formulated invites speculation on the part of the participants regarding the origin of these effects. This would also make it easier to ask the same questions to participants would did and did not drink alcohol and use the latter as a meaningful comparison group to discount pseudo-hangover effects. In any case, you can certainly compare placebo and treatment groups on these two variables. If treatment assignment was not blind, you have some extra interpretation problems but no additional statistical difficulty.
