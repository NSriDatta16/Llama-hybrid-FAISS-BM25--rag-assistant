When/where to use functional data analysis?

I am very new to functional data analysis (FDA). I am reading: Ramsay, James O., and Silverman, Bernard W. (2006), Functional Data Analysis, 2nd ed., Springer, New York. However, I am still not very clear where/when to use FDA? Could someone please give me an example especially in medical studies? I really don't know where/when to apply FDA in practice. For growth curve data, we can use nonlinear mixed models, for longitudinal data, we can use repeated measure ANOVA, and for multivariate data/high dimensional data, we can use PCA, FA, etc. So when/where will be the best timing/situation to use FDA?
