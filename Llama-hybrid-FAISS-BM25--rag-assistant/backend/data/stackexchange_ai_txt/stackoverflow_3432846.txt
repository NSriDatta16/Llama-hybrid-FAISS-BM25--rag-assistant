I'm not sure about 'elegant', but I think the following is much simpler and more intuitive (at the cost of an extra variable): a = range(20) runningTotal = [] total = 0 for n in a: total += n runningTotal.append(total) The functional way to do the same thing is: a = range(20) runningTotal = reduce(lambda x, y: x+[x[-1]+y], a, [0])[1:] ...but that's much less readable/maintainable, etc. @Omnifarous suggests this should be improved to: a = range(20) runningTotal = reduce(lambda l, v: (l.append(l[-1] + v) or l), a, [0]) ...but I still find that less immediately comprehensible than my initial suggestion. Remember the words of Kernighan: "Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it."
