If you are a programmer, you could start with a Decision Tree classifier, focus on understanding the math behind Entropy and Information-Gain. It is essential to understand that ML is just all about data compression. I'd highly disagree with some of the other answers on the value of practical courses. Most valuable for ML is math: number theory, linear algebra and probability theory. If you don't focus on math, the only thing that you will learn is, how to use some library for doing magic, that's not machine learning and not science at all.
