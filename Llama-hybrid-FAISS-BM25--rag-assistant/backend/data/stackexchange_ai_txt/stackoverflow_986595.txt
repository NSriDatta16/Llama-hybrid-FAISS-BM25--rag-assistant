Dynamicly generate a JNLP file for a Java Web Start application?

I'm writing a servlet to return a JNLP file with several dynamically generated parameters to be passed to a web start program. Right now my code uses a stock template and token replacement, but I have to think there is a way to generate this file programmaticly within a servlet. Are there any tools available for this?
