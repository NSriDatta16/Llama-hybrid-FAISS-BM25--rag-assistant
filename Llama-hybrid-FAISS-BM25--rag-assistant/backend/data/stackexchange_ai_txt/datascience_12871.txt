Multi-label Text Classification

I am trying to build a multi-label classifier for suggesting tags on blog posts. The textual data is full of noise. The approach I have been following until now was a BOW approach with Tf-idf weighting. However I could only get an accuracy of around 0.35 on the test set using OnevsRest approach and a SVC. I then decided to eliminate the noise and I applied TextRank on my data to obtain a more meaningful summary and then applied the same BOW approach which however resulted in further loss of accuracy. I am quite new to machine learning and data science in general. Can someone please guide me with the approach? I am looking specifically on how to create my features and what else can I try. I have 12 labels and around 1500 blog posts. I know it isn't much data, but the data-set is still well-balanced and won't be the primary reason for such low accuracy.
