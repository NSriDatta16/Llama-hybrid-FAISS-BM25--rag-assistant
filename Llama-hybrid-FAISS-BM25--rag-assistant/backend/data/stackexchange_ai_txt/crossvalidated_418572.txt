Yes, a multiple regression probably would be appropriate here. You would need to specify the interactions in the model for this to work, so it's good that you have specific hypotheses/expectations about which variables interact. I said probably in the previous point because it depends on the structure of the dependencies you are interested in. It is possible that a structural equation model (SEM) would be more appropriate. Another possibility is to use a machine learning approach in which you do not specify your interactions a priori . For example, random forests capture interactions quite well without them being specified. However, extracting understanding from the fitted random forest is more complicated that simply using coefficient values. I would not 'chunk' the data and investigate correlations (or even partial correlations). It's more efficient to use all the data at one time in a single model. Whichever approach you use, keep in mind that what you will be modelling will be biased by students' perceptions. Especially after having taken a test, how much they believe they have studied may be coloured by how well they think they did on the test.
