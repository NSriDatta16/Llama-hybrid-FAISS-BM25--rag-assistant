An alternate method of finding variable importance is using random forests. A package called varSelRF was built specifically for this purpose. This method isn't designed to be right all the time, but is a rather quick way of dealing with large dimensions to get a semblance of which variables could at the first level affect the response variable. Combine this with an MANOVA and you stand a decent chance of finding your key variables.
