From your comments it seems that your problem is something completely different than in your original question. To start your Webstart-application, save the XML file you have there under the name trader.jnlp in your directory c:/Users/OPTRADER/ , and then double-click on it. If webstart is configured right and the jar file is also in the right place, it now should start your program. If you get some error message saying that Windows does not now what to do with your file, then you should reinstall Java webstart (or your JRE/JDK). If you get some error message from Webstart, add this message to your question (there is an edit link below it). If your program runs and you have some other problem, describe the problem (also in your question).
