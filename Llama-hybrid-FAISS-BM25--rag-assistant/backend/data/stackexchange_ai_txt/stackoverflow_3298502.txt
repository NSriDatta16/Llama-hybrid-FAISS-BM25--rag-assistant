just something I noticed, you shouldn't wrap objects from the Current Context in a using statement. Good article here Clicky Better practice would be to use the following using (SPSite mySite = new SPSite(SPContext.Current.Site.Url)) { ... } Also you should look at packaging up your solution in a WSP, allowing stsadm to deploy it. Dragging into the GAC isn't very good practice. Shane
