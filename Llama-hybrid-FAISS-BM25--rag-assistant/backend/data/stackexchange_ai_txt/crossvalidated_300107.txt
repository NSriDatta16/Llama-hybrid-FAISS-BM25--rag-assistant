Diagonal lines occur in ROC curves when you have ties, that is when you have one or more observation with the exact same test value in both the positive and negative groups. SVM classifiers output continuous probabilities. The chance to get a tie is normally very low. This is why you get a "steppy" curve. On the other hand, due to the limited number of observations that make a k-NN decision, the output probabilities are typically not continuous. For instance if you considered a k-NN classifier with k = 3, probabilities can only be 1.0, 0.67, 0.33, 0. It is very likely that you observe these values in both groups, hence the tie and the diagonal line.
