How to correctly understand PROCESS model 4 for output “ Test of X by M interaction?

Perhaps some one can help me interpret some of the outputs of Hayes model 4. I designed a questionnaire that had good Cronbach and KMO scores etc. I did the PCA and have four components (factors). I have now done some mediation analysis with PROCESS model 4 and need some clarification regarding the following: If the “Test of X by M interaction” is sig. p If this test is not significant, what does that imply for the relationships between the variables? Is it important if the “direct effect of X on Y” is not significant? And why would it meant if the “test of X by M..” is significant but the Direct X on Y is not?
