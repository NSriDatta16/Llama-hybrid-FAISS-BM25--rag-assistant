Subclassing UIScrollView/UIScrollViewDelegate

I'm trying to create my own custom UIScrollView, so that I can pass touch events from it to a delegate object which has logic to draw to an imageview inside the scrollview. If I remove the delegate variable and property from the class interface it works fine as a normal scroll view. When I make it my custom protocol delegate it builds but doesn't pass on messages.. Any help appreciated @class DrawableScrollView; @protocol DrawableScrollViewDelegate - (void)touchesBegan:(DrawableScrollView *)drawableScrollView touches:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event; - (void)touchesMoved:(DrawableScrollView *)drawableScrollView touches:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event; - (void)touchesEnded:(DrawableScrollView *)drawableScrollView touches:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event; @end @interface DrawableScrollView : UIScrollView { id delegate; } @property (nonatomic, assign) IBOutlet id delegate; @end
