For this kind of situation, I think what you really need to do is to set a Bayesian model that captures the possible outcomes and the measurement error. This could be framed as a two parameter model where the centre of the interval is $0 \leqslant \theta and the variance of the measurement error is $\sigma^2 \geqslant 0$ . To facilitate the analysis, define the interval centered at $0 \leqslant \theta and having length $\pi$ (but expressed in the space $[0, 2 \pi)$ ) as $\mathscr{I}(\theta)$ , which is given by: $$\mathscr{I}(\theta) = \begin{cases} [0, \theta+\tfrac{\pi}{2}] \ \cup \ [\tfrac{3\pi}{2} +\theta, 2 \pi) & & & \text{if } \theta \tfrac{3 \pi}{2}. \\[6pt] \end{cases}$$ Your model could be framed as a latent value model where you observe (conditionally) independent values $Y_1,...,Y_n$ that are based on unobserved values $X_1,...,X_n$ but subject to measurement error. If you have uniform values on the interval but then normally distributed measurement error (for some small $\sigma$ ) then your model might look like this: $$\begin{align} X_i | \theta, \sigma &\sim \text{U}(\mathscr{I}(\theta) ), \\[6pt] Y_i | X_i, \theta, \sigma &\sim \text{N}(X_i, \sigma^2) \ \text{mod} \ 2 \pi. \\[6pt] \end{align}$$ You could then assign a prior for the parameter $(\theta, \sigma)$ and derive the corresponding posterior distribution. With a reasonable amount of data you ought to be able to make a good inference for both parameters, which will allow you to infer the location of the true half-circle support and the variance of the measurement error. This will not be a simple model, owing to the modular properties of circular representation of coordinates, but it ought not be too complicated to implement.
