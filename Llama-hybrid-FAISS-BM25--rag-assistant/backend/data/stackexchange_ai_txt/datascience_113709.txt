Discover context in word alignement

I am using Facebook Muse to translate words from one language to another, and apparently it performs well (I set no metric though). Although I have very basic ML/Datascience/NLP knowledge, could you please guide me to translating not only one word but two and maybe three words. I am not looking for very accurate translations like with tense and prepositions and so on. I am looking for approximate translation even say up to 70% is very fine for my case. In other words, is it possible somehow to translate for instance: bat correctly in baseball bat knowing it is so different from bat in bat wings , in this situation, probably the context could help but I'm not sure how or even if this is possible using these alignment models ?
