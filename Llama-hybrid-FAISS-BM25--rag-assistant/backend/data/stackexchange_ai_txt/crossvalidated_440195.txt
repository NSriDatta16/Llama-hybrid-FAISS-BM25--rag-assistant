Mixed models for longitudinal data

I'm starting to study the Linear Mixed Models (LMM) and the Generalized Mixed Models (GLMM) and I got kinda confused. If I want to apply logistic regression to a longitudinal data, I need to add random effects. But which one should I use? LMM or GLMM? Whats the difference of using logistic regression with LMM and with GLMM?
