How to convert colors into strings with the same size?

I'm converting color values to string values, however when I get 0, the string is too short and I have to manually add "00" after it. Whats the most elegant way to solve this issue in Python ? print "#" + str(self.R) + str(self.G) + str(self.B) if self.R is 0 then I get a too short string.
