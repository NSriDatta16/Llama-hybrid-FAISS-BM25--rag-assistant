These guys were having similiar problems (mostly, it appears, with the journaling file being locked, maybe TortoiseSVN interactions ... check the referenced articles). They came up with a set of recommendations (correct directories, changing journaling types from delete to persist, etc). http://sqlite.phxsoftware.com/forums/p/689/5445.aspx#5445 The journal mode options are discussed here: http://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html . You could try TRUNCATE. Is there a stack trace during the exception into SQL Lite? You indicate you "batch my commits at a reasonable interval". What is the interval?
