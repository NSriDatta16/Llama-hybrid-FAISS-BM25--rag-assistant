Ensure that you do not send UDP datagrams larger than the path MTU (which is typically no more than ~1400 bytes, and sometimes less). Such packets will be fragmented into multiple IP packets and reassembled at the destination - and if any one of those fragments is lost, then the entire UDP datagram will be discarded. This has an amplification effect on the packet loss rate - this table shows how the UDP datagram loss rate goes up dramatically as the number of fragments used to carry it increases: Underlying Fragment Loss Rate: 1.00% Fragments UDP Datagram Loss Rate -------------------------------------- 1 1.00% 2 1.99% 3 2.97% 4 3.94% 5 4.90% 6 5.85% 7 6.79% 8 7.73% 9 8.65% 10 9.56% 15 13.99% 20 18.21% 30 26.03% 40 33.10%
