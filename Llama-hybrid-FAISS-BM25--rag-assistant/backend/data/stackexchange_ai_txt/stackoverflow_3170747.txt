What is Developer in the Settings App?

I updated my iPod touch to iOS4, and connected it to my Mac. I opened Xcode's Organizer, and clicked 'Use for development.' Since then, when I open te Settings App on my iPod, there is an extra section between 'Safari' and 'Nike+' called 'Developer' (it is not Safari's debugging console!). When I select it, the awesome navigation controller pushes me to a view where I can enable 'Logging.'
