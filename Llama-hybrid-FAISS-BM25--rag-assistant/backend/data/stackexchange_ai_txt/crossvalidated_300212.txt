Taylor answer is accurate. I do not see HMM as suited to the data set you propose as is however. It seems to me that the number of samples in the time series is too little... To answer your question about illustrating how HMMs work without equations: A HMM is based on a Markov Chain of states (called the hidden states of the model). An HMM models time series of observations which are ordered sequences of values, that we can see evolving along with a time variable $t$. Each state of the Markov chain is associated with a probability distribution (or a mixture of distributions) that are often called emission distributions . At time $t=0$ a state is randomly chosen from an initial probability mass function . The observation at time $t=0$ is assumed to follow (or to have been generated) by the probability distribution associated to this chosen state. At time $t=1$, the system enters a new hidden state that is chosen from a transition matrix . The observation at time $t=1$ is assumed to follow (or to have been generated) by the probability distribution associated to this new chosen state.
