ASP.Net Submit Button Not Executing Inside jQueryUI Dialog-Content Loaded From Another Page

I am trying to add a few functions to a ASP.NET page using jQuery UI's dialog. I am attempting to display 3 separate dialogs which allow a user to add or edit a contact's address, phone, or email information. I have a UserView page which contains the jQuery, a GridView, and the DIVs I load the controls into. I am using jQuery's .load(url + '#DIV', function... capability to load the 3 boxes from a second page called UserFunctions. The boxes all load and are populated correctly with data, however, the save button does not submit the changes skipping the button's click command. Is there a way to do this? Can I manually call postback from the jQuery dialog? I would like to stay away from IFrames if at all possible. UserView jQuery Code $('#addPhone').load('/Administration/UserFunctions.aspx?Mode=edit&Record=1' + ' #PhoneAdd', function () { $(this).dialog({ modal: true, autoOpen: false, draggable: true, width: 600, open: function (type, data) { $(this).parent().appendTo("form:first"); }, buttons: { "Close": function () { $(this).dialog("close"); } } }); }); UserView and Show Dialog Button Add Phone UserFunction DIV that is loaded Phone Type Number Extension UserFunction Button Click Event (which does not fire) protected void btnPhoneSubmit_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) { if (qString == "insert") { //insert to database. Code removed to save room. } if (qString == "edit") { //update database} } The Code Behind above never runs (tested by attempted to debug the if statement). Thank you in advance for your help. I appreciate it very much.
