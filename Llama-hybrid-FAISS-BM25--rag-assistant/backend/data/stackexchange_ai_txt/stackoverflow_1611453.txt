Design that "slides out" of the left side of the browser as you make the browser bigger?

I'm trying to build a blog. I would like to create a design that essentially slides out more of the picture when you drag the browser handle to the right, and slides in to a certain point when you drag the browser handle to the left. How do you do this in css?? EDIT: I'm thinking you could use a float:right, width:100%, overflow:hidden, combination or something.. Thanks! Matt Mueller
