See: Paging and swapping The issue of swapping and paging is often misunderstood. Swapping and paging are two totally different things. Swapping was the first technology used in Unix System V as physical memory fills up with processes there is a problem. What happens when the system runs completely out of RAM? It "grinds to a halt"! The conservation and correct management of RAM is very important because the CPU can only work with data in RAM, after it has been loaded from the hard disk by the kernel. What happens when the mounting number and size of processes exceeds physical memory? To allow for the situation, and because only one process can ever execute at any one time (on a UniProcessor system), only really that process need to in RAM. However organising that would be extremely resource intensive, as multiple running processes are scheduled to execute on the processor very often (see the section called “Scheduler”) To address these issues the kernel advertises an abstract memory use to applications by advertising a virtual address space to them that far exceeds physical memory. An application may just request more memory and the kernel may grant it. A single process may have allocated 100mb of memory even though there may only be 64mb of RAM in the system. The process will not need to access the whole 100mb at the same time this is where virtual memory comes in. [...]
