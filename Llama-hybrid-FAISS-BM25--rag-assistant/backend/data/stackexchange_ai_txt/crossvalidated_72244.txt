Is this a bug in auto arima or am I doing something wrong?

I must be doing something very wrong here, as auto.arima in R is completely dying, but I can't see what it is. I have the latest version of forecast and R and I think this happens on both Windows and Unix. It works for some/most time series I tried (equities) but fails for others. It seems to fail more often when I diff the high/low with the previous day's close as opposed to just diffing the closes as below. Is this a bug or am I somehow giving arima bad data? (and causing it to die with a horrible error message) I tried searching for this error but didn't come up with much. Thanks a lot. library(tseries) library(forecast) dwa Output: This is forecast 4.8 trying URL 'http://chart.yahoo.com/table.csv?s=DWA&a=0&b=01&c=2010&d=9&e=31&f=2013&g=d&q=q&y=0&z=DWA&x=.csv' Content type 'text/csv' length unknown opened URL .......... .......... .......... .......... .... downloaded 44 Kb time series starts 2010-01-04 time series ends 2013-10-07 ARIMA(2,1,2) with drift : 1e+20 * ARIMA(0,1,0) with drift : 1e+20 * ARIMA(1,1,0) with drift : 1e+20 * ARIMA(0,1,1) with drift : 1e+20 * ARIMA(1,1,2) with drift : 1e+20 * ARIMA(3,1,2) with drift : 1e+20 * ARIMA(2,1,1) with drift : 1e+20 * ARIMA(2,1,3) with drift : 1e+20 * ARIMA(1,1,1) with drift : 1e+20 * ARIMA(3,1,3) with drift : 1e+20 * ARIMA(2,1,2) : 1e+20 *Error in if (diffs == 1 & constant) { : argument is of length zero Calls: auto.arima -> myarima In addition: Warning messages: 1: In if (is.constant(x)) { : the condition has length > 1 and only the first element will be used 2: In if (is.constant(x)) return(d) : the condition has length > 1 and only the first element will be used 3: In if (is.constant(dx)) { : the condition has length > 1 and only the first element will be used Execution halted
