For autoregressive time series modeling, does the AR(p) regressors have to be in order despite insignificance?

I am trying to fit a time series model using data of auto sales (DAUTONSA from FRED) and noticed that there is evidence of serial correlation. Iâ€™ve tried fitting a model with 4 lags but noticed that the second lag was insignificant. When I dropped the second lag but kept the first, third, and fourth lag, the BIC of the model was better. Do I have to keep the second lag or can I drop it and ignore it?
