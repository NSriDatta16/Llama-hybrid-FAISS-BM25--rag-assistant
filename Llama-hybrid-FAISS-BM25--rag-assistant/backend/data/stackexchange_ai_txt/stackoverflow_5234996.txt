Creating a Blog Summary in Python?

Is there any good library (or regex magic) which can convert a blog entry into a blog summary? I'd like the summary to display the first four sentences, first paragraph, or first X number of characters... not really sure what would be the best. Ideally, I would like it to keep html formatting tags such as , , and , but it could remove all other html tags, javascript and css. More specifically, as input I'd give an html string representing an entire blog post. As output, I'd like an html string which contains the first few sentences, paragraph, or X number of characters. With all potentially unsafe html tags removed. In Python please.
