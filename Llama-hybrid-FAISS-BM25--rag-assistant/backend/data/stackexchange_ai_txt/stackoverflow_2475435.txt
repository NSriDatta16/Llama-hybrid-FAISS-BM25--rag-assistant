C# timer won't tick

i have a strange problem... I've been going out of my mind for the past couple of hours... the timer i put in my winform code (from the toolbar) won't tick... I have timers on a couple of forms in my program, they all work fine... I try to do exactly the same it this it won't tick... I select it, drag it on to a form, enable it, set interval and handle the tick event... and nothing happens... i even tried putting random code like messagebox.show in the tick event just to see if anything happens, and nothing!!! as I said, a have a couple of more timer in my program (on other forms, not in the one i'm trying to put this timer) and they all work fine... any suggestions? thanks in advance!
