Detecting forged images with C#?

One of my friends came up with an interesting problem - Assume that we have a set of images in the system. Now, some one might submit a new image by slightly modifying any of the images already submitted, and in that case, the system should report that the submitted image is a forged image. I can think about two solutions. Solution 1 - Do an image comparison (bitmap based) for each input image with the given images in the database, probably after converting them to gray scale to counter color changing tricks, and after resizing them to a standard size. Solution 2 - Create a Self Organized Map and train with all the existing images. And if some one submits an image, if it has a close match, report it as forged. It might not be possible to have a system with more than 90% accuracy. Please share your thoughts/suggestions/solutions. Edit after going through few answers : I already have a backprop neural network and an xml based language to train neural networks here - http://www.codeproject.com/KB/dotnet/neuralnetwork.aspx I'm looking forward for specific answers for the problem I described above. Thanks
