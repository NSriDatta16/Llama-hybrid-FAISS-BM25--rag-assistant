The answer to this question used to be Quartz . It is the defacto standard for scheduling in Java. It is pretty easy to use but it is a bit heavyweight. If you don't care about clustered scheduling or JDBC storage of the jobs, quartz might be overkill. Thankfully Spring 3.0 comes with new scheduling features. These allow the simple 'do this evey 30 seconds' or 'do this everyday at midnight' types of scheduling without using quartz. If you are already using spring it is pretty easy to set up. Example: This will cause the method 'anotherMethod' to be called on you bean named 'anotherObject' at midnight everyday. More information can be found on spring's site: http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/spring-framework-reference/html/scheduling.html
