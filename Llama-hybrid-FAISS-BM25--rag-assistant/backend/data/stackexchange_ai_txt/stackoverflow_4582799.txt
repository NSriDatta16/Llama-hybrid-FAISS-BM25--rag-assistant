You can use $.browser . However, this is highly discouraged, since it doesn't cope with new or rare browsers. As the docs note: We recommend against using this property; please try to use feature detection instead (see jQuery.support ). $.browser will be removed from future versions of jQuery. If you give us more information, we may be able to suggest a better solution. EDIT: As the docs say, you can use flags like $.browser.webkit (true for webkit) or $.browser.ie , and get the version from $.browser.version .
