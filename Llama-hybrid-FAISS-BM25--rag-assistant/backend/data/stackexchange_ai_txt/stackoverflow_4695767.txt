Is Cucumber simply a wrapper around rspec to help organize tests into features?

Just want to make sure I understand things. From what I gather so far, Cucumber is simply a 'wrapper' or a nice way to organize your tests by categorizing things into features and steps, where the actual unit tests are in the steps phase. It allows to organize your tests into how things will work. Is that correct?
