machine learning to predict equations / parameters of equations

I'm not sure if machine learning is the best way to do this, but I'm interested in seeing if this problem is feasible. Normally you use machine learning for classification. ie.given the size of a tumor and the color(darkness) of the tumor, determine whether its lethal or benign. However, say you want to figure out how the tumor has been growing/how it will end up in the future, given that you know its current size and current color. Can you use machine learning to predict an equation or curve that describes its size, for the duration of the tumor's life? This is how my data looks: Subject SIZE COLOR GROWTH 1 5 10 3.4/(1+t^-1.2) 2 8 62 3.8/(1+t^-1.5) 3 15 77 6.5/(1+t^-3) 4 40 94 8.6/(1+t^-15) … … … …
