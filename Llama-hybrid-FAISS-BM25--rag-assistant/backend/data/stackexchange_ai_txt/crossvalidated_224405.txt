Looks like the question is more about, how to propagate error through pooling layer. You can find the answer here for max-pooling: https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/11699/backprop-through-max-pooling-layers and in general rule here in slide 11: http://www.slideshare.net/kuwajima/cnnbp You are right is both account; during max pooling you have to maintain the index of max unit in forward propagation and is mean pooling, it is 1/m, m being in the size of pooling function, of the gradient.
