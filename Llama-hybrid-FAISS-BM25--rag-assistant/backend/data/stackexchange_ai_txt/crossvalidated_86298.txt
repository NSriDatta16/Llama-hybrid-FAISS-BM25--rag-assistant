Regarding your first bullet point, bear in mind that people are heterogeneous. There is a small proportion of people who eat pizza constantly (say, some college freshmen), a lot of people who eat it occasionally, and some people who never eat pizza. It is worth always remembering that there is no "average American". The confusion that you are recognizing is an instance of what economists call the ecological fallacy . In essence, this is assuming that what is true of an aggregate (e.g., all Americans) must be true of the components (e.g., each individual American). It is hard for me to think how a newspaper might try to briefly state the statistics at issue and preempt this possible confusion without being pedantic or trying to give a statistics lesson. As critical as I am on occasion of the news media, this is a genuinely difficult task and they have competing demands. I suppose they could say, "because some people eat pizza so frequently, on a typical day one in eight Americans is eating pizza (albeit from day to day many of these are the same people)". As to your question about how we can validly conclude the proportion of Americans who eat pizza, without more information, all we can say is that the proportion must be within the interval from 12.5% to 100%. Based only on loose familiarity with analogous phenomena, I would guess the distribution follows a power law .
