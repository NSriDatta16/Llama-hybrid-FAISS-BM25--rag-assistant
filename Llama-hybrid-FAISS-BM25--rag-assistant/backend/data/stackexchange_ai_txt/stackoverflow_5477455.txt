For the duration of time that your app is in memory, storing state in a globally accessible object is a lot less overhead than the SharedPreferences. You can easily use SharedPreferences to serialize your app state so it can be reloaded later, but I would say to think of SharedPreferences as a storage mechanism and use a derived Application class for stuff you will be reading and writing to often while your app is running.
