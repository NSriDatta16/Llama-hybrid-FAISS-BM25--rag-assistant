Use the -classpath option for the java command to specify where your classes are. The value of the classpath option is a list of directories, JAR archives, and ZIP archives that contain classes, structured into directories that mirror the classes' package structure. The list uses the path delimiter, which is plaform specific: on Windows, it is " ; ", other platforms use " : ". Using the CLASSPATH environment variable is discouraged because changes for one program are likely to interfere with the operation of other programs.
