I'm not sure of the actual relationship of this to exponentially weighted moving linear regression, but a simple online formula for estimating an exponentially-weighted slope and offset is called Holt-Winters double exponential smoothing . From the Wikipedia page: Given a time series $x_0 ... x_t$, and smoothing parameters $\alpha \in (0,1], \beta \in (0, 1]$, Initialize with: \begin{align} s_1 &= x_1 \\ b_1 &= x_1 - x_0 \end{align} And then for $t>1$: \begin{align} s_t &= (1-\alpha) (s_{t-1}+b_{t-1}) + \alpha x_t \\ b_t &= (1-\beta) b_{t-1} + \beta (s_t - s_{t-1}) \end{align} Where $b_t$ is an estimated slope and $s_t$ is an estimated y-intercept at time t. Maybe a statistically-inclined person can comment on how close this is to the solution of exponentially weighted moving linear regression.
