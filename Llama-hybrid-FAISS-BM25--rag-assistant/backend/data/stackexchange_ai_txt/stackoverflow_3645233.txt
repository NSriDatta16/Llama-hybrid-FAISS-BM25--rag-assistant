Display Special Characters (Korean Letters) in RichTextBox

My question might be a little bit confusing, but I think it's still worth of paying some attention. Basically I'm designing a program to display all printable Unicode characters in a RichTextBox. I'm using VC# 2010 Express Edition. However, the RichTextBox has a critical problem: some special characters cannot be displayed correctly. For example, some Korean Characters (ﾡﾢﾣﾤﾥﾦﾧﾨﾩﾪﾫﾬﾭﾮﾯﾰﾱﾲﾳﾴﾵﾶﾷﾸﾹﾺﾻﾼﾽﾾ), can be displayed correctly in Microsoft Word. After I copy to the RichTextBox, the characters cannot be displayed correctly. However, when I copy back to Microsoft Word, it can be displayed correctly. Therefore, it's a display problem (the characters themselves are correct). I guess it might be a font problem. Some related property info: RichTextBox.Font.GdiChaSet RichTextBox.Font How can I solve it? So that all printable Unicode characters can be displayed correctly (using different fonts for different CharSets are acceptable). Actually, I need further assistance about removing all formatting when pasting rtbxFileContent.Paste(DataFormats.GetFormat(DataFormats.Text)); // DataFormats.UnicodeText I still need to have all printable characters to be displayed correctly, but without any formatting (except font). Thanks. Hope I made myself understood.
