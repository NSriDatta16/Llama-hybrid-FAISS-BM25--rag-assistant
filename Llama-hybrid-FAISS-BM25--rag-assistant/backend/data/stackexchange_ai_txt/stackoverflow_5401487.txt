Cocoa is it self implemented in Object-C. By using that language a developer can more easily leverage the features of the hose system. While C/C++ are valid languages ( because of Objective-C background in them ) the interface between C/C++ and Cocoa ( because it's Objective-C ) is harder than if you were to just stick with Objective-C. See more on this from Apple .
