I suggest that a feedforward Neural Network with 1 or more hidden layers should be appropriate for a binary or multiclass problem. I should also point out that with a relatively smaller number of features (10) compared to M, other classifiers such as Logistic regression / Random Forests should give acceptable performance and would train faster as well.
