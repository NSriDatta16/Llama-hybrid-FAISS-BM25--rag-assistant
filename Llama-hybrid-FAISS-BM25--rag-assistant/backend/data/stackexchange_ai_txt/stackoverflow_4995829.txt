What user agents support mp4/H.264 video in the HTML5 tag?

What user agents support the HTML5 video tag, using mp4 as the container and H.264 as the codec? Has anyone come up with a regex for this? UPDATE: Thanks for the comments, everyone. I forgot to mention, I preferably want to do this on the back-end, which means something like modernizer wouldn't work.
