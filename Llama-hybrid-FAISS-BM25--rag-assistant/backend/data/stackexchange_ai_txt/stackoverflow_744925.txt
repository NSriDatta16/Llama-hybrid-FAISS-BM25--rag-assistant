In Python, you could leverage the inbuilt string formatting to make it shorter. Just needs a little regex hacking to get the syntax to match. import sys, re sys.stdout.write(re.sub(r'%(.+?)%',r'%(\1)s',open(sys.argv[2]).read())%dict(l.split("=",2) for l in open(sys.argv[1],'r'))) Down to 139 bytes. (Though perhaps the args/file-IO stuff shouldn't really be part of a golf challenge?)
