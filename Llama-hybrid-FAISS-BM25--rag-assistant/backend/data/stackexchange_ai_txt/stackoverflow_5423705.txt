I'm told there are more uses in haskell, but I've only had the pleasure of using closures in javascript, and in javascript I don't much see the point. My first instinct was to scream "oh no, not again" at what a mess the implementation must be to make closures work. After I read about how closures were implemented (in javascript anyway), it doesn't seem quite so bad to me now and the implementation seems somewhat elegant, to me at least. But from that I realized "closure" isn't really the best word to describe the concept. I think it should better be named "flying scope."
