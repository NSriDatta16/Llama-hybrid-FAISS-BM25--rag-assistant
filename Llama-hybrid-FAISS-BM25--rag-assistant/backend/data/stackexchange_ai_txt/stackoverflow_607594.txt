Two things immediately come to mind. The first is the notion of progressive disclosure, i.e., only show users what they need in order to accomplish the task at hand. How many UIs have we seen that have hundreds of controls on a single dialog? Divide the controls into their respective tasks and only allow the user to do a single task at a time. An Advanced button on a dialog is one way to implement this, and this concept has the added benefit of separating the power users from the run-of-the-mill users. Run-of-the-mill users are less likely to attempt a task that is likely to be beyond their skill level. The second is to leverage the wizard concept for complicated tasks. I know wizards have fallen out of style, but if a task is truly complicated, users usually appreciate having their hands held the first few times. A good example of this is the WinZip wizard interface. If you've never zipped a file before, this wizard uses a logical progression to walk you through the process. And then, once you've grown comfortable with it, you can switch to the classic interface to zip files more quickly. Of course to do all of this requires a committment not only by the developers, but by management. And that, sadly, is where many of these usability battles are lost.
