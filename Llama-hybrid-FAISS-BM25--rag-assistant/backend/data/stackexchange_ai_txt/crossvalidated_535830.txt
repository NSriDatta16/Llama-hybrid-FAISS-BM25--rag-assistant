From the delta method we have that $$ \sqrt{N}[\hat{\beta}^2 - \beta^2] \stackrel{D}{\to} \operatorname{Normal}(0, 4 \beta^2 \sigma^2) $$ where $\sigma / \sqrt{N}$ is the standard error of $\hat{\beta}$ . Therefore, a consistent estimator of the standard error of $\hat{\beta}^2$ is $$ 2 |\hat{\beta}| \times \sigma / \sqrt{N}. $$ So, basically, multiply the standard error of $\hat{\beta}$ by $2 |\hat{\beta}|$ to get the standard error of $\hat{\beta}^2$ . If you want a solution that doesn't rely so heavily on Taylor series approximations and a super large sample size, then you should look up how to perform a bootstrap in whatever software you are using. There are tons of tutorials out there --- I'm just showing you the delta method because it's a quick and elegant solution for this particular problem. Many people find the bootstrap confidence intervals more credible.
