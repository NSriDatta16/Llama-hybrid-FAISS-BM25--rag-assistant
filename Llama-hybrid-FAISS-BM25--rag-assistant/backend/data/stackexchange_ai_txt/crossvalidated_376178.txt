Bayesian MCMC methods that need to calculate the evidence / normalizing factor

I came across this answer which states that: NOT all the MCMC methods avoid the need for the normalising constant. I was under the impression that one of the strengths of the MCMC methods (usually employed for parameter inference) is that they avoid the need for obtaining the Bayesian evidence, only requiring evaluating the likelihood and the prior. Apparently this is not true, so my question is: what MCMC methods need to calculate the Bayesian evidence (normalising constant)?
