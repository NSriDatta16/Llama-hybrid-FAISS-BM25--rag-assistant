Types of statistical tests in R studio that can be used to analyze a dataset with categorical and numerical variables

Hi I am new to R programming, and have begun learning the different types of statistical tests that can be run on a dataset. I am trying to analyze a set of data with both numerical and categorical variables, and determine which statistical tests would be best to run. I am looking to compare the body length (BL) between two species of birds (sp) for each sex (sex). I have selected the variables I want and organized into a data frame and calculated the average body length by species and sex and organized it into a data table below. But am a bit lost on which tests I can use or would be best to use (t-test, chi, fisher, ANOVA, etc.) considering I have 2 categorical variables and not just 1 like a straightforward t-test. Any advice for a newbie getting started? bird.df % group_by(sp,sex) %>% summarize(mean_bl = mean(BL)) %>% filter(mean_bl == min(mean_bl) | mean_bl == max(mean_bl)) bird.dt
