From the sklearn documentation on gridsearchCV verbose (int) Controls the verbosity: the higher, the more messages. 1 : the computation time for each fold and parameter candidate is displayed; 2 : the score is also displayed; 3 : the fold and candidate parameter indexes are also displayed together with the starting time of the computation. Just set verbose = 1 in the gridsearch parameters (not sure if 10 works?) Probably you will regret this later as you will end up with a wall of text. If you are talking about a progress bar for the CNN I would look at tqdm
