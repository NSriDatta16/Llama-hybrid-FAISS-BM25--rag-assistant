I've looked at this on django running as fastcgi on both Slicehost (django 1.1, python 2.6) and Dreamhost (django 1.0, python 2.5), and I can say this: Running the top command shows the processes use a large amount of CPU to start up for ~2-3 seconds, then drop down to 0 almost immediately. Running the ps aux command after starting the django app shows something similar to what you describe, however this is actually misleading. From the Ubuntu man pages for ps: CPU usage is currently expressed as the percentage of time spent running during the entire lifetime of a process. This is not ideal, and it does not conform to the standards that ps otherwise conforms to. CPU usage is unlikely to add up to exactly 100%. Basically, the %CPU column shown by ps is actually an average over the time the process has been running. The decay you see is due to the high initial spike followed by inactivity being averaged over time.
