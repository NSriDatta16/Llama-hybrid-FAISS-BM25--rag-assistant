Single Sign 0n between DotNetNuke, Classic ASP app, ASP.NET app

We run multiple apps to provide services to our members at our organization 1. DotNetNuke as CMS 2. Classic ASP custom app for membership management and event management 3. ASP.NET app for providing online learning 4. Wordpress blog Can somebody please suggest a way to enable Single Sign On in this kind of an environment. I am looking for a solution which would enable adding any kind of application easily to the SSO in the future. We host most of the apps, but there are some being hosted outside our environment as well. All members are customers in different locations. THanks
