Does iPhone OS 3.0.1 ruin your development phone?

I updated my phone to 3.0.1. While the phone works fine as a phone, xcode organizer no longer knows the name of the phone. It also says 3.0.1 is unsupported by this version of xcode. I downloaded the latest version of xcode and OS (3.1). Now, I'm trying to move my phone from 3.0.1 to 3.1. I'm pressing option-restore in iTunes (does this bring in the beta OS?). It tells me all the data on my phone will be erased. How should I proceed?
