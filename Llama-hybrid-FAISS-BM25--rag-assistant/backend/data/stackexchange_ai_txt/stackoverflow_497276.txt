How can I consume Firebug net panel data programmatically?

My agile team will be adding new features to a existing realty website. As we add the features we want to have a better handle on the site's overall performance as well as the performance of particular pages. I would like to automate the gathering of performance metrics on a request/response basis for each page ( e.g. what sub requests are sent out by the browser, how many are there, how much data is transferred, and how long did each request take to fulfill ). Firebug currently captures this information in its net panel, however, I haven't found any way to programmatically pull this information out. Does anyone know of a way to pull this information out after a page has loaded? We are currently running our user acceptance tests with Selenium and I have considered adding this feature to the selenium interface so that our tests could run and collect the data without starting any other service. All suggestions are welcome, including ones that leverage other tools/methods to gather the performance metrics. Thank you.
