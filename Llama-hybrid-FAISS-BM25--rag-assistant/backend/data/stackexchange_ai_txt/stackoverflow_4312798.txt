If you plan on having the SQL backend, you should go with WPF. Silverlight is restricted in what it can access on the filesystem, even if you run it in the trusted mode and sign the app properly. People have been implementing all kinds of "good enough" databases that use Isolated Storage. You might use them depending on your level of comfort with the non-mainstream storage engine. Are you sure you'd need a local SQL database? How much data are we talking about and what is the frequency of inserts/complexity of selects?
