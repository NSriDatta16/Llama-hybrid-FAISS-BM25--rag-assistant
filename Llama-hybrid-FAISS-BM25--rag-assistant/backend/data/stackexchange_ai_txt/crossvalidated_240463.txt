Testing logistic regression using SGDClassifier

I am testing Logistic Regression with stochastic gradient using sklearn.linear_model.SGDClassifier . I have 2D independent variables and corresponding labels as below: X = array([[-2.58733628, 2.26126322], [ 1.97831473, 2.03510032], [ 2.48324069, -2.17901384], ... ]) Y = array([[ 1.], [ 1.], [-1.], [-1.], ...]) Here my objective function is $\sum \log( 1 + \exp(-y^{(i)}(wx^{(i)}+ w_{0}))) + \lambda||w||_2^2$, and I first tested with no regularization term. mySGDlr = linear_model.SGDClassifier(loss = 'log') mySGDlr.fit(X,ravel(Y)) print mySGDlr.score(X, ravel(Y)) 1) Then, the score is 1, which is not possible. Could you point me where is the wrong part in my code? Also, how can I check the optimized $w, w_0$ after having fitted the model? 2) I read the documentation of SGDClassifier and LogisticRegression function, and it seems that the main difference is that SDGClassifier uses SGD, and LogisticRegression uses some other fancy solvers. Is there any other importance differences?
