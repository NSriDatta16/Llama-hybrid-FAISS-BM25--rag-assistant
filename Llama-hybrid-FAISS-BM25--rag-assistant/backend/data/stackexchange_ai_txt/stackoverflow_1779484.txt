Hibernate 3.0 + ElementCollection class missing

I created a small desktop project using Hibernate, to understand how enterprise patterns are applied in there. I'm using annotations, and wrote a class to wrap my session factory public class Hibernation { private static final SessionFactory sessionFactory; static{ try{ //sesionFactory = new org.hibernate.cfg.Configuration().configure().buildSessionFactory(); sessionFactory = new AnnotationConfiguration().configure().buildSessionFactory(); } catch(Throwable e){ throw new ExceptionInInitializerError(e); } } public static Session getSession(){ return sessionFactory.openSession(); } } However, whenever i try to run it, I get this error: Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: javax.persistence.ElementCollection The jars in my classpath do not seem to have that class inside them hibernate3.jar jpa.jar log4j-1.2.15.jar persistence-api-1.0.jar slf4j-log4j12-1.0.1.jar I've looked around for that class, but I can't find where to download it from. Any idea what jar file i'm missing? I looked inside javaee.jar , where there are many javax.persistence.*** clases, but its not there either. Thanks in advance.
