Ended up making the window transparent and setting showFlexChrome to false. Then using a container I was able to get rounded corners. It didn't help my other problem which was trying to get a glow effect around the window and still being able to resize it.. for that I had to override the mouseDownHandler from the window class so I could modify the drag locations to the container canvas. What a pain!
