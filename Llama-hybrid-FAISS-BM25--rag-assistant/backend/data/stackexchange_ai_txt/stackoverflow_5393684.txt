I prefer typing games that encourage you to type faster for a reward (high score). Do a search for 'typing games' and have fun. I'm about 80 wpm atm (according to some games I peak near 90 but the longer words drag my average down). Whatever you choose, you do need to keep doing it on a regular basis.
