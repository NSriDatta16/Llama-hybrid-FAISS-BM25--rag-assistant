Data Quality Assessment in Image Data

I'm working on a CNN model that classifies images. After scraping image files from the Internet, I found that many of them didn't look this way as described by the searching keyword (for example keyword='dog' but image not containing a dog). So, I cleaned my dataset manually which was quite labor intensive and time consuming. Was my approach right or is there any tools or methods by which image data can be cleaned? Actually this sounds quite controversial because this cleaning tool should do the job for what the model are being built - classify the images.
