MySQL by default uses the MyIsam storage engine. As the MyISAM does not support transactions, insert, update and delete statements are directly written to the database. The commit and rollback statements are ignored. In order to use transaction you need to change the storage engine of you tables. Use this command: ALTER TABLE table_name ENGINE = InnoDB; (note how ever, that the two storage engines are different and you need to test you're application if it still behaves as expected)
