Lasso regularization is a type of cost function regularization that only works with certain types of machine learning algorithms. For example, lasso regularization does not work with support vector machines (SVMs). A more common way to frame your problem is feature selection for categorical features in binary classification. A couple of techniques are the chi-squared statistic and the mutual information statistic.
