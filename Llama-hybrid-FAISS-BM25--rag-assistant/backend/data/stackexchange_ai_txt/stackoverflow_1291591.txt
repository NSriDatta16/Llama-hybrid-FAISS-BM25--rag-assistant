I also have the same issue. I've been looking for a solution to this problem for almost a year now. Doing a search on google shows that the issue has been raised in the MySQL Bugs tracker/forum. I thought that the issue would be fixed in version 6.04 of the connector, just downloaded and tested it, but still unable to drag and drop stored procedures from the server explorer. I'm thinking of using the workaround of hardcoding the strongly typed datasets. Maybe you should try that in the meantime.
