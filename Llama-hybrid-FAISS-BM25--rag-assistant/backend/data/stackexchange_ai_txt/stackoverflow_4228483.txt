Where do I catch Exceptions in MVVM?

My view model class has a method (not sure if that is good practice or if view models are supposed to be strictly property and property changing mechanisms) that connects to a service. Of course I want to handle any possible WCF exceptions when connecting or disconnecting. Let's use endpoint not found as an example considering that is an exception that I would want to bring to the user's attention. Consider the rough code example: public void Connect() { ServiceClient proxy = null; try { proxy = new ServiceClient(); proxy.Subscribe(); // ... } catch(EndpointNotFoundException) { // should I do something here? } // .. other WCF related exception catches and a finally } Is it considered good practice to maybe invoke System.Windows.MessageBox.Show() directly within the catch or should I maybe rethrow the exception so another layer of my WPF application catches it? If so, where is the ideal place to catch such an exception?
