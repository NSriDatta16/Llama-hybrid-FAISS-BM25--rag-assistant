Approach 1: Visualisation Let me summarise an idea from a little book of R for time series. I use the following time series births Now I can decompose the time series library(TTR) birthstimeseriescomponents You can either plot all components plot(birthstimeseriescomponents) or you just have a look at the seasonal component with birthstimeseriescomponents$seasonal Jan Feb Mar Apr 1946 -0.6771947 -2.0829607 0.8625232 -0.8016787 1947 -0.6771947 -2.0829607 0.8625232 -0.8016787 1948 -0.6771947 -2.0829607 0.8625232 -0.8016787 1949 -0.6771947 -2.0829607 0.8625232 -0.8016787 1950 -0.6771947 -2.0829607 0.8625232 -0.8016787 1951 -0.6771947 -2.0829607 0.8625232 -0.8016787 1952 -0.6771947 -2.0829607 0.8625232 -0.8016787 1953 -0.6771947 -2.0829607 0.8625232 -0.8016787 1954 -0.6771947 -2.0829607 0.8625232 -0.8016787 1955 -0.6771947 -2.0829607 0.8625232 -0.8016787 1956 -0.6771947 -2.0829607 0.8625232 -0.8016787 1957 -0.6771947 -2.0829607 0.8625232 -0.8016787 1958 -0.6771947 -2.0829607 0.8625232 -0.8016787 1959 -0.6771947 -2.0829607 0.8625232 -0.8016787 May Jun Jul Aug 1946 0.2516514 -0.1532556 1.4560457 1.1645938 1947 0.2516514 -0.1532556 1.4560457 1.1645938 1948 0.2516514 -0.1532556 1.4560457 1.1645938 1949 0.2516514 -0.1532556 1.4560457 1.1645938 1950 0.2516514 -0.1532556 1.4560457 1.1645938 1951 0.2516514 -0.1532556 1.4560457 1.1645938 1952 0.2516514 -0.1532556 1.4560457 1.1645938 1953 0.2516514 -0.1532556 1.4560457 1.1645938 1954 0.2516514 -0.1532556 1.4560457 1.1645938 1955 0.2516514 -0.1532556 1.4560457 1.1645938 1956 0.2516514 -0.1532556 1.4560457 1.1645938 1957 0.2516514 -0.1532556 1.4560457 1.1645938 1958 0.2516514 -0.1532556 1.4560457 1.1645938 1959 0.2516514 -0.1532556 1.4560457 1.1645938 Sep Oct Nov Dec 1946 0.6916162 0.7752444 -1.1097652 -0.3768197 1947 0.6916162 0.7752444 -1.1097652 -0.3768197 1948 0.6916162 0.7752444 -1.1097652 -0.3768197 1949 0.6916162 0.7752444 -1.1097652 -0.3768197 1950 0.6916162 0.7752444 -1.1097652 -0.3768197 1951 0.6916162 0.7752444 -1.1097652 -0.3768197 1952 0.6916162 0.7752444 -1.1097652 -0.3768197 1953 0.6916162 0.7752444 -1.1097652 -0.3768197 1954 0.6916162 0.7752444 -1.1097652 -0.3768197 1955 0.6916162 0.7752444 -1.1097652 -0.3768197 1956 0.6916162 0.7752444 -1.1097652 -0.3768197 1957 0.6916162 0.7752444 -1.1097652 -0.3768197 1958 0.6916162 0.7752444 -1.1097652 -0.3768197 1959 0.6916162 0.7752444 -1.1097652 -0.3768197 If you plot it and you get the raw data of the seasonal component you should be able to make a conclusion. Approach 2: Statistical testing The following question seems to be very close to yours and it has some answers: Test for trend and seasonality in time series . There are also several tests for seasonality such as the Friedman test and the Kruskal-Wallis test. Both test are available in R and apply to stable additive seasonality. The command for the Kruskal-Wallis test is kruskal.test() from the preinstalled stats package. The command for the Friedman test is friedman.test() which is also in the stats package. Friedman test The Friedman test is a test which is used to detect differences in treatment across multiple test attempts. It can detect differences in the mean between ≥ 2 samples. Here is an explanation why the Friedman test is useful for seasonality: Stable seasonality test (also called an F-test, Friedman test) is a test for the presence of seasonality based on a one-way analysis of variance on the SI ratios. Thus the test is performed on the detrended time series adjusted for prior factors. Generally, the test compares the periods (months or quarters) variance with the residual variance. Under the assumption that the first one is caused by seasonal factors while the second one derives from irregular movements the test checks if the first type of variations are repetitive and regular enough to be reliably identified as the seasonal movements. Kruskal-Wallis test The Kruskal-Wallis test is similar to the Friedman test. It also test whether ≥ 2 samples have different means. The Difference to the Friedman test is that the Kruskal-Wallis test is based on an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) between the samples. For a detailed discussion read this page: Friedman vs Kruskal-Wallis test Here is an explanation why the Kruskal Wallis Test is useful for detecting seasonality: Kruskal-Wallis test is a non-parametric test used for comparing samples from two or more groups. This test does not make assumptions about normality. However, it assumes that the observations in each group come from populations with the same shape of distribution. The null hypothesis states that all months (or quarters, respectively) have the same mean. As NickCox already stated in the comment these test are available in almost every package of statistical software.
