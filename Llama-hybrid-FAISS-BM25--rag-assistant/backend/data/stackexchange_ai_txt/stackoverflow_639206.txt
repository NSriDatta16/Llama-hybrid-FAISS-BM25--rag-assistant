Twisted has been used for this purpose with success. Being based on asynchronius calls it's very efficient for applications requiring persistent connections. Also it has a nice RTMP implementation for use with flash. Check chesspark, it's built with Twisted: http://www.chesspark.com/ Plus the game engine doesn't really have to be in c/c++. Depends on the complexity and type of the game. But there's also the pygame library which is pretty good. Personally I'd discourage you from using silverlight. The flash plugin is much better adopted and will continue to be in the forseeable future, especially on non ms operating systems. Don't take this to heart but I wouldn't install silverlight just to see your game.
