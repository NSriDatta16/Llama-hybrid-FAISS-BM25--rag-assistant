Start with "alt 2", then gradually add unicode support to your framework, then move over to Unicode. Rationale: you want a stable app; switching over to Delphi 2009+ will eventually require you to really support Unicode. Edit : 20100125 While doing "alt 2" watch the Delphi compiler hints warnings. The situation that Andreas describes will generate such hints and warnings. I have explained this in my CodeRage 4 session about Unicode and other encodings . The above link points to a page where you can view the replay of that session. If you still have questions, just drop them here. --jeroen
