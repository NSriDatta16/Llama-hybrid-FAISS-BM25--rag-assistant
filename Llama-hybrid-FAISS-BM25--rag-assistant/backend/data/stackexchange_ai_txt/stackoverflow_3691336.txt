Strange memory leaks when running 'Navigation Based Application' template project

I did a very simple test which was creating a blank project using xCode and execute on device. When executed with Instruments I got memory leaks ! Please note that I am using iPhone 3G device running iOS 4.0.2 Here are the steps to reproduce: From xCode 3.2.3 Choose File -> New Project -> Navigation-based Application selecting Use Core Data for storage Choose Device - 4.0 as the build Target Choose Run -> Run with performance tool -> Leaks On the iPhone 3G device (running iOS 4.0.2) click the '+' button several times in the launched App. Here is the Instruments screenshot: Can anyone confirm this issue? Thanks, Joshua
