Predicting parallel time series with multiple features

I am trying to predict sales for 2 departmental stores which share similar demographic properties. My goal is to make a single LSTM model to predict sales from these parallel time series having multiple features. My input features for training would be +----------+-------+--------------+-------+ | Date | Store | DayOfTheWeek | Sales | +----------+-------+--------------+-------+ | 1/1/2019 | A | 2 | 100 | | 1/2/2019 | A | 3 | 200 | | 1/3/2019 | A | 4 | 150 | | 1/1/2019 | B | 2 | 300 | | 1/2/2019 | B | 3 | 550 | | 1/3/2019 | B | 4 | 1000 | +----------+-------+--------------+-------+ and my output for training would be +----------+-------+--------------+-------+ | Date | Store | DayOfTheWeek | Sales | +----------+-------+--------------+-------+ | 1/4/2019 | A | 5 | 220 | | 1/4/2019 | B | 5 | 700 | +----------+-------+--------------+-------+ Problem is that LSTM takes input as 3D i.e (n_sample, n_timesteps, n_features) and I can pass a single time series for a specific store (e.g. A) If I had a univariate mutiple time series I can reshape my input data as follows and pass it to LSTM. +----------+---------+---------+ | Date | A_Sales | B_Sales | +----------+---------+---------+ | 1/1/2019 | 100 | 300 | | 1/2/2019 | 200 | 550 | | 1/3/2019 | 150 | 1000 | +----------+---------+---------+ But I need to identify how can I predict parallel multivariate time series? Is there any other way to define in Input LSTM layer that there are 2 time series with 2 features each i.e (2*2).
