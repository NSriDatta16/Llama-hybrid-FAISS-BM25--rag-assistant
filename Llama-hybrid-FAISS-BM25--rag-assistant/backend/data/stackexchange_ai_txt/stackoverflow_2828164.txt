A couple of things: FSA won't necessarily work depending on how intelligent you want the filter to be Regex are generally extremely slow depending on how many you want to run 400 words is somewhat low, depending on your needs and langauges There are a number of extremely tricky cases to be careful of when filtering, particularly embedding of words such as "ASSume" My company, Inversoft, builds a commercial filtering solution and it is quite intelligent. It doesn't use regex or FSA, but has a custom built fast-linear processing technology that makes it extremely fast and accurate (4,000+ messages per second). It also has over 600 English words in a number of categories including Slang, Racial Slurs, Drug, Gang, Religious, etc. If you are looking for an intelligent context-aware solution with support, you should check out Clean Speak from Inversoft. Hooking it up to Obj-C should be simple using the XML WebService.
