Vb 6 Make .exe different results to debugger

I'm comparing the results produced when i use the 'Make .exe' compared to when i run the exact same process using the exact same variables though the IDE vb 6 debugger. I've tried an array of different compiler options but to no avail. So my question is why would i get a difference between the debugger and the 'Make .exe'? have you ever come arross something similar and if so did you find a fix? the program takes a large file of counts of cars in a timeperiod and averages them into 15 minute timeperiods for the day over a month for each route. It elminates certain records depending on if there outside the standard deviation and other statistical algorithms To eliminate values. its a bit to much code to post unfortunately...
