Suppose I have a dictionary: {apple:large apple, apple:red apple, apple:aple, orange:mandarin, orange:orang, orange:blood orange} and so on... And then I want to replace a large document of entries with the keys. However, occasionally a new value will come up, i.e. {apple:green apple} Is there a method where I can replace all values with the corresponding key, but then also replace 'close' values like the one given if they appear? Example document: var1 _____ aple apple orange Apple Red apple gren Apple blood Orange orang var1_replaced ______________ apple apple orange apple apple apple orange orange
