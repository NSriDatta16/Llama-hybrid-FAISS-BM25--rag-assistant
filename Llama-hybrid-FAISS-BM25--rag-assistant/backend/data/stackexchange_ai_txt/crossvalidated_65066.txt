This Youtube video is a really nice visualization of a simple problem that's solved using MCMC. The distribution of interest is the posterior distribution over possible slopes and intercepts in a linear regression (upper-right panel). Some combinations of slopes and intercepts are very probable (i.e. they have a high likelihood of producing the observed data points and are consistent with our a priori expectations), so they should be sampled frequently. Other combinations are improbable (e.g. if they correspond to a blue line that doesn't go through the cloud of data points), and should be sampled less often. The big panel in the lower-left shows the path taken by the Markov chain through a two-dimensional space of slopes and intercepts. The histograms show one-dimensional summaries of the chain's progress so far. Once the chain has run long enough, we have very good estimates of the distributions for possible values of the slope and intercept. In this case, MCMC is overkill, but there are some problems where a solution is hard to write down and it makes a lot of sense to explore the possibilities with a Markov chain rather than trying to solve it directly.
