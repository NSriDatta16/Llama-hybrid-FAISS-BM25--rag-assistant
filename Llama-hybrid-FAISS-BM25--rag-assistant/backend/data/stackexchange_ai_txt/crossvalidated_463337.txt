KNN suffers from the curse of dimensionality . For this reason, it will almost never perform well in high dimensional feature space. So in terms of feature engineering, it's important to have a small set of meaningful features. Additionally, if your model is going to measure distance using the Euclidean distance, it's important to map your numerical features to a standard range, usually $[0,1]$ .
