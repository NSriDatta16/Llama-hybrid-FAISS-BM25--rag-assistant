The first thing is to break down all physical walls by moving the team to the same location, prefable seating everyone in the same room. Second, start using release planning meetings. That is, your team in concert with the customer, estimates each story that needs to be developed for the coming release. I will improve communication between team members because they are discussion technical issues and problem solving together. They are estimating and, if done correctly, leads to consensus regarding estimates and design approach. Follow up the release planning with kicking of each iteration (one-week iteration is best) with an iteration planning meeting. This is where the team breaks down each story into a number of small tasks scheduled for implementation this iteration. Third, start using pair programming. Dont force it, but encourage it strongly. Also, make sure that pairs are only pairing for a day or so. Ie rotate pairs. This builds collective code ownership and team spirit since it is "our code" not "his code". Oh, and finally: Learn to always talk about "us" and the "team". Never point fingers.
