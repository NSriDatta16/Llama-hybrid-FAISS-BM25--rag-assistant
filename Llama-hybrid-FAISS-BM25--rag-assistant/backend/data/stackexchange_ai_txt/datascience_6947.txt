Looking for language and framework for data munging/wrangling

I have an extensive series of projects that require importing data from many different types of different sources (websites, web apis, sensors, legacy text files, etc). Is there a good framework (preferably open source) that has been built bottom up to tackle this type of problem? Preferably one leveraging an appropriate language (python, most likely) and already having an extensive plugin database.
