Android Local Storage files getting erased on reboot

I have an android app that stores data to the local storage. This is done just like in the tutorial on Google's site: String FILENAME = "data.xml"; String string = "some content"; FileOutputStream fos = openFileOutput(FILENAME, Context.MODE_PRIVATE); fos.write(string.getBytes()); fos.close(); However, whenever the device is powered off, then powered back on, these files are removed. How can I get them to stay?
