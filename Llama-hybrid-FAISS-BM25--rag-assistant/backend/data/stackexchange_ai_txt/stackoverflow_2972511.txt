Call NHibernate Repository from HttpApplication.Init()

In S#Arch based web application I need to read some data during the application initialization. From the first point, the best place - HttpApplication.Application_Start() or HttpApplication.Init() But, Application_Start isn't applicable as there is no WebSessionStorage yet. Init() seems isn't fit as well, as there is no NHibernateSession. What would you suggest?
