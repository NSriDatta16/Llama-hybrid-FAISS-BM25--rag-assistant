Brant test in R

In testing the parallel regression assumption in ordinal logistic regression I find there are several approaches. I've used both the graphical approach (as detailed in HarrellÂ´s book) and the approach detailed using the ordinal package in R. However I would also like to run the Brant test (from Stata) for both the individual variables and also for the total model. I've looked around but cannot find it implemented in R. Is there an implementation of the Brant test in R?
