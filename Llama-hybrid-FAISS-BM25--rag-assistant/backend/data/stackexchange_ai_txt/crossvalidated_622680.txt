Input/References on time series modeling/prediction without assuming stationarity

I am trying to find out what methodologies there are for analyzing/modeling time series without assuming the time series is stationary/trying to make the time series stationary. I am wanting to do this to explore if there is some form of useful information that is being discarded when traditional approaches to approximating stationarity are applied such as differencing, etc. When attempting to search for frameworks that don't assume stationarity through terms such as "Non-stationary time series modeling" or "Non-stationary time series forecasting", aside from the common approaches such as exponential smoothing and time series distance clustering, I tend to run into approaches that start with non-stationary data, attempt to approximate stationarity, then apply methods that assume stationarity. I am looking for any input/references/search terms that may point me more towards what I have in mind.
