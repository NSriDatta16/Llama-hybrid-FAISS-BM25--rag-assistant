As already mentioned, you should use getchar() if you only want one character. If you still want to use scanf() for whatever reason you may have, the correct format is "%c" , not "%s" . I would also suggest that if you are looking for a single character, the if block looks a little "busy" (read, awkward) ... a switch would be a cleaner, more elegant way to do it (IMHO). /* something like this ... */ switch ( selection ) { case '1': case 's': case 'S': printf ( "Hello\n" ); break; case '2': case 'e': case 'E': i = 0; break; } Other couple of things ... if you don't care about the case of the character being read (that is, 's' and 'S' will do the same thing), you can convert selection to uppercase before your if -block or switch -block using toupper() . Also, and this is just a style suggestion, don't use i for your exit flag. General practice is to use things like i and j for counters or indexes - you could use something like quit_now or user_done which would convey more precisely what the variable means.
