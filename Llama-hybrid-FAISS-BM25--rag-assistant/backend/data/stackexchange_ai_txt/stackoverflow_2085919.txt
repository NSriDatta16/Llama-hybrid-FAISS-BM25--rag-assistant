No threads are made. Actionscript is single threaded*. The xml will start to load and the function loadedCompleteHandler() will run once the file is completely loaded. There is no way to pause execution (ie making a synchronous request). What you need to do is make your loadedCompleteHandler call another function that continues what you started in your constructor. Another option is to either load the xml before even calling the constructor or embedding the xml inside the swf. * there are exceptions, but let's skip them for simplicity
