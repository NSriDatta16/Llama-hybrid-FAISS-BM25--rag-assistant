Both positive and negative labels are required in order to train a machine learning classification model. It appears that you only have positive labels. Any model trained on the current data will only predict positive labels for all future data. I suggest finding additional data that is similar but the loan was not granted. Then the model will be able to learn which feature values are associated with granting or not granting a loan.
