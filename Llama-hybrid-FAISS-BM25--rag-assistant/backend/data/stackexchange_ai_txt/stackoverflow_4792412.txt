If it's only about 50-200 words, I'd store it in memory in a data structure that supports fast lookup, such as a hash map (I don't know what such a structure is called in Ruby). You could use option 2 or 3 (persist the data in a file or database table, depending on what's easier for you), then read the data into memory at the start of your application. Store the time at which the data was read and re-read it from the persistent storage if a request comes in and the data hasn't been updated for X minutes. That's basically a cache . It might be possible that Ruby on Rails already provides such a mechanism, but I know too little about it to answer that.
