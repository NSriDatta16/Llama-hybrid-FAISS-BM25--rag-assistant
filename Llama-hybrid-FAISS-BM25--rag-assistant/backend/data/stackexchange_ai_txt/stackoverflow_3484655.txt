Extracting Browser Element from User Agent

I'm still working on the whole gathering user data from a visit thing, so I'm hung up on grabbing the actual name of the browser being used by the visitor. I have this code, but it seems that after execution, $browser is empty. $userAgent = mysql_real_escape_string($_SERVER["HTTP_USER_AGENT"]); $browser = get_browser($userAgent, true); print_r($browser); What am I doing wrong here, and what steps do I take next to extract the browser from the array? EDIT Okay so now I have the following code: $browser = get_browser(null, true); $userAgent = $browser["browser"]; $browser = mysql_real_escape_string($userAgent); echo $browser; Which does nothing. Any insight?
