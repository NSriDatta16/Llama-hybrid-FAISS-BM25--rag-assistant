The same points as HLGEM. I very often encounter people who "know" ADO, yet have no clue about SQL. In most cases this is because they've used ADO (usually drag and drop with the properties dialog) to create and manipulate their data (for example using ADO tables to be able to step through and update records), but don't really understand how it works "behind the scenes" in SQL. Concentrating on SQL knowledges helps avoid bringing one of these people on to your team (let them write unscalable VB apps filled with concurrency problems at some other company). Another point is that ADO is just a means to connect to an SQL database. There where methods before ADO, and there will be methods after ADO (for example LINQ centric frameworks). Understanding the underlying technology, and not just a single "tool" is important to many good employers - Would you hire someone who could only program C++ if they used the Visual Studio IDE? (Actually this is a very real problem I've encountered with some Java programmers, especially with regard to GUI programming)
