Relationship between average and characteristic function of a Gaussian process

I'm having trouble understanding an equality given in a book ("Speckle Phenomena in Optics" by Joseph Goodman p.145) for a zero mean, stationary Gaussian process: $\overline{\exp(i [\phi(x_1)-\phi(x_2)])}=\exp(-\sigma^2[1-\mu(x_1-x_2)])$ where $\sigma^2$ is the variance of the process $\phi$ and $\mu$ is the normalized autocorrelation of the process. Could anyone derive this equality for me or give me a reference that explains it? The author says: "from the relationship of the average to characteristic functions we have ..." Thanks!
