There are several methods to find whether the data is linearly separable, some of them are highlighted in this paper (1). With assumption of two classes in the dataset, following are few methods to find whether they are linearly separable: Linear programming: Defines an objective function subjected to constraints that satisfy linear separability. You can find detail about implementation here . Perceptron method: A perceptron is guaranteed to converge if the data is linearly separable. Quadratic programming: Quadratic programming optimisation objective function can be defined with constraint as in SVM. Computational geometry: If one can find two disjoint convex hulls then the data is linearly separable Clustering method: If one can find two clusters with cluster purity of 100% using some clustering methods such as k-means, then the data is linearly separable.
