If you're using public key encryption, then you'll want to freely distribute the public key (most likely) and keep access to the private key highly restricted (only on storage media that you know are secure). Either way, it is typical to store keys as base64-encoded strings in XML files. The RSACryptoServiceProvider class has built-in capability to do this, I believe.
