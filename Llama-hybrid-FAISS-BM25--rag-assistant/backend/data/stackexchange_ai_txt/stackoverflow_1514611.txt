How can I replace a div with a widget when it is already contained in another widget?

I'm using Ext-GWT and I think ListView is the right layout for what I need. My problem is that I have to use a HTML template for all of my items, but I want to build GWT/Ext-GWT widgets instead, so I'm using div placeholders that I will replace with the proper widgets. How can I replace my div with a widget? My first attempt was to use RootPanel.get('div-id') , but apparently you can't create a RootPanel that is in a widget (I used debug mode to step through the code till I found that silent exception). public class TicketContainer extends LayoutContainer { private ArrayList tickets; public TicketContainer(ArrayList tickets) { this.tickets = tickets; } @Override protected void onRender(Element parent, int index) { super.onRender(parent, index); setLayout(new FlowLayout(1)); ListStore store = new ListStore (); store.add(this.tickets); ListView view = new ListView (store); view.addListener(Events.Refresh, new Listener () { @Override public void handleEvent(BaseEvent be) { for (BasicTicket ticket : tickets) { // At this point I need to find the div with the id // "ticket_"+ticket.getId() and replace it with a GWT // widget that I can add events to and enable drag and drop } } }); add(view); } private native String getTemplate() /*-{ return [' ', ' ', ' '].join(""); }-*/; } The full source is at https://code.launchpad.net/~asa-ayers/+junk/Kanban if you need additional context in the code.
