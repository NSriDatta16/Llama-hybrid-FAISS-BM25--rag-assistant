If you would like to spoof headers for your end users, then using a User Agent altering browser add-on is not an option. My suggestion is to write a simple PHP script to which you pass the URL to be fetched, and make a PHP cURL request towards that URL, but beforehand you should set the User Agent header with the following call: curl_setopt($ch,CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER,array('User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; U; CPU like Mac OS X; en) AppleWebKit/420+ (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/3.0 Mobile/1A537a Safari/419.3')); I think this should work, but it will kill your server in no time...
