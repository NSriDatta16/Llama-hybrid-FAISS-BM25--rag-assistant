While it doesn't look too complex you might consider using / deriving from suitable std exceptions and use std s conventions throw away setMessage() - the constructors are sufficient for throw Exception("foo"); throwing away virtual (when would you normally want to hand pointers to exceptions around or upcast them?) clarification: At least the destructor of the base exception should be virtual to avoid ambiguities and resulting unwanted hits on catch(...) {} when you wanted to catch the exception base class ( background ). Thanks Martin.
