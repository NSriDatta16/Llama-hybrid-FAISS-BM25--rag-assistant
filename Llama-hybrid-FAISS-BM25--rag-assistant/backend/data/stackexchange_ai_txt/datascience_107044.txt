How to train a CNN with several features but test with less features

I'm trying to train a model (with TensorFlow and Keras) to classify the soil based on the x,y, and z coordinates. I have a table 8321 x 10 where 8321 are the points in a mesh, and 10 are the features I have (label, density, plasticity index, cone penetration resistance, etc). What I would like is to introduce x,y,z and the model return the label/classification (between 1 and 7) How can I make a CNN with this? I have tried the Naive Bayes, but the training data set must be the same shape as predicted, and for training, I have all information (10 features) but for prediction, I only have 3 (the coordinates x,y, and z). I have this data, and I want to predict (populate) all the mesh. An example of the dataset is: From where for training I drop the "zone", "label" and "cptu_ID" columns and as the target, I set the "zone".
