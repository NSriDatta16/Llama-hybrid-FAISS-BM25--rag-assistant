I would say no. Time series methods can reveal something about the structure of the problem in hand, not just about some forecasts done only with series own history. For example state-space model form can be used to model time varying regression with several varieties. And also structural time series can be casted into state space form. Zellner and Palm wrote an article about the combining structural and time series modeling. ftp://ftp.uic.edu/pub/depts/econ/hhstokes/e537/zellner_palm_je74.pdf
