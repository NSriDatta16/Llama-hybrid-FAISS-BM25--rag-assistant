My comments might not be a direct answer to your question but useful. IOD/IOP encourages that put less headers in INTERFACE headers as possible, the main benefits to do so: less dependencies; smaller link-time symbols scope; faster compiling; smaller size of final executables if header contains static C-style function definitions etc. per IOD/IOP, should interfaces only be put in .h/.hxx headers. include headers in your .c/.cpp instead.
