C Drive got filled while training my dataset over yolov5

Asked the question over a cross-validated stack but got recommendations to ask at the data science stack. So, I recently bought a GPU and tried yolov5 on my personal dataset of around 1500 images. While training my C drive got filled (before that I had 11 Gb free). I am not sure what is the issue, but this might be the reason that I have python.exe in my C drive. If it's true, do I need to uninstall the python and reinstall it on another disk?
