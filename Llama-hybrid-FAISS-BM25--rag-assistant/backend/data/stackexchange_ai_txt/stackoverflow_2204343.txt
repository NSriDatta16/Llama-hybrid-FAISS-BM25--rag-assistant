It all depends on what you want your database to do with the XML. If you just want to store the XML document for later retrieval, just use a blob or text field. Also check the MySQL docs . If you are trying to dump/import a model, use mysqldump. If you are planning to query on XML, you should probably be using a native XML database such as eXist-db instead.
