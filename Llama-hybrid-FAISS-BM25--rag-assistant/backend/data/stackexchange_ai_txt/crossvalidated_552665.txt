What does the skewness, when converted to the units of the data, represent?

I have calculated the skewness of my data. I was wondering what the skewness, when converted to the units of the data, represents in non-mathematical (biological?) terms? For instance, I know that the variance, when "converted" to the standard deviation, represents how far, on average, a single datum deviates from the mean. Any help would be greatly appreciated! Alex
