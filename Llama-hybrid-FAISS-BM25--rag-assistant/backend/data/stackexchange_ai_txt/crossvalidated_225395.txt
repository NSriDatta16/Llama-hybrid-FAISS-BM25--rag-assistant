Where to find a guide to encoding categorical features?

I am facing an ML task with various categorical variables. Some examples include the following: Binary variables (0,1). Multilevel factors that can be ordered (low, medium, high). Multilevel factors that cannot be ordered (red, blue, green). I'm going to use a deep neural network to perform my classification task: however, I'd like to find a possibly comprehensive guide to encoding categorical features according to the most commonly used methods and current best practices. Is there a reference text? I'm asking this since I usually need to do similar encoding tasks and I usually apply some rough fix, which is probably suboptimal, but that works more or less fine. This approach is, however, not an option in some cases and I would like to improve the way I handle such encoding tasks.
