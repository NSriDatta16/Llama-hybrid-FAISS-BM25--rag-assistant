Panel not getting focus

I am continuing to program some kind of keyboard navigation in my simple graphic program (using C#). And I ran into trouble once again. My problem is that I want to process the keyboard input to move a layer around. Moving the layer with the mouse already works quite well, yet the control doesn't get the focus ( neither KeyUp/KeyDown/KeyPress nor GotFocus/LostFocus is triggered for this control ). Since my class derives from Panel (and overwrites a couple of events), I've also overwritten the events mentioned above, but I can't succeed in getting those events triggered. I think I could manage to implement keyboard response either using something like Keyboard.GetState() or ProcessCmdWnd or something. However: I still have to be able to tell when the control got the focus. Is there an more or less elegant way to add this ability to a user control (which is based on Panel)? I've checked many threads in here and I might use this approach for keyboard input. The focus problem however still remains. Thank you very much for information in advance! Igor. p.s.: I am programming in C# .NET v3.5, using VS2008. It's a Windows.Forms application, not WPF .
