To add to the above answers (+1 to both), here 's a good resource on deriving a CLT for a U-statistic when the ranks are assumed to be random (when they are nonrandom you can use Lyapunov's CLT--this is what @Glen_b is referring to). They mention the projections that @Michael R. Chernick is referring to. You can see it is involved. Here's the thing I wanted to add: the signed-rank test isn't exactly a U-statistic, though--there's still a bit of a jump. The answer in this thread shows you can write the signed-rank test as a sum of "Walsh averages," however notice that the sum runs over indexes where $i \le j$ . In a U-Statistic the sum runs over all $i . Even though the signed-rank test has sum extra sums corresponding to where $i=j$ , you can show that they still (after having been properly rescaled and recentered) have the same asymptotic normal distribution. This is exercise 1.7 in Chapter 6 of this book .
