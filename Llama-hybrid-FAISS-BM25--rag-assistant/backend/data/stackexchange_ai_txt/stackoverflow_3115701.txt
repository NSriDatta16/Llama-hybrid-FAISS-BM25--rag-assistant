I have just created a new open source project on Google Code with a basic code coverage tool for Delphi 2010. https://sourceforge.net/projects/delphicodecoverage/ Right now it can measure line coverage but I'm planning to add class and method coverage too. It generates html reports with a summary as well as marked up source showing you what lines are covered (green), which were not (red) and the rest of the lines that didn't have any code generated for them. Update: As of version 0.3 of Delphi Code Coverage you can generate XML reports compatible with the Hudson EMMA plugin to display code coverage trends within Hudson . Update: Version 0.5 brings bug fixes, increased configurability and cleaned up reports Update: Version 1.0 brings support for emma output, coverage of classes and methods and coverage of DLLs and BPLs
