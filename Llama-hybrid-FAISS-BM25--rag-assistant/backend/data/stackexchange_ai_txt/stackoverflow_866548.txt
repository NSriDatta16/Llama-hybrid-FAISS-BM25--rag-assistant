Combining multiple SQL Queries

I want to make a query to list cats that took longer than average cats to sell? I have five tables: Animal, Sale, AnimalOrderItem, AnimalOrder, and SaleAnimal Animal table: AnimalID, Name, Category (cat, dog, fish) SaleAnimal table: SaleID, AnimalID, SalePrice Sale table: SaleID, date, employeeID, CustomerID AnimalOrderItem table: OrderID, AnimalID, cost AnimalOrder: OrderID, OrderDate, ReceivingDate, SupplierID, ShippingCost, EmployeeID There is other tables I donâ€™t think they have an effect on the query. I thought of the following ... make a query to calculate days to sell for all ex.: [SaleDate]-[ReceiveDate] AS DaysToSell Have the INNER JOIN built: Sale INNER JOIN ((AnimalOrder INNER JOIN (Animal INNER JOIN AnimalOrderItem ON Animal.AnimalID = AnimalOrderItem.AnimalID) ON AnimalOrder. OrderID = AnimalOrderItem.OrderID) INNER JOIN SaleAnimal ON Animal. AnimalID = SaleAnimal.AnimalID) ON Sale.SaleID = SaleAnimal.SaleID Create another query based on the above query SELECT AnimalID, Name, Category, DaysToSell WHERE Category="Cat" AND DaysToSell> (SELECT Avg(DaysToSell) FROM the earlier query WHERE Category="Cat" ORDER BY DaysToSell DESC; After running the query it I got error saying ORA-00921: unexpected end of SQL command Any suggestions! please
