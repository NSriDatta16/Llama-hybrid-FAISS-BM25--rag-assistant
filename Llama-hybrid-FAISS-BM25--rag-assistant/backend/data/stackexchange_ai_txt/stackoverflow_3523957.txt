What you are doing is taking copying a contiguous region of memory in which you have stored one and wrote it to disk. This will work fine for simple data types (POD in C++ jargan). The problem with vectors is that a vector is a complex object with pointers to other regions of memory. These other regions of memory don't exist when you de-serialize one into two hence your segmentation fault. Unfortunately there is no shortcut, some form on custom serialization code will need to be written to get the job done. As some have already mentioned Boost Serialization may help. Alternatively roll out your own.
