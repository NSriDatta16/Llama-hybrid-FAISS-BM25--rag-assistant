You want to use array_agg , this should work: SELECT i_adgroup_id, array_agg(i_category_id) FROM adgroupcategories_br WHERE i_adgroup_id IN ( SELECT i_adgroup_id FROM adgroupusers_br WHERE i_user_id = 103713 ) GROUP BY i_adgroup_id; Note that i_category_id is no longer in the GROUP BY as it is now being aggregated.
