Why Deep Learning / Neural Networs don't achieve state of the art results in tabular data problems?

Apparently, deep learning methods don't achieve state-of-the-art results on tabular data problems [ 1 , 2 ]. This claim appears to be known also by Kagglers. The SOTA method looks like it is the gradient boosting decision tree. Is there any intuition on why this happens? Any relevant literature on the topic? Do neural networks have a stronger IID assumption that inhibits learning in tabular data?
