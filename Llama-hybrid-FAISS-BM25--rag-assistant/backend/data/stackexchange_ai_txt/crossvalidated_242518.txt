Like all the comments above, the Bayesian interpretation of LASSO is not taking the expected value of the posterior distribution, which is what you would want to do if you were a purist. If that would be the case, then you would be right that there is very small chance that the posterior would be zero given the data. In reality, the Bayesian interpretation of LASSO is taking the MAP (Maximum A Posteriori) estimator of the posterior. It sounds like you are familiar, but for anyone who is not, this is basically Bayesian Maximum Likelihood, where you use the value that corresponds to the maximum probability of occurrence (or the mode) as your estimator for the parameters in LASSO. Since the distribution increases exponentially until zero from the negative direction and falls off exponentially in the positive direction, unless your data strongly suggests the beta is some other significant value, the maximum value of value of your posterior is likely to be 0. Long story short, your intuition seems to be based on the mean of the posterior, but the Bayesian interpretation of LASSO is based on taking the mode of the posterior.
