Logistic regression does both: the predicted probabilities of success are the same as the predicted proportion of individuals with that set of covariates who would be a "success". Eg, suppose you fit the logistic model and you find that an individual with (salinity = 25, temp = 15, site = a) has a predicted probability of Stomach Empty = 1 of 85%. This is the same as if you took a large sample of individuals who all had (salinity = 25, temp = 15, site = a) then the predicted proportion of those individuals who are Stomach Empty = 1 is 85%. If further, you want to predict the overall proportion for a dataset consisting of a variety of different individuals, then you'll have to do some arithmetic to add them up. But that should be straightforward.
