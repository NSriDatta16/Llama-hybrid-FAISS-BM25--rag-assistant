I suggest that you investigate Probabilistic Programming. Basically, you write programs that operate on probability distributions rather than (random) variables. This makes it easy to define functions that are dynamic mixtures of distributions. While full-featured Probabilistic Programming systems support Bayesian statistical inference, your application doesn't really need it. Primarily you just need the programming language and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) solvers to generate samples from the distribution defined by your program. Good introductions and list of resources can be found in the following: http://radar.oreilly.com/2013/04/probabilistic-programming.html http://probabilistic-programming.org/wiki/Home Good tutorials on Probabilistic Programming can be found at the Church web site, especially the second, "Simple Generative Models": http://projects.csail.mit.edu/church/wiki/Cornell_tutorial http://projects.csail.mit.edu/church/wiki/Simple_Generative_Models Finally, investigate STAN as an implementation platform. There are versions for R and Python. Again, you just need the generative model capabilities.
