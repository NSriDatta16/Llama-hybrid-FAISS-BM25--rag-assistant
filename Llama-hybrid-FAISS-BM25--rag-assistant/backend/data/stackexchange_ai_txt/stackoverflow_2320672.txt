Some tips for more effective white-boarding?

I am occasionally called upon impromptu to white-board (non-virtually) data flows, architecture diagrams etc., for both a technical and non-technical audience. Unfortunately my drawing skills (and print legibility) are terrible. How can I become more effective at doing this? I am looking for tips on standard symbols and connectors to use, some standard ways of organizing and categorizing the information (e.g., swim lanes ), etc. What can I practice to become better at this? I want these visual presentations to be effective in communicating my ideas, and badly presented diagrams can make the ideas appear convoluted and inelegant, even when they are not.
