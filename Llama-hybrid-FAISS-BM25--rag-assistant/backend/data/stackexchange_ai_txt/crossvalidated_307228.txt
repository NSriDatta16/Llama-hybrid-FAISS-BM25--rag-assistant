The values obtained after MCMC is a sample from the posterior $P(\theta|D)$. You have to ensure that you draw a large enough sample so that the sample itself can be considered a population. Now assuming that the sample is indeed the population, you can do anything with it that you do with the probability density. For example, you can find out the credible-region by finding $2.5^{th}$ and $97.5^{th}$ percentile or you can compute the mean of $\theta|D$. Now, you can use this sample from posterior to estimate the probability density $P(\theta|D)$ which is usefull in constructing High Posterior Density (HPD) region. I cannot think of any other application where you will need probability values themselves. It is redundant to have both the population and its probability distribution because they provide the same information. For your doubt regarding the normalization, you can refer to the article by Chib and Greenberg: http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00031305.1995.10476177 . This article helped me understand the MCMC very well.
