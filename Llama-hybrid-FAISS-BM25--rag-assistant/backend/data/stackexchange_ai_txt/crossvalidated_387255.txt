The main issue here is that unlike other time series, incidences of fire alarms don't particularly follow a trend - or as you mentioned are not seasonal. e.g. if a toaster catches fire and sets off a fire alarm, that event is not in any way time-dependent. This seems to be more of a probability problem, i.e. what is the likelihood of an alarm going off in the future based on past occurrences? If you wanted to go the time series route, then I highly recommend obtaining explanatory variables before doing so, namely pertaining to the causes of an alarm going off. For instance, buildings typically use more electricity in winter. If this starts a fire, e.g. due to a circuit breaker malfunctioning or some similar event, then this type of event would be time-dependent to an extent since electricity usage tends to be seasonal. However, other factors that are not based on time (e.g. smoking, candles, etc) would not be time-dependent. By separating into time-dependent and time-independent causes, you can incorporate such explanatory variables to better model this time series. However, if you would like to model this as a probability (which would be my recommended approach), then I would recommend using the Poisson Distribution. In essence, you are trying to predict the probability of an event happening - this is not a forecast per se. The Poisson Distribution models the number of events in a given time period, given the mean number of occurrences. Let's take an example in R. Over the past six months, 100 alarms went off, with an average of 2 per day. This would be modeled in R as follows: #Parameters x=0:100 lambda=2 #dpois = Poisson Distribution probability = dpois(x, lambda) #Histogram plot plot(x, probability, type = "h", col="blue") The generated probabilities would give a distribution as follows: If this is not specifically a time series task, which I gather is not necessarily the case from your question, then this may be a better option for what you are trying to accomplish.
