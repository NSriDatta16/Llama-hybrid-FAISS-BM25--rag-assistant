At this point, I want to check whether the single profiles are statistically different from the averaged one. Then, I was thinking to do a test between the average profile and the single profiles. I think which test you should use will be strongly dependent on what the profiles look like, and what you think an "average profile" should even be. If the periodicity is exact, and the profiles appear to exist in different "classes", then maybe you can apply some sort of clustering algorithm (e.g. k-means) based on a distance metric (Euclidean, treating each profile as a vector -- but if high-dimensional, than maybe Manhattan norm is better?). Another possibility is to compare some summary statistic applied to the profile, instead of the data directly. For example if the profiles are "similar" visually, but have different phases or magnitudes, then you might want to compute those values as an ordered pair representation that will give more robust results when you start comparing profiles. Can you post some sample figures or data?
