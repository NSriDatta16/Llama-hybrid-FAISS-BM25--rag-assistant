Keep the fields in the table where they belong. Since SQL Server 2005 the engine got a lot smarter in regard to large data types and even variable length short data types. The old TEXT, NTEXT and IMAGE types are deprecated. The new types with MAX length are their replacement. With SQL 2005 each partition has 3 types of underlying allocation units: one for rows, one for LOBs and one for row-overflow. The MAX types are stored in the LOB allocation unit, so in effect the engine is managing for you a separate table to store large objects. The row overflow unit is for in-row variable length data that after an update would no longer fit in the page, so it is 'overflown' into a separate unit. See Table and Index Organization .
