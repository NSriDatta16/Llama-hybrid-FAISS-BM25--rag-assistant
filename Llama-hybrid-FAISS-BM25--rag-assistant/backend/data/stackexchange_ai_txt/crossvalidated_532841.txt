Compare within- and between-individuals variances with lme4?

How can I compare the variances of two random effects variables? I have an experiment with several proteins measured in individuals (ind = 4 levels) before and after a treatment (treatment = 2 levels factor), which was replicated one week after (day, 2 levels). The main goal of the replication was to measure how individual responses varied between the days, i.e., if they were similar (irrespective of treatment). I'm looking for a way to compare the variance between-subjects and within-subjects (across two days) to rank the compounds (I'm interested in higher between-ind. variance with least within-subj. variance across days). I tried some mixed models (lme4), here are two of them: The dataset is here for reproducibility: https://pastebin.com/H5VcJhcx 1. Random intercepts for individuals and day: lmm1 |t|) (Intercept) 0.002 ** treatmentinfected 8.6e-16 *** 2. Random intercepts for day + random intercepts and slopes for individuals: lmm2 |t|) (Intercept) 0.0031 ** treatmentinfected 9.8e-15 *** --- The complete dataset has more individuals, but without the second day replication. I tried both a smaller with only the balanced set (4 individuals) or with all (26 ind). I believe that for mixed effects the larger unbalanced are better, right? For some proteins, the model is singular (zero or almost zero variance for ind or for day). Would this answer my question? Can I use the ratio of variances/SD (ind/day) to select proteins with higher variation between individuals compared to across-days within the same individual? Are there more elegant/correct ways to do this? I appreciate if you have recommendations of books for learning this subject further. I'm using Gelman & Hill 2007. Thank you.
