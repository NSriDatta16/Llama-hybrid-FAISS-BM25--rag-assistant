If I understand your question correctly, what you want to know is what kind of objects in Active Directory can contain User object. I think you can get the answer from the AD schema partition. I had a quick check on my schema partition which is running Windows 2003 AD. The User object is allowed to be assigned to OU , container , builtinDomain and domainDNS . I didn't check Windows 2008 but I believe it should be the same. Many people know what OU and container are. Few people know what builtinDomain and domainDNS are. I doubt if it's useful in your case. builtinDomain is a special container used to contain the built-in account. By default, AD created a builtinDomain at CN=Builtin,DC=yourdomain,DC=com . domainDNS is your root domain path DC=yourdomain,DC=com . Here is a function to find all kinds of objects in Active Directory under a particular node . If you think builtinDomain and domainDNS is not meaningful in your case, just take it out from the LDAP filter. IEnumerable FindUserParentObject(DirectoryEntry root) { using (DirectorySearcher searcher = new DirectorySearcher(root)) { searcher.Filter = "(|(objectClass=organizationalUnit)(objectClass=container)(objectClass=builtinDomain)(objectClass=domainDNS))"; searcher.SearchScope = SearchScope.Subtree; searcher.PageSize = 1000; foreach (SearchResult result in searcher.FindAll()) { yield return result.GetDirectoryEntry(); } } }
