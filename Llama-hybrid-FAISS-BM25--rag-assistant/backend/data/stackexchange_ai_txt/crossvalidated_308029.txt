Calculate the MLEs for betas of a logistic regression

An answer to a previous question on how to manually calculate the MLE for beta coefficients from a logistic regression was given the below answer (see previous question here: How to manually calculate the intercept and coefficient in logistic regression ). Take for example, the crosstab bellow shows how many males/females are in the honor class. | female hon | male female | Total -----------+----------------------+---------- 0 | 74 77 | 151 1 | 17 32 | 49 -----------+----------------------+---------- Total | 91 109 | 200 As mentioned above $∑_iy_ix_{ij}=∑_ip_ix_{ij}$ holds. The left hand side(LHS) is the expectation of the observations (y's in samples) and the right hand side(RHS) is the model's expectation. Assuming the function is $log(\frac{p1}{p1−p})=β_0+β_1x_i$ or equivalently $p=(\frac{1}{1+e^{β0+β1*x_i}})$ ( $x_i$ represents the feature of the observation being a female, it is 1 if the observation is a female and 0 otherwise), obviously we know that the following two equations hold respectively when $X=1$ and when $X=0$ with the data shown above: $\frac{32}{109}=(\frac{1}{1+e^{β0+β1*x_1}})$ $\frac{17}{91}=(\frac{1}{1+e^{β0+β1*x_0}})$ So the intercept $(β_0)$ is -1.47 and the coefficient $(β_1)$ is 0.593. You can manually get it. I am confused as to how they jumped from $\frac{32}{109}$ to getting the estimate for $(β_1)$ . This seems like a useful way to estimate MLEs of parameters in a logistic regression. Can anyone help explain how they got to $(β_1)$ is 0.593 ?
