Best Solution be able to update database without updating Application

Thanks for taking the time to read my question. I am looking for advice on the best solution for my application. This application is basically going to be a database of objects that I would like the user to be able to search. The database is going to be constantly updated by myself, not the user, as new products are released often. I've read over a few options and began implementing this using a flat file database but realized that every update to the database would require an update to the app which is not desired. I read about using SAX Parser which seems like a possibility but wondering if there are any other viable options. Thanks in advance! -Dave
