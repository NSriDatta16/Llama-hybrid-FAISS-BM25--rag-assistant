I generally just try to follow the guidelines set by the HTML standard itself. Headings go in "h" tags (so one H1 tag for the main heading, then one or more H2 tags under that etc). Free text gets grouped in paragraphs in P tags. Logically-grouped sections of information go in DIV tags. Any kind of list (even menus that you eventually might want horizontally laid out) belong in list tags like UL, OL or DL. Tables of information go in TABLE tags. DON'T use table tags for layout. Be smart with your ID and CLASS attributes. Keep IDs unique and assign them to elements that you know represent something unique on the page, like a navigation menu or a page footer. Assign the same class to elements that are repeated but similar (which you might want to render with a similar visual style). I always start with a very plain, vertical page - just run everything I want down the page in black and white. Then I start adding CSS to make sure the bits are formatted and laid out the way I want. Take a look at the source of my home page for an example of what I'm talking about.
