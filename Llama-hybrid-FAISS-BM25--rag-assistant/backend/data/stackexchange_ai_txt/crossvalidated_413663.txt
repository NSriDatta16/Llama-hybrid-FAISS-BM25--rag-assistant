Increasing image size in pytorch celebrity generating GAN?

complete newbie here, bear with me. I'm making my way through this tutorial: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/dcgan_faces_tutorial.html Upon attempting to make a simple change to the image parameters. I want to change the size variables. I basically go and set: ngf = 120 ndf = 120 and turn image_size = 64 to image_width = 120, image_height=80, and use it here: transforms.Resize(image_height, image_width), transforms.CenterCrop(image_width), I tried several variations of course, but on the training bit of the code I get the following unhelpful error: I'm new to both pytorch and python, so can I have a more accessible explanation of how it gets those numbers and what a fix would look like? Thanks in advance!
