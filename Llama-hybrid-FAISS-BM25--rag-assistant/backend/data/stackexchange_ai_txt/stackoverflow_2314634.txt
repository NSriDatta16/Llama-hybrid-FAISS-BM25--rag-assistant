Store your result in your object. When it completes, have it drop itself into a synchronized collection (a synchronized queue comes to mind). When you wish to collect your results to submit, grab everything from the queue and read your results from the objects. You might even have each object know how to "post" it's own results to the database, this way different classes can be submitted and all handled with the exact same tiny, elegant loop. There are lots of tools in the JDK to help with this, but it is really easy once you start thinking of your thread as a true object and not just a bunch of crap around a "run" method. Once you start thinking of objects this way programming becomes much simpler and more satisfying.
