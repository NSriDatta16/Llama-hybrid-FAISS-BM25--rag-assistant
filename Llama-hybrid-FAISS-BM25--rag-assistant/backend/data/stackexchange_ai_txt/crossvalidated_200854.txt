The " mean ", " median " and " mode " are "central tendency", aka "most likely outcome" in different domains. They are all "best bets" in different "games". Probability and Statistics is a field that was, in part, built by gamblers ( link , link ) . When you go to the horse races, or the poker table, you want to know some science that helps you win. They did too, and wrote about it, so you don't have to invent it yourself. In a horse race, you want to pick a winner. You don't have future information, but you do know some past information. You know how fast each horse ran in the past few races. If you want to make an estimate of how fast they are likely to run in their next race, you can compute and compare the mean, aka the average, race-times. Another central tendency is the "median" - which is the center of a sorted list. What if I put a horrible typo on your list of race times, and the value was 1000x longer than all the others. It would mess up your estimate. You might not bet on the winning horse. How do you address that? You could manually look for that one value, or you might use the "median". What if you are playing cards, like " blackjack ", and you are trying to figure out if you need another card given the previous cards. The card you are looking for is not a 3.14 because cards numbers are integer values. How do you figure out what your best bet is when "average" or median is not meaningful? In this case, you want to bet on the "mode" - the most likely card to come out of the dealers stack. In all three cases, the central tendency is just another way of saying "best bet". If you want to account not only for central tendency in your betting, that is to say if you want to bet so that you are able to reduce the impacts of a loss while maximizing winnings, then you must look at "tendencies of variation". Things like standard deviation, inter-quantile-ranges, or alternative modes and their frequencies, are all used to minimize the maximum losses while maximizing the likely winnings.
