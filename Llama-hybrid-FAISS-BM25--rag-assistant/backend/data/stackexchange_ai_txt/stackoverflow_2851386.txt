What's the best way to transition to MVC coding?

It's been around 5 months since I picked up a PHP book and started coding in PHP. At first, I created all my sites without any organizational plan or MVC. I soon found out that was a pain.. Then I started to read on stackoverflow on how to separate php and html and that's what I have been doing ever since. Ex: profile.php This is how I have been separating all my coding so far and now I feel I should move on and start MVC. But the problem is, I never used classes before and suck with them. And since MVC (such as cakephp and codeigniter) is all classes, that can't be good. My question: Is there any good books/sites/articles that teaches you how to code in MVC? I am looking for beginner beginner books :) I just started reading the codeigniter manuel and I think I am going to use that. EDIT: Is it possible to have a MVC organization structure to your coding without using cake, codeigniter, etc? Basically just separate say profile.php into 3 different files(the view, controller, model)
