Automatically categorize parts of a piece of writing

Suppose I had a piece of writing. The document contains aspects like questions, assertions, examples, and explanations. Is it possible to use Natural Language Processing to categorize each sentence of the writing into such aspects, thus creating a code like 1.1:assertion, 1.2:explanation, for instance, meaning paragraph 1, sentence 1 assertion, and paragraph 1, sentence 2, explanation? If that is possible, I would appreciate if someone would share their knowledge about known algorithms for performing this task.
