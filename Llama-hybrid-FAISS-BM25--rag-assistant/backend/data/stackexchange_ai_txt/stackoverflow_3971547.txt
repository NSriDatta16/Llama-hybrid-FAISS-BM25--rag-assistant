James's answer caught the most obvious error. But there is a subtler (and IMO more instructive) issue, in that floating point values should not be compared for (un)equality. That loop is prone to problems, use just a integer value and compute the double value inside the loop; or, less elegant, give yourself some margin: for(double i = 0; i Edit: the original comparison happens to work ok, because 0.25=1/4 is a power of 2. In any other case, it might not be exactly representable as a floating point number. An example of the (potential) problem: for(double i = 0; i prints 11 values: 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.30000000000000004 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.7999999999999999 0.8999999999999999 0.9999999999999999
