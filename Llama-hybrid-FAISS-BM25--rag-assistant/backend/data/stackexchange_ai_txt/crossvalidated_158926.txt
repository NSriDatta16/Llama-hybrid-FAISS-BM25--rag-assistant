I want to generate outliers in binary logistic model

I want to generate outliers in binary logistic model What I want is: to select 3 elements of 10 elements that are randomly generated, and: if the selected value is 1 convert it to zero & if the selected value is 0 convert it to 1 and display the new y with 10 elements including the changed and the unchanged values I searched through r and I was able to write the following code to generate y-outliers: Y 0.5) Y[toreplace] but this code displays only the 3 changed elements, besides it change 0 to 1 only; I want to change both: from 0 to 1 and from 1 to 0. I also want correct code to change x-values in logistic regression to to obtain good leverage points and bad leverage points any help, please
