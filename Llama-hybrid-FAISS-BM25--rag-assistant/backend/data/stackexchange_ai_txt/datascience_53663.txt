Get how similarity between the training data and the income data?

I'am trying to use Clustering and Classification methods as SVM using scikitlearn. I'm also studying some outliers/novelty detections I want something like a semi-supervised model. I want to predict some class labels, however, I cant training my model with some anomalies/new behaviors that are going to happen eventually. I'm working with motors vibration, I'll train my model with the vibration when they are "ON" and the vibration when they are "OFF". With the time the vibration of the "ON" state will start to become slightly different because of some defects, however if I just train with "ON" and "OFF" for sure it'll continue to identify that my motor is "ON" because the vibration with defects are more close to the model "ON". Therefore I would like to identify how far is my new data from the data that I have already trained my model. For example, 1 - My predict_prob returns ON because has $98$ % of chance to be ON and $2$ % to be OFF. So far so good, however my DATA is slightly different from the ON mode in the training data, so I would like to measure this difference, like it has $98$ % probability to be ON between ON and OFF and it is $95$ % similar to the original model, so with the time this number ll be reduced. For example: 1 day: $98$ % to be ON $2$ % to be OFF and $95$ % similar to the training data 2 day: $98$ % to be ON $2$ % to be OFF and $93$ % similar to the training data 3 day: $99$ % to be ON $1$ % to be OFF and $90$ % similar to the training data 4 day: $95$ % to be ON $5$ % to be OFF and $85$ % similar to the training data Can someone help me with this part " and $85$ % similar to the training data "?
