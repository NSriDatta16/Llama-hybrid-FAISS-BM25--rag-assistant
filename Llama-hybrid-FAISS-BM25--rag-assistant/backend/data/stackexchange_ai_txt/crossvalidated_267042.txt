You can find more information from Shumway & Stoffer's Time Series Analysis and Its Applications With R Examples . I provide answer to your question with references directly from their Chapter 2. The authors define their AIC with the formula below: Definition 2.1 Akaikeâ€™s Information Criterion (AIC) $$ AIC = log\ \hat{\sigma}_k + \frac{n + 2k}{n} $$ where $\hat{\sigma}_k $ is $\frac{SSE_k}{n}$ and $k$ is the number of parameters in the model. However, this calculation of AIC is different from R's lm . In your example, the AIC with the value of -802.85 is from R, whereas the AIC of -7.684481 is derived from R's results with additional adjustment to fit Definition 2.1. On page 56 of Shumway & Stoffer, they provide how their AIC can be derived: The easiest way to extract AIC and BIC from an lm() run in R is to use the command AIC(). Our definitions differ from R by terms that do not change from model to model. In the example, we show how to obtain (2.19) and (2.21) from the R output. It is more difficult to obtain AICc. num = length(cmort) # sample size AIC(fit)/num - log(2*pi) # AIC In your case, $$ \frac{-802.85}{\text{Sample Size}} - log(2\pi) $$ or the code below AIC(sarima(data,0,0,1,0,1,1, 12)$fit)/length(data) - log(2*pi) should return the value of -7.684481. I have experimented the two AICs with a different dataset and was able to get somewhat close (but not exact) results. But this is what the authors have said about the two values.
