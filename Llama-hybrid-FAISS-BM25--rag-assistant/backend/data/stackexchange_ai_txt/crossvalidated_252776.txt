activation functions of elman recurrent neural network

From the Book"fundamentals of neural network", the input layer of a feedforward neural network has linear activation function. Elman recurrent NN is the same as a feedforward except that it has context layer. What should be the activation functions of each layer in an elman recurrent NN? I have searched for this answer from many sources but many journal papers do not mention about the activation functions. Some information online says that the hidden layers should have tansig activation function. So, What should be the activation functions of each layer in an elman recurrent NN?
