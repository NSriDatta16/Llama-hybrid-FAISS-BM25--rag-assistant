I don't see the "Access to 4G speed" thing in the first place when I go to that page. The two most likely culprits for this difference are cookies and your user-agent. You can specify cookies manually using both curl or wget . Dump out your cookies from Firefox using whatever plugins you want, or just javascript:prompt('',document.cookie); in your location bar Then stick read through the man pages for wget or curl and see how to include that cookie. EDIT : It appears to be what I thought, a missing cookie. curl --cookie "INSERT THE COOKIE YOU GOT HERE" http://shop.sprint.com/NASApp/onlinestore/en/Action/DisplayPhones?INTNAV=ATG:HE:Phones | grep "Access to 4G" As stated above, you can grab whatever you cookie is from above: javascript:prompt('',document.cookie) then copy the default text that comes up. Make sure you're on the sprint page when you stick that in the location bar (otherwise you'll end up with the wrong website's cookie) EDIT 2 The reason your browser cookie and your shell cookie were different was the different in interaction that took place. The reason I didn't see the Access to 4G speed thing you were talking about in the first place was that I hadn't entered my zip code. If you want to have a constantly relevant cookie, you can force curl to do whatever is required to obtain that cookie, in this case, entering a zip code. In curl, you can do this with multiple requests and holding the retrieved cookies in a cookie jar: [stackoverflow] curl --help | grep cookie -b/--cookie Cookie string or file to read cookies from (H) -c/--cookie-jar Write cookies to this file after operation (H) -j/--junk-session-cookies Ignore session cookies read from file (H) So simply specify a cookie jar, send the request to send the zipcode, then work away.
