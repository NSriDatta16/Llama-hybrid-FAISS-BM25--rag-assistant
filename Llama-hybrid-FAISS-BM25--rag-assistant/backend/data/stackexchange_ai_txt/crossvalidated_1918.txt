I'm not sure you need simulation for a simple regression model. For example, see the paper Portable Power , by Robert E. Wheeler (Technometrics , May, 1974, Vol. 16, No. 2). For more complex models, specifically mixed effects, the pamm package in R performs power analyses through simulations. Also see Todd Jobe's post which has R code for simulation.
