Advice for implementing simple regex (for bbcode/geshi parsing)

I had made a personal note software in PHP so I can store and organize my notes and wished for a nice simple format to write them in. I had done it in Markdown but found it was a little confusing and there was no simple syntax highlighting, so I did bbcode before and wished to implement that. Now for GeSHi which I really wish to implement (the syntax highlighter), it requires the most simple code like this: $geshi = new GeSHi($sourcecode, $language); $geshi->parse_code(); Now this is the easy part , but what I wish to do is allow my bbcode to call it. My current regular expression to match a made up [syntax=cpp][/syntax] bbcode is the following: preg_replace('#\[syntax=(.*?)\](.*?)\[/syntax\]#si' , 'geshi(\\2,\\1)????', text); You will notice I capture the language and the content, how on earth would I connect it to the GeSHi code? preg_replace seems to just be able to replace it with a string not an 'expression', I am not sure how to use those two lines of code for GeSHi up there with the captured data.. I really am excited about this project and wish to overcome this.
