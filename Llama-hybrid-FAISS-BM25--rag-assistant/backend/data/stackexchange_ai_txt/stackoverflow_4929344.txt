What is your method of working with a single CSS file in a large team and version control

We work on the Magento platform and our front-end developers all work on the same CSS stylesheet. There are a lot of existing styles that come with this stylesheet. Most of the time I tell them to put any additional styles at the bottom to make it easier for merging and everything. This doesn't always work when you want put certain styles with selectors that are already existing in the stylesheet. We seem to be having a lot of issues with developers not managing conflicts correctly and overriding other peoples code. Obviously its always best to try and work on files when you know others are done with it to lessen the chance of conflicts but obviously if there is more then one developer working on a site and there is only one CSS file this is going to run into a lot of conflicts. I am looking for ways other people manage this and some ideas for how to best minimize the amount of conflicts these developers have.
