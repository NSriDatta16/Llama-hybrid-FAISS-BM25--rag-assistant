I ran into this problem on older versions of IE. It was never reproducible in a test harness and left no trace in server logs, but consistently affected a very small percentage of IE 6 loads. The solution was to have the embedding HTML file double check that the JS was loaded. foo.js: // do all the real work. // As the last statement, set a variable indicating completion. foo_js_fully_loaded = true; foo.html: if (!foo_js_fully_loaded) { /* reload the page */ }
