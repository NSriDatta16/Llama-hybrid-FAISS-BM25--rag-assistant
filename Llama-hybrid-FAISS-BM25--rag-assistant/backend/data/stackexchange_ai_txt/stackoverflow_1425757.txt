You need to use (and include) JQuery UI to use the $('#something').draggable() and $('#something').droppable() functions. You can make as much items as you want draggable or droppable and create different functions for each one. Its pretty easy to work with. This is the best example with the most functionality: http://jqueryui.com/demos/droppable/#photo-manager
