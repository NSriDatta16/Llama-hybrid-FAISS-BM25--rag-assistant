Just to start, a quick thought. Random Forest can run in parallel and they are much faster to train, Boosting is an iterative algorithm instead. However, Boosting might converge early iteration-wise. Boosting might overfit when there are many noisy features but Random Forest also does. On the other hand, their target is almost similar: produce many different weak learners as much different as possible from each others. Random Forests tackle the problem with randomization and Boosting focuses on mis-classified examples of previous models to build a different one.
