Machine Learning in Paper making machines

The company I work for produces packaging paper on a mass scale; my task is to see if machine learning would be able to help identify paper breaks on the machines before they actually happen. We have sensors and high speed camera systems on the machine for real-time analysis. I do not know which machine learning algorithms would be applicable for this problem? In the paper making process, a continuous sheet of paper is formed and fed through a series of machines. If the paper breaks, the process must be restarted. We have machines for detecting a paper break after one has already occurred, but my goal is to use machine learning to detect a break before it happens. Could an algorithm be created that could constantly analyze many different points on the machine and based on that data be able to predict a sheet break or not?
