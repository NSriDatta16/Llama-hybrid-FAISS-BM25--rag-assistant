C#: What technic is that code?

I would like to know: What technic is that code? Can you rewrite that code to make it more readable, because I do not completely understand its meaning. Paragraph para = CaretPosition.Paragraph; var matchedRun = para.Inlines.FirstOrDefault(inline => { Run run = inline as Run; return (run != null && run.Text.EndsWith(inputText)); }) as Run; if (matchedRun != null) { }
