Ok, assuming left justification only, a very basic approach would be this: You introduce two indices lineStart/lineEnd which mark the start and end of a possible text line in your input string. You then loop over all words in the input string, and for each word you check if it could be added to the current line without exceeding the rectangle width. If yes, increase lineEnd accordingly. If not, add the current fragment [lineStart..lineEnd] to the result, then reset lineStart/lineEnd to the start of the current word (which will be the first word on the next line). There are a couple of border cases to consider, including (but likely not limited to) the possibility that a single word may be wider than the rectangle's width; and the very last line probably needs explicit handling as well.
