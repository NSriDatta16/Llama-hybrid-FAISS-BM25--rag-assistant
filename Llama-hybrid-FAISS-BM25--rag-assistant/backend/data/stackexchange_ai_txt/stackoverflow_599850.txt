To learn vi(m) fast one must first understand the whole design. Vim has a great set of cursor-movement commands, check a few (X is a character, # a digit): j k enter arrows 0 $ w W b B ctrolD crtolU ctrolE ctrolY H M L fX FX tX TX , ; % gg G n N mX 'X '' and many more it would be boring to enumerate. Many of these support a count before the command, like 4j to move 4 lines up. Now, back to the design, you type a command like d for delete followed by a cursor movement and the command applies to the piece of text from the cursor position till the movement end. For example H moves to the top of the screen, dH deletes to the top of the screen and cH changes (replaces) to the top of the screen. This design is quite powerful. It also reduces, or organizes, what you need to learn. Definitively the first step is to learn a few cursor movement commands. Say,8 or 10 at first. Then you are almost done.
