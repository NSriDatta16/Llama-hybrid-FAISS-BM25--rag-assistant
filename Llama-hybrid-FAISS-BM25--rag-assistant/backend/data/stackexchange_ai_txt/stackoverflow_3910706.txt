Found one solution: delete the scalar property 'ProductId' from the feature entity: http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/adodotnetentityframework/thread/a71901fb-97ec-4072-949a-c0c66a9775b1 However, in the auto-generated relationships that EF gives you if you set up the foreign key in the database, the eg 'ParentId' fields are present in the child as a scalar field. So i'm a little confused still. -edit- Further help: http://www.hanselman.com/blog/CreatingAnODataAPIForStackOverflowIncludingXMLAndJSONIn30Minutes.aspx
