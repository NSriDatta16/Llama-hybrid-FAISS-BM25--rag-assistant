AUC - Logistic Regression versus LDA, and Naive Bayes

everyone! I am a newbie on machine learning, and I am now interested on classification modeling. I used logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and naive Bayes on my notebook DataCamp Certification - Travel Insurance as a tool to exploratory data analysis. A thing that caught my attention is the difference between AUC of the three models, more specific between logistic regression and the other tow techniques. I use the Yardstick to calculate this measure. Well, I am trying to apply this same strategy on Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster . When I model on my notebook the data with logistic regression, I was surprised by a AUC very low (0.1464) despite my score of 0.7584 on the competition. It is important to say that some terms on the first notebook show a low p.value. Differently, the second notebook, all terms show p.value So, I would like to understand this situation because it is worries me a lot! Thank you all for your time!
