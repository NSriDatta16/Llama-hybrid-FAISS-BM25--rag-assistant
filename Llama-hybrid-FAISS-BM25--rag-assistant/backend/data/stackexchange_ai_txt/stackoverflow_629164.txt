The C standard (1999 version, ยง6.7.2.1, page 102, point 10) says this: An implementation may allocate any addressable storage unit large enough to hold a bit-field. If enough space remains, a bit-field that immediately follows another bit-field in a structure shall be packed into adjacent bits of the same unit. There does not seem to be any wording to allow the packing to be affected by the types of the fields. Thus I would conclude that this is a compiler bug. gcc makes a 4 byte struct in either case, on both a 32-bit and a 64-bit machine, under Linux. I don't have VS and can't test that.
