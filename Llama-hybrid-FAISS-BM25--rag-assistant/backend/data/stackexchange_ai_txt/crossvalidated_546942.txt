Similar questions have been asked and given fairly comprehensive answers here and here . A few comments: The main keywords you will want to look for are i) 'Hierarchical Modeling' and ii) 'Panel Modeling'. Panel modeling is concerned with modeling multiple time series at once. Hierarchical modeling makes use that some products belong to the same category. If you have a large number of products, it may make sense to engineer the promotional features. For example, instead of having 1 column per product, maybe try columns like: Is this product on Sale? How many other products are on sale? Are products from the same category on sale?
