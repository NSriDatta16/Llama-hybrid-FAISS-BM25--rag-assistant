I can think of a few different ways to do this: Use the Referer header. However, while this is the simplest way to identify the source of a request, it's probably the least dependable since the referer field can be easily spoofed and may not even be sent by the user-agent. Have the two forms submit to two slightly different URL patterns both of which map to the controller servlet in question which would allow it to differentiate between the two. Use a hidden field in each form that will uniquely identify it.
