Need a predictive (binary outcome) model for a set of binary variables and one continuous variable

I have a data set of about 1600 binary results, that I want to predict from 9 binary variables and a continuous variable. The relationship between the continuous variable and the result variable by itself isn't linear - most of the true results are for intermediate values of the continuous variable. I've tried a logistic regression for the binary variables, but I don't know how to create a model that includes the other variable. My sense is this continuous variable is the strongest predictor, but (at least some) of the other variables are predictive as well. I am familiar with R, but I need a model that is fairly easy to implement outside of R, which is why regression appealed to me.
