Showing prediction output in Keras

I am doing a image classification with CNN using Keras. The training process was so far so good. But when it comes to the prediction, I couldn't figure out to extract correct prediction results out of numpy array from predict(x). It is binary classification task but I used softmax layer at the end purposefully. The original labels should look like this: [0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0] But I have this from predict: [[ 1.00000000e+00 0.00000000e+00] [ 1.00000000e+00 1.13929331e-32] [ 1.00000000e+00 0.00000000e+00] [ 1.00000000e+00 1.51848069e-28] [ 1.00000000e+00 3.70465143e-38] [ 1.00000000e+00 5.44319748e-37] [ 1.00000000e+00 0.00000000e+00] [ 1.00000000e+00 0.00000000e+00]] Apparently, there is a pattern in the output with ones and super small numbers that resembles the real labels although these small numbers should be greater than the ones before them. How can I transform it to look like the original one.
