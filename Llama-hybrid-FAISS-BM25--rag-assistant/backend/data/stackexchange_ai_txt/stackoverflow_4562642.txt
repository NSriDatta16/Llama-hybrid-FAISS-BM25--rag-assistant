The glib answer is you're going wrong by supporting IE6.... Response.Clear only clears content from the response, use Response.ClearHeaders instead. Other than that, you might want to look at using Response.Buffer & Response.Flush and explicitly setting Response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.NoCache); Personally I might want to add content length and charset to my headers as the more info the browser has to work with the better. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.httpresponse.aspx
