spatio-temporal density analysis of point patterns with lgcp

I am trying to use the R package lgcp to estimate density based on a point pattern over time. I follow the example given by the authors of the package in this article , but even the first step (copied from page 25 in the article) fails. My data is available here bad-sample.RData (21 kb) and it consists of two objects: xyt and my.weights (both used in the function call below). and the failing code is this: library(lgcp) load("bad-sample.RData") minc The error message is: [Univariate spatio-temporal minimum contrast] Spatial: Time-averaged PCF estimation... |============================================| 100% Spatial: Starting values are (0.07, 4.04); optimising exponential correlation function...Error in optim(par = spatial.startvals, fn = g.diff.single, ghat = nonpar$iso[-1], : function cannot be evaluated at initial parameters In addition: Warning message: In CovarianceFct(useq, model = model, param = c(mean = NA, variance = ps[2], : The function is obsolete. Use 'RFcov' instead The error message: "function cannot be evaluated at initial parameters", made me try different samples, but I get the same error with other samples too. Have someone here at CrossValidated used lgcp successfully for spatio-temporal analysis of point patterns? Do you, or anyone else, have any advice on what I could try to overcome the problem above?
