Help me about using ARIMA forecasting rainfall

I am currently using the ARIMA provided in R. I use the data as the rainfall time series in QuyNhon (Vietnam) from 2000 to 2017 to forecast rainfall for the next several years. I wish that the professor could answer for me if I have used the ARIMA model to accurately predict. If the model is wrong, I hope professor can help me rewrite the R code to forecast rainfall more accurately. I hope that the professor gives me a 95% confidence interval that is correct for rain forecast. And how to use ggplot () to represent this confidence interval. Link data and code rainfall: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1MmFeWoUSfXrGNbsL4SiK28FoMAby0gwD Once again, I thank you very much. I am looking forward to hearing from you soon.
