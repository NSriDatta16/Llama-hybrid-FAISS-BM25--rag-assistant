Possibility of dragging more than one element on a webpage with jQuery

I create a web application with HTML5, CSS3 and jQuery, jQuery UI and jQuery Mobile. Now I have a little example (example: http://jsbin.com/ayoba4/2 ) Drag Test $(document).ready(function() { $(".draggable").draggable(); }); So I have two images which should be draggable. Now I test this on my iPad and only one image at once is draggable. But the iPad should support up to 11 fingers, so why isn't it possible and what can I do to solve this problem? Or does it work with your multitouch devices (iPhone, iPad, mobile phones with Android, or multitouch display) and I do something wrong (settings) -> http://jsbin.com/ayoba4/2 ? Thank you in advance & Best Regards.
