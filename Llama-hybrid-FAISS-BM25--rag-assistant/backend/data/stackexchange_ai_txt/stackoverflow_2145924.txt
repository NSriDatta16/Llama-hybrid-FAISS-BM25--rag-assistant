AssociatedObject.FindName in Silverlight behavior OnAttached method returns null

I'm making a Silverlight behavior to enable dragging an element by a contained "drag handle" element (rather than the whole element being draggable). Think of it like a window title bar. In the OnAttached method I am calling: AssociatedObject.FindName(DragHandle) but this is returning null. I then tried handling the AssociatedObject's Loaded event and running my code there, but I still get a null returned. Am I misunderstanding what FindName is able to do? The AssociatedObject is in an ItemsControl (I want a collection of draggable elements). So is there some kind of namescope problem?
