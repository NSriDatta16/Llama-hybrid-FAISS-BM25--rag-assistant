Is there any point in having layers in a neural network for regression problems?

In my textbook I read that an MLP and linear activation functions for the hidden layers can be reduced to a simple input-output system, i.e. no hidden layers. This makes sense to me. Later on I read that for regression problems, the linear activation function is commonly used (along with MSE loss function). How does this work together? Is it reasonable to say that no layers are ever needed if using an MLP to solve a regression problem, or is any of the statements wrong (or compatible)?
