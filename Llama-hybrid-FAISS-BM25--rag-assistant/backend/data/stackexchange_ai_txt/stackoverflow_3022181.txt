See the mySQL manual on String Types . Varchar (String): Values in VARCHAR columns are variable-length strings. The length can be specified as a value from 0 to 255 before MySQL 5.0.3, and 0 to 65,535 in 5.0.3 and later versions. The effective maximum length of a VARCHAR in MySQL 5.0.3 and later is subject to the maximum row size (65,535 bytes, which is shared among all columns) and the character set used. Text: See storage requirements If you want a fixed size text field, use CHAR which can be 255 characters in length maximum. VARCHAR and TEXT both have variable length.
