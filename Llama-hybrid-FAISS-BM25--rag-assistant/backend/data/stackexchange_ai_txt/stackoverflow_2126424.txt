TComponet / any other Superclass and its child item detection

I have Popup menu control on form ( grr, I most likely gonna make it dynamic - hate static tools ). It has got Item with SubMenu. SubMenu has three Menu Items ( TMenuItem class ). I need to check by taking Sender param in if..then statement whenever procedure has been called by the Item with SubMenu or by SubMenu Items. I tried different vraiations with typecasting and superclass operations but no luck. I think it is possible to something like this: if FindControl(MenuItemWithSubMenu.Handle) = TControl(Sender as TComponent).Parent then ... but, of course, with correct typecasting and commands .. Any ideas appreciated. Additional Information by community request: The code itsef ( if I simply check by component name prop ) looks like this: procedure TForm1.xClick(Sender: TObject); // procedure that has attached onClick from PopupActionBar1 Items begin if ((TComponent(Sender).Name = 'Unloadresources1') or // PopupActionBar1.Items[3] (TComponent(Sender).Name = 'VKPCache11') or // PopupActionBar1.Items[3].Items[0] (TComponent(Sender).Name = 'VKPCache21') or // PopupActionBar1.Items[3].Items[1] (TComponent(Sender).Name = 'AllCache31') or // PopupActionBar1.Items[3].Items[2] (ActLoadVal = 2)) and (PopupActionBar1.Items[3].Caption = 'Delete VKP Cache') then begin .. end; end; The problem is that it is way to weak approach and needs additional coding if programm user wants to add / drag'n'drop / insert component or control or object in runetime. In this way programm itself would automatically do hald job in my place - know what to call and when :) On ( static ) Form1 is ( static ) PopupActionBar1. It has four Items. Forth Item has SubMenu - with three Items. Both fourth item with submenu items ( PopupActionBar1.Items[3] ) and three submenu items ( PopupActionBar1.Items[3].Items[0 .. 2] OnClick event handlers are set to Procedure containing If..Then statement wrote above. Task - by eveluating Sender parameter and using its OOP capabilities - check if Procedure has been called from PopupActionBar1.Items[3] Menu Item or its SubMenu items ( PopupActionBar1.Items[3].Items[0] or PopupActionBar1.Items[3].Items[1] or PopupActionBar1.Items[3].Items[2] ). I have tried various syntax ... also tried typecasting manipulations with TControl, TWinControl, TComponent .. ( no use of TObject is it has got no Parent ( excl. OLE ) ..
