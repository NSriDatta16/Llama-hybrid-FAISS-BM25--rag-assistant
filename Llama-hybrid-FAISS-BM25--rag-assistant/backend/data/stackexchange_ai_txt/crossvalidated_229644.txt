For general information on meta-analysis (MA) you could look at the tag-info . I have not read the sources it quotes so cannot recommend one over another. The basic MA paradigm is that from each study (on drug A) you extract the statistic you wish to summarise $y_i$ and its variance $v_i$. You then form a weighted average using $w_i=\frac{1}{v_i}$. In your case there is a complication that the proportions take the role of the $y_i$ and they are supposed to be normally distrbuted which they clearly are not. The answer is to transform them first. At this point I strongly recommend choosing a software system to do all this. MA is certainly available in R (which I use), see the CRAN Task View for more details I use metafor but meta also does this, available in Stata (search for Stata metaprop) and in various stand-alone packages. It is possible to program it in SAS but I have no idea how. I have never seen anyone do it in SPSS but it may be possible. When you have done that you will have an estimate from each set of studies on drug A and on drug B so you can proceed to compute the probability of their simultaneous occurrence conditional on their being independent.
