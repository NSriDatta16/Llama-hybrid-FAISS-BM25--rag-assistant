Why not backtest them against a benchmark (e.g. for US stocks, how did it compare to the S&P500 in terms of risk/return)? If the indicator requires past data like moving averages, or has numeric terms, just make sure you're only calculating on previous data using a rolling window function to avoid 'data snooping'. Simplest way is to use a software package like R (or excel for simpler things) and have a dummy variable in your data that equals 1 for a long position, 0 for no position and -1 for a short position. Then you can run calculations like sum, mean and standard deviation on the log returns of the actual asset multiplied by this dummy variable; and compare it against your benchmark. If it 'beats the market', its worth investigating further while paying close attention to transaction costs/market depth (if there is very little liquidity at the historical price point, you would likely have gotten a much worse price as your trade would have affected the market price adversely).
