Logistic Regression - Only Dummy Variables

I'm working on a problem where all my variables are dummy variables (i.e. I have 5 dummy variables and a binary dependent variable). I'm exploring how each variable affects my dependent variable. My dataset is from a questionnaire with a sample size of around 2000. All the responses are either yes (= 1) or no (= 0). Therefore, I'm only able to use dummy variables for both my dependent and independent variables. I came across the logistic regression and this model seems to fit my dataset (my data has independence of observations, my data does not follow a normal distribution and the dependent variable is mutually exclusive). However, I do have a concern with regard to the fact that I do not have any continuous variables and I have yet to come across an example of a logistic regression where all the variables are dummies. Is a logistic regression model appropriate for my data? Thank you!
