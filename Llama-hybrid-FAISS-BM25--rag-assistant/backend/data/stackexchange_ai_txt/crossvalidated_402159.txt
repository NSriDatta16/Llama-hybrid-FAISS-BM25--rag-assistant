Ordinal regression or multiple regression?

I'm using STATA and this page to find a proper test, but I'm not sure which is better fitting, an ordered logistic regression or multiple regression? My dependent variable is life quality (ordinal from bad to good) and my independent variables vary in type such as age, pain, depression etc. What would be the best way?
