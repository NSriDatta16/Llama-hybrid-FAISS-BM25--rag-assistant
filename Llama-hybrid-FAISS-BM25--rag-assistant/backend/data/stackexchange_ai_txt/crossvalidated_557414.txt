We really could need some more information, for instance, what does $Y$ represent, and how do you do the simulations producing $X$ ? The answer by @Nuclear Hoagie: assumes the simulations give a true predictive distribution for $Y$ , if that is so (and you assumed squared error for the prediction) the mean of the $X$ 's is the correct answer. But if not (and how can you know?), maybe try something else. One idea is to bin $X$ and make histogram counts, then use the bin counts as predictors. Another, probably better, is to compute various descriptors from $X$ , maybe mean, median, some quantiles, ... and use those as predictors. The problem looks somewhat similar to abc (approximate bayesian computation) so maybe have a look ABC. How can it avoid the likelihood function? or ABC with Lotka-Volterra (or any dynamical system) .
