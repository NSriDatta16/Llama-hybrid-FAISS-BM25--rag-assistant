How to reach continue training in xgboost

I read the paper but found nothing talking about how to implement incremental learning. Can someone share some basic or deep knowledge? not in coding way. I know how to write code snippet to train incrementally. When new data comes in, how to train incrementally if I use XGBRegressor? Reserve the old trees and train new data with new trees? I found nothing talking about this in detail
