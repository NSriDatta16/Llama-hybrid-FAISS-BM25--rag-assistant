I would disagree that the SQL is similar. The SQL SYNTAX is similar (to the lowest common denominator of ANSI) for basic CRUD development. But actually building packages, writing multi-table / multi step joins, bulk updates and inserts, use of the rich and powerful Oracle feature set is very different from SQL Server. This takes a different mindset and can take many years to master. However... The purpose of the CV / resume is to get an interview. Work with your agent to highlight your best TALENTS and BEHAVIOUR'S, not purely skills. Skill's can be learnt and taught. A talent for, and the demonstration of, learning new skills in new environments is gold dust for an employer. Don't try to blag it. Don't lie. You'll be found out. Use your experience gained from SQL Server to demonstrate that you can solve the problem. Show eagerness to learn, train and graft. But, if they really want a "parachute in and start running Oracle programmer", then your stuffed!
