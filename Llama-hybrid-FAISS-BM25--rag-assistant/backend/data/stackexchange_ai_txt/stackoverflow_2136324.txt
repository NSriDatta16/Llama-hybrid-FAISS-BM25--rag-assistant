has_many with multi-level hierarchy and single table inheritance

In my Rails app I have a multi-level hierarchy of the following kind: class Vehicle Then I have a class referencing the middle level like so: class Garage In this simplified example, I have given the vehicles table a type column to enable single table inheritance. Additionally, it contains a garage_id column, to enable the has_many relationship. When I create a new garage and add cars and busses, all get added to the database as expected. However, when I later retrieve the garage object and inspect the road_vehicles collection, it is empty. Can anyone tell me what I'm doing wrong?
