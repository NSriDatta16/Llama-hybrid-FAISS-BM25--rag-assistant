Machine Learning Models for predicting probability

I have a dataset where the dependent variable is a success probability ranging from 0 to 1. I cannot use the regular linear regression to model because linear regression does not restrict the output range. One idea I come up with is using logit function to map it into real number sets, but I do not know whether it is accurate. Does anyone have any idea about this? Thank you!
