To understand the limitation of these data one must understand the structure of NHANES . In the 2007-2010 cycle NHANES included two 24-hour dietary recalls as part of the interview process. Children's intakes might be co-reported by a proxy/caretaker. The dietary recalls served to just show on a typical day how Americans eat, it's not meant to be a long-term food preference survey. If 1 out of 8 Americans will eat pizza today, does that mean that the average American will eat pizza once every 8 days? There's an assumption here that every American eats pizza, which is not the case I don't see this assumption being necessary. It can easity be dispelled if you swap in something that is less modifiable. For instance: 1 out of 2 Americans is male. Apparently we don't need to shapeshift between male and female every other day. however, that raises the question of how to make a valid assumption of how many Americans eat pizza. I agree, as I have described above NHANES is not meant to report preference. At best we can just assume that today, our best guess is that 1 out of 8 Americans would be consuming pizza. It is reported that 25% of a child's caloric intake is pizza. I'll define a child as a 9 year old who is moderately active and therefore needs a 2000 calorie daily intake. If we trust Google's estimate that the number of calories in a pizza slice is 285, then does that suggest that a child consumes 12 slices of pizza per week on average? (2000 * 7 * 0.25 / 285) I don't think if I understand your concern, but please read the original release here . On page 3, it says that the 25% energy contribution only applies to children who had had pizza on the sampled day. For general US children population, the total energy contribution of pizza drops to 4%. So, if some children have pizza on a given day and if their total daily calories end up being 2000 kcal, then the pizza would likely contribute around 25% of it. According to your pizza calorie number (285 kcal/slice), the children usually consume about two slices. Also notice that the 2000 kcal I quoted here is the observed total calories, not "required calories" as you pointed out. From the report, I don't think they use any dietary guidelines (aka ideal amounts of nutrients and energy) as their denominator.
