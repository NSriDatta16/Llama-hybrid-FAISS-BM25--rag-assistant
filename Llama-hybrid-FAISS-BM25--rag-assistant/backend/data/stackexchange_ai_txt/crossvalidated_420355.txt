How to plot estimate + raw data of a Bayesian zero inflated poisson?

GENERAL QUESTION: How to back-transform estimates from a zero-inflated poisson to obtain the original scale in R? (I tried exponential like for poisson but the results are wrong) DETAILED REPRODUCIBLE EXAMPLE: To be able to modify the plot at will I want reproduce the plot obtained with: plot(marginal_effects(MODEL_NAME), points=T) As an example I used the data from https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/r/dae/zip/ https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/stat/data/fish.csv deleting a couple of extreme points for aesthetically plot purposes: fish $camper camper) fish I ran the following ZERO-INFLATED model mod_pois_zero = brms::brm(count ~ child + camper +(1| persons), control = list(adapt_delta = 0.999, max_treedepth = 12), iter = 6000, cores = 4, data = fish, family = “zero_inflated_poisson”, file=“mod_pois”) I wrote the following script to plot estimate and raw data as for marginal_effects: #extract posterior samples d $lower upper $count ~fish$ child, xlab =("b"), ylab = ("a")) lines(newdat $b_child, newdat$ fit, lwd=2) lines(newdat $b_child, newdat$ lower) lines(newdat $b_child, newdat$ upper) the script works fine for norm and poisson models but the estimates with zero_inflated are different from the ones calculated from the automatic plotting of the package (see figures). plot_brms my_plot How can I back-transform zero inflated models? clearly exp() is not enough. Where can I find this information for the rest of the link functions ( e.g. skew normal, etc.)? On a different note, the default plot plot(marginal_effects(MODEL), points=T) always cut the extreme points, any idea why? Also if someone has a better strategy to plot raw data and estimates from brms I would be glad to know. Online I could not find any example that I was able to reproduce. Thanks and best regards
