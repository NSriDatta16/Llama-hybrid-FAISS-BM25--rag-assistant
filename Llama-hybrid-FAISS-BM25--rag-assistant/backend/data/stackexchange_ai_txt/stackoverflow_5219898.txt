Well...im adding my overlays using the draw() method. If you are also using this method to add your overlays then you can simply cover any overlay in this method with an if statement having the condition: mapView.getZoomLevel > yourMinimumLevel . Since draw() is called each time the map is dragged or zoomed, it will remove your overlay if the zoom level condition is not satisfied.. Hope this helps.. :)
