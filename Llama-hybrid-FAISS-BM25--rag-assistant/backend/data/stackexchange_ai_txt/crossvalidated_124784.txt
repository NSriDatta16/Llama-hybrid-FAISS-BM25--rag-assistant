Take a look here for 2 possible approaches. These predictions will reduce the retransformation bias that arises when predictions of the log dependent variable are exponentiated. This will improve the mean prediction, but does not ensure that predictions for individual cases are very good. As an alternative, fit the model with glm or robust poisson regression. Edit: Since it turn out you have time series data, this advice is no longer appropriate.
