Correct interpretation of summary_plot shap graph

While through the various resources online to understand the shap plots, I ended up slightly confused. Find below my interpretation of the overall plot given in examples - Shap value 0 for a feature corresponds to the average prediction using all the other possible combinations of features except for the feature of interest. For e.g, shap value 0 for LSTAT corresponds to the average prediction of models having different combinations of features (excluding LSTAT) Shap value of 4 with respect to 0 means that there is a relative increase in prediction being 1. How do we explain shap values 4, 2, etc. with respect to 0 in layman's terms? Slight confusion in interpreting the overall graph vs the single point graph ( ( ) - In a single data point example, the base value/expected value is the average prediction in the entire dataset -> but in the overall plot (referenced at the top) we are saying it is the average prediction without that feature. So things don't add up? Thank you for your help! :)
