There is no publicly known single complete "WHOIS database", if you mean it. ICANN organizes and keeps information about which registry is responsible for each top level domain and which registrars are entitled for which tlds (e.g. com, net, co.uk, ...). Registries (e.g. Verisign, national registries, ...) keep the general availability information for domains of their allotted tlds. Some generic and country tld registries keep detailed whois information too, as the registrar system has not yet been (or will not be) fully developed for them. And finally, registrars (GoDaddy, Enom, country code registrars where applicable, ...) have the detailed whois information about the domains registered through them. So which one of these do you need? For example Verisign, the biggest registry who is responsible for com/net/... has no rate limit AFAIK, or at least I've never encountered it up to ~40k queries/day.
