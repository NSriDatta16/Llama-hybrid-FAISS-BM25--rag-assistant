try 'webcam' sudo apt-get install webcam on debian. It will grab images from a USB camera and put them in a jpg file in /var/www/ then you make an html page that auto-refreshes as fast as possible that points to the image file. I know its not a very elegant solution but its the only one I know of. If you really are bent on writing it yourself, You will need to read data from /dev/video0 (probably) and maybe encode it according to a standard video format, open a socket with the client process, and write the video data to the socket. There are some rules for the proper way to stream data over a socket though.
