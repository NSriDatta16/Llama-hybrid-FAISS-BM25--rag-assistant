You're ready to go for JavaEE. When you use it you'll be using JavaSE for JavaEE is JavaSE + new libs. To me the best ( almost only ) way to learn a new technology is actually working on it. I tried to read and learn about JSP ( back in 2000 ) or any new framework, but I just get bored. I never get Hibernate or EJB's until I actually got some project in which I could apply it. I've read a lot of spring and probably I could pass an interview but since I've never used it in a project I don't consider my self that I know it ( Although I know how it works, the config files and even the new changes ). So my recommendation is, if you can afford it, get a job no matter if the pay is bad, put your hands on any JSP project as soon as you can. The learning will be much better than any Book, Boot camp, Course or anything you can get. Probably this only works for me. :)
