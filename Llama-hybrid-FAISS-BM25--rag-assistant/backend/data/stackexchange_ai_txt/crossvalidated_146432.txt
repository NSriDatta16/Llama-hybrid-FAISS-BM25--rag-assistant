The standard $t$-test assumes that the distributions are the same (both normal, and with equal standard deviations), and that they are simply shifted relative to each other. Put another way, the $t$-test is a simple test of location. Thus, your distributions are different at every point on the BMI scale. If you wanted to predict the probability a person was in one group or the other based on knowledge of their BMI, you should fit a logistic regression model. Bear in mind that there won't be a point where you go from one group to the other (unless there is complete separation). Instead, the model will tell you the probability of a person with that BMI being in the target group. If you want a quick and easy way to select the most likely group and are willing to stick with the assumptions of normality and equal variance, you can just check which group's mean someone's BMI is closer to. The groups' probability densities will cross at the point halfway between the two means, and the ratio of the pdfs at a specific BMI can be taken as a measure of how sure you can be. If you want to assume that the groups are unbalanced in the population, you can weight the ratio of the pdfs.
