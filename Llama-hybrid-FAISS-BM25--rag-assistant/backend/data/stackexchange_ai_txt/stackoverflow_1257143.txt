Single or multi-threaded with TCPListener class?

We're creating a c# app that needs to communicate with one other system via TCP/IP sockets. We expect to receive about 1-2 incoming transactions per second, each message averaging around 10k in size (text and 1 image). We'll then do some processing (could take anywhere from 100 milliseconds to 3 seconds, depending on a few variables), and then send a response back of around 1k. In the examples I've looked at, some are multi-threaded. For this application, would it be better to make it single or multi-threaded? If multi-threaded is recommended, roughly what would the different threads do?
