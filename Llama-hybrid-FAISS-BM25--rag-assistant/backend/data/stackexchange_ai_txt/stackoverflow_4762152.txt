How to detect a contact is an organization instead of person in address book of iOS application?

In iOS devices, the contacts application doesn't support to create/maintain a contact as an organization. However, it is supported in contacts application of MAC OS. The contact created from MAC OS and synchronized to iOS devices will show different default image for an organization in the contacts application of iOS devices. So I am looking for the solution to detect a contact as an organization for iOS development. Please help if you have the solution or any comment.
