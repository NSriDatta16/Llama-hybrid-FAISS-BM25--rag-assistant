Large no of categorical variables with large no of categories

I'm working on a binary classification problem where the dataset is slightly imbalanced (30% class 0 | 70% class 1). Most of my features are categorical with large number of categories. For example: one of them has 310 categories but the top 10 most frequently occurring variables account for ~50% of the training and test data. I was thinking of keeping these top k frequently occurring values and encoding all the other values as another category "others". Would it be okay to do so? Also, what kind of classifier would be optimal for such a task? I was looking at random forests. However, due to noisy data (too many categories, too many features) my model doesn't generalize too well (low recall and precision). Thank you for your time. PS: Data not time series
