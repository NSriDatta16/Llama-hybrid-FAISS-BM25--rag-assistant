Forecast Daily Data with Multiple Seasonality

I am new to the field of time series forecast and trying to build a time series model on R for a daily data, which I think there are multiple seasonality, weekly and monthly. My data contain the number of customers collected from a store operating on weekdays. So data are only collected from Monday through Friday. Also, there are holidays. How do you deal with holiday ? Could you please give me suggestion what model I should use ?
