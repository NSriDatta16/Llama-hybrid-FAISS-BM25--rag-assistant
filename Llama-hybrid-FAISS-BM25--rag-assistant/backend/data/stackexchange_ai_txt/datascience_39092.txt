Train a model using only dataset 1, only dataset 2 and using a combination of dataset 1 and 2 evaluate their performances on both test sets. If the combined model is significantly better than the separate models, you have something, and I think you can report as such in a possible publication. Of course, you will still have to motivate which machine learning model you use, your performance metric of interest, how you conduct cross-validation, ...
