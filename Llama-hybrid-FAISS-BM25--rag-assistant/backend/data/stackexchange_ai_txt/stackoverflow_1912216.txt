There are two ways to do it: either by accessing the DOM element directly and changing its style (or css) attributes, or by calling a javascript function on the page which will do the same thing. Below i have the xaml, code behind, and the HTML for a simple example which when you drag a slider in the silverlight control, it resizes the div that contains the control. If you create a simple Silverlight Application with a complementary test website and page, and then copy and paste the following code in then you can have a play (note that i have snipped some of the generated styles/script from the aspx page for the sake of brevity). The C# and javascript code is not particularly pretty or bullet proof, it is simply an example. Code behind for the Silverlight application: public partial class MainPage : UserControl { public MainPage() { InitializeComponent(); this.Loaded += new RoutedEventHandler(MainPage_Loaded); } private void MainPage_Loaded(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e) { WidthSlider.ValueChanged += new RoutedPropertyChangedEventHandler (WidthSlider_ValueChanged); } private void WidthSlider_ValueChanged(object sender, RoutedPropertyChangedEventArgs e) { //access and manipulate the DOM element directly: HtmlElement container = HtmlPage.Document.GetElementById("silverlightControlHost"); if (container != null) { container.SetStyleAttribute("width", (50 + e.NewValue).ToString() + "px"); } //pass a delta value to the js function, which will get added to the current width of the container: HtmlPage.Window.Invoke("resizeContainer", (e.NewValue - e.OldValue).ToString()); } } and the aspx page: SilverlightApplication6 function resizeContainer(delta) { var container = document.getElementById('silverlightControlHost'); if (container != null) { //alert('starting width: ' + container.style.width); container.style.width = (parseInt(container.style.width) + Number(delta) + 'px'); //alert('finishing width: ' + container.style.width); } } Edit: Two days after i wrote this answer Charles Petzold wrote a blog post about resizing silverlight controls within the html page, you can find it here . The main difference is that he resizes the actual silverlight plugin control, while i was resizing the html element that the silverlight plugin resides within.
