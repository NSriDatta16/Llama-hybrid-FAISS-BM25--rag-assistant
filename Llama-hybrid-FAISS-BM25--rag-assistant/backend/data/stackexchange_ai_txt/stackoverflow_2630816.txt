It's not as elegant as using OS support for ephemeral ports, but the docs show that you should be able to specify a port for your socket to bind to. Specify a port at the base of the range you want and if it is used an exception will be thrown, in which case increment the port and try again. Given that windows isn't using the port range that you want, there shouldn't be many collisions.
