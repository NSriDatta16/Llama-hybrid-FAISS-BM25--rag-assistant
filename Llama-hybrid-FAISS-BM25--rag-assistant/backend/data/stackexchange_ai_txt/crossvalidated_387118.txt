Can I do machine learning projects on a bad PC?

I am trying to learn about machine learning and I've done some reading and tried simple task like the Iris dataset, but I've decided to go to a bigger project and got a couple datasets from some sites of competitions and I couldn't run any of the models on my computer. I got an error message from R saying that it couldn't allocate such a big vector, so I tried running on a kernel on Kaggle, but I don't think it will work it out for me because of the limited time I have available to use. So I want to know is it possible to run a model on a bad computer? Right now I'm on vacation so I'm using a laptop, back home I have a computer which is a little better, but I don't think it's good enough. I really want to try projects by myself so I can see that I'm learning, but I'm not being able to run it. Can I get suggestions on how to run? My laptop have 4GB of RAM and my processor is an Intel(R) Celeron(R) CPU N3350 @ 1.10GHz. My PC has also 4GB RAM and a i5 as processor (I don't remember which one exactly).
