This problem seems like it might be handled well by logistic regression. You have two states, A and B, and want to examine the probability of whether a particular individual has switched irreversibly from state A to state B. One fundamental predictor variable would be age at the time of observation. The other factor or factors of interest would be additional predictor variables. Your logistic model would then use the actual observations of A/B state, age, and other factors to estimate the probability of being in state B as a function of those predictors. The age at which that probability passes 0.5 could be used as the estimate of the transition time, and you would then examine the influences of the other factor(s) on that predicted transition time. Added in response to discussion: As with any linear model, you need to ensure that your predictors are transformed in a way that they bear a linear relation to the outcome variable, in this case the log-odds of the probability of having moved to state B. That is not necessarily a trivial problem. The answer by @CliffAB shows how a log transformation of the age variable might be used.
