Are you talking about: Slowness starting the app (like running script/server)? If it's the server startup, then what server are you using? From my experience webrick is slower than mongrel is slower than thin. Passenger really is the most efficient for local development (though I've never tried to get it running on windows). Slow page responses from hitting the dev server? This could be inefficient database queries, too much computation in the view that could be reworked, etc. If it's running ok in production this is probably not your issue. However, the web server you run will make a difference in your speed locally as well. I think the same order for startup applies for execution as well. Rake tasks taking forever to start? I've had this issue as well. If you have a large project with lots of plugins (which means lots of initialization that needs to run), it can take a while to ramp up the rails environment. There are things that will probably speed it up, but there's no silver bullet. Make sure you don't have any plugins installed you are no longer using, take a careful look at your environment and initializers to make sure it's in good shape, etc. Bottom line being, stating "Rails is slow in development" doesn't really pinpoint the problem. If you can clarify what is slow, then you can get specific help to speed it up. I've worked on lots of pretty large projects that have suffered from performance issues in development as well as production. I've never had a situation that couldn't be improved if given the right attention. Pinpoint the problem and you can usually diagnose a better solution to speed things up.
