How to control which side a margin paragraph appears on?

I would like to force a \marginpar to appear on the "wrong" side of the page (that is, in the left margin on a single-sided document). My problem is not the slipping of \marginpars across pages addressed by marginparhack , but rather a desired to override the usual behavior at need. Nor does marginnote seem to cover my needs. What package or cantrip can I use to easily force \marginpar s to the side of my choosing?
