Cant Drag ListBoxItem Adorner outside of ListBox in WPF -ScrollViewerProblem

I am working with a WPF application that uses alot of drag and drop. Everything is working fine, with exception of ListBoxItems. I have a ListBox with ListBoxItems that can be dragged to another target( a StackPanel). The problem is, when I drag the cursor outside the ListBox, I cant see the Adorner that I have setup with the ListBoxItem? I know this is a common problem, but I am just not sure how to fix it. Is there something that I need to do to allow me to drag outside of the ListBox control? Below I have attached what the UI looks like so far. As you can see, there is a ListBox on the bottom left. When I drag an item, the adorner appears, and follows the cursor around while the cursor is over the ListBox, but if I try to move the cursor away from the listbox, the Adorner seems to almost go under the other controls(zIndex?). Edit - Solution I have changed the code to handle the AdornerLayer relative to the window as oppose to relative to the AdornedElement So I changed layer = AdornerLayer.GetAdornerLayer(_originalElement); to layer = AdornerLayer.GetAdornerLayer(this); This solved the problem of the ScrollViwer clipping the AdornerLayer
