Theoretical justification that sum of stationary time series is asymptotically normal

I am working on time series. Theorem A5 of this document http://www-stat.wharton.upenn.edu/~stine/stat910/lectures/11_clt.pdf claims proof of asymptotic normality for autoregressive process of a special type (idependent white noise) of the sample mean. Also, the Wold decomposition says that it is almost possible to represent a time series as an autoregressive model with uncorrelated white noise and some deterministic term (See Shumway and Stoffer section B4 of the appendix). Which makes me wonder if there is any theoretical justification to believe that A sum of elements of stationary time series is asymptotically normal? By the above, it seems almost true. Is it true, or can we make it true by adding some weak conditions, such as $\gamma(h) \to 0$ as $h\to \infty$ or that there exist $M \in \mathrm{N}$ such that $\mathrm{Cov}(X_i,X_j)=0$ for all $|i-j|>M$?
