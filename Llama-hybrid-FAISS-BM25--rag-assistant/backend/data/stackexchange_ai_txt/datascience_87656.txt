Concatenating embedding and hand-designed features for logistic regression

An interviewer told me that we cannot concatenate an embedding from a neural network (such as a pre-trained image representation) and hand designed features (such as image metadata) for use in a linear model such as logistic regression. He says they must only be used with neural networks. I understand the resulting data may not be linearly separable but that to me seems like a case-by-case empirical question. Is he right? Can someone explain why?
