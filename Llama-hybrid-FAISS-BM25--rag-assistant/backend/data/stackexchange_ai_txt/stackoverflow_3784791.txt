Organizing large no of tables in Entity Framework

I have a couple of queries with regards to entity framework: My database has over 100 tables including of master, lookup and child tables. One operation of save may save data in 25 different tables. I am trying to figure out the best possible way to organize my entities. Whether I should do table wise or should do it operation wise. Do we have any best practices or suggested practices defined in this regards? Since in the above scenario which do not have pure CRUD operations, should I keep one EDMX file or split them into multiple EDMX files and how?
