Time series - Classic decomposition model

A decomposition model widely used in practice is $$Z_t = \mu_t + N_t + a_t$$ where $\mu$ captures the deterministic part of the series and $N_t$ is a stationary process that can be adjusted by ARMA(p, q). The series I'm studying shows no trend, only seasonality. I tried to fit a dummy regression, however $N_t$ is non-stationary. Subsequently, I adjusted a sine-wave regression and the Anderson Darling test checked for $N_t$ stationarity. However when analyzing the fac and pafc of $N_t$ I have significant high order lags. Still pointing to the presence of something seasonal. Any idea how to get a gun model ARMA for $N_t$? To read the series I used the following code: x = scan() 0.94891 0.89786 0.83291 0.74823 0.69496 0.66354 0.58498 0.49182 0.45535 0.33249 0.31806 0.33588 0.94031 0.91268 0.88446 0.86162 0.81494 0.76389 0.68428 0.43835 0.33715 0.2918 0.29184 0.26639 0.91411 0.83015 0.79352 0.70579 0.67098 0.66247 0.65689 0.59713 0.60407 0.46496 0.38194 0.38118 0.98666 0.92302 0.80413 0.73738 0.62196 0.5825 0.54789 0.47124 z = ts(x[1:40], start = c(2014, 1, 1), freq = 12) ts.plot(z)
