This is merely a harmful warning issued by gcc, and I would disable it with -Wno-braces . {0} is an extremely useful "universal zero initializer" for types whose definition your code is not supposed to be aware of, and gcc's discouraging its use is actively harmful to the pursuit of good code. If gcc wants to keep this warning, it should at least special-case {0} and disable the warning in this one case.
