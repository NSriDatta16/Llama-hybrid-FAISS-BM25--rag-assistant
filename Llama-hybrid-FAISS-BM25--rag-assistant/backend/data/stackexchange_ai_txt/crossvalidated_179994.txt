Interpreting very small Exp(B) in multinomial logistic regression

I am having trouble interpreting the Exp(B) value in a multinomial logistic regression in which my outcome variable is categorical (3 categories) and my predictor is a scale variable. The Exp(B) value for Category 3 (reference is Category 1) is 8.849E-51, with confidence intervals of 2.734E-51 - 2.865E-50. There is a similar value for Category 2. This is the first time I have performed multinomial logistic regression so I might be misunderstanding but this very small Exp(B) doesn't appear to make sense from looking at my data. I have read this post but can't make sense of this result based on this.
