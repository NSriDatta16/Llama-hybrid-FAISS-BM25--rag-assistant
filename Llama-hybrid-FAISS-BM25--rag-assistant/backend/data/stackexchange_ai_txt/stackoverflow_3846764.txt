It sounds like you want a Markov Chain model for passwords. A Markov Chain has a number of states and a probability of transitioning between the states. In your case the states are the characters in the allowed character set and the probability of a transition is proportional to the frequency that those two letters appear consecutively. You can construct the Markov Chain by looking at the frequency of the transitions in an existing text, for example a freely available word list or password database. It is also possible to use variations on this technique ( Markov chain of order m ) where you for example consider the previous two characters instead of just one. Once you have created the model you can use the probability of generating the password from the model as a measure of its strength. This is the product of the probabilities of each state transition.
