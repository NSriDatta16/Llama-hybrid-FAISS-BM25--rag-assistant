Seasonality and work days in time series

I have a time series which is daily data for workdays only. There is an almost obvious seasonality comparing the plot of the raw data that appears at the end of each month. However, there are not the same number of workdays for every month. Some times a month has 20 or 21 workdays. Do you have any idea how to treat the data? Do you suggest to manipulate the data in order to create a series with a constant frequency? The problem is that in R I have to set the frequency before running the ARIMA.
