SLPA (now called GANXiS) is a fast algorithm capable of detecting both disjoint and overlapping communities in social networks (undirected/directed and unweighted/weighted). It is shown that the algorithm produces meaningful results on real-world social and gene networks. It is one of the state-of-the-art.
