Plotting of the time series, plot(logloss,type="l") , shows the variance is very clearly not constant. It doesn't seem to vary with the mean, suggesting that a transformation won't help. Rather it seems to wax and wane over time. You might want to look into AutoRegressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (ARCH) models . [Response to comment: No particular ARMA model's strongly indicated by the ACFs (bear in mind the heteroskedasticity is going to give the distribution fat tails) - try fitting a GARCH to the data as is, & then to residuals from an ARMA(1,1), & compare the results. You've got enough observations so that tests or information criteria will probably suggest a more complex model with 'balancing' MA & AR parameters that doesn't make much difference to the predictions, but it's up to you what's sensible given the context.]
