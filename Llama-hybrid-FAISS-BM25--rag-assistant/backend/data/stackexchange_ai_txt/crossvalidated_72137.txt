Probability density function for a logarithmic spinner

I'm having trouble deriving the PDF for the following problem (from the book Doing Bayesian analysis with R and BUGS ): Consider a spinner of the kind often found with board games, but with a log10 scale from 1 to 100 (covering 0 to 360 deg). The spinner is fair, so any value is equally likely. What is the pdf at point $x$? I know that the $x$ value at angle $t$ is given by $$x = 100^\text{t/360}$$ Doing some transformation $$x = \exp^{(t/360) \times \log(100)}$$ $$pdf(x) = pm(x)/dx$$ I also know $$dt/dx = 360/(\log100 \times x)$$ Question How to derive the answer below, using the information above? Book answer $$pdf(x) = 1/(2 \times ln(10) \times x)$$ Thanks.
