Drop lines from actual to modeled points in R

Yesterday I worked up an example of the difference between Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) vs. Principal Components Analysis (PCA). For that illustration I wanted to show the errors minimized by OLS and PCA so I plotted the actuals, the predicted line and then I manually (with GIMP) drew in a drop line to illustrate a couple of the error terms. How can I code the creation of the error lines in R? Here's the code I used for my example: set.seed(2) x Then I manually added the yellow lines to produce the following:
