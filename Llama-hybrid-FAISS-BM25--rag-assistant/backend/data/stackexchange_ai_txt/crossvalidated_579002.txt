Comparison of frequentist methods (say, averaged over Monte Carlo simulations) and Bayesian method

I have read a lot of questions with answers like this one, How do Bayesians verify their methods using Monte Carlo simulation methods? , which stated that Monte Carlo methods are not suitable for verifying Bayesian methods. I'm interested to look at intervals, and I understand that we do confidence intervals for frequentist methods and credible intervals for Bayesian methods. Suppose that I have generated data 100 times for a Monte Carlo simulation study and obtain an averaged estimator with standard error and 95% confidence interval for frequentist methods. The issue is that I also have a Bayesian method to work with and as far as i know, Monte Carlo simulation may not be ideal in this case. What is the best way to do simulations for both Bayesian and frequentist methods?
