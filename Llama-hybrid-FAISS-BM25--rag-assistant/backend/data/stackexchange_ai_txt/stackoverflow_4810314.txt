Infragistics UltraTree with checkboxes in selected cells

I use the Infragistics UltraTree control in a Winforms application as a treelist ( outlook mode ). The problem with the outlook mode is, that it is not possible to have node checkboxes. So my workaround is, to use a own column for the checkboxes . My question is now, how can I achive, that there are only checkboxes in specific cells (for example only in cells, which belongs to tree level 2)? At http://news.infragistics.com/forums/p/11661/44028.aspx#44028 there is a solution with ultraCheckEditor, but first, the EditorControl is a "obsolete"-control and I don't know how to include ultraCheckEditor!?!? Although I have using Infragistics.Win.UltraWinEditors the class is still not available!?!?
