Using a hash of data as a salt

I was wondering - is there any disadvantages in using the hash of something as a salt of itself? E.g. hashAlgorithm(data + hashAlgorithm(data)) This prevents the usage of lookup tables, and does not require the storage of a salt in the database. If the attacker does not have access to the source code, he would not be able to obtain the algorithm, which would make brute-forcing significantly harder. Thoughts? (I have a gut feeling that this is bad - but I wanted to check if it really is, and if so, why.)
