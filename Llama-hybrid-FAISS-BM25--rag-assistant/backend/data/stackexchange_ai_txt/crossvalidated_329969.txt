Determining the percentile rank of a score w.r.t. a known distribution

I have data from a SUS-survey (a standardized test for evaluating the usability of software) which gave me an average score of 73.25 . As I understand, it is best practice to normalize the scores to produce a percentile ranking as indicated here . I do not however understand how I would go about assigning a percentile rank to my score - if I understand correctly, I would require a reference distribution of SUS-Scores (or else there's no way of saying "my score is better or worse than X% of available scores", right?) I have found that Bangor et al. have published the results from 10 years worth of SUS-evaluations , and here's the data they give: Count: 2324 Mean: 70.14 Median: 75 Standard Deviation: 12.71 Is it possible to determine the percentile rank of the score of 73.25 with respect to this distribution, and how would I do that?
