When you drag an object, the object doesn't take all the position possible, but skip some pixel. I log the .top position, and the value are 8, 11, 18, 27, so it is rare that the condition Math.abs($('#map div.map').offset().top-$('#map').offset().top) % fragmentH == 0 is true. For your case, it is better to have something like Math.abs($('#map div.map').offset().top-$('#map').offset().top) >= fragmentH It only depends on what you exactly want to do, but do not use modulo with pixel arithmetic & dragging, bad idea !
