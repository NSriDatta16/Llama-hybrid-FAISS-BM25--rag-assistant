1. Your data clearly suggests sigmoidal function. However, you can try to fit any curve including a polynomial function (of arbitrary order). JAGS code for fitting a cubic spline: model { for (g in 1:G) { for (s in 1:S) { for (i in 1:N) { mu[g, s, i] Save the code to "model1.jag", then fit & examine with rjags: library(rjags) data Note that this model takes into account data truncation (score >= 0). 2. This could be addressed with Bayesian oneway ANOVA. The idea is to fit a linear model for a single nominal predictor â€” a vector $\langle 1, 0, 0\rangle$ for Group 1, $\langle 0, 1, 0\rangle$ for Group 2, etc. A simplistic JAGS model: model { for (g in 1:G) { mu[g] Fit with R script: library(rjags) data Then examine normalized group deflection b: b[j] = a[j] - mean(a), b0 = a0 + mean(a) The best source on this subject is chapter 18 of Kruschke, John.
