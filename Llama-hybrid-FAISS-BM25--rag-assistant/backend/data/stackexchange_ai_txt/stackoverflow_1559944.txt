After converting your data into Weka's simple text-based .arff format , you should be able to use the GUI or command-line interface to train and test a variety of different classifiers on that data, including: decision trees neural networks rule-based systems support vector machines (SVMs) various types of regression Experimenting with this interface should allow you to easily try different classifiers and training parameters to determine which ones perform the best on your data. You can also use an API to integrate Weka into your own source code .
