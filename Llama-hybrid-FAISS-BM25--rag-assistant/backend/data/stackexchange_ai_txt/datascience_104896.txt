Activation and Loss Function not chosen correctly when use Neural Network

I have three classes for my text dataset before. These are my classes: 0 = Cat 1 = Not Both 2 = Dog Then I use this code: df_result = df[df["class"] != 1] So, now my classes are 0 and 2. When I use neural networks, what can I choose for the Loss and Activation? Then, what should I do for choose the last Dense of neural network's model? Before, my code like this: model.add(Dense(2, activation = 'softmax')) history = model.compile(loss = sparse_categorical_crossentropy, optimizer = 'adam', metrics=['accuracy']) I do not know if it makes a bad accuracy and bad validation accuracy or not. So, I am still confused. Please, give me a hand.
