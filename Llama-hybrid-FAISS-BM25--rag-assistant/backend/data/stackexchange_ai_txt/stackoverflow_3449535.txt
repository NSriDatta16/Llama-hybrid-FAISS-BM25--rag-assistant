how many users typically use the "forgotten password" flow?

I was wondering what the "standard" usage rate of the "forgot my password" flow is on other ecommerce/industry websites? Right now not that many people go through the "forgot my password" link on my website, but that's mainly because most people don't have passwords. I'm in the process of installing a new login (which will encourage people to create passwords), so I anticipate that the number of people who go through the "forgot my password" link will go up, but I don't have any real baseline to compare it against. So does anybody know what the typical percentage of users executing the "forgotten password" flow is? A typical user will probably be prompted to log in once every four weeks. Our password requirements are currently minimal.
