Display areas of unmanaged entities

I have a custom entity in CRM 4.0 called Mark. Areas that display this entity is none. After importing this organization to CRM2011 beta, i tried to make this entity appear in Workplace area, so i navigated to the settings >>Solutions>>Entities then i checked Workplace in areas that display this entity, Then saved and published the form. The unexpected happened, i didn't find the Mark entity in the workplace area. I tried to refresh, restarted the IIS, closed the brower, .. nothing changed, any ideas ? Thanks
