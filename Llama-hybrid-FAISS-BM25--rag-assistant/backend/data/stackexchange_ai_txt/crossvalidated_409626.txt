Ridge regression does not need to be all-or-none with respect to penalization. It's quite acceptable to penalize covariates that are likely to be important to outcome but not of primary interest in terms of inference. Chen et al show that: Ridge regression and penalized logistic regression models that penalize all but the coefficient of the exposure may be considered in these types of studies. Even with penalization of all predictors, it's possible to try bootstrapping to identify predictors that are highly related to outcome. See this page for some ideas.
