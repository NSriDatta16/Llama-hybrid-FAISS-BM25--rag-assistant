Reference request: Storks bring babies

There is a well-known statistical example, claiming that there is correlation between the number of babies in Alsatian/Danish/Dutch/German villages or European countries and the number of storks in that place. The humorous "implication" of this example is that storks indeed bring babies . This example is often used to teach the difference between correlation and causality. I would like to know by whom this example was initially coined. So far, I found two references talking about this example. I checked this answer and found Sies, H. (1988), A new parameter for sex education , Nature 332, 495; https://doi.org/10.1038/332495a0 Furthermore, I found Matthews, R. (2000), Storks Deliver Babies (p= 0.008) . Teaching Statistics, 22: 36-38. https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-9639.00013 Across the web, I also found attributions to G. Udny Yule, author of Introduction to the Theory of Statistics (1911) and to Darrell Huff, author of How to Lie with Statistics (1954). In neither of the books, I could find a paragraph on the subject. As G. Udny Yule is the oldest of the named authors, I would like to believe that he is the inventor of the storks-and-babies example, but I would like to see a reference proving or falsifying my assumption.
