How to calculate the forecast interval for time series prediction obtained by doing seasonal differencing before fitting arima

Here is the link of my previous question. How to forecast a time series which is generated by accumulating data of every five minutes and reset to 0 by the end of the day I am working with a seasonal data of which period is 288. Thanks to @Stephan Kolassa, I did find sarima can fit the data well. But since the prediction would be running on an online service, sarima seems to be quite time consuming. So I manually do the seasonal differencing, and fit the data with non-seasonal arima. Here are the steps: Step1: calculate $Y_{t\_sdiff} = (Y_t - Y_{t-288})-(Y_{t-1} - Y_{t-1-288})$ (set some outliers as 0) Step2: fit $Y_{t\_sdiff} $ with non-seansonal arima Step3: predict $Y_{t+1\_sdiff} $ Step4: calculate $Y_{t+1}=Y_{t+1\_sdiff}+Y_{t+1-288}+(Y_{t} - Y_{t-288})$ The result shows that the precedure above works also well, the point estimate is quite close to the truth. But I also want to obtain the forecast interval of prediction. So, I calculate the it based on the formula in step4, which means that the variance of prediction mainly comes from $Y_{t+1\_sdiff}$ . After reviewing the result, I found there must be some wrong right here. Because the magnitude of forecast interval is much more smaller than Y. But I cann't figure out how to get the right forecast interval. I would appreciate if anyone can help me in this issue. Thanks in advance.
