Hibernate - cant use GROUP BY With ORDER BY together

This one is odd... I have an hql query that ignore the GOUP BY if ORDER BY is included. it will perform the query without the group by , but if I remove the order by it will work fine list = getSession().createQuery( "SELECT Brand.name as Brand_name , Brand.url as Brand_url , Brand.email as Brand_email , Brand.brandId as Brand_brandId , Brand.description as Brand_description FROM com.affiliates.hibernate.Brand Brand INNER JOIN Brand.users as users WHERE 1=1 AND users.userId>'0' order by Brand.email ASC group by brandId"//this one will be ignored because of the order by ).setResultTransformer(Transformers.ALIAS_TO_ENTITY_MAP).list(); sql generated: select brand0_.NAME as col_0_0_, brand0_.URL as col_1_0_, brand0_.EMAIL as col_2_0_, brand0_.DESCRIPTION as col_3_0_ from BRAND brand0_ inner join USERS_BRANDS users1_ on brand0_.BRAND_ID=users1_.BRAND_ID inner join USER user2_ on users1_.USER_ID=user2_.USER_ID where 1=1 and user2_.USER_ID>'0' order by brand0_.EMAIL ASC limit ?
