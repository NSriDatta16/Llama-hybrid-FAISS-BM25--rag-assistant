How about loading the child entities using the partial OnLoaded() method in the parent entity? That would allow you to avoid messing with generated code. Of course it would no longer be a lazy load, but it's a simple way to do it. For example: public partial class Supplier { public List Products { get; set; } partial void OnLoaded() { // GetProductsBySupplierId is the SP dragged into your dbml designer Products = dataContext.GetProductsBySupplierId(this.Id).ToList(); } }
