I was able to get this working but perhaps not as elegantly as I would have liked. Ideally I would have liked to call the prototype or defaults version of of onfocusout from within a timeout closure but I wasn't able to figure out how to reference it from that scope. The approach that I took instead was to override the onfocusout method with its code copy/pasted into a timeout closure. The only other tweak was to change references from this to _this to work within the different scope of the timeout closure. $("#aspnetForm").validate({ success: "valid", onkeyup: "false", onfocusout: function(element) { //Delay validation so autocomplete can fill field. var _this = this; setTimeout(function() { if (!_this.checkable(element) && (element.name in _this.submitted || !_this.optional(element))) _this.element(element); _this = null; }, 250); } }); Feel free to post improvements.
