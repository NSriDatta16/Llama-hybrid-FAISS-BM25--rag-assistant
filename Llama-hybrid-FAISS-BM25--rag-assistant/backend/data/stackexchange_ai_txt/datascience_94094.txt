How to interpret the rec curve for a regression task?

I am using forest fire dataset and applied neural network model. I tried to generate REC curve, this is how it looks like. Pretty weird!!! I have also applied XGBoost but the REC curve is almost parallel to X-axis. I don't understand how to make sense out of it? I also want to understand how to interpret REC curve in general?
