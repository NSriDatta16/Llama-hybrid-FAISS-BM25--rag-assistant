same number of observations but not significant?

If we two time series (x,y) with the same number of observations. We then computed the Pearson correlation with z , which has the same number of observations as x and y ( corr between x and z , corr between y and z ) Is it possible to encounter this case: - there is a significant (p even if they the have same number of observations!
