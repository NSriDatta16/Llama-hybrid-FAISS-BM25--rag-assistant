There is no pooled dataset with multiple imputation in SPSS or any other software. Pooling is done on the results of the analyses for the separate completed datasets. You might do this by doing some averaging or something, but you'd be missing some of the value of multiple imputation (as you'd be eliminating between-imputation variability, which is integral to the methodology). As noted above, there's no pooling of datasets, only pooling of analysis results from different completed datasets. Pooling algorithms are given in the Multiple Imputation Pooling Algorithms chapter of the IBM SPSS Statistics Algorithms manual, which is available online (in the program, click Help>Documentation in PDF Format, select English or other desired language, then scroll down to the Manuals section and look for that title). The pooling of results is done using what are known as Rubin's rules. There's lots of information about those on the Internet. To incorporate year into analyses, you'd probably want to go back to the original data with all three years in a single dataset, with cases for a given year properly identified, then re-impute data, with year included as an imputation variable. Then you could add year as a categorical predictor or factor in your GLM analyses.
