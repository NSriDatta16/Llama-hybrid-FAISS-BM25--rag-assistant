If you have not taken other steps to ensure that the two factors don't occur in a fixed temporal order, than no, logistic regression will not ensure that that's true. Your interpretation would be something along the lines of: "A one-unit increase in BIOMARKER increased the odds of vitamin deficiency by 1.22". Finally, when I entered other risk factors to the model do I interpret the result as dependent and independent risk factor? It's a little unclear what you're asking here. The estimates determined in any logistical regression model are conditional on any other variables you've included in the model.
