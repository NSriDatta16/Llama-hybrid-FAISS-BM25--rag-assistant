Often your model pipeline will rely on data generated by Data Engineers. So beyond having the ML pipeline (feature engineering, training and prediction pipeline) you also have Data engineering pipeline. A good example can be found here https://flypipe.github.io/flypipe/html/release/1.0.1/index.html . In my point of view as a Machine Learning, I prefer to have these pipelines implemented and linked end-to-end. Decoupling Data and model pipelines can cause problems when serving your models behind an API that will receive raw data and therefore needs the data transformations (from data pipeline) + the features transformations (from model pipeline) Have a look on Flypipe docs, it has a good explanation of pipelines and quick and easy to use in local python pandas or pyspark and databricks.
