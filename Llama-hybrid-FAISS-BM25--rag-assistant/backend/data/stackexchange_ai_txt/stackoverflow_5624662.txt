Answers on 2 out of 3: Host the SSH Server on VM Role in Cloud, In this case, will the other Web/Worker roles on the same cloud be ale to access the local storage of the VM role? Not the local storage, but you could let them access a shared Cloud Drive - http://blog.maartenballiauw.be/post/2010/02/02/Using-Windows-Azure-Drive-(aka-X-Drive).aspx - note that only one instance can have write access to this drive, but plenty can have read. If there is no support for SSH in Windows Azure, please let me know other alternatives for Secure File Transfer in Cloud. The actual upload/download of blobs can be secured with SSL, and access to your stored hosting is via your keys. To be honest, I'd recommend looking at using blob storage for this requirement. It depends on how many files/blobs you are looking to store and how often you want to change them, but overall blob storage is pretty useful and usable. For an intro to blobs see http://blogs.msdn.com/b/jnak/archive/2010/01/11/walkthrough-windows-azure-blob-storage-nov-2009-and-later.aspx Is it possible to host a SSH FTP server using .NET components (Payed/Open Source) in a Worker role in Azure? If yes, please provide information regarding the .NET components available in Market. Possibly - but I've no idea on this - there's lots of hits from http://www.bing.com/search?setmkt=en-GB&q=ssh+ftp+server+c%23 Edit - also check out this thread - http://forums.iis.net/t/1147827.aspx - you could deploy WinSSHD to a role?
