I think it depends on the data. For example, if you are processing counts and you just forgot to measure it on some days, then the best strategy is to impute the missing values (e.g., via interpolation or Gaussian processes) and then process the imputed time series with an RNN. By imputing, you would be embedding knowledge. If the missingness is meaningful (it was too hot too measure counts on some days), then it's best to impute perhaps and also append an indicator vector that is 1 if the value was missing and 0 otherwise.
