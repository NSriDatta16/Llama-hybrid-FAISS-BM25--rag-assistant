I'll leave out some of the details: Connect to Hyper-V on the host. Enumerate the machines ( SELECT * FROM Msvm_ComputerSystem ). For each machine, find the associated Msvm_SyntheticEthernetPort objects. var ports = computerSystem.GetRelated("Msvm_SyntheticEthernetPort"); foreach (ManagementObject port in ports) { Get hold of the settings: var portSettings = port.GetRelated("Msvm_SyntheticEthernetPortSettingData"); foreach (ManagmentObject portSetting in portSettings) { Look for the configured MAC address: string macAddress = (string)portSetting .GetPropertyValue("Address");
