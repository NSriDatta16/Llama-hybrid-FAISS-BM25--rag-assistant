Low level operations with SD card on Android

is it possible to have low level access in Android with Java/NDK to create for example card scanner like scandisk or card defragmenter? I move a lots of stuff around my card and it gets fragmented quickly. I have experience with FAT32 defragmenting on Windows, but I'dliek to do this on Android.
