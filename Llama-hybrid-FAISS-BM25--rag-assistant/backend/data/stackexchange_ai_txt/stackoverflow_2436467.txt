AlertDialog.Builder vs class to extend AlertDialog - Application size

I am trying to figure out what is the best way to go about creating dialogs. I can either create my own Dialog class (which, to me, is more clean and organized), or I can use AlertDialog.Builder (which would be done inline, and funky looking)... What are the positivies and negatives of either implementation? The only thing I can think of is application size...
