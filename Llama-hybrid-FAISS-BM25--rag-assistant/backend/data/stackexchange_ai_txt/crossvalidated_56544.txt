Modelling rainfall to size storage tanks

I have daily rainfall data for a given site going back about 30 years. I have a building with an average daily demand for water of $L$ litres and a catchment of $A$ m$^2$ with a runoff coefficient of $c$. How can I construct a model so that I can determine for a tank size T litres, The mean and variance of the days per year the tank will be empty Shortfall of water days per year the tank will overflow Amount of water that overflows I have googled this extensively and found plenty of rules of thumb but noting that uses a probabilistic model.
