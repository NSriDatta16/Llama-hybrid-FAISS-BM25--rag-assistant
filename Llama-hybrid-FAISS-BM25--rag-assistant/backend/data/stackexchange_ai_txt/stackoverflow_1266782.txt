G'day, I would highly recommend that you get a copy of the excellent book "Pragmatic Version Control: Using Subversion" ( sanitised Amazon link ) which covers this topic along with many others. It does so in terms of what you want to do, rather than be simply a mechanical recitation of the features. HTH 'Avahappy, BTW I've just seen that the second edition of this book is out.
