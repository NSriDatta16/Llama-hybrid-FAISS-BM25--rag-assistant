How is a deep learning network with multiple passes to determine its fitness called?

Sorry if this has already been answered, I am quite new to deep learning and especially to the specific terms. I am looking into deep learning at the moment, and I found a video done by Sethbling where he shows a deep neural network he has trained that is able to "play Mario". Here is a link : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv6UVOQ0F44 What is troubling to me is that all the documents I found about NNs are the kind of networks that require a single pass to determine their fitness, or the error. However, this is more a "feed those return values to this network until this condition is met (character doesn't go forward anymore or has come to the end of the level), then evaluate its fitness". How is this specific kind of learning and way of evaluating a network called ? Thanks in advance
