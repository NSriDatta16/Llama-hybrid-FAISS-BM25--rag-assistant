How do you parse multi-level "nodes" in text?

I have a configuration format similar to *.sln format, so take the following as an example: DCOM Productions Configuration File, Format Version 1.0 BeginSection:Global GlobalKeyA = AnswerOne .: Stores the global configuration key :: for the application. This key is used :: to save the current state of the app. :: as well as prevent lockups GlobalKey3 = AnswerTwo .: Secondary Key. See above setting GlobalKeyC = AnswerThree BeginSection: UpdateSystem NestedKeyA = One NestedKeyB = Two NestedKeyC = { A set of multiline data where we will show how to write a multiline paragraph } NestedKeyD = System.Int32, 100 EndSection EndSection BeginSection:Application InstallPath = C:\Program Files\DCOM Productions\BitFlex EndSection I know that I will need a recursive function probably that takes a segment of text as a parameter so, for example, pass an entire section to it, and recursively parse it that way. I just can't seem to get my head around how to do this. Each section can potentially have more child sections. It's like an Xml document.. I'm not really asking for code here, just a methodology about how to go about parsing a document like this. I was thinking about using the tabs (specifies the index) to determine which section I am working with, but this would fail if the document was not tabbed (formatted) correctly. Any better thoughts?
