XHTML Mobile Profile long predates HTML5. It is aimed primarily at lower-powered mobile devices such as mobile phones from the pre-smartphone generation, as part of the “WAP 2.0” stack. If you want to continue to support this kind of device you should continue to use XHTML Mobile Profile or XHTML Basic, and ensure that your documents are well-formed XML and use only the features from those specs. If you only care about the new generation of mobile user-agents, that happily render normal [X]HTML[5] pages designed from standard desktop browsers, you can drop it and use whatever doctype you like.
