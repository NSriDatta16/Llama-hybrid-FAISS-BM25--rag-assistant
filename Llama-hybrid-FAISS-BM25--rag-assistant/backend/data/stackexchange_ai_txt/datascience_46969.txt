In addition to what has been said: Why do we choose principal components based on maximum variance explained? - Because the variance left by rest of the components is in fact the residual you want to minimize when looking for the best representation of your data in less dimensions (the best mean-square linear representation, of course). do we always have to choose principal components based on maximum variance explained? - Yes, if dimensionality reduction is what you want. However, there are applications when the residual components are those who tell the story :-)
