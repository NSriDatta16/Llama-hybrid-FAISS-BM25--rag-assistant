There is large body of work on this problem. It is generally referred to as social choice theory . The basic problem is to take the preferences of several individuals and try to aggregate them into preference for the group. The short answer is that the theory side is a gigantic mess with no clear solution emerging. I think your points system is the way to go on the basis of simplicity and transparency. The big problem with doing a ranking of items relative to each other is that you don't know the distance between them. One person might have the slightest preference for chocolate over vanilla while another might have a very strong preference. Without knowing the magnitude of how much happiness each item brings to the user constructing an aggregate ranking is very hard. Also, it is possible to get paradox's where the aggregate measure prefers item A to B, B to C and C to A. An alternative is to ask people how much would you pay for a cone of each flavor of ice cream. The situation becomes much easier for you, but harder for the user.
