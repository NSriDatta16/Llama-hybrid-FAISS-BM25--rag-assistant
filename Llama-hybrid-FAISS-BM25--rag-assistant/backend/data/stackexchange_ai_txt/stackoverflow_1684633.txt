Consider creating a rolling, rapid, off-site, automated backup of your data. S3 is so cheap these days that one might cron a mysqldump -type process to transfer your entire repository of data to a Transatlantic backup store every so often. How often exactly will depend on the evilness of your DBA. To make the process possible, simply find or institute a machine inside your network that the evil admin knows nothing about or wouldn't care to look at if she suspected anything. The simplicity and elegance of a plug computer can't be overstated here. Note on the actual export mechanism: knowing nothing about your particular system, I suggested mysqldump or Oracle exp as the simplest and dumbest solution. If your application has a way of exporting data in a native format (such as XML, JSON, or even Protocol Buffers - in other words, any format that parts of a, say, SOA application use to talk to each other), then that format can be used as the format of your rolling dump. I've implemented this approach on my gitosis box. Every three hours the contents get dumped to a European S3 bucket. It's a poor man's VCS of another VCS.
