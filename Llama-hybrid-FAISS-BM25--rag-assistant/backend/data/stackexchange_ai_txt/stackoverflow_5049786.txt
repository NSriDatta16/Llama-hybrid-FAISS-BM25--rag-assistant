How do I find out if product has a product image?

To get the image src in a template file the following code is used: $this->helper('catalog/image')->init($_product, 'small_image')->resize(200,100); But how can I find out if there is an image associated with the product or if the placeholder image will be used? (Magento v. 1.4.2)
