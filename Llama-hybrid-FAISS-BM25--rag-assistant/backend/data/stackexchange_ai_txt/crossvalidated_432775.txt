A sometimes useful alternative to the confidence band is to show the estimated line together with bootstrapped lines. Here is a simple, simulated example: EDIT Bootstrapping regression can be done in different ways, for instance: Resampling (with replacement) from the rows of the design matrix. This is what I have done here . A robust option, is valid even when assumptions like constant variance do not hold. But a philosophical problem, it does not really condition on the covariables, see What is the difference between conditioning on regressors vs. treating them as fixed? . Resmpling residuals. More dependent on assumptions like constant variance, but true to conditioning on predictors. Parametric bootstrap, more of a bayesian flavour. It could be interesting to try all tree and see how much of a difference it makes. R code for the simulation: set.seed(7*11*13) # My public seed a
