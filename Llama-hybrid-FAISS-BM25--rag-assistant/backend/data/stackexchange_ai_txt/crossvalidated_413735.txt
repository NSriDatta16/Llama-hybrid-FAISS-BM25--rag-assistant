Estimating probability density for forecasts

I've used a handful of algorithms for forecasting future values in a time series. But sometimes what I'm really interested in is not the predicted value, but the probability that some future will be below (or above) some threshold. So I'm trying to figure out a way to turn the output of a forecast into an estimate of probability. Forecast algorithms usually return, at minimum, a prediction and a confidence interval (often 95%). So perhaps I could make the assumption that the probability density function is normally distributed, centred on the prediction. If $x_{pred}$ is the prediction, the probability density would be $f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2} } e^{ -\frac{(x-x_{pred})^2}{2\sigma^2} }$ So next I need to know (or estimate) $\sigma$ . The 95% confidence interval is $x_{pred} \pm 1.960 \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$ , so I can calculate $\sigma$ if I know (or can estimate) n. Would it make any sense to set $n \approx$ the number of data points used in making the forecast? Alternatively, forecast models often provide the standard error. Would it make any sense to use this as an estimate of $\sigma$ ? In theory, I could re-implement a standard algorithm to get access to the information I need. However, I want to be able to use existing implementations, including ones that might be available in future.
