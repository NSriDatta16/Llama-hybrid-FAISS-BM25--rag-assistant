What does it means getting p-values equal to 1 and complete separation in logistic regression?

I was really confused if I should ask this here or in Stackoverflow, but I'll give a shot here. I ran a logistic regression using statsmodels library in Python. However, two things went wrong here (which I think are the same), I got all dependent variables with p-values equal to one and a message "Complete Separation: The results show that there is complete separation. In this case the Maximum Likelihood Estimator does not exist and the parameters are not identified." So my question is about what this result means. This is what I've done (in case anyone want to check it out): import statsmodels.api as sm y = model_df[['var_y']] X = model_df['var1','var2','var3','var4'] logit_model = sm.Logit(y_train, X_train) result = logit_model.fit() print(result.summary())
