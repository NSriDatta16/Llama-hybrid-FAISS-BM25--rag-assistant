Reading the docs, the subrepo plugin supports this functionality. I haven't used it yet, but will likely start using it in the near future. It is improved every release of Mercurial, and I believe people are successfully using it. It seems to get a reasonable amount of attention, and was on the agenda for the last coding blitz. According to the help , pull, push, commit etc should act on the subrepo as well. It sounds like a commit will check if there are any changes in the subrepo. If there are, they will be committed, and the new changeset in the subrepo will be recorded in the .hgsubstate file. This file, as well as the changes in the main repo will then be committed. When you clone, Mercurial should see the .hgsubstate as well as the .hgsub file, and correctly pull the subrepo, and update to the correct revision.
