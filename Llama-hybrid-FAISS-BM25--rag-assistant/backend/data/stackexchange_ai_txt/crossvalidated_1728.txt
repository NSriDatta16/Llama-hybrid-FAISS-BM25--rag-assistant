I would go straight to VideoLectures.net . This is by far the best source--whether free or paid--i have found for very-high quality (both w/r/t the video quality and w/r/t the presentation content) video lectures and tutorials on statistics, forecasting, and machine learning. The target audience for these video lectures ranges from beginner (some lectures are specifically tagged as "tutorials") to expert; most of them seem to be somewhere in the middle. All of the lectures and tutorials are taught to highly experienced professionals and academics, and in many instances, the lecturer is the leading authority on the topic he/she is lecturing on. The site is also 100% free. The one disadvantage is that you cannot download the lectures and store them in e.g., itunes; however, nearly every lectures has a set of slides which you can download (or, conveniently, you can view them online as you watch the presentation). YouTube might have more, but even if you search Y/T through a specific channel, i am sure the signal-to-noise ratio is far higher--on VideoLectures.net, every lecture i've viewed has been outstanding and if you scan the viewer reviews, you'll find that's the consensus opinion towards the entire collection. A few that i've watched and that i can recommend highly: Basics of Probability and Statistics Introduction to Machine Learning Gaussian Process Basics Graphical Models k-Nearest Neighbor Models
