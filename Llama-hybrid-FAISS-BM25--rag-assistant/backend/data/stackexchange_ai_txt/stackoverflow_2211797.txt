I think there are many developers and projects out there that found the same issues about the ESB toolkit that you describe. I've seen a handful of projects and companies leverage the toolkit but usually what I see is that the source code is used (not the MSIs and/or compiled code, the source is cleaned up and only parts of it are deployed on the project. I've seen the ESB portal be used the most for its "out of the box" error management features and since its ASP.NET I've seen and been part of extensions built for it. I think it will get there, kind of reminds me of the early years of the enterprise library, in my opinion it only got enterprise ready after 3-4 years of development.
