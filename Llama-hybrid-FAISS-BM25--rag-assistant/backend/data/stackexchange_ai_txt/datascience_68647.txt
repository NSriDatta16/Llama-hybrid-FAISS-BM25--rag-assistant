The meaning of random word dropout in NLP

I have been reading the early paper on pre-training in NLP ( https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.01432 ) and I can't understand what random word dropout means. The authors completely ignore explaining this method as if it was a standard thing. Can someone explain what they really do and what is the purpose of that?
