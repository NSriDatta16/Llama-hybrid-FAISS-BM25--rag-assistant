Exact confidence intervals are acceptable ways of modeling prevalence or rates. In large samples, they approximate interval estimates based on normal approximations to the mean. In small samples, they provide better coverage than normal approximations. To find a discussion on the adequacy of these methods, I recommend "Modern Epidemiology" by Kenneth Rothman. R gives different results to the binomial and the poisson confidence intervals because you are using a different probability model for the prevalence. In the Poisson case, the prevalence can theoretically take values greater than 100%. This may in fact be a good thing because it tends to estimate a longer right tail in prevalences than are less than 50%. It is perhaps more important to emphasize how similar they are, given the large sample of 142 cases out of 742 observations.
