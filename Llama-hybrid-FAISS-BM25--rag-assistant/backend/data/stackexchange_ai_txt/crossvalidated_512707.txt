You might be trying to push these data a bit too far. First, unpenalized logistic regression models typically need about 15 cases in the least-prevalent outcome class per predictor to avoid overfitting. With only 33 trials showing Solved = 0 , you should be wary of evaluating more than 2 or 3 predictors. If you count the random-intercept effect as a single predictor, you have 7 predictors in your model. Also, of the 13 Individual s, 4 account for 23 of those 33 trials, 2 have no trials with Solved = 0 , and 4 more have only 1 trial each with Solved = 0 . Be cautious. Second, each Individual has a single value of each of Sex , Age , and Neophilia , in addition to Zoo , for all trials.* Removing any one of those predictors from the original full mixed model removes the singularity problem. I can't say precisely why that is the case, but it presumably has to do with the ratio of the number of such predictors (4) to the number (13) of separate individuals. Perhaps once you have identified the associations of those 4 fixed predictors with outcome, there isn't much left to further associate with the Individual s as random effects. The implications for your questions: whether it is legitimate to simplify the full model by removing a fixed effect based on the p value ... You should be evaluating fewer predictors in any event. What you are proposing is similar to backward stepwise selection of predictors, probably the least objectionable of stepwise approaches. It would be better to use your knowledge of the subject matter to choose the most crucial fixed-effect predictors to include from the beginning. Or could my result with the full model provide enough support to argue that there is not enough individual variation so I don't have to account for repeated measures? If you perform the no- Zoo model both with the Individual random effect and by completely ignoring the Individual values (in a glm ), you get very different results. The magnitudes of the fixed-effect coefficients are about 10 times larger in the no- Zoo mixed model than in a no- Zoo glm model that omits Individual . That raises red flags. I suspect that this has to do with overfitting. For example, the fixed-effect coefficients of models restricted to Persistence , Neophilia and Diversity are quite similar whether Individual is ignored (with glm ) or included as a random-effect intercept (with glmer ). Look carefully at your data and apply your knowledge of the subject matter to decide how best to proceed. *That's why the last 4 coefficients for levels of Individual in the glm model without random effects are NA . Had you listed Individual as the first predictor in the model formula, then those 4 predictors would have had the NA values instead.
