A problem about confidence interval

How can I solve this? Two new drugs were given to patients with hypertension. The first drug lowered the blood pressure of $16$ patients an average of $11$ points, with a standard deviation of $6$ points. The second drug lowered the blood pressure of $20$ other patients an average of $12$ points, with a standard deviation of $8$ points. Determine a $95\%$ confidence interval for the difference in the mean reductions in blood pressure, assuming that the measurements are normally distributed with equal variances. My attempt: I think I need to use the identity for the pooled estimator $S_{p}^{2}$ given by $$S_{p}^{2}=\frac{(n_1-1)^{2}+(n_2-1)S_{2}^{2}}{n_1 + n_2-2}$$ where $S_{i}^{2}$ is the sample variance from the $i$ -th sample, $i=1,2,\ldots,n$ . First step: I am just beginning to deal with these kinds of problems and I don't know how to approach the problem. So, my question is how can I solve the problem using the definition of $ S_{p}^{2}$ that I have learned?
