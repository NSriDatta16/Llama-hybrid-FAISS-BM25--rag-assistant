The real reason I'm raising this question though, is because my DB fields that store my user input are in "latin1_swedish_ci" and I want to know whether I NEED to convert them to "utf8_general_ci"? No. latin1_swedish_ci and utf8_general_ci are collations - not charsets. The collation won't affect the way that characters are stored or input/output. It only controls how sorting functions order their results. The collation - to work as expected - should match the storage charset. So if your tables are stored in utf8, you should use a utf8 collation. The storage charset for mysql is not directly tied to the charset in php. You can use utf8 as the storage characterset for Mysql, while using iso-8859-1 in php. In that case, you need to tell Mysql about it, by setting the charset on the connection ( set names XXX ). Mysql will then convert as needed. If you don't use the same charset on Mysql and php, you'll end up with the charset capacity that is the lowest dommon denominator, so even though strings are stored in utf8, you'll not have the full unicode range of characters available. Therefore you should use utf8 in both Mysql and php.
