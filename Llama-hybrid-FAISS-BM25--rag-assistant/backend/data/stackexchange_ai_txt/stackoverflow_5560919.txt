Silverlight 4 ListBoxDragDropTarget drop onto ListBoxItem

I have 2 list boxes (ListA and ListB) that display data from different entities (EntityA, EntityB). These entities are related - EntityA has a property of a collection of EntityB. I want to be able to use drag and drop behaviour in order to add items from ListB into the collection of the dropped item in ListA. To clarify, I don't want to add ListItemB into the collection of the selected ListItemA, I want to add it into the collection of the list item that I drop it onto (the ListItemA that the mouse is over when I release). Using ListBoxDragDropTarget, is it possible for a ListBoxItem to be the drop target, instead of the listbox itself? Any suggestions as to a solution for this scenario?
