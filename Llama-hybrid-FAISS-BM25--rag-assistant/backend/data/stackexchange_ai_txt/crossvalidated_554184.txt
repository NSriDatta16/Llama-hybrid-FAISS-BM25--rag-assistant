OP mentioned that they ended up selecting control groups for the treatments independently. In this case, if there is no clear bias in the assignment mechanisms of treatment A and treatment B (e.g. somehow applying treatment B also increases probability of treatment A), the subtraction in the calculation of average treatment effect should naturally cancel out the impact of the other treatment on both treatment and control group. If one suspects that there is some dependency between treatment A and treatment B, it is always possible to manually test for the independence of the two random events. In the case of treatment A and treatment B being dependent, without loss of generality, one can adjust for the bias from treatment B by conducting regression adjustment with the propensity scores of treatment A given treatment B. I suspect that's what OP went for directly without testing for independence.
