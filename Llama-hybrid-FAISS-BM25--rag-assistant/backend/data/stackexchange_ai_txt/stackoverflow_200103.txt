I would suggest: For representation in code, wchar_t or equivalent. For storage representation, UTF-8. For wire representation, UTF-8. The advantage of UTF-8 in storage and wire situations is that machine endianness is not a factor. The advantage of using a fixed size character such as wchar_t in code is that you can easily find out the length of a string without having to scan it.
