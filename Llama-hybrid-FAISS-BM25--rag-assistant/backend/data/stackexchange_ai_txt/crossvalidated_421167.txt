Is there a conjugate prior for normal location family N(x|u,1) such that the mean is always positive?

The conjugate prior to normal location family is usually a normal distribution. However, I want to constrain the mean to be positive. Is there a conjugate prior to the normal location family $x\sim N(u,1)$ such that the mean $u>0$ is always positive? Maybe a truncated normal distribution? https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/573694/bayesian-posterior-with-truncated-normal-prior However, truncated normal is not that helpful because it is a strong prior in terms of the posterior mean is going to be difficult to approach the boundary, unlike lognormal and gamma. Anything else? I tried gamma, inverse gamma, but I am not able to complete the square with the $\log u$ in the exponents of gamma.
