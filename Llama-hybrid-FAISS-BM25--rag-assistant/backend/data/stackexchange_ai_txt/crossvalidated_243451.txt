Your intuition is correct: in that case you want to compute by Monte Carlo an expectation under the joint distribution of $\mu$ and $\hat{\mu}$. Hence, if$$(\mu,\hat{\mu})\sim\nu(\mu)\times f(\hat{\mu}|\mu)$$the Monte Carlo approximation of$$\mathbb{E}_{\nu\times f}[L(\mu,\hat{\mu})]=\int L(\mu,\hat{\mu}) \nu(\mu)\times f(\hat{\mu}|\mu)\,\text{d}\mu\,\text{d}\hat{\mu}$$is obtained by simulating pairs $(\mu,\hat{\mu})$ from the joint distribution $\nu(\cdot)\times f(\cdot|\cdot)$, say $(\mu^s,\hat{\mu}^s)$, for $s=1,\ldots,S,$ and taking the average$$\frac{1}{S}\sum_{s=1}^S L(\mu^s,\hat{\mu}^s)$$ There is not particular reason for taking several realisations of $\hat{\mu}$ for a given realisation of $\mu$. (This point is discussed in more details in this other question . And on my blog .)
