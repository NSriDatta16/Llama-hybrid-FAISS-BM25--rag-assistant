The documentation says that libFM uses the LIBSVM file format. LIBSVM provides a python tool to validate data files, and that tool throws an error if the column indices are not in ascending order: https://github.com/tomz/libsvm-ruby-swig/blob/master/libsvm-3.1/tools/checkdata.py#L87 So I would assume that for libFM the column indices should also be in ascending order.
