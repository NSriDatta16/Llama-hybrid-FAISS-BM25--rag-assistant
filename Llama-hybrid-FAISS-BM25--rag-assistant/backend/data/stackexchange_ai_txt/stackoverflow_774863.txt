The problem is this: NHibernate works best (but not only) for DDD, this means for creating domain classes first and make the database best fitting the domain model. You have a composite-id relation to non-primary-key fields. So start praying that NHibernate can cope with that. Both composite-ids and relations by non-primary-keys are supported - for legacy databases - and generally discouraged for DDD. I think the combination of both does not work. See this issue on NHibernates issue tracker: https://nhibernate.jira.com/browse/NH-1722 . You can vote for the feature there.
