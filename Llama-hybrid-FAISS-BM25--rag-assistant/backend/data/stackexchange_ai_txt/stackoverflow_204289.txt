A working Drag&Drop enabled ListView implementation for WPF?

Been trying to find a working implementation of a WPF listview (or listbox) where you can order items by dragging them up or down. I have found a few, but none really works, for example this one http://www.codeproject.com/KB/WPF/ListViewDragDropManager.aspx?msg=2765618#xx2765618xx stops working once you have list where you need to scroll down to get to the last items. Why is Drag&Drop so hard in WPF? Does anybody know a working control?
