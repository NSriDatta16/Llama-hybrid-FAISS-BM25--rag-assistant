Why is the posterior proportional to $P(X=x|C=c_i)P(C=c_i)$?

When we are trying to maximum a posterior, we apply Bayesian rule to convert them into posterior probabilities! $P(C=c_i|X=x) = P(X=x|C=c_i)P(C=c_i) / P(X=x)$ proportional to $P(X=x|C=c_i)P(C=c_i)$, but how can i be sure that it is really the case?
