Machine learning for inequalities

This is a very general question about machine learning. Two of the most standard problems in ML are classification and regression. E.g. if we have pictures of buildings, we can classify them as two-story vs three-story, or predict their height in meters, assuming we have proper ground truth labels. But what if you need to answer something like: "what is the lower bound on the height of this building?" In other words, assuming all of the training data is correct, what is the absolute lowest this building can be (with 99% confidence)?
