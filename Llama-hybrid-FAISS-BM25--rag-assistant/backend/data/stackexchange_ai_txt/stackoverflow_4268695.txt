Anyway, check this http://labs.shikiryu.com/test-cookie.php : How do you check your cookie? 'cause, for example, in firefox, you must look for your domain (and not your subdomain). In chrome, ctrl+I, storage tab. Can you try this code on your server and come back to tell us if it works, it may comes from your unicode domain name. I've changed the code to (same url): if you try : http://labs.shikiryu.com/test-cookie.php?id=1&vote=1 you'll have bool(true) 1st cookie named viewz1 set to : viewed 1 http://labs.shikiryu.com/test-cookie.php?id=1&vote=3 => bool(true) 2nd cookie named votez1. is set to :voted 3 http://labs.shikiryu.com/test-cookie.php?id=1&vote=2 => won't show anything since both cookies are set.
