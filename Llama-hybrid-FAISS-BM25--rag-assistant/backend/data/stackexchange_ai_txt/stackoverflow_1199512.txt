Grails + sqlite

Is there any way to use SQLite as a database storage for my Grails app? If I use a SQLite JDBC driver ( http://www.zentus.com/sqlitejdbc/ ), my app fails to start with "Could not determine Hibernate dialect for database name [SQLite]" The only workaround I found was http://d.hatena.ne.jp/torutk/20090711/p3 (it's in Japanese, have it google translated if you want), but it does not make any help. Or, is the idea of using SQLite for web apps so terrible that nobody uses it?:) EDIT: Yes, I know, the default Grails HSQLDB support works just fine, but my web app is a part of a bigger system which uses solely SQLite, so we would prefer end up supporting only one database instead of both HSQLDB and SQLite.
