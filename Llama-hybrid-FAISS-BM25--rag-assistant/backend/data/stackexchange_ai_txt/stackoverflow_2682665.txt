If this error is preventing you from progressing and is a small dataset you could could hydrate your retrieval from the database by by enumerating the query (call ToList). From that point on, your operations will be against in-memory objects and you may not encounter the error you are receiving. var countries = (from c in Country where c.IsActive.Equals(true) orderby c.CountryName select c).ToList(); var countryCodes = (from c in countries where c.IsActive.Equals(true) orderby c.CountryName select new { countryIDCode = c.CountryID + "|" + c.TwoDigitCode, countryName = c.CountryName });
