Addressing your concern in the earlier paragraph about repeated code in controllers... With Kohana, I generally put common controller code in a base controller and inherit all my controllers from that. For example, in one project I am using a modified version of Template_Controller to make a reference to the Auth module available to every page as $this->auth. abstract class Template_Controller extends Controller { /* @var Auth_Core reference to authorization class */ protected $auth; public function __construct() { parent::__construct(); [snip] $this->auth = new Auth(); } [...] } Now all my controllers start out like this: class Help_Controller extends Template_Controller { All controllers thus have access to $this->auth inside any function. Agree to keep biz logic out of views, that's the whole idea.
