There are a few ways to handle this in GWT, this is a great discussion on the subject. Seems like the best option is to serve up static SEO content when the user-agent is a bot, as long as the SEO content is identical to what is served via the GWT route. This can be a lot of work, but if you really want a fully rich GWT app that is optimized for search engines it may be worth it.
