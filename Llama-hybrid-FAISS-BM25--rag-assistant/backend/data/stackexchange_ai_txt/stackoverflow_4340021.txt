jQuery: execute something after an effect is finished

I have a top nav bar, when you click on an item a megamenu slides down, if you click on it again, the megamenu slides back up. Sometimes, I have elements (links and paragraphs) whose z-index is higher than the mengamenus, so when the megamenus slide down, they appear on top of the megamenu. I solved this issue with the code below. However, by solving this issue, another one came up and this is where I need help: When the megamenus are sliding back up, the z-index of the elements is immediately changed back to 1, thus the elements appear on top of the megamenu while the megamenu is sliding back up. Is there a way to have the action of changing the z-index of those elements AFTER the megamenus have finished sliding back up? Here's my code so far: $('.click-menu h6 span').click(function() { if ($(this).hasClass('selected')) { $(this).removeClass('selected'); $(this).parent().next().slideUp('fast'); $('.generic-box a, .generic-box p').css('z-index', '1'); } else { $('.click-menu h6 span').removeClass('selected'); $(this).addClass('selected'); $('.click-menu div').slideUp('fast'); $(this).parent().next().slideDown('fast'); $('.radio-btns-wrapper-wjs').slideUp('fast'); $('.generic-box a, .generic-box p').css('z-index', '0'); } }); Any help would be greatly appreciated.
