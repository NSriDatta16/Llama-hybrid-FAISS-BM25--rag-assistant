I sometimes wish developers to pay more attention to details. The notice you're getting is coming from this line: print_r($subject_cat['Subjectscat']['Subjects']) If you replace that line with this one you will see why: debug($subject_cat) "Subjects" key does not exist in your array, all models are singular, remember? What you need to do there is a foreach loop: foreach ($subject_cat['Subject'] as $subject) { // output stuff you need from $subject } Remember the debug() function , it is a great tool. Another way to debug your stuff is the excellent debug_kit plugin ; very easy to set up and very, very useful.
