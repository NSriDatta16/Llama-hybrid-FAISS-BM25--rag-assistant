Item Parceling As @Christian Geiser suggests in his answer, you should look into the item parceling literature $^1$ . Item parceling, according to Sterba (2011): involves the averaging or summing of several raw items to form a single score, which can then be used as an indicator of a latent variable in a factor analysis model or structural equation model. Hopefully, this answers your question: Is this type of aggregation ever allowed? as Sterba (2011) and the references provided by @Christian Geiser demonstrate that this (i.e., item parceling) is commonly done in practice. Model fit When I run CFA where latent factors map to each induvial item and add a method factor for each set of items within a scenario, I get marginally decent or bad fit statistics. However, if I first sum the related items in each scenario [see figure 2], this new model produces really fantastic fit statistics. Is this type of aggregation ever allowed? If so, when is this allowed, and when is it not allowed? Why? And where are the references that talk about this? Now, regarding your question about fit $^2$ , I am not surprised that your second model (i.e., the one that used item parceling) fits better. My main reason for this is that it has been demonstrated that (paradoxically) many fit indices (and the RMSEA in particular) display worse fit as the number of items increases. See Shi et al. (2019) for more information on this point. $^1$ Also see Sterba (2019), which is my favorite article on this topic. Further, you can check out the Quantitude podcast episode on item parceling. $^2$ Also,there are additional considerations that should be made when evaluating the fit of a model that uses item parceling. For more information on this, see not only Sterba (2011), but also Sterba & MacCallum (2010) and Sterba & Rights (2017). References Shi, D., Lee, T., & Maydeu-Olivares, A. (2019).
