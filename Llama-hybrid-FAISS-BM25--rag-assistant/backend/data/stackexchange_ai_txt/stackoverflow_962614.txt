Embedding PowerPoint Chart into Excel

If I embed a PowerPoint Presentation within an Excel Worksheet, then, within the PowerPoint, set up chart objects on each slide, can I go into the data table for the chart object, and have it refer back to the Excel spreadsheet for its data? If so, how? Note: I'm asking for Office 2003
