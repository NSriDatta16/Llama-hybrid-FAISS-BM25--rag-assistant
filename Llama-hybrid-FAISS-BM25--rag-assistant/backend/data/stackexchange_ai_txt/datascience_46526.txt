Which part of the data should I use for Linear Regression?

I have a dataset composed of Carbon Monoxide level per 5 seconds (up to 20 seconds) as my independent variables/features and mg/dl (Glucose) as dependent variable. I want to use Regression to make a model for the CO level in breath vs Glucose in blood. Should I use the average of four instances (5s, 10s, 15s, 20s), should I have them all as features? Or should I manipulate it first? My data goes like this CO(5s) | CO(10s) | CO(15s) | CO(20s) | mg/dl 161 168 165 170 8.6
