I would suggest moving away from any sort of config file and instead use some type of local database such as sqlite or sql server express which is much more resilient to app crashes. IMHO, config settings shouldn't be a default container for user settings. To me a config file is there to make sure the app runs in the given environment. For example, defining connection strings or polling rates or things of that nature. User settings, especially ones that change often, need a better storage mechanism such as a local database. Unless, of course, it's a client/server application. In which case those settings should be up at the server itself and only persisted locally if the app has to work in a disconnected state. The example you gave, one of configuring what appears to be one or more alarms is a perfect example of something that belongs in a database table.
