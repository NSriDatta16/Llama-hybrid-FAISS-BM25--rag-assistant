Even if you have an agreed level of coverage, code coverage would only tell you if you meet that level, not if the tests are any good. But even with its limitations coverage (and the stats you can derive from it, such as CRAP (coverage over complexity, Clover can display the same data as tag cloud, tis very neat) is still useful for getting a rough idea how how well the code is tested and if where potential bugs will be hiding. No silver bullets exists, but that does not mean you should not use of every regular bullet you can find. Bind them together (Code coverage with CI, trends and coverage over complexity and maybe some code mutation) and you end up with a powerful method to quickly informing you of potential issues.
