Yes try this: string[] words = txtSearche.Split(' '); which will give you: words[0] = put words[1] = returns words[2] = between words[3] = paragraphs EDIT: Also as Adkins mentions below, the words array will be created to whatever size is needed by the string that is provided. If you want the list to have a dynamic size I would say drop the array into a list using List wordList = words.ToList(); EDIT: Nakul to split by one space or more, just add them as parameters into the Split() method like below: txtSearche.Split(new string[] { " ", " ", " " }, StringSplitOptions.None); or you can tell it simply to split by a single space and ignore entries that are blank, caused by consecutive spaces, by using the StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries enum like so txtSearche.Split(new string[] { " " }, StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries);
