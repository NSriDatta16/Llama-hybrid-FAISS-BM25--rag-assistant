User identification using machine learning

I am quite new to machine learning, and the task I was given was to find attributes that will allow me to identify users. I have a set of data for training that contains roughly 48,000 instances, where every instance is labeled with user id. The data are TCP sessions with data on destination, source, ttl, start time, endtime, destination IP addresses, and more. My task is to find attributes so that in given a difference TCP flows in the same format form the same group of users, I will be able to labeled them with the appropriate user Id. There are 10 users in the data set. My question is what the best way to do it, I tried using weka to run number of machine learning algorithm, but I couldn't configure them right, for example I tried to use K-means but the results didn't fit with the labeled user id.
