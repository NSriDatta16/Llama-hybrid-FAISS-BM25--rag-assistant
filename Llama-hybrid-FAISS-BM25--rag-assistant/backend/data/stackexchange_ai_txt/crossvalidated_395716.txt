If you care about modeling unrestricted $x$ , you shouldn't worry about $z$ 's distribution much, so the KL term is not a problem here. Instead, just replace your Bernoulli decoder $p(x|z)$ with a Gaussian one: $$ p(x|z) = \mathcal{N}(\mu(z), \sigma(z)) $$ That is, multivariate normal distribution with mean and scale generated by a neural network from $z$ .
