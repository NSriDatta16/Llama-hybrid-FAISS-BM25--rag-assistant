While it is not very clear to me what specific relationships between your data you want to display, I can give some general advice. I think that this time series visualization calls for so-called diverging color scheme (as opposed to sequential , categorical and other ones). ColorBrewer is nice online tool for selecting an appropriate color scheme and other parameters (note that ColorBrewer 's color schemes have built-in support in major data analysis and visualization software, such as R, Python, d3.js, plot.ly and others). If you would use R environment, it would be quite easy to produce the time series trend line chart that you want by using ggplot2 package and its scale_color_gradient2() function: ... + scale_color_gradient2(midpoint=midValue, low="blue", mid="white", high="orange" ) A quick glance at your profile suggested me that you would prefer a JavaScript solution. In that case, I would advise to use d3.js library or one of multiple other JavaScript visualization libraries or packages. For more details, check this relevant answer of mine.
