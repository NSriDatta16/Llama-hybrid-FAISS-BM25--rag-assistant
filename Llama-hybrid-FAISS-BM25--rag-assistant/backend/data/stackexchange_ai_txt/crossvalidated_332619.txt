The deep learning is an approach where you have a lot of relatively simple layers. You increase learning capabilities by increasing the number of layers, as opposed to increased complexity of layers. You could for instance come up with very fancy output functions, maybe nonlinear functions of inputs or complicated connections. Instead you stick with simple things like ReLU and liner combination and softmax, but stack a lot of layers one on top of other. That's why CNN perfectly fits into this very generic and rather vague definition of deep learning. Look at CNN's components, they are usually very simple MAX, convolutions etc.
