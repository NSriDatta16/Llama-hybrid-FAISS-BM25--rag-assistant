Help needed on using LINQ to SQL classes

Already Generated the default classes. There are 2: 1. DataContext 2. Table object class Now : 1. how to add functionality (extend) to the data class. i created seperate partial class. do i need to do any extension to data context ? Do i need to call generated-class constructor inside my own custom constructor ? How to create new instance of the data class ? A concern is that the DB name (Databahn) and (i dont know what else) is tightly attached by dbml. If i change my DB name etc. in future how does this pan out ? And can i change the class names. Don't want them to be same as DB table name ? [global::System.Data.Linq.Mapping.DatabaseAttribute(Name="Databahn")] public partial class AgentsDataContext : System.Data.Linq.DataContext
