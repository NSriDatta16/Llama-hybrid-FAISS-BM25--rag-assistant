LINQ compound aggregation

I have a simple LINQ question: I have a collection of FooBars. A Foobar has a foo property and a bar property. I want to aggregate both foo and bar without running through my collection of foobars more than once. Ie. I want something equivalent to SQL: SELECT SUM(Foo), SUM(Bar) From FooBars or int fooSum, barSum; foreach (var foobar in foobars) { fooSum += foobar.Foo; barSum += foobar.Bar; } Is there an elegant way to write this with a compound select (or similar) in LINQ?
