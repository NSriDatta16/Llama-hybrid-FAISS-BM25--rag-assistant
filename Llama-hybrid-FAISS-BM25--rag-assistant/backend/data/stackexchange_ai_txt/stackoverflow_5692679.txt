What affect does null in a database have?

Database vary in implementation and how they handle the querying and storing of the data. Does having null valued attributes consume storage space? Does having null valued attributes have an effect on the speed of querying of the data? Basically would querying be faster or slower if the data was present or not. Note. I'm not asking how to speed up a querying of data. So my question is a general one but feel free to answer for a specific database implementation like sql server or sqlite.
