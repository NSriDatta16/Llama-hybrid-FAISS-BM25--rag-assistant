"_OBJC_CLASS_$_CheckmarkTile" this type of errors come when the class 'CheckmarkTile' is not the member of current target. you have to make the member of current target. there are two ways to remove these errors:- 1. right click on Groups & Files in the xCode and select Target Membership. Now make sure that the membership check box is on for the class CheckmarkTile. 2. just drag the file named CheckmarkTile to the active Target->Compile Sources. Thats all what you need to solve these errors.
