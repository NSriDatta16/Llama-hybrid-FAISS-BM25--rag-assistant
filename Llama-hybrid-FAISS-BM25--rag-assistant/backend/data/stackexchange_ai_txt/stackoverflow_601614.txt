If you think about it there's no such thing as irrational user behaviour, there's just a mismatch between your expectations and theirs. The only way to close that is through dialogue. That doesn't necessarily mean going and doing usability studies, often the right dialogue is for them to read the help where the discrepancy is easily dealt with. The only wrong thing to do is to not listen to what they are saying - or to listen and not really hear them (see the post on here about IE on the Mac - it's the height of arrogance). Of course you are going to get some people who just don't like change and will whinge about anything, but in general if a user will take the time to point out something in your software which bugs them, then you should listen. You may choose to ignore them, but if you listen right you may just as easily uncover a real gem. I don't believe your users or customers will often innovate for you, but I strongly believe that they are the key to your software being usable, and usability leads directly to success. So to characterise them as irrational probably doesn't serve your best purposes - or theirs. Better to take them seriously to start with and filter out what you consider not to be good feedback.
