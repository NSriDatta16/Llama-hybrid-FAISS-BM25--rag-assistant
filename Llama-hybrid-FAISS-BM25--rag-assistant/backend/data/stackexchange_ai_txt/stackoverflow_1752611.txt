Debug -> Windows -> Call Stack (Ctrl + Alt + C is default bindings (I think)) Will show you the history of execution, you can double click events to go to definition, however you cannot step back in code But you can drag your little yellow arrow to another point in the code to re-execute some code, again this will not change what has already been executed
