Drop #div1 (draggable) into #div2 (droppable) only when a div that is a child of #div1 is over #div2

I try to drop a div into another one, using his child as the area that should activate the droppable. To make things more clear let's say that we have #parent_div, #child_div and #droppable. I want to drag #parent_div over #droppable, but be able to drop it only when the smaller div (#child_div) inside it is over #droppable. Is this possible using jQuery UI? Thanks
