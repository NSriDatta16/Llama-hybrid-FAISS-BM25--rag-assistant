The answer is yes. There is a paper Intra-class Variation Isolation in Conditional GANs ( https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.11296.pdf ) discussing it. They propose a "C-GAN that is able to learn realistic models with continuous, semantically meaningful input parameters". They actually cover generating images of people at different ages as well.
