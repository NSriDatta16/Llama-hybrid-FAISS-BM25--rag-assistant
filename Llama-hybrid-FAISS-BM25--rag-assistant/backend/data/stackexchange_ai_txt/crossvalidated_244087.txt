In theoretical physics random matrices play an important role to understand universal features of energy spectra of systems with particular symmetries. My background in theoretical physics may cause me to present a slightly biased point of view here, but I would even go so far to suggest that the popularity of random matrix theory (RMT) originated from its successful application in physics. Without going too much into detail, for example energy spectra in quantum mechanics can be obtained by calculating eigenvalues of the systems Hamiltonian - which can be expressed as an hermitian matrix. Often physicists are not interested in particular systems but want to know what are the general properties of quantum systems that have chaotic properties, which leads the values of the hermitian Hamiltonian matrix to fill the matrix-space ergodically upon variation of the energy or other parameters (e.g. boundary conditions). This motivates treating a class of physical systems as random matrices and looking at average properties of these systems. I recommend literature on the Bohigas-Gianonni-Schmidt conjecture if you want to dive into this deeper. In short, one can for instance show that energy levels of systems that have time reversal symmetry behave universally different than energy levels of systems which have no time reversal symmetry (which happens for instance if you add a magnetic field). An in fact quite short calculation using Gaussian random matrices can show that the energy levels tend to be differently close in both systems. These results can be extended and helped to understand also other symmetries, which had a major impact on different fields, like also particle physics or the theory of mesoscopic transport and later even in financial markets.
