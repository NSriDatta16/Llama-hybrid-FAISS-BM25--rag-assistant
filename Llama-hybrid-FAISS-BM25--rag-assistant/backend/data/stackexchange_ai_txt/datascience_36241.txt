Is it possible to change the sequence of convolution layer and pooling layer?

Many CNN architectures sequentially consist of convolution layers and pooling layers. I just wonder if it is possible to change the sequence of convolution layers and pooling layers. If not, could you explain the reasons why a convolution layer precedes to a pooling layer?
