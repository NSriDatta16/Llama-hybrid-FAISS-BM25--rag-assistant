I haven't had much experience with deep learning, but I have tried it on "vanilla" ML techniques. In Python , I've had some success using a package called hyperopt (link) , although if you're interested in Bayesian methods then take a look at Spearmint (link) . If you're using R , then take a look at rBayesianOptimization .
