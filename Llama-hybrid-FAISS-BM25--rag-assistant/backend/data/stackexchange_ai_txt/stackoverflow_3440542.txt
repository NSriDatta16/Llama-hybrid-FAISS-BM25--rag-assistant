How to avoid userinput while playing a soundloop complete

I have some UIImageViews (Animals) and by touching them a specific soundloop starts to play. But if the user touches twice or more on the same View, the apropriate soundloop starts over and over again with an overlap. I wanna have that the touched sound is played once until its end and than the user can start the next time. The duration of a soundloop is approx. 3 sec.I tried something with "sleep(3); but it stops the prog before the sound is playing.. But if the user touches another View, two different sounds can overlap. #pragma mark - -(void)touchesBegan:(NSSet*)touches withEvent:(UIEvent*)event { //Soundfile names in array arrAnimalde arrAnimalde = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:@"Hund" ,@"Schwein" ,@"Ferkel", nil]; // here are some Views and their triggers if([touch view] == img_hund){ trigAnimal = 0; } if([touch view] == img_schwein){ trigAnimal = 1; } if([touch view] == img_ferkel){ trigAnimal = 2; } AudioServicesCreateSystemSoundID ((CFURLRef)[NSURL fileURLWithPath:[[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource: [arrAnimalde objectAtIndex: trigAnimal] ofType: @"wav"]], &soundFileObject); AudioServicesPlaySystemSound (self.soundFileObject); //if the trigger is the same as before play the sound only once and completely } } Please write alternative solutions too - maybe with the possibilities to start and hold the sound in every if-statement. Thanxx
