I think what I have learnt from this and from looking around at all of the different vendors is that they really do all offer something slightly different in different areas. To pick a suite before confirming your requirements is not sensible. Having determined your high level requirements you can then go through each of the suites and find the short list of vendors who do what you need. In the meantime, I think I'm going to still with Infragistics (if anyone's interested)
