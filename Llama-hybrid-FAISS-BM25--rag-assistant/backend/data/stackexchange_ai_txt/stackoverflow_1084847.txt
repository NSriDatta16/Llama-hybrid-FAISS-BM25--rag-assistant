I think we should be clear on the status of Remoting. It most likely will never be improved. It most likely will have a sharply reduced number of bugs fixed. It could reach the point where only business-critical bugs, or security-critical bugs, will ever be fixed. You may also want to consider that Microsoft apparently does not consider a "Remoting" solution to be necessary. That is, the solution where there is an object in a server, complete with state, and a remote machine may make method calls that actually go to that specific object, across the network, via a proxy. Note that a great deal of the technology of Remoting is part of WCF. The channel and message stack extensibility; the extent of the configurability; all of those things are part of WCF. Frankly, I see no reason for you to change your existing code. However, I recommend that you take the time to reach the point in your organization where, if you would have started a new project using Remoting, that you can be comfortable using WCF instead. Finally, is there any part of Remoting that you feel WCF does not accommodate? I mean, other than the fact that behavior and data have been separated in WCF. P.S. In my opinion: WSE is obsolete. Don't use it unless you have no other choice at all. Replace it as soon as possible. ASMX is now publicly acknowledged to be "legacy technology". See ASMX Web Services are a “Legacy Technology” , and comment if you feel like it. Remoting, in my opinion is pretty much in the same position as ASMX, as having had most, or all, of its features superseded by WCF.
