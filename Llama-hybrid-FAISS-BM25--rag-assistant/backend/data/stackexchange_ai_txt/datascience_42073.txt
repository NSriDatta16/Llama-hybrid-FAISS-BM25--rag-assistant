Json and XML are file-formats/file-types typically used for sharing information from and to the website or the webpage. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation while XML stands for eXtended Markup Language. Typically in data science, semi structured datasets are required to be shared, for which such file types comes very handy. The choice of sharing the semi-structured datasets largely depends on the user and these formats are used as they are easy to interface with web-frameworks too. Data could be stored into these file formats and can be parsed to a dictionary or a DataFrame. Structured data in the form of DataFrames is easy to process and use.
