I once worked in a project where there was an official limit of 20 lines of code per function. It was hell! I might be working with masks, moving data in or out of GUI elements, and then I'd be forced to write transferFirst10Elements() transferElements11Thru20() transferElements21Thru30() transferElements31Thru40() and railed against our policy as an example of dogma taken too far. Just to clarify, I think that initial function should indeed be broken up, but I don't agree with some other answerers that the breakdown should continue until there are no more fragments bigger than a screenful. There comes a point where managing zillions of tiny functions is more painful than managing somewhat fewer larger ones.
