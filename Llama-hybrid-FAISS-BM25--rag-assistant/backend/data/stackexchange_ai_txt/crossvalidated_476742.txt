Can't find loglinear model's corresponding logistic regression model

I have the loglinear model with parameters x, y, z, v, x y, x v, and z*v. As far as i understand there should exist a logistic regression model that essentially is equivalent to this, using v as response variable. How do i find it, and how does it look like? I have tried to derive it using the relationship described in http://teaching.sociology.ul.ie/SSS/lugano/node58.html . I end up with the parameters x, z and x*y for the logistic regression model which turns out to be incorrect when testing in R. I have also tried many other combinations of parameters in R but neither of the parameters in these models has the same values as the parameters in my loglinear model. The loglinear model and it's results looks like: Call: glm(formula = n ~ x * y + x * v + v * z, family = poisson(link = log), data = data41) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -0.87421 -0.32788 0.08769 0.38924 1.64946 Coefficients: Coefficient Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 4.01862 0.11901 33.767 --- Signif. codes: 0 ' ' 0.001 ' ' 0.01 ' ' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1 (Dispersion parameter for poisson family taken to be 1) Null deviance: 20311.0677 on 15 degrees of freedom Residual deviance: 7.7197 on 8 degrees of freedom AIC: 115.69 Number of Fisher Scoring iterations: 4 The logistic regression model(using same data): Call: glm(formula = v ~ x + z + x * y, family = binomial(link = logit), data = data41, weights = n) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -15.7143 -8.4149 -0.6557 4.6727 9.6823 Coefficients: Coefficient Estimate Std.Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 1.8298 0.1383 13.232 --- Signif. codes: 0 ' ' 0.001 ' ' 0.01 ' ' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1 (Dispersion parameter for binomial family taken to be 1) Null deviance: 1435.5 on 15 degrees of freedom Residual deviance: 1084.4 on 11 degrees of freedom AIC: 1094.4 Number of Fisher Scoring iterations: 7 I would expect that for example the parameter x*v in the loglinear model would have equivalent estimate and variance as the x parameter in the logistic regression model, however this is not the case. I am thankfull for help!
