Testing Response Time of PHP

For my research purposes, I have modified the php sinterpreter and I want to test the response time of the new modified interpreter. So I am looking for a script that would help me achieve my objective. I could simply request for a page which records start time and the end time but I want to measure the average time taken for 100 requests. Will Ajax or something be of help.
