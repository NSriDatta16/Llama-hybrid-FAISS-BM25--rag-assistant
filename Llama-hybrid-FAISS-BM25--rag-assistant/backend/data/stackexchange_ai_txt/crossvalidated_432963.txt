In terms of predictive performance, you could get the same result by engineering the predictors of a GAM model and then using a GLM. Although for a complex non-linear relationship between the target and predictor, the best way to engineer the feature for a GLM to match the performance of a GAM, would probably be to generate a GAM for that feature. However, I do not use GAMs primarily for predictive performance. I find the utility of GAMs is to determine the non-linear relationship between your dependent variable and a predictor. This relationship, and the confidence intervals, are more often than not all I want from the model. I can then make a useful visualisation of the results that help me explain the data. Practically the answer to your question is; if the relationship is simple then a simple transformation and GLM would probably perform just as well; if the relationship is complex then it would be hard to engineer the feature as well as GAM does; but if your primary goal is predictive performance, then just use gradient boosting or a neural network.
