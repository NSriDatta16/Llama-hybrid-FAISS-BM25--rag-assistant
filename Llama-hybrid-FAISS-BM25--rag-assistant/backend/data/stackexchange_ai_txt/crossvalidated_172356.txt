The confusion is probably due to how the data matrix is organized. In The Elements of Statistical Learning (and also in the Abdi & Williams paper you linked to), data matrix $\mathbf X$ has data points in rows and variables in columns; so one data vector is a row . Whereas a single data vector $\mathbf x$ is usually understood to be a column vector. So one has to be carefully watching the algebra: if you want to project the data onto an axis $\mathbf v$, you need to write $\mathbf X \mathbf v$, but $\mathbf v^\top \mathbf x$. Now, if $\mathbf X$ is centered and you do singular value decomposition (SVD) $$\mathbf X = \mathbf {USV}^\top,$$ then COLUMNS of $\mathbf V$ are principal axes (also called principal directions). The first column is the first axis, the second column is the second axis, etc. To project the data onto the first two principal axes, we write $\mathbf X \mathbf V_2$, where $\mathbf V_2$ are the first two columns of $\mathbf V$. The hyperplane spanned by the first two principal axes is spanned by the first two columns of $\mathbf V$. There is no contradiction.
