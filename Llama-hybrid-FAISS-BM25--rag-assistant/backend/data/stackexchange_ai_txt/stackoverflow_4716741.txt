I'd suggest you to use vmstat utility for CPU load measurement and ps to measure the CPU utilization per process. Unfortunately I do not remember exactly the command line options that you have to send but I am sure you can find them yourself easily. I implemented similar task several years ago. I ran vmstat (with required command line options) in background and read its output. So, I had the overall cpu and memory utilization. BTW vmstat "knows" to run periodically, so you even do not have to implement your own loop. Additionally I ran ps (with required parameters) that measured CPU of interesting process. Bottom line: there is 10% of java and 90% of shell scripting here. And the last note. The overall CPU utilization may be discovered using pure java: ManagementFactory.getOperatingSystemMXBean().getSystemLoadAverage() This returns system load average in last minute. So, if 1 min resolution is good for you use this instead of vmstat. Otherwise vmstat is your solution.
