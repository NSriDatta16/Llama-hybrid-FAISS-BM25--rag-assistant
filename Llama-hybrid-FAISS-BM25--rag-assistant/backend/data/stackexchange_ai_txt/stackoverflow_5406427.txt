Creating threads a Webapplication which is deployed in Tomcat

I am working on a web application which is deployed in Tomcat. We are using Spring, Hibernate, GWT at the client side). One of the functionality of this application is to send alerts ( emails ) to Users when any entity is created, updated or deleted. ( Alerts can be added by Users on the fly, so there is some processing involved - to decide which users should be notified by email ). Alert mechanism ideally should be asynchronous and it should be affect the performance of CRUD operation. First thing which came in my mind is to create a thread and have a blocking queue. Thread keeps polling blocking queue to see if it has got any events. But creating thread in web application is something which is discouraged by many Containers. Can someone advice/ suggest - is this the correct way of doing it ? or There are better ways of doing the same thing . Any pointers would be highly appreciated. Thanks in advance, Sachin
