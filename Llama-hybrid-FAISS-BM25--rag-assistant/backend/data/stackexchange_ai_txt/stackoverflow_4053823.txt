Fragment caching with Touch

Currently I am using fragment caching with an object key. And I expire the cache using Touch with updates the updated_at column and then the current cache become obsolete. And a new cache is generated the next time. The cache key for an object looks like this table_name/ID-updated_at Now I want to cache my products somewhere else. To do so I would like to do same thing as before which is simply give the object in cache options, but I can't do that :( It would be great if I could generate a key like this in order to still have my cache expired with the Touch. table_name/ID-something_updated_at Unfortunately this is not possible, does someone has any idea how I could solve my problem?
