Help diagnosing crash in Cocoa framework - possible memory leak?

I'm currently migrating the Fragaria framework from a GC-only environment to GC being supported. After the work was done (or what I thought had to be done to make it work) I was able to run the examples that come with the framework without any problems and Instruments didn't show any major memory leaks. I included non-GC Fragaria in my non-GC application and it crashes as soon as I place the cursor on it. To be honest the usage pattern is different from the examples as I'm embedding it in an instance of NSViewController instead of NSDocument. Can you give me some tips on how to debug this? I'm a bit lost on where to proceed now.
