How to get the best out of a "bad" set of features for regression?

I'm trying to learn a regression model for a computer vision / pattern recognition task, where I try to estimate a continuous variable from a set of visual features. I have done preliminary experiments and saw that some features perform better compared to others, I measure the performance with MAE (mean absolute error), so I have such a table: Feature MAE ------- ----- F1 5.5 F2 7.5 F3 8.5 etc. I see that F1 performs the best, i.e. yields the least cross validation error. The other features are not so bad either, but simple feature-level or score-level fusion does not decrease the MAE (it remains around 5.6 or so), so with this level of knowledge, I can't make use of F2 and F3 . So currently my best model is the one that just uses F1 . But I want to -if possible- include the information from other features as well. My learning strategy is instance level normalization + ridge regression. All the features have the same dimensionality (1000), and I have a dataset of 4000 samples. So my question is, are there alternative approaches that are commonly used for this type of situation? The alternatives I can think of are: Weighted score-level fusion (however I feel it is prone to overfitting, and it does not improve the accuracy that much) Dimension reduction (of F2 and F3 ) with PCA. (This didn't help either. Also, I feel like there is no point of choosing the maximally-variant subspace other than reducing the risk of overfitting because of the reduced dimensionality) Dimension reduction (of F2 and F3 ) with CCA (canonical correlation analysis) to select a subspace that is more "relevant" to the labels. I didn't actually try this because I don't know how to, but will it be beneficial? Also can CCA be applied to regression? I previously applied it to C -class classification to obtain a C-1 dimensional subspace, but does it make sense for regression? And are there other alternatives that can enable the use of the "bad" features such as F2 and F3 ? Thanks for any help,
