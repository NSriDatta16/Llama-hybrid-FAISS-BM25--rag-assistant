Your problem statement is not really clear but from what I have read seems that you could use Year as the index in order to do time series validation splitting . You can read a bit about it here and use the implementations of sktime by Alan Turing Institute or classic scikit learn . This will allow you to evaluate the performance of your model in a production environment since given the nature of your problem (real state) you will want to predict the prices for next given year. So, rather than using it as a feature, indexing by it and then splitting. If you are interested in using it as a feature you can calculate elapsed time from the first year and this will help the model to see if there is a trend over time. Or as categorical and do target encodings.
