How gradients are learned for pooling layers in Convolution Neural Network?

Assuming we could compute a layerwise Hessian of the error function when training a neural network, the error sub-surface of pooling layers will be flat.?? Is that correct? There is no weights to be learnt for pooling layer but for eg. max pool can have different values at different iterations? Will that effect the error surface?
