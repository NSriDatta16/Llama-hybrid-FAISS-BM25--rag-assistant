Fieldset disappears in quirks mode

I have a form which is split into multiple fieldsets which works fine in almost all browsers. When viewing in quirks mode in IE however, 3 of the 5 fieldsets are not visible. The html is rendered but they are not displayed. The offending outrage can be found here: http://www.pocketpayday.co.uk/apply-online.aspx . I can't see anything different between the sections that are displayed and those that aren't?
