One important alternative (which I advise) is to set up a local key-handling agent (e.g., ssh-agent or pageant ) to hold the decrypted key so that your code doesn't need to handle passwords at all. I find that's a much simpler method overall because it stops a lot of code from having to understand anything about passwords (which are harder to handle correctly than you might thinkâ€¦)
