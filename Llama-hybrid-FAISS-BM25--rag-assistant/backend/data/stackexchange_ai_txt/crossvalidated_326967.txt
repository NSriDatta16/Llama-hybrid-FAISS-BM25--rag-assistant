Analysis of a dataset including dichotomial, ordinal and % data

I'm working on a dataset which is giving me trouble. I have 200 samples (Sample 1, Sample 2...). An example dataset (limited to 15 samples) is here . My dataset is structured with the following columns (I'll try to simplify): Sample source. Type of data: dichotomic. It can be SEDIMENT or WATER. Sequencing technique. 4 categories: A,B,C,D (non numeric values) Salinity. 3 categories: salt, brackish, freshwater Depth. 5 categories: surface, epi, meso, bathy and abyssopelagic. (through 10) Abundance of phyla, expressed as % of the considered domain. In my opinion a PCA and a MDS are not useful for this kind of data. I'm trying to evaluate the relation between the abiotic variables (salinity, etc.) and the abundance of the phyla. What type of analysis can be useful to see the relation between Phyla abundance and abiotic variables like salinity and depth (see dataset example at link)?
