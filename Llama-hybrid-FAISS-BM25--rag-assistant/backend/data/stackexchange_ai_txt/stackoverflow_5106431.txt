If you want to stick to JavaHL way of accessing the repository, you can also install the 64 bits version of JavaHL. Referenced here - look at the paragraph saying Windows 64-bit . It will redirect you to slik subversion client You can install the whole client (I could not install only javahl with the custom install) To make sure it is taken into account, edit your eclipse.ini file and, after the -vmargs line, add -Djava.library.path=C:\programs\slik (or if you already have an item for the jni path, add your own path).
