AR model driven by non-iid input

I want to use an AR(1) model to describe a time series, but I know that the driving variable at each timestep is not iid. The autocorrelation function of the time series suggests an AR(1) process, but is there a way for me to modify the statistical formulation of an AR(1) process in the case where the driving noise violates the iid assumption?
