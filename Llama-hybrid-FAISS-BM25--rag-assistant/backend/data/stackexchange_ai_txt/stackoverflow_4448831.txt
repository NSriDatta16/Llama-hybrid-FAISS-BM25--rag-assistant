I'd expect that to work, although since \s includes \n and \r , perhaps it's getting confused. Or I suppose it's possible (but really unlikely) that the flavor of regular expressions that Visual Web Developer uses (I don't have a copy) doesn't have the \s character class. Try this: [ \f\t\v]$ ...which searches for a space, formfeed, tab, or vertical tab at the end of a line. If you're doing a search and replace and want to get rid of all of the whitespace at the end of the line, then as RageZ points out , you'll want to include a greedy quantifier ( + meaning "one or more") so that you grab as much as you can: [ \f\t\v]+$
