How does the draggable crosshair in Process Explorer work?

There is a feature in Sysinternal's Process Explorer that allows a crosshair to be dragged from the application to a control in any other application you are running and highlights said control. Does anyone know how this was achieved or if there is a .NET/C++ library out there that can be reused?
