Php scripts are not like Java server apps. Where your Java server will run for a long time, your php script will just be a one time thing. Instead of this kind of process : user make a request to Java-run server, server receive the request in one of it's infinite loops, server process it, server send the response, server wait for new request; you have this kind of thing : a webserver (Apache, Nginx, whatever other webserver) receive the user's request, understand it needs to be interpreted by php, starts a php child, this child do what's in the script, send its answer, dies, the server wait for new requests. So, when a php script ends, nothing (in good case) is left from it. But, a php script can use persistent storage on the server so another request can read from it. That's why you have files, databases and even shared memories functions. If the games state is for one user only, you can use sessions (usually files) to store your deck object. If it's meant to be used by multiple players, you should store it after serialization in a database.
