This is not so much a problem of logistic regression per se as it is a problem with classification accuracy as a performance measure. Note that balancing the data set is not necessarily the only valid approach. If one of the classes is actually much more common in the population (and not merely in your sample), a naive model (classifying everything as belonging to the most common category) really is a good guess. If the error costs are not symmetric, balancing the data set might lead you to err in the wrong direction (the more costly one). The problem also often comes up the other way around: Training/evaluating on some artificially balanced data set before using the resulting model in a strongly unbalanced situation (think detecting fraud or diagnosing a rare disease) where the usefulness of the model is not nearly as high as the raw accuracy would suggest. It all depends on your objectives and your cost structure.
