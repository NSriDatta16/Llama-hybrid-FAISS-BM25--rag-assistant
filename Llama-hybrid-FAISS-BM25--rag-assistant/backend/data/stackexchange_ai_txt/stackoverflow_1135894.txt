An example of a ROBOCOPY call would be ROBOCOPY C:\Users \\SERVER\backup\Users /MIR /R:0 /W:0 This copys everything under C:\Users to a network share at the UNC path \\SERVER\backup . If you don't know, what that means, google for 'UNC path' or find a nice tutorial that explains how to setup network shares under Windows. Instead of \\SERVER\backup , that copies to a remote machine, you are totally free to use something like H:\ to copy to a local drive like a USB mass storage device. The part /MIR /R:0 /W:0 are options of ROBOCOPY. Call ROBOCOPY /? to get an explanation for these. Cheers,
