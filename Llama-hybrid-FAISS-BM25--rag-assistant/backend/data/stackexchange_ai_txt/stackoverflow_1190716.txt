Can't get a JSON object to return from ASP.NET web servive using jQuery

I am finding many "solutions" to this seemingly common problem, but alas, none seem to work for me - of course. I have some jQuery code that is trying to post to an ASP.NET 3.5 web service. The web service is supposed to return some json. I am getting 501 Internal Server errors with the code below, but according to the solutions found online, this is how it is supposed to be! The error function in the jquery code displays a parsererror. If I change how the data parameters are passed to the service ( "userID=3456" ), and remove the contentType property and change the dataType to "text", then no errors, but it returns the JSON in an XML string. Here is my jQuery code: $.ajax({ type: "POST", url: "mywebservice.asmx/Initialize", data: "{'userID': '3456'}", dataType: "json", contentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8", success: function(result) { alert("success"); }, error: function(request, status, errorThrown) { alert(status); alert(errorThrown); } }); Here is my ASP.NET code: _ Public Function Initialize(ByVal userID As Integer) As String Dim scormInstance As New CMI(userID) Return scormInstance.ToJsonString End Function Here are the HTTP request and response through my browser (Firefox 3.5.1) http://localhost/cognition/webservices/cognitionapi.asmx/Initialize POST /cognition/webservices/cognitionapi.asmx/Initialize HTTP/1.1 Host: localhost User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.1.1) Gecko/20090715 Firefox/3.5.1 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729) Accept: application/json, text/javascript, */* Accept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7 Keep-Alive: 300 Connection: keep-alive Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8 X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest Referer: http://localhost/cognition/scorm-test2.html Content-Length: 20 Cookie: RadEditorGlobalSerializeCookie=[_ctl0__ctl0__ctl0_Content_mainContent_mainContent_txtSpecialInstructionsModules]-[]#[_ctl0__ctl0__ctl0_Content_mainContent_mainContent_txtSpecialInstructionsToolbars]-[]# Pragma: no-cache Cache-Control: no-cache {"userID":"1234"} HTTP/1.x 500 Internal Server Error Cache-Control: private Content-Length: 4956 Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8 Server: Microsoft-IIS/7.0 X-AspNet-Version: 2.0.50727 X-Powered-By: ASP.NET Date: Mon, 27 Jul 2009 21:24:41 GMT Any ideas as to what exactly I am doing wrong????!!!!???
