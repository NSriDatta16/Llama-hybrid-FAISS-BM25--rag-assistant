How useful is Bayesian Inference

Last few months, I had been exposed to Bayesian Inference in ML course With further investigation, I come to place where there is MCMC technique to simulate the posterior distribution. It seems interesting. However, I am not sure if it is really useful in the industry? Does anyone has experience with Bayesian Inference in practical? Take customer_lifetime_value as X for example Basically, my main question is how bayesian inference can be more useful than I just plotting frequency and cumulative frequency of historical X Because with frequency , i can estimate the mean X , With cumulative frequency , i can estimate prob[X>x] What is the advantage of trying to do bayesian inference
