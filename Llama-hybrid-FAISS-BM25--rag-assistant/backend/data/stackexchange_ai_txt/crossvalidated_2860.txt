PCA on out-of-sample data

We know that the projection matrix learned by PCA can be applied to out-of-sample data points to get their low-dimensional embedding. However, how reliable are these embeddings expected to be, as compared to the embedding obtained from PCA with these out-of-sample points combined with the original data? Consider this hypothetical pseudo out-of-sample setting: Let's say I have 1000 data points and I want to do PCA on them. Can I instead do PCA on maybe just 500 of them (in order to have some computational savings) and then use the learned projection matrix to get the embedding of the rest of the points as well (by treating them as out-of-sample data)?
