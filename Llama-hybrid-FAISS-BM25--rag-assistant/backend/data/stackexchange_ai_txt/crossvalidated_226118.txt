how many data should we choose for training and testing the neural network?

I am using MLP neural network. My question is for training the neural network and testing it how much splitting of data is needed like is there any rule that I always have to split data 70% for training and 30% for testing when I did this my accuracy was not good as when I split it into 10% for training and 90% for testing I got more accuracy... Is this valid?
