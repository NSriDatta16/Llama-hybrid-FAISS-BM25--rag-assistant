Show that a process is MA(3)

Let $X_t$ be a MA(1) time series - i.e., there is an IID $N(0,\sigma)$ process, $Z_t$, such that: (for some value $\theta$) $X_t = Z_t + \theta Z_{t−1}$ for $t= \cdots , -3, -2, -2, 0, 1, 2, 3, \cdots$ Suppose that we don’t get to observe the $X_t$ process, but rather $Y_t$ defined as: $$Y_t = (a +b t+c t^2) + X_t$$ Show that the process $W_t$ defined by second-differencing: $W_t = \nabla^2 Y_t$ is a MA process, like $X_t$, but is MA(3) (as opposed to MA(1) - as a result of second-differencing). I have no idea how to even start. I've read over every example in this chapter of the textbook, and all I can get from it is: $W_t = Y_t - 2 Y_{t-1} + Y_{t-2}$, so that leads to: $$W_t =((a +bt +ct^2) + X_t) - 2((a + b(t-1) + c(t-1)^2) + X_{t-1}) + ((a + b(t-2) + c(t-2)^2) + X_{t-2}$$ After that, I don't really understand how any of that progresses...
