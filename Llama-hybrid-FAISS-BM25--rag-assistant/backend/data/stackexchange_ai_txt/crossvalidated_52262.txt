It's talking about principal components. First, it finds the eigenvalues of the correlation matrix which it takes as input. Then it decides how many of those values are "reasonably big" by doing simulations and comparing them with the simulated values. Here is the key part of the code: valuesx and then later on: pc.test values.sim$mean))[1] - 1 results$nfact The whole function is written in R, so you can read its source code by typing its name in the R terminal. Here is a presentation which compares factor analysis with PCA and hopefully answers your question (see the last slide in particular): http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~ripley/MultAnal_HT2007/PC-FA.pdf
