This is a pretty broad topic, but if you want to go down the Core Data route, check out this book http://pragprog.com/titles/mzcd/core-data Core Data published by Pragmatic. Core Data is a persistence solution that is highly object oriented and integrated with cocoa. In my opinion it is relatively easy to implement basic persistence with it. Marcus Zarra, the author of the book I recommended also has a great Cocoa blog with lots of Core Data resources: http://www.cimgf.com/category/core-data/
