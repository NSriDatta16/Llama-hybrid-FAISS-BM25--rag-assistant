"Although the bias-variance decomposition may provide some interesting insights into the model complexity issue from a frequentist perspective, it is of limited practical value, because the bias-variance decomposition is based on averages with respect to ensembles of data sets, whereas in practice we have only the single observed data set. If we had a large number of independent training sets of a given size, we would be better off combining them into a single large training set, which of course would reduce the level of over-fitting for a given model complexity." - Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Bishop).
