Two types of kNN classifier algorithm

The following is copy-pasted from a lecture note on machine learning... k-NN classification can be realized in two ways: Selecting for the classified sample it's $k$ nearest neighbors for each class and computing than neighborhood radius $r_i$ for each of the classes. As the result of the classification, we select class $i$ , for which its radius $r_i$ is the smallest. Selecting for the classified sample it's $k$ nearest neighbors in the training set (without taking class labels into account in this step). As the result of classification, we select class $i$ which is most numerous in the set of $k$ nearest neighbors of the classified sample. Can anyone explain what points (1) and (2) talking about? Are they talking about kNN for classification and kNN for regression , or something else?
