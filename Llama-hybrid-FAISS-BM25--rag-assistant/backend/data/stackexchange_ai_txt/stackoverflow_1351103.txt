In Perl, is there graceful way to convert undef to 0 manually?

I have a fragment in this form: my $a = $some_href->{$code}{'A'}; # a number or undef my $b = $some_href->{$code}{'B'}; # a number or undef $a = 0 unless defined($a); $b = 0 unless defined($b); my $total = $a + $b; The reality is even more messy, since more than two variables are concerned. What I really want to write is this: my $total = $some_href->{$code}{'A'} + $some_href->{$code}{'B'}; and have undef correctly evaluate to 0 but I get these warnings in almost every run: Use of uninitialized value in addition (+) at Stats.pm line 192. What's the best way to make these messages go away? NB: I 'use strict' and 'use warnings' if that s relevant.
