Chances are that your iterator is actually pointing at the 3 -- but it's not certain. The general idea is to allow vector to allocate new storage and move your data from one block of storage to another when/if it sees fit to do so. As such, when you insert or delete data, the data might move to some other part of memory entirely. At least that was sort of the intent. It turns out that other rules probably prevent it from moving the data when you delete -- but the iterator is invalidated anyway, probably because somebody didn't quite understand all the implications of those other rules when this one was made.
