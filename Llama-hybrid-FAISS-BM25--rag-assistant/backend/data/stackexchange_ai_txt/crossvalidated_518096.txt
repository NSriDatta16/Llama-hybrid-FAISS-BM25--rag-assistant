How do get rid of (1 not defined because of singularities) in R?

I'm analyzing data in R, I'm trying to see how some variables affect test scores (Value) of different countries. In the data, since there is different time periods for different countries I need to use a panel technique to regress this data. I'm using a fixed-effect model, more specifically a constant-free model, where you include dummy variables for every particular country. In the equation I took off the intercept to eliminate collinearity. When I ran the regression, I could see the statistical information for all variables except one. I get "NA" for this variable in R. I think my model still suffers from collinearity and I think the solution to fix this problem is just to drop one dummy variable from the equation. I did do that and I'm no longer getting "(1 not defined because of singularities)". I just wanted to double check with someone else if I did the right thing? This is my code: library(stats) library(lmtest) library(dplyr) library(plm) # running fixed effects with country dummies Data_we_using2 $LOCATION = as.factor(Data_we_using2$ LOCATION) dummyregress = lm(Value ~ Boysdummy + RGDPCapita+Graduation_rates + MissingGraDummy + Mortality_rate + GovtExpen + MissingGovt + Private + LOCATION-1, data = Data_we_using2) summary(dummyregress) LOCATION is the dummy variables of the countries. The pictures I included is the output I got for R.
