Your problem typically occurs in hierarchical clustering where the distance $D$ between clusters needs to be computed, whilst only a distance $d$ between individual points is defined (e.g. the Euclidean distance). There are different standard solutions named single linkage , complete linkage or average linkage , e.g. $$D_{single}(C_1,C_2) = \min\{d(x,y)\,\mid\, x\in C_1, y\in C_2 \}$$
