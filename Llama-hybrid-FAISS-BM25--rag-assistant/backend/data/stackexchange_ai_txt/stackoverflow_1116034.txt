How can I use the "s///" operator in order to change number of values?

I have a file that contains: foo1 = 1 foo2 = 2 foo3 = 8 . . . I need to replace only the values (1,2,8...) in that file with part of a memory hash values, the ones with the same keys (foo1 -> 33,foo2 -> 44,foo3...) How can I change it using the "s///" operator? If there is other elegant ways to conduct it I'll be happy to know. Thanks for any help, Yohad.
