Converting similarity matrix to (euclidean) distance matrix

In Random forest algorithm, Breiman (author) constructs similarity matrix as follows: Send all learning examples down each tree in the forest If two examples land in the same leaf increment corresponding element in similarity matrix by 1 Normalize the matrix with number of trees He says: The proximities between cases n and k form a matrix {prox(n,k)}. From their definition, it is easy to show that this matrix is symmetric, positive definite and bounded above by 1, with the diagonal elements equal to 1. It follows that the values 1-prox(n,k) are squared distances in a Euclidean space of dimension not greater than the number of cases. Source In his implementation, he uses sqrt(1-prox) , where prox is a similarity matrix, to convert it to distance matrix. I guess it has something to do with the "sqaured distances in a Euclidean space"-quoted above. Can somebody shine a little light on why it follows that 1-prox are squared distances in a Euclidean space and why he uses squared root to get distance matrix?
