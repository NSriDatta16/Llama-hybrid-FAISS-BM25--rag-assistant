In Environmental Statistics with S-Plus (CRC Press, 2001), Steven Millard and Nagaraj Neerchal state that a $\beta$ -content tolerance interval with confidence level $(1-\alpha)100$ % is constructed so that it contains at least $\beta 100$ % of the population ( i.e. , the coverage is at least $\beta 100$ %) with probability $(1-\alpha)100$ %. Citing several sources (Wald & Wolfowitz 1946, Guttman 1970, Gibbons 1994), they give an approximate two-sided tolerance interval for $n$ observations in the usual form of (sample mean) + $K$ (sample standard deviation) where $$K = r \sqrt{\frac{n-1}{\chi^2_{n-1, \alpha}}}.$$ Here, $\chi^2_{n-1,\alpha}$ is the $\alpha$ quantile of a chi-square distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom and $r$ solves the equation $$\Phi(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} + r) - \Phi(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} - r) -\beta$$ (with $\Phi$ the standard Normal CDF). Wald and Wolfowitz (1946) show that this approximation is quite good, even for values of $n$ as small as $2$ , provided both $\beta$ and $1-\alpha$ are greater than $0.95$ . Furthermore, Ellison (1964) shows that for this approximation, the error in the confidence level is on the order of $1/n$ . Millard & Neerchal also discuss the simpler case of a one-sided tolerance interval , where $K$ is given by $$K = \frac{t_{n-1, z_\beta \sqrt{n}, 1-\alpha}}{\sqrt{n}}.$$ The notation $t_{\nu, \delta, p}$ refers to the $p^\text{th}$ quantile of the non-central Student t distribution with $\nu$ degrees of freedom and noncentrality parameter $\delta$ , and $z_p$ refers to the $p^\text{th}$ quantile of the standard Normal distribution, $z_p = \Phi^{-1}(p)$ . This directly answers the present question. Software I provide an Excel (VBA) macro for these (Normal-theory) intervals in a spreadsheet at http://www.quantdec.com/envstats/software/intervals.xls . Although I have not tried it, the R package tolerance appears to offer a broad suite of tolerance intervals (these formulas need to be modified to apply to regression residuals, for instance). The non-central Student t distribution is available via the ncp argument through the qt function (and its relatives) found in the base R installation. References Wald, A., and J. Wolfowitz. (1946).
