phpunit xdebug reporting

I am trying to produce an html report of some tests using PHPUnit, Selenium and Xdebug. I run the test like so: phpunit --coverage-html ./report blah.php But the report generated is somewhat lacking in information and it doesn't seem to coincide with the official documentation here . I just get a green bar with "100.00% | 0/0" as the value for the 'Lines' column. I thought perhaps this was normal but I altered my test script to fail deliberately and the report is the same. I would've assumed it would at least tell me that it failed. Any ideas why this is happening? PS: I am using PHPUnit 3.4.8, Xdebug 2.0.5.
