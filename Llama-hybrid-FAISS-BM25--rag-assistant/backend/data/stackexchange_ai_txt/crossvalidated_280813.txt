When would it be appropriate to use CNN vs. DNN?

I guess the common rule of thumb when choosing between CNN vs. DNN is if it has to do with images choose CNN and data points for DNN. But what if input images are pretty small.. in my case (33,45,3) or (33,15,3), or flatten to 4455 or 1485 datapoints. . When considering each as pixel as a datapoint I don't see that big of an issue using a DNN to train the data, given the number of data points are pretty small... Why shouldn't I do this? CNN : C onvolution n eural n etwork DNN : D eep n eural n etwork
