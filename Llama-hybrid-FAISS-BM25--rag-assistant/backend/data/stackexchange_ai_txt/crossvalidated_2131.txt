For a classification problem if class variable has unequal distribution which technique we should use?

for eg. if I have a class variable credit scoring with two classes good and bad, where #(good) = 700 and #(bad)= 300. I do not want to shorten my data. which technique I should use? I was using SVM but it is giving all bad as good in predictions.
