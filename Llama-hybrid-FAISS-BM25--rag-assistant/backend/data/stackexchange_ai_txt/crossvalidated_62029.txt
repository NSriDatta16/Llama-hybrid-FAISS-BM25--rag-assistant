From the title it does not sound like it but the book "Mostly Harmless Econometrics" by Angrist and Pischke gives a thorough explanation of causal effects estimation, the underlying rationale and a wide discussion of techniques useful for applied worked. They explain all techniques and their basic ideas with real-life examples, though the majority is related to economics if you don't mind that. If you would like to have a more technical treatment of the idea of counterfactuals, a major paper in this respect is by Angrist, Imbens and Rubin (1996) in the Journal of the American Statistical Association. In there they establish a causal effects framework built on counterfactuals which uses instrumental variables to identify local average treatment effects.
