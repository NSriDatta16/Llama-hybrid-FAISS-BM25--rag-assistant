Windows VB.NET 1.1 to 2.0 Upgrade - Benefits?

We have a fairly large Windows based 1.1 .NET application that we are considering moving up to 2.0. The main reason we are considering the update is so we can utilize Visual Studio 2008 for ongoing development on the project, as well as we use the Infragistics Suite of controls and the 1.1 set is no longer being updated with new features. Since this is an internal Windows only app for one organization and not a public web app where security issues are a bigger concern, what possible benefits will be seen from such an upgrade? Are there performance and other improvements in 2.0 and other pluses over 1.1 for Windows based apps?
