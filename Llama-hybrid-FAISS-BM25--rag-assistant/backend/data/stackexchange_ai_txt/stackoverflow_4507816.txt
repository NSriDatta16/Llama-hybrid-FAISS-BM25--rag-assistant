pull communication of data from iphone app

I developed an application where I can build objects based on a model which is written on a .plist file. The mechanism works very well, data are in form of string, date or int, and the .plist file is really small. I was wondering if it's possible to update the model only, which is, at the moment, an update of a plist file. Before the .plist file I was thinking about a .sqlite database download, but as this post I got strongly discouraged: which xcode application for pre filling a database So, as main newspapers do, I was thinking about replicate the news update process. In exactly the same way, I don't want this to be a push notification process from the server, but rather an on-demand pull from the iphone. I am looking for the best way to achieve this. Therefore these are my questions: usual question: can it be done ? is the .plist file a good format candidate for this ? which api, technology... suit best ? can Apple raise any kind of problems about that ? If yes, how can I prevent this problem ? thanks
