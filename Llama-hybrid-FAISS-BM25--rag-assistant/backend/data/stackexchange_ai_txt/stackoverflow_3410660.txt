Looks to me like the problem is that you haven't bothered learning how to search an array. Hint: Array.IndexOf or Array.BinarySearch depending on whether the array is sorted. You're right that converting to a list is a bad idea: it wastes space and time and makes the code less readable. Also, blindly upcasting to IEnumerable slows matters down and also completely prevents use of certain algorithms (such as binary search).
