What are the various basic kernels available?

I am currently following the book Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning by C.E. Rasmussen and C.K.I. Williams and I have come across various kernels in their Chapter 4 I have also gone through the kernel cookbook which is a nice description of various basic kernels available and how we can create new kernels from adding, multiplying, and convoluting these basic kernels. Since we know that regression in a Gaussian process hinges on the choice of kernels, I want to ask if there are basic kernels other than the following and what kind of functions do they draw? Constant : $\sigma _{o}^{2}$ Linear kernel : $k_{\textrm{Lin}}(x, x') = (x - c)(x' - c)$ Squared exponential kernel : $k_{\textrm{SE}}(x, x') = \sigma^2\exp\left(-\frac{(x - x')^2}{2\ell^2}\right)$ (subset of 7) Matern : $\frac{1}{{2}^{\nu -1}\Gamma (\nu )}{\left( \frac{\sqrt{2\nu }}{l}r\right)}^{\nu }{K}_{\nu }\left( \frac{\sqrt{2\nu }}{l}r\right)$ Rational quadratic kernel : $k_{\textrm{RQ}}(x, x') = \sigma^2 \left( 1 + \frac{(x - x')^2}{2 \alpha \ell^2} \right)^{-\alpha}$ (subset of 4) Exponential : $\exp\left( - \frac{r}{l}\right)$ (subset of 7) $\gamma $ - Exponential : $\exp\left( -{\left(\frac{r}{l}\right)}^{\gamma }\right) $ Periodic kernel : $k_{\textrm{Per}}(x, x') = \sigma^2\exp\left(-\frac{2\sin^2(\pi|x - x'|/p)}{\ell^2}\right)$ Neural networks
