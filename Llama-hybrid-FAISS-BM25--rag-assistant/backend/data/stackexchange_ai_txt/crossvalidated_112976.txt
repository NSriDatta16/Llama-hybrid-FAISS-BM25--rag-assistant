After browsing the literature I came across the following paper which compares several different methods for calculating $R^2$ values for mixed models, where the $R^2$(MVP) methods is equivalent to the method proposed by Nakagawa and Schielzeth. Lahuis, D et al (2014) Explained Variance Measures for Multilevel Models. Organizational Research Methods. Overall, most of the measures (Formula , Formula , $R^2$ (OLS), and $R^2$ (MVP)) exhibited acceptable levels of bias, consistency, and efficiency across all conditions and models. In addition, the difference in mean bias values for these measures was small. Formula and Formula were the least biased in the random-intercept models and Formula and $R^2$ (MVP) were the least biased in the random-slope models. In terms of efficiency, the Formula and $R^2$ (MVP) had the lowest standard deviation values in the random-intercept model. $R^2$ (MVP) and $R^2$ (OLS) had the lowest standard deviations in the random-slope model. In general, Formula was not an efficient estimator.
