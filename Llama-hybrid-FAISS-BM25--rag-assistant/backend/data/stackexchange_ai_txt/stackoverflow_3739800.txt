This page looks to explain it pretty clearly to me. Essentially it's a convenient way of quickly and accurately assessing the performance characteristics of an algorithm. Be it how quickly in the worst case or average case the algorithm runs. How much space in the worst or average case it uses. Sometimes more useful is how an algorithm performs on a number of items, this is known as amortized analysis. The fundamental characteristic of the notation is that it leaves out terms that become irrelevant as n gets large. For example as n gets large n^2 + 2n the 2n becomes irrelevant. This would be O(n^2) .
