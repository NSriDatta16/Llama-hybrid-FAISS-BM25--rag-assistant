How to explore high dimensional data to inform a choice of clustering method?

I want to cluster users of a web app based on their engagement, my data looks approximately like: id | count of action 1 | count of action 2 | ... | count of action n I have 40 different counts and a sample of around 30k users. From here I remove outliers and I further create some features and scale all the variables to be in $[0,1]$. I am familiar with the basic algorithms and their drawbacks, however, these often relate to a structure of the data. That is quite easy to get a feeling for in two dimensions for example like here or here . The question is, how can I explore my data with so many dimensions and see, for example, if my data follow a gaussian distribution. I know there's dimensionality reduction but using visual examination seems like it might be prone to errors in judgment because the reduced dimensions miss some important information. How can I inform the model choice in a smart/rigorous way? I work in R.
