Filling tableadapter with stored procedure takes signifigantly longer than running stored procedure in SQL

I have been trying to fill my ultracombo box with data yet it takes a signifigant amount of time. However when I run the same stored procedure from withing sql server it takes relatively no time. The line of code that the program gets hung up on is: SprocPatientsTableAdapter.Fill(Me.PatientsDataSet.sprocPatients, SelectedCustomerID) By signifigant differnce of time I mean the difference of less than 5 seconds in sql server and more than three hours from within the program.
