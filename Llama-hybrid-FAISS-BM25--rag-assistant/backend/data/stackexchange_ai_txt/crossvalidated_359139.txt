You're specifying the conditional distribution as negative binomial, but the exact functional form depends on the link function, it's not inherent in the fact that it's negative binomial. This is distinct from logistic regression where the logistic is the link function being used, the conditional distribution is binomial and other links may be used with a binomial (i.e. logistic regression is really a binomial GLM with a logit link). The default link for the function you call - the one that's used if you don't specify a link, and a common choice - is the log link (as can be seen from the help on the function).
