Code organization style for C?

I know some higher level languages, all web based (PHP, javascript, some python). I've finally decided to learn a lower level language, and I've decided to go with C. The problem is that all the languages I use are based heavily on OOP. Seeing as (based on the research I did) C doesn't have classes or inheritance. As a result, I ask you this: How should I organize my code in C in an organized manner like OOP, without having to switch languages or just have files with endless amounts of functions? Edit from Future : This question is pretty silly looking back on it. I was 15 and didn't have CS at my school...
