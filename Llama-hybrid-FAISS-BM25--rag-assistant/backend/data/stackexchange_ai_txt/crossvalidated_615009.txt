Not sure this is what you are looking for but, my preferred resource is the book by Rafael C. Gonzalez and Richard E. Woods titled Digital Image Processing , Pearson, and now in its fourth edition. It's a quite comprehensive text on image processing, it covers: spatial filtering, filtering in the frequency domain, image restoration, colour image processing, wavelets, etc. The book has twelve chapters and the last chapter covers ML methods for image classification, e.g. NNets and Deep Learning.
