You don't have to override registerForDraggedTypes: . You just have to invoke it. However, you will have to override the methods to respond to entering your view with a drag, or releasing a drag, etc. So if you have a view that needs to accept drops of type MyCustomDropType , then you do: [myView registerForDraggedTypes:[NSArray arrayWithObject:MyCustomDropType]]; Then your dragging methods will only fire if the drag has been declared to offer MyCustomDropType data.
