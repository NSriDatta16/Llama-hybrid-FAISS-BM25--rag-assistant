bayesian structural time series model question

I am using the R package CausalImpact to make some causal inference. Does the response variable y need to be independent (has to be daily or weekly data, etc.)? Can I use data that are related (data from a sliding window, for example, each data point contains data for the past 28 days)? The reason I am asking is because the daily data is very noisy, while data from the sliding window is more smooth.
