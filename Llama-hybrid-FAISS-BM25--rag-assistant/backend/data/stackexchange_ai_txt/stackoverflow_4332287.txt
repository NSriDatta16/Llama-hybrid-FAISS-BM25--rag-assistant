Monotouch - Use of Application class as storage of common objects

To communicate between views and objects persistant information, for example the username and choice of font size for display, is it considered good form to put these onto the Application object, or is it more efficient to put them into static singletons? For example: public class Application { static void Main (string[] args) { UIApplication.Main (args); } public static Username {get;set;} }
