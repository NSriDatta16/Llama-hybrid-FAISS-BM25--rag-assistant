With Subversion, I use the externals feature. It makes it easy to use the third-party stuff in multiple projects; when you check out a project, you get the external dependencies as well. If you don't have it already, you should get a copy of Pragmatic Version Control Using Subversion. It's a great book about Subversion functionality and how to do things. While it references SVN from the command-line, the info is also easily translatable to the GUI in TortoiseSVN. For reinstalling the components into Delphi for older projects, I usually export the registry entries for whatever version of Delphi used into the project's folder and then check that .REG file into Subversion along with the project. You can easily check out the project, export your existing Delphi registry section for the corresponding version of Delphi, import the .REG file from your project source folder, and then start Delphi with all of the components installed. As far as the "binary BPL" issue, shame on you! If you have projects depending on third-party tools, you should buy the source for them. That way you're protected against that company going out of business, or dropping support for the components, or new releases of Delphi that aren't compatible. I always get source for third-party components; if the source isn't available, I find a different product or write the code myself. It's called self-preservation. :-)
