It turns out that, because the URL we're using sets a cookie, and Hootsuite creates a frame, that IE won't trust the third party cookie (our site). So I've added some framebuster code to the page, and triggered it to happen "immediately" if the browser is IE. Code is below: " /> var timeout = 1; if (navigator.userAgent.match(/MSIE/)) { timeout = 1; } else { timeout = 14500; } setTimeout('if (top != self) top.location.replace(self.location.href)', timeout); Maybe this will help some other random user out there some day.
