How to use a distribution to represent a stationary time series?

Suppose I have a stationary time series, if I pool the data together it will look like a Gaussian distribution. However, I don't think it is proper since it might be auto correlated and Gaussian distribution assumes iid. What's the proper way to represent this series using distribution? Suppose I do ACF and PACF test and there's no auto correlation, can I directly use a Gaussian distribution to represent it?
