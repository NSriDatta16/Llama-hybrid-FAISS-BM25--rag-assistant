Replace 'collection_select, :multiple => true' with multiple 'check_box' options in Rails

How do you replace a collection_select (with :multiple => true ) with a list of check_box options, such that there is a check_box option for each object in the collection? Is there an elegant way to implement this using form builders (i.e. without using *_tag helpers)? I'd like to lean on ActiveRecord's built in functionality as much as possible...
