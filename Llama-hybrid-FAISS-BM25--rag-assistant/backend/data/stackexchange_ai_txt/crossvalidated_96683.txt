Is a Chi-squared test sufficient to tell me if my process change was "good enough"?

Experiment Design: Process : Outputs the order in which to do the work (assumption: ordering of work items is most preferred/valuable by stakeholders) Work items : The process above produces a rank ordering of items. Individual teams select work items from this "prioritized" queue to do their work. I introduced a new process to perform the prioritization and we did notice some improvement in the selection of work items i.e., work items were more and more goal oriented and not as per "whims of individuals" or "star performers" only. Question to answer : Given 4 year experimental data I wish to know if my 'new' process was any better? Current Approach : For a set of work-items I compute how strongly did their selection/choice compare with the prioritization ordering of the new/old process. I compute a correlation metric (almost like an exam score in essence) which is a weighted average of the proportion of work-items completed. For example: Percentage of top 25% work items completed * $w_1$ Percentage of 2nd 25% work items completed * $w_2$ Percentage of 3rd 25% work items completed * $w_3$ Percentage of bottom 25% work items completed * $w_4$ Weights are chosen as $w_1 = 8, w_2 = 4, w_3 = 2, w_1 = 1$ That is if highest priority tasks are selected we wish to give that a higher score. Weights are normalized on $[0,1]$. A simple coverage metric, like $10/22$ items done, would not do justice. Also 100% of the tasks can never be completed, since that makes the prioritization redundant, but it's good if that's the case, albeit rare. I create three categories based on the scores: Strong, Medium and Weak if the scores are $> 0.5,[0.2, 0.5), I performed a Chi-squared test as follows, based on the frequency counts of Strong/Medium/Weak correlations as above. The DV is the work-item-selection and the IV is the Prioritization Process. $H_0 = $ work-item-selection is not impacted by process change $H_1 = $ work-item-selection is impacted by process change I conclude there's a high chance that the new process has impacted work item selection rejecting $H_0$ and accepting $H_1$. Questions: Is this approach correct and are the inferences drawn from it valid? Is $\chi^2$ the best that can be done given the above DV/IV? Are there any other tests? Would they add more value to the insight gained from $\chi^2$? Note : For simplicity we are considering only one IV since most of the other variables is what we controlled for keeping them almost constant (i.e., team size/composition etc.,) and we (people reviewing this experiment) have agreed that they don't impact the DV and can thus be removed from the model.
