I need help identifying this formula please

A few months ago, I became interested in time series analysis and started digging through statistics formulas. I found a formula that I ended up playing around with, but I've misplaced my notes and cannot remember what it's called or what its purpose is. I'm not a mathematician (I'm a programmer), so I'll write it out here using some pseudo code. Let's say we have 2 numbers, A and B: (A+B)/sqrt((A^2+B^2)*2) ... or let's say we have 3 numbers, A, B, and C (A+B+C)/sqrt((A^2+B^2+C^2)*3) ... etc You might also write it like this: sum(A,B,C) / sqrt( sumsq(A,B,C)*count(A,B,C) )
