Answers "i", "ii" and "iii" are not entirely relevant. True, WebSphere's support for clustering and fail-over is very good out-of-the-box, and it also has caching, JMS, security and JCA support out of the box - but by using third-party products (also open-source) as add-ons to Tomcat, you can get these functionalities on Tomcat as well. Answer "iv"'s relevance depends on whether the asker was talking about technicalities only. True, certain organizations are indeed not comfortable running their applications on open-source software; usually, these are organizations that tend to involve politics with technical decisions. There are many political factors that I won't get into here, but remember - these are political, rather than technical, factors. In short: if all you need is JSP/Servlets, using WebSphere is a waste, mostly of money. If you need a bit extra over JSP/Servlets, use an open-source application server (Apache Geronimo, for example) or even JBoss. WebSphere is too expensive to do anything with, unless your organization insists on paying (a lot of money) for application servers due to political (or other non-technical) reasons.
