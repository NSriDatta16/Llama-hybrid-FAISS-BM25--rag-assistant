Zend framework 1.8 recommended way to register a plugin?

In Zend Framework 1.8, what is the recommended way to register a new plugin in Zend Framework 1.8? I remember doing something like this in versions prior to 1.8: require_once 'Wenbert/Controller/Plugin/CheckHasAccess.php'; $frontController = Zend_Controller_Front::getInstance(); $frontController->registerPlugin(new Wenbert_Controller_Plugin_CheckHasAccess()); What would be the best / recommended way to do it in ZF 1.8? Thanks in advance! -Wenbert
