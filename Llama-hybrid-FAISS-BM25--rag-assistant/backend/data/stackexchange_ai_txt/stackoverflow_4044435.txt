The code above is actually correct. You're passing messages to the app delegate singleton and certainly don't want to retain a strong reference to it. Without more code it's a little difficult to see the program flow but it looks like you're passing startUpdatingLocation to a LocationManager referenced from your app delegate subclass. I'd first check that the LocationManager's delegate is set to the class in which your second snippet is from - otherwise it will never be hit. However it looks like it is as you seem to be seeing an update in you NSLog statements. Secondly I'd remember that the LocationManager will be updating asynchronously. Don't expect to receive an update immediately after you start updating location. Therefore it is quite reasonable to expect that the lat would be nil for some seconds after start update location. Thirdly I'd be looking at the other controller (where you're trying to read the result). Are you in a breakpoint within the class when you're trying to get the app delegate? BTW, your app architecture seems a little (pardon me) ugly. Is there a reason you need to so closely couple your app delegate and controllers? A more elegant way may be to create a your own location management singleton and have it post notifications. Any class that is interested may then subscribe to these location update notifications.
