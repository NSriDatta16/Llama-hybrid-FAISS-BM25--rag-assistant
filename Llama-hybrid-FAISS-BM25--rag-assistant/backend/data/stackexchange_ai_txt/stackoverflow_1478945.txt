If you need a Windows CE Emulator get it here http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/thankyou.aspx?familyId=a120e012-ca31-4be9-a3bf-b9bf4f64ce72&displayLang=en and to setup the Emulator look at this guide http://www.hpc.net/chat.asp?ObjectID=97662 Edit: The hpc.net link is now dead so here is what was found on the page using the wayback machine. https://web.archive.org/web/20070428121320/http://www.hpc.net/chat.asp?ObjectID=97662 Connecting the CE 5.0 Emulator to VS2005 This uses the network method and saves the emulator state. It does not use activesync, communications ports or a null modem cable. Start the emulator using a shortcut command that is something like this: "C:\Program Files\Windows CE 5.0 Emulator\Emulator_500.exe" nk.cem /video 640x480x16 /Ethernet virtualswitch /sharedfolder "C:\CE5SharedFolder" The shared folder appears on the emulator as \My Device\Storage Card. Using the shared folder, copy the following files to the \My Device\Windows\ folder on the emulator. These files are located on the host at \Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\CoreCon\1.0\Target\wce400\x86, or similar Clientshutdown.exe ConmanClient2.exe CMaccept.exe eDbgTL.dll TcpConnectionA.dll Select Emulator -> Start Menu -> run -> \Windows\conmanclient2.exe. Get the IP address of the emulator by double-clicking on the T networking symbol bottom left. If it has no ip address try installing Microsoft Loopback Adapter on the host, check for Virtual Machine Network Services, or other host networking hacks. (This is the difficult bit). To check that the emulator is responding, on the host type Ping at a DOS prompt. To get "Save State" working on the emulator, shut down the emulator using the "Save State" option. Then navigate to Host -> My Documents -> My Virtual Machines The saved state is in the folder that is named with a curly brackets string similar to {06A8A448-EB8B-4E0B-8A88-451412A10C66} say, and known as a GUID. Attempt to rename this folder so that you can highlight and copy the GUID string itself (not the folder). Then add an option, which is similar to /vmid {06A8A448-EB8B-4E0B-8A88-451412A10C66}, to the emulator shortcut command above. The shortcut should now start the emulator from its saved state. It is a good idea to back up the saved state folder. On the host select Visual Studio 2005 -> Tools -> Options -> Device Tools -> Devices Then select Windows CE 5.0 Device -> Properties -> Configure In the "Configure TCP/IP Transport" dialog box, select "Use specific IP address", and then type the emulator IP address you found above. Close the dialog boxes. Select Emulator -> Start -> run -> \Windows\cMaccept.exe and connect to the emulator from VS2005 within three minutes. Run your application from Start Debugging in VS2005 and VS2005 should deploy the two cab files nectcfv2.wce5.x86.cab and system_SR_enu.cab first (this may take some time), and then your application. Close your application in the emulator (I've had trouble using the Stop button on the host). Shut down the emulator using the "Save State" option. You may need to re-run cMaccept each time you restart the emulator or VS2005, but the cab files should not need to deploy again, and the emulator ip address should remain the same. To avoid cMaccept navigate host -> programs -> Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 -> Visual Studio Remote Tools -> Remote Registry Editor In the "Select a Windows Device" dialog box that appears highlight the "Windows CE 5.0 Device" option In the emulator run cMaccept and then immediately click OK in the Remote Registry Editor Highlight Windows CE 5.0 -> HKLM -> System Right click in the right hand pane and select New DWORD value. In the name field type (exactly and without the quotes) "CoreConOverrideSecurity" and set its value to 1 Close the editor. Shut down the emulator with Save State.
