Logistic Regression - Finding out information about a particular $X_i$ when all other Xs and parameters are known

Suppose someone made the following logistic regression: $Logit(p)$ = $\beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + \beta_2X_2$ Now, someone else is trying to replicate the model creation, but by mistake the $X_2$ column is replaced by some other values. Hence, the model is coming as: $Logit(p)$ = $\beta_0^{'} + \beta_1^{'}X_1 + \beta_2^{'}X_2^{'}$ I know all the values of the Xs and the parameters in the two equations except the values of $X_2$ My question is: How can I get back the values of $X_2$ ? I know that getting the value of $X_2$ for each row may be a challenge. Can I get something at an aggregated level at least (mean, sum, etc.)?
