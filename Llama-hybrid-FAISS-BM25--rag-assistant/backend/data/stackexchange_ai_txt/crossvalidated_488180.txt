The are several approaches on how to deal with seasonality in time series. You can either model it or remove it and model the residual series. Some popular approaches: Decomposition : the original time series is decomposed into several components (additive or multiplicative) which are modelled and forecasted individually. Exponential smoothing is a very popular method, capable of also modelling seasonality (Holt-Winters' seasonal method) Seasonal ARIMA models: Stationarity is a necessary condition before applying ARIMA. Usually, time series with trend and/or seasonal component are non-stationary. Essentially here seasonality is removed via seasonal differencing Harmonic Regression : Here you use Fourier terms to model the time series. I believe that empirical results have shown that this performs better for long-term components, while performance degrades as the frequency increases. Dummy variables: Calendar effects can be modelled with indicator variables. Ignore: You can just ignore the seasonality and directly model the time series. This is sometimes applied in machine learning literature, but inputs usually include historical lags of the target series. This list is non-exhaustive. The referenced book offers a good starting point in general. Also, note that there is a difference between additive and multiplicative seasonality. I believe that the passenger dataset contains multiplicative seasonal component, because each cycle seems to get more volatile.
