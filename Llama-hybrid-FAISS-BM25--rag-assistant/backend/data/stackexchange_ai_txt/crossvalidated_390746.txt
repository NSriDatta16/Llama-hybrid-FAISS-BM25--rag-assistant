You wake up. You have no idea how you got where you are. You look around at your surroundings and make a decision on what to do next based solely on the information you have available at that point in time. That is essentially the same situation as what is happening in MCMC. It is using the current information that it can currently see to make a decision about what to do next. Instead of thinking of it as figuring out $x_{i}$ from $x_{i-1}$ (which might be what is causing you trouble because you're thinking "hey we're looking into the past when we look at $x_{i-1}$ ) think of it as figuring out what $x_{i+1}$ should be based on the current information $x_i$ for which you don't need any 'memory'. Those two formulations are equivalent but it might help you think about the semantics a bit better.
