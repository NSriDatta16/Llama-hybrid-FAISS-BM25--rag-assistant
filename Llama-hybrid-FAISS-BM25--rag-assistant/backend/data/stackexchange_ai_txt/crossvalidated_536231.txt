What might be the identification challenges with a generalized DiD model where the treatment variable experiences reversals (switches on/off)?

I have a setting where my treatment variable experiences reversals across the panel units in a staggered adoption setting. To estimate the average treatment effects on the treated in a setting that experiences both treatment reversals and staggered adoption, we typically use generalized difference-in-differences (DiD) or a two-way fixed effects model. I am familiar with both generalized DiD and a conventional DiD setting and realize that the identification assumption of parallel trends is common across both models. A plethora of new literature has emerged during the last few years which talks about correcting the weights and, thus, biases in a staggered adoption DiD setting. But more of that literature assumes that the treatment variable does not experience any reversals, i.e., a unit once treated remains treated for the rest of the time (to quote a few highly cited papers: Callaway and Sant'Anna, 2020; Goodman-Bacon, 2018). However, I was not able to find a direct answer as to why these papers make this assumption. What would happen if this assumption is not being made? Why, for example, would our results be biased and maybe inconsistent if we include units with treatment reversals in the analysis. I am looking for an (intuitive) econometric justification if there is any. Now suppose, I want to estimate my model using a conventional DiD setting, which means that I drop the panel units which experience treatment reverals. In this case, how can I justify dropping units with treatment reversals econometrically or in terms of the identification assumption of the DiD model?
