Markov chain long run probabilities

So I want to find the long run probability of getting two heads in a row when flipping a fair coin many times. I know this answer should be 1/6 (expected number of flips to get 2H in a row is 6) but I'm trying to figure out how to use a Markov chain to solve this. I think my transition matrix should be (3x3): 0H 1H 2H 0H .5 .5 0 1H .5 0 .5 2H 0 0 1 Then I come up with a system of equations to find the limiting distribution. .5x1 + .5x2 = x1 .5x1 = x2 .5x2 + .5x3 = x3 x1 + x2 + x3 = 1 But I can't seem to solve this equation correctly. Is my transition matrix/ approach correct?
