I haven't had to do this, so take this with a grain of salt and a big helping of "test, test, test". What happens if (in a safe controlled test environment) you directly modify the Host column in the mysql.user and probably mysql.db tables? (E.g., with an update statement.) I don't think MySQL uses the user's host as part of the password encoding (the PASSWORD function doesn't suggest it does), but you'll have to try it to be sure. You may need to issue a FLUSH PRIVILEGES command (or stop and restart the server). For some storage engines (MyISAM, for instance), you may also need to check/modify the .frm file any views that user has created. The .frm file stores the definer, including the definer's host. (I have had to do this, when moving databases between hosts where there had been a misconfiguration causing the wrong host to be recorded...)
