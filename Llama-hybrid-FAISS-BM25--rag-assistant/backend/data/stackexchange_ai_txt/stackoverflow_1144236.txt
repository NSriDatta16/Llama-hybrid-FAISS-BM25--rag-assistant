If you have domain expertise on the project you are going to work on like say banking. It's easy to structure your objects and you know how those enhancements come every other day. If you don't have that expertise work with someone who has that expertise and convert those ideas into technical details. If you are confused about how to structure your project design. BLINDLY follow "pragmatic programmer" book. I was in same situation before, try reading a chapter from that book. you will see the difference, It will change the way you think as a software developer.
