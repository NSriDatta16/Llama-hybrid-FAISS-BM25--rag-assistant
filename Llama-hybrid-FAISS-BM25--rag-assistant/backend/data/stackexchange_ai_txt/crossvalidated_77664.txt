What is the proper terminology for the parts of a bayesian hierarchial model?

Lets say I have the following JAGS model, what are the proper terms for the three parts and 1/tau? model{ #Term??? for(n in 1:Ndata){ y[n] ~ dnorm( mu[ subj[n] ], tau[ subj[n]] ) } #Term??? for(s in 1:Nsubj){ mu[s] ~ dnorm( muG, tauG) tau[s] ~ dgamma( 5, 5) } #Term??? muG ~ dnorm( 80, .01) tauG ~ dgamma( 1, 1) } What would I call each of the three parts? Also, for the parameters I would say: mu= "Individual Level Mean" tau= "Individual Level Precision" muG= "Group Level Mean" tauG= "Group Level Precision" Now what would I call 1/tau? "Variance"?
