Efficient way to select default value in t-sql when no results are found

OK, this is a pretty simple problem, but I'm curious: what is the best approach in terms of efficiency and style? I often need to select data in MS SQL, but am looking for a single result. If there is no match in the database, I'd like to return a default value. Here are a few approaches I take: Do it in Code --Regular Select in SQL SELECT myValue FROM dbo.SomeTable WHERE id = @id //In Data Access Layer using (IDataReader reader = cmd.ExecuteReader()) { if (reader.Read()) { return Convert.ToInt32(reader["myValue"]); }else { return 0; //return a default } } Guarantee a returned value in SQL --SQL stores in a variable and selects null value if available declare @myVal int select @myVal = myValue FROM dbo.SomeTable WHERE id = @id --return value or a default select ISNULL(@myVal,0) as myValue //In Data Access Layer return Convert.ToInt32(cmd.ExecuteScalar()); Is there a more elegant way to do this? Or a more efficiient way? If not, which of these would you consider a better practice?
