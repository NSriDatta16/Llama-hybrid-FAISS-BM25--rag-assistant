For purely lexical analysis, you could use regular expressions, or any of dozens scanner generators (flex/lex, ANTLR). For syntactic analysis on the other hand, you'd probably need a parser generator that could read a context-free grammar. However, from what I understand, most C++ parsers are hand written. I'm not sure if even an LALR parser would do the trick; you might need to bring out the big guns and use something like Bison's GLR support. Also, for a ton more information on lexical/syntactic analysis, I'd recommend 'The Dragon Book' . Good luck!
