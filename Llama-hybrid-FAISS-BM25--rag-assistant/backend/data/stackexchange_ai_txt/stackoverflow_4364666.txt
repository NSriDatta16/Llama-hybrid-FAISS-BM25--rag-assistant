Problem installing Ajax Control Toolkit

I have installed MS Ajax Control Toolkit in Visual Studio 2010. I can see all the Web Controls under ToolBox in TAB Ajax Control Toolkit. BUT in the moment of dragging (using) a control, example HTML Editor onto a page, nothing happen, no error, no markup added to code.... and I cannot use it! So what I am doing wrong? I installed in a directory called C:\VisualStudio-Tools\AjaxControlToolkit.Binary.NET4 Any ideas? Thanks for your help!
