What to give as predictors to predict future values?

I am new to machine learning techniques. I was going through few supervised machine learning model examples and i have doubt in predicting future values. I have daily time series dataset from database where my target variable is complete noise signal like this: To train and predict the models, we divide the dataset into train set, validation set and test set to check if the model is efficient or not. I have two independent variable and one target variable. I am using linear regression,Keras LSTM and other models. My basic question is how do i predict for future values (for next one week, one month) when i don't have independent variables for next week? what am i supposed to give as predictors in that case? Any information is much appreciated.
