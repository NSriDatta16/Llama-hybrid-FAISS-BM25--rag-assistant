Assuming this is entirely repeatable, I would start by changing the method. Namely I would remove stuff until it works as expected. It sounds like there is some odd secondary behavior caused by the web method itself. I'm guessing it's a bit more complex than just adding two numbers together and returning a result. Also I'd pay close attention to what the method is doing. For example, is it instantiating unmanaged resources? Do you have any http handlers or modules involved which might be cratering on the first execution for this method? By eliminating code until it works you'll figure out exactly what's causing this.
