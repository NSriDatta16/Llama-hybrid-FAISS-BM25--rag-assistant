When developing external applications for Magento I usually reach for the Magento API . This would minimize the amount of work you have to do on the Magento side of things (which from my experience can be frustrating at times). You can focus more on your application and less on the data you need from Magento. To answer your question more directly, you need to use the order API calls . Example (To get list of orders): $proxy = new SoapClient('http://www.YOURDOMAIN.com/magento_root/api/soap/?wsdl'); $sessionId = $proxy->login('Username', 'password'); $filters = array(); $orders = $proxy->call($sessionId, 'sales_order.list', array($filters)); var_dump($orders);
