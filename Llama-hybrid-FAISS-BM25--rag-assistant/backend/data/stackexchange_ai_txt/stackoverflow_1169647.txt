More than likely each edit view is going to require different fields so sharing editpost is not really viable. If however you are editing [exactly] the same fields then perhaps organise the views as you have them and then render a partialview which you can pass a model to. The partialView can be in a common place which keeps your seperation of concerns as far as the views are concerned as well as code reuse with the partialview. Each controller then has its own name such as UserController and AdminController. Inside each of these you have your editpost action no probs. Does this help or do you need more?
