Why is p(x) hard to calculate in a VAE?

In VAEs, it is hard to calculate the posterior: $p_\theta(z|x)$ because that reduces to: $$ \frac{p(x|z)p(z)}{p(x)} $$ which is difficult to calculate because $p(x)$ is hard to calculate. But why exactly is $p(x)$ hard to calculate? Is it because you must do the following to calculate it: For each image, loop over every possible latent encoding and calculate the probability the latent encoding results in the given image. Thus, you must do (number of images) * (number of latent encoding) loop iterations, which is too many? Specifically, the thing I'm confused about is. Given that the likelihood and the posterior are kind of inverses of each other, why would one be much harder to calculate than the other?
