Using logistic regression to estimate whether probability of an outcome is greater than chance (and by how much)?

I have an outcome variable that is subjects' correct or incorrect responses to a single question asked at two time points (before and after the experiment). I want to know if subjects were better than chance at answering these questions and by how much (i.e., obtain an effect size). I already know from a separate analysis that performance didn't vary depending on when the question was asked, so I think the most appropriate approach is to treat the responses as successes/failures and use the following code to run a model comparison, one estimating the intercept and one leaving it out and comparing the models using the likelihood ratio test to determine if the intercept-only model is more likely: df$successes I will interpret the exponent of intercept estimate (exp(2.6692) = 14.42) as the odds ratio relative to chance (e.g., Subjects' probability of responding correctly was 14 times higher than would be expected by chance. Is this correct? EDIT: I didn't realize this approach wasn't addressing the repeated measurement issue. To do so I propose the following code instead: modela Note, the data are melted in this case so that the responses (0 vs. 1) to the two questions are in the same column and ID is the variable that identifies multiple responses from the same individual. Is this okay? The results seem interpretable. Or is there a simpler way to do this that gives me an effect size?
