Sorting an IList in C#

So I came across an interesting problem today. We have a WCF web service that returns an IList. Not really a big deal until I wanted to sort it. Turns out the IList interface doesn't have a sort method built in. I ended up using the ArrayList.Adapter(list).Sort(new MyComparer()) method to solve the problem but it just seemed a bit "ghetto" to me. I toyed with writing an extension method, also with inheriting from IList and implementing my own Sort() method as well as casting to a List but none of these seemed overly elegant. So my question is, does anyone have an elegant solution to sorting an IList
