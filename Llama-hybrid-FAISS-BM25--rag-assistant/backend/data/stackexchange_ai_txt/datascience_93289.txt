Best Model for Multi-label image classification

Usually using CNN architecture with a Sigmoid function as an activation function in the last layer and using binary cross entropy can be used to output a probability for each class. However, the problem is when we have more than 2 labels per image, the model will result in lower accuracy. Anyone has a suggestion for a robust state-of-art models that do Multi-label image classification with a high accuracy.
