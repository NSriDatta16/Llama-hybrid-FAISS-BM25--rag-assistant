Hopefully this answer isn't unwelcome, as it's technically not a solution achieved via Magento programming as you ask, but I have successfully purged all gallery images myself for the same purpose simply by truncating the relevant tables in Magento 1.4.2.0 (I believe it's the same table structure in 1.5 as well). TRUNCATE TABLE `catalog_product_entity_media_gallery` TRUNCATE TABLE `catalog_product_entity_media_gallery_value` Then follow up by removing all the image files within the /media/catalog/product directory. I did look for a way to do this programmatically myself, but found this much more efficient and have experienced no negative side effects.
