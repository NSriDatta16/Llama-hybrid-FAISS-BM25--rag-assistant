Is it possible to repeat an iteration of a loop?

I have defined a for loop as follows which scans through a file made up of two columns, when it finds the keyword DEFINE_MENU the second column on this line refers to the title for a screen. The next instance of the keyword will define a title for a seperate screen and so on to the nth screen. At the moment the code is capable of defining the first menu title. Is it possible, when I reach the second instance of the keyword DEFINE_MENU to repeat the loop for the same line, setting the title_flag = 0 thereby repeating itself, capturing the second menu title? def getInfo(): title_flag = 0 number = 1 menus = {} items = {} title = None file = open('some_file', 'r') for line in file: # Test for comments, if they exist pass and move on if line[0] == '#': continue # Hop over blank lines if re.search(r'^\s+$', line): continue # Find the line where the title is defined if re.search('DEFINE_MENU', line) and title_flag == 0: type, name = line.split() title = name title_flag = 1 continue # If DEFINE_MENU is found and flag has been raised, this # signifies a new menu definition so break. if re.search('DEFINE_MENU', line) and title_flag == 1: break if re.search('PRIV', line): (type, name, priv_holder, *description) = line.split() else: (type, name, *description) = line.split() # If flag has been raised, the line must follow the definition # of the menu, it must contains info regarding a menu item. if title_flag == 1: description = ' '.join(description) items[str(number)] = name number += 1 file.close() menus[title] = items return menus Thank you for your input! Tom EDIT: First, apologies for the confusion caused. Perhaps I thought of the problem as being simpler than I thought and gave less information than required. I will delve deeper, the input file i am using is of the form: # MENU TYPE NAME PRIV? DESCRIPTION DEFINE_MENU CRAGINS MENU menu_name1 This takes you to menu 1 MENU menu_name2 This takes you to menu 2 VARIABLE var_name1 Alter variable1 VARIABLE var_name2 PRIV Alter variable1 COMMAND command1 Perform command1 DEFINE_MENU MENU2 MENU menu_name3 This takes you to menu 3 MENU menu_name4 This takes you to menu 4 VARIABLE var_name3 Alter variable3 VARIABLE var_name4 PRIV Alter variable4 COMMAND command3 Perform command3 I had raised the flag as I further manipulate the data between the DEFINE_MENU calls. I have edited the code to include the full method that I have written. The outcome is currently a dictionary where the key is the menu title and value is the another dictionary containing the menu items (values following the title) as follows: {'title1': {'1': 'menu_name1', '3': 'var_name1', '2': 'menu_name2', '5': 'command1', '4': 'var_name2'}} What I would like to have is a larger dictionary containing the menu titles as keys with the lowest level dictionary as the value. I understand that this is complicated so I'm sorry if it unclear, let me know if more information is required. Thanks again Tom
