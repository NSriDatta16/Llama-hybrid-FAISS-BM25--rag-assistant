global.asax and ASP.NET MVC solution Organization

I am refering to this article from Jimmy Bogard He is suggesting two projects to organize your ASP.NET MVC solution. Basically, one project for the code and another for the rendering My concern is about global.asax file. Jimmy suggested separating global.asax from global.asax.cs and put them in two differents projects When I did this, I could not compile my solution. I got this error : Could not load type 'MyProject.Web.Global'. Can someone help and show me how to solve this? Thanks
