convertPoint:

I'm learning Objective-C and Cocoa (in fits and starts when time allows) so be gentle OK. A example app has the following lines: NSPoint down = [mouseEvent locationInWindow]; //...some other stuff NSPoint p = [self convertPoint:down fromView:nil]; It then proceeds to use p for a drag and drop operation (using the pasteBoard). But, what I don't get is this is all in one view, why not just use down , why do a convertPoint: ? Or have I missed something basic? Thanks!
