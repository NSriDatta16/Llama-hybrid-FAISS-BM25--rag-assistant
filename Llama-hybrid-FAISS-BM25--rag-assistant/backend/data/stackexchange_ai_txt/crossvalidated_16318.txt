You might want to look at this paper: G. Sanguinetti, Dimensionality reduction of clustered data sets, IEEE Trans. Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (PAMI) 30(3), 535-540 (2008) (www) Which describes an unsupervised version of linear discriminant analysis, I have seen some demonstrations of this and it looks like a very useful tool to have in ones toolbox. If you already know which classes each sample belongs to, then (as ttnphns suggests) you want Linear Discriminant Analysis, Andrew Webb's book on statistical pattern recognition is a good reference book for that kind of thing.
