Full VB in the original VAE paper

I've few doubts in the original VAE paper, Doubt1: Equation 1 says use equality, however, it seems that Equation-1 and Equation-2 combined imply $logp_\theta(x^{(i)}) = E_{q_\phi(z|x)}[log(\frac{p_\theta(z)p_\theta(x^{(i)}|z)}{p_\theta(z|x^{(i)})})]$ , where the expectation is wrt $q_\phi$ , rather than $p_\theta$ . Moreover, the RHS seems to be expected value of $log p(x)$ . Am I missing something here? Doubt2: Full VB has been described in the appendix, where variational inference is done on network parameters $\theta$ as well as latents $z$ . They have called $q_\phi(\theta)$ as the approximate posterior. Shouldn't posterior be conditioned on the data X.
