Argument validation, aka. Null Checks. If you take any external inputs and pass them into functions but never check if they are valid/null, then you can achieve 100% coverage, but you will still get a NullReferenceException if you somehow pass null into the function because that's what your database gives you. also, arithmetic overflow, like int result = int.MAXVALUE + int.MAXVALUE; Code Coverage only covers existing code, it will not be able to point out where you should add more code.
