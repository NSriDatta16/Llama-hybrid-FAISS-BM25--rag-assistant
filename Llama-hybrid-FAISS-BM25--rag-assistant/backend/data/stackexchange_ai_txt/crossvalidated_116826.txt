I wouldn't suggest using regression slope as an output target, but rather another metric that's lagged into the future by either 2 days or 10-days. Two key issues with data inputs for a neural network is a), most people input all the data (bars) available, and b) input a lot of highly correlated predictors. If correlated features are input into a NN, the net will spend precious time learning the correlation -- which is undesirable. In addition, many bars will be non-informative and redundant, which for example, means that you don't need to input all the e.g. daily bar data if you are doing end of day (OED) trading. Although, I have no conflict of interests, look at the WAV and DDR modules developed by Jurik Research, which are available for most packages. WAV significantly reduces the bars needed for input, and DDR decorrelates input predictors you think are important.
