As suggested the Ruby On Rails Guides is a good place to start, along with the RailsCast site The key point is that the foreign keys, although implied by the use of the ActiveRecord abstractions such as :belongs_to, :has_many, :has_and_belongs_to_many etc, are not created for you. In the Rails Guides notes on Associations you'll notice comments like: "In any case, Rails will not create foreign key columns for you. You need to explicitly define them as part of your migrations." This note is often referenced in the details of the individual associations under the :foreign_key option. I guess it's often not obvious and from my experience (esp. coming from a Java/C++ background) I found that I had to print out and read the set of guides a couple of times to really appreciate the elegance, simplicity as well as the wealth of information contained within them. On a side note - it's great not to have to deal with all the low level plumbing as per the Java experience.
