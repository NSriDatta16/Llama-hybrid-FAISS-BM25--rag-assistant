The prior in MAP and Bayesian inference

We can use a Normal distribution as a prior when handling a Normal distribution as likelihood in Bayesian inference However if we want to do MAP given a Bernoulli as likelihood can we use Normal distribution as a prior which ignore the conjugate rule ? or we only allow to use Beta Prior?
