How to find the average and median values of the column 'Total Traded Quantity' for each of the types of 'Trend'

df_trend = df.groupby(["Trend"]) average_trades = df_trend["Total Traded Quantity"].mean() print("The average traded quantity is: ", average_trades) >>The average traded quantity is: Trend Slight or No Change 1.635627e+06 Name: Total Traded Quantity, dtype: float64 But I have 9 types of trends in Trend column, although I get only one type here in the output. How shall I proceed?
