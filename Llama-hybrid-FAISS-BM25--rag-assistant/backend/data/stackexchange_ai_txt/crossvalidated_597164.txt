ANOVA for 2 groups with subgroups within the second group?

Say I’m interested in running an experiment. I want to see if student using collaborative techniques (say we pick one random technique) affects test scores. So, obviously the null hypothesis is that there is no change in test scores and the alternative hypothesis is that there is some significant change from employing this treatment. I’ll give my experimental design idea and I want to know what would be the test to use if this experiment were to actually take place. So say there are two courses and the students have roughly the same level in math (or whatever as long as it’s the same subject matter). Class A is the control group and class B is the treatment group. In the treatment group, the students are split into many smaller groups since normal classes have 20 + students. There are, say, 4 exams (and they’re the same for both groups) given during the year. How do I test if the treatment made a difference? I’m thinking a One-Way ANOVA. Or a two sample t-test? Is the fact that there are smaller groups in Class B a problem or could just average all those exams and compare it to Class A’s? What about the fact that there are 4 exams throughout the year? I feel like that’s problematic. Would it be best to pick one exam, say the final exam to test whether one or not the treatment made a difference? Are there other things I should be concerned about? Is One-Way ANOVA the right way to go here?
