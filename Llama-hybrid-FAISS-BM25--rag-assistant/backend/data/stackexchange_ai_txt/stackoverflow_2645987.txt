ghostdog gave me a clue to the solution First I enumerated the table into a dictionary Then step through it. If the line began with VLAN I could then test for line+1 etc to see if it was a helper line then output them all as one line and slice it up as I needed Not the cleanest way, but works and thanks all for your help
