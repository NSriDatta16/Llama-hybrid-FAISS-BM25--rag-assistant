How to enable visual styles without a manifest

I am referring to this answer How to enable visual styles without a manifest Doing what that answers says creates a .manifest and visual styles are enabled. However I don't want the manifest to be bounded with my .exe - I am delivering only my executable and would like everything bundled in there. Is there a way to enable visual styles without manifest or maybe through embedding the manifest inside the executable itself?
