I believe this add-on equals the feature described on http://sqlite.phxsoftware.com/ : "Visual Studio 2005/2008 Design-Time Support You can add a SQLite connection to the Server Explorer, create queries with the query designer, drag-and-drop tables onto a Typed DataSet and more! SQLite's designer works on full editions of Visual Studio 2005/2008, including VS2005 Express Editions. * NEW You can create/edit views, tables, indexes, foreign keys, constraints and triggers interactively within the Visual Studio Server Explorer!" I think it's just about the ability to use the common database-related features of VS with SQLite.
