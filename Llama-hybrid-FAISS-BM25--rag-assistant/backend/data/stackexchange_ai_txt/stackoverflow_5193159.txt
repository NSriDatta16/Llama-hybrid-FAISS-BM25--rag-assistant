Thanks Aditya, The crash logs in the Organizer are actually very well detailed and they even include the line of code in the implementation file where the app crashed. When going to that line of code it seemed that I was CFRelease -ing a ABRecordRef, which is an integer of some kind...therefore I shouldn't release it The weird thing is that it didn't crash or complain while debugging, but when running it on the device it did.
