Why do I need to run a model on multiple imputed datasets?

In R, there is a package called mice which multiply imputes a dataset. For my situation, I imputed using the predictive mean matching (pmm) method using a time series that I acquired that details multiple different climate variables like average temperature, relative humidity, precipitation etc. At some point I would like to combine the results of these multiply imputed datasets, but in the syntax of the mice packages in R I apparently need to fit a statistical model on each imputed dataset. But why do I need this? I mean sure, I need to run a model on the completed dataset (artificial neural networks), but that comes after. Examples on the internet use the lm() package, but that's not exactly what I need. What should I do and why should I do it?
