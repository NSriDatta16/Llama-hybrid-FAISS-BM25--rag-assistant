The null hypothesis for your situation is: $H_0:μ_1=μ_2=μ_3$ $H_A: not\,\, all\,\, µ_i \,\,are\,\, equal.$ Since the p-value for the $F$-test is $> 0.05$, you fail to reject your null hypothesis and conclude that there is not significant difference between any of the $µ_i$. The steps for calculating different ANOVA quantities are as follows: (i) The grand mean is simply an average over all the observations in all the groups. It is denoted by $\bar{Y}..$. (ii) The treatment means (group means in your case) are averaged over the observations in specific groups. It is denoted by $\bar{Y}.$. (iii) Once we have the grand mean and the treatment means, we calculate the overall variability in the data - **Total Sum of Squares: $\sum_i\sum_j(Y_{ij}−\bar Y..)^2$ (iv) Next, we find out how much of the variability is accounted for by different treatments by calculating the **Treatment Sum of Squares = $\sum_1^{n=i}(\bar Y_i.−\bar Y..)^2$ (v) Once we find out the variability caused by the treatments (groups, in your case), the rest of the variability in the data is being caused by noise. We calculate that by subtracting the treatment SS by total SS . $Error\,\,sum\,\, of\,\, squares = Total\,\,SS - Treatment\,\, SS$. (vi) Next we find $MSTrt = SSTrt/df_{Trt}$ and $MSError = SSError/df_{Error}$. (vii) The ratio of the $MSTrt$ and $MSErr$ gives us the $F$-statistic. (viii) If the F-statistic is greater than your critical F, we reject the null hypothesis. The link you have posted for the online calculator doesn't show any formulas.
