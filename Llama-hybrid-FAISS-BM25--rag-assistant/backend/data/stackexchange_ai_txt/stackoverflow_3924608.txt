Rails 3 - set environment

I have a rails 3 app (which I upgraded). It runs on passenger and nginx but on my production server it also starts with the environment set to 'production'. I know I am missing something really basic, but I just can't figure out where to set the environment instead of in environment.rb. Thanks for helping! UPDATE: ok, I learned I can still do that with Rails.env = 'production'. That seems kind of old school to me. Do you know an elegant way to configure this maybe in the Capfile or sth like that?
