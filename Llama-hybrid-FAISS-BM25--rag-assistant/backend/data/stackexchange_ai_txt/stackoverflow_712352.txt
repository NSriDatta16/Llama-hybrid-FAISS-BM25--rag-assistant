Here's how HTTP protocol works: You send this kind of header with your browser: GET /questions/712326/why-cant-i-use-sessionstart-in-my-php-script-it-says-headers-are-already-sen HTTP/1.1 Host: stackoverflow.com User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; fi; rv:1.9.0.8) Gecko/2009032609 Firefox/3.0.8 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729) Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: fi-fi,fi;q=0.8,en-us;q=0.5,en;q=0.3 Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7 Keep-Alive: 300 Connection: keep-alive Referer: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/php Cookie: *censored* Cache-Control: max-age=0 First server sends you headers: HTTP/1.x 200 OK Cache-Control: private Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8 Content-Encoding: gzip Expires: Fri, 03 Apr 2009 02:14:49 GMT Vary: Accept-Encoding Server: Microsoft-IIS/7.0 Set-Cookie: *censored* Date: Fri, 03 Apr 2009 02:14:49 GMT Content-Length: 9346 Then server sends you the actual page data Why can't I use session_start() in my php script? It says headers are already sent. - Stack Overflow ..snip.. So you see you can't FIRST send HTML data (DOCTYPE) and then header data because header is already processed. You can go around with PHP's Output Control but more recommended is that you use MVC design where you buffer all data that user sees last.
