High security is a difficult concept as it generally involves way more than just the code you wrote. Basically every layer of the OSI model has to be taken into consideration. Things like, preventing capture of the data stream (or it being rerouted) between the end points ( quantum cryptography ). At the higher levels, you have things like various things like Physical security of the devices (all endpoints if possible). Hardening the OS (e.g: closing ports, turning off unused services, using kerberos, VPN tunnels, and leveraging white lists of machines allowed to connect, etc); Encrypting the data at rest (file encryption), in transmission (SSL), and in memory (column/table encryption). Ensuring and enforcing proper authentication and authorization at every level (in app, in sql, etc). Log EVERYTHING. At a minimal it should answer "who/what/when/where/how" Along with the logging, Actively Monitor it. aka: intrusion detection. Then we can move on to other things like looking at other attack vectors like sql injection, xss, internal / disgruntled employees, etc. And once you've done all of that be prepared when a hacker gets away with everything they want simply by social engineering. In short, the best tact to take in order to secure any computer related application is to listen to the ethos of Fox Mulder, and Trust No One. Another favorite of mine that applies is: It's only paranoia if they aren't after you.
