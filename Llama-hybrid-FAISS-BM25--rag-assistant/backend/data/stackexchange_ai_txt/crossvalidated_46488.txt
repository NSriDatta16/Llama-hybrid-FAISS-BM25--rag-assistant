SVM hyperplane equation

I am trying to understand the hyperplane of the SVM algorithm. My problem is that different sources state different equations. Which equation is the right one and if both are right, why? Wikipedia : $w\cdot x-b = 0.$ Intelligent Data Analysis and Probabilistic Inference notes : $ w\cdot x+b = 0.$ Furthermore, I thought the normal form of a plane looks like this: $$ w\cdot x + w\cdot a = 0.$$
