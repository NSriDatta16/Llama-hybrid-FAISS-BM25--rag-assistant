Loading a different dataset per test method in DBUnit

I'm trying to use DBUnit to test my DAO layer methods. Every method needs different set of seed data. Example: getEmployeeById(Long id) needs data from Employee table updateOrder(CustomerId cId) needs data from Orders table Is there an elegant way to load different seed data before running different methods instead of loading all the data at a time in a setUp method? Thank you.
