For linear regression, a muti-label output is the same as multiple linear regression models - each has its own coefficients. But for other models, such as a neural network, one model with several outputs is not the same as several independent models. In such a case, if you believe the labels depend on some common underlying structure then it is better to use one model with multiple outputs.
