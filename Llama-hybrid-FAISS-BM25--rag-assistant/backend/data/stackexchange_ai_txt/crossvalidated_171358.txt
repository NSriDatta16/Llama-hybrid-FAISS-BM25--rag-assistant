I realized that my assumption might be wrong, which states "I will expect the P(Y) of subset will be close to P(Y) of the original training set." The parameters of probability distribution (or underlying data structure) is unknown. Bayesian methods begin with a prior probability (prior degree of belief). After training model by learning more observation data, we can update the belief, i.e. post probability. Training data set composes of features (attributes) and classes (or labels). Stratified sampling would introduce bias by the labels.
