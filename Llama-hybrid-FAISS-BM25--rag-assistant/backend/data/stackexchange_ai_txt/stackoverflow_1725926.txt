Creating an application to move files around ... am I looking for a service bus?

We do a lot of document scanning, and I find myself now with a bunch of simple scripts that watch incoming folders for files, and then route the files to their final destination (i.e. they might end up in a Sharepoint library, or be encrypted and stored in an archive folder, etc). I'm considering developing a rather simple application to consolidate this effort. Essentially it could be configured with inputs (i.e. folders to watch, mailboxes to check, etc), and then one or more actions that could be performed per input (i.e. copy to webdav folder, send to web service, send via email, etc). Now this isn't a terribly difficult application to whip out, but I'm curious... I heard a podcast or something about "Mule", I believe, which is an ESB. And I don't know much about service buses, but it sounds to me like what I'm considering doing is at least similar. Is it? Is there a lightweight framework / library / application that I can use to accomplish my task without a gigantic learning curve? Preferably Java-based, but C#/.Net isn't out of the question. (P.S. I considered this for ServerFault, but it seems appropriate here...)
