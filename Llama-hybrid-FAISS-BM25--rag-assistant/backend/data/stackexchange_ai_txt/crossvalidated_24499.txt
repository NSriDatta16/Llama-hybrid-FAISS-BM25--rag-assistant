k-means is not appropriate for this kind of data, for a very simple reason. Assume you convert the data set so that value a = 1, value b = 2, value c = 3, a cluster that consists of 10 objects with label a and 10 objects with label c will have a center at the value of b . And even when you have binary data, what is an average of 0.1314 supposed to mean? Do not convert the data set. Choose an appropriate distance function that can handle binary attributes, and use an algorithm that only needs distances and not a vector space. Methods that require an euclidean vectors space (such as k-means, in order to compute a mean) are not meaningful for that that just isn't from an euclidean space.
