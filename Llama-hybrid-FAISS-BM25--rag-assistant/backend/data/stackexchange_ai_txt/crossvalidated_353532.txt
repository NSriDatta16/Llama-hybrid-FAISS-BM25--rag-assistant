How to compare 2 clustering algorithm?

I have selected 'Nursery' data set from UCI machine learning repository and run 2 different clustering algorithm on, K Means and Hierarchical clustering. How should I compare these to algorithm to see which one did a better job on the data set? I have calculated the parameters: adjust_rand_score adjust_mutual_info_score silhouette_score for each 2 clustering model. Is that true to compare the calculated parameters to see which one did better? For example: K Means model: adjust_mutual_info_score = 0.044 silhouette_score = 0.56 For Hierarchical Clustering model: adjust_mutual_info_score = 0.16 silhouette_score = 0.59 So can I say the Hierarchical model has did a better job? Or there is another parameter to compare these 2 clustering algorithms?
