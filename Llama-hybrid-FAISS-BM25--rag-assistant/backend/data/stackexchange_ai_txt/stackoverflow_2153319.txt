Efficiency of embedding flash assets in flex actionscript project

I'm creating a project in flex builder but it's not using the flex framework, it's just pure actionscript. At the moment I have some bitmap resources embedded for drawing things, but I'd like a little animation and thought I could create swf animations for them in flash and use the [Embed()] thing to embed them in the actionscript project. This works perfectly well for me, however I'm a little concerned about efficiency and how well this approach will scale when my project gets larger. Does anyone know if there are any efficiency implications to embedding maybe 20 or 30 swf files, or do they get efficiently integrated into the main swf file? Most of the animations are really simple and I could probably redo them in actionscript if needed but it's a lot easier just to draw them in flash and embed them.
