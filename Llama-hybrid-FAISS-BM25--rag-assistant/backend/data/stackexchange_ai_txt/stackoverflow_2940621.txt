In regards the MySQL issue, what storage engine you use can make a difference. "MyISAM relies on the operating system for caching reads and writes to the data rows while InnoDB does this within the engine itself" Oracle will cache the table/data rows, so it won't need to hit the disk. depending on the OS and hardware, there's a chance that MySQL MyISAM had to physically read the data off the disk each time.
