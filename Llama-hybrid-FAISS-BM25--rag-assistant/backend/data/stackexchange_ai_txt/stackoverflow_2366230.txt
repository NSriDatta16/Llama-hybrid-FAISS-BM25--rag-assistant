Thanks for helping me out Joe, in the meantime i made, again, a lot of progress, but still not there yet ;-) What i actually want to achieve is that any page of magento can be dispatched. For example a valid http post request to /customer/account/login should still log me in. Except rendering the body of the response. I dont want the layout to be rendered by default, in stead i want to fetch a block (defined in the corresponding requested layout xml) in a programmatic manner. Short code example, of how i see it. toHtml(); ?> Best would be handling this in the local code pool, however im not sure it's a good idea to extend (if its at all possible) the front controller. I didnt know about layout update handles.. a layout can update? What do they mean with that...
