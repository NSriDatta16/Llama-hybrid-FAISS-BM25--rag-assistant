How do I know if raw sockets are enabled in Windows 7?

I'm currently working on an app in C++ as for studying tcp/ip raw sockets on a Win7 box. I want to know if my OS has raw sockets enabled, and if not, is there any way to enable them? I can see from here that Winsock has limitations in Win7 (again: is it possible to unlock it since its my box, I have admin privileges). Moreover, despite of those referenced limitations, is it possible at least, for me to complete the TCP 3-way presentation? Maybe my last option would be using Winpcap library.
