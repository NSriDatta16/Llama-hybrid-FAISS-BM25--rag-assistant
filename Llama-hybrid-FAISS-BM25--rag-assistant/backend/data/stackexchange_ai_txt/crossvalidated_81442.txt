Categorical IVs with more than two groups are perfectly fine for a logistic regression, just like multiple regression. If the dependent variable is more than two groups, however, then a multinomial logistic regression is appropriate. The UCLA website has a great tutorial for ordinal logistic regression in R. The example used only has a categorical predictor with 2 levels, but the same logic applies (much like in a multiple regression).
