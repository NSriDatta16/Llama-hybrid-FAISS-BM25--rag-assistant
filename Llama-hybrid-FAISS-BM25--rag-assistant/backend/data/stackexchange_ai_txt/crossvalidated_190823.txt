How to estimate real series from smoothed moving average?

Suppose I have an observed time series $y_t$, which I suspect has been smoothed out. It appears to be significant autocorrelation at lag 1 and 2, therefore I suppose that the observed series $y_t$ is in the form: $$y_t = \theta_0 x_t + \theta_1 x_{t-1} + (1 - \theta_0 - \theta_1)x_{t-2}$$ where $x_t$ is the original series I am after. How can I recover the "original" series $x_t$? Clearly I need a method to estimate $\theta_0$ and $\theta_1$ and then apply the relevant transformation. But how to do that? I don't see how to apply an arima process here.
