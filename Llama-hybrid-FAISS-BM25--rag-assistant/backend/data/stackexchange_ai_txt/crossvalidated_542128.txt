Let's go back to first principles here to see what you are trying to estimate. The GLM with the binomial family and the logit link function is just the logistic regression model , so we can use the regression equation for that model. Letting $p \equiv \mathbb{P}(Y=1)$ be the probability of a positive response outcome (here the death of the organism), your model is based on the model equation: $$\log \Big( \frac{p}{1-p} \Big) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x.$$ Setting $p = \tfrac{1}{2}$ gives the corresponding explanatory value (here the LC50 concentration): $$x_* \equiv \frac{\log(\tfrac{1}{2}/\tfrac{1}{2}) - \beta_0}{\beta_1} = \frac{\log(1) - \beta_0}{\beta_1} = - \frac{\beta_0}{\beta_1}.$$ So, you are effectively trying to find a confidence interval for the ratio of the true coefficients in the logistic regression. Usually we approximate the joint distribution of the estimated coefficients by a normal distribution (by appeal to the central limit theorem for large $n$ ) and so we are then trying to find a confidence interval for the true ratio based on observed estimators that are assumed to be jointly normally distributed around the true values (with non-zero correlation). (The estimated variance-covariance matrix for the estimators can be found using the vcov command on your model.) The other answer here already shows you how you can use bootstrapping to get a confidence interval in this case, but there are a range of analytic approximations you can use if you prefer; for some examples of analytic forms for this type of confidence interval, see e.g., Malley (1982) , Shanmugalingam (1982) , and Dunlap and Silver (1986) .
