Visualizing tasks completed by workers over time

I have several "workers"/"executors"/"agents" that process some "tasks" over time. The data about processed tasks can be presented in a table like this: Task # Processed by Time started Time completed 1 X 12:00 12:10 2 X 12:15 12:30 3 Y 12:20 12:35 4 Z 12:25 12:40 5 z 12:30 12:40 6 Y 12:35 12:40 7 Y 13:00 13:30 I want to visualize it in some way like this (screenshot from manually colored Excel spreadsheet): , kinda like Gantt chart - but each row (corresponding to worker) should contain many colored bars (corresponding to task and its execution time). Question is - how is this type of charts/diagrams even called? Or maybe it is possible to visualize the data with other (more "mainstream") charts in a way I have not thought about yet? NOTE: The question is not about project management or planning, it is about ways to visualize "machine-provided" data. Specifically - I am looking for means to visualize build processing times on Jenkins automation server, in order to highlight problematic agents and bottlenecks and study their reasons.
