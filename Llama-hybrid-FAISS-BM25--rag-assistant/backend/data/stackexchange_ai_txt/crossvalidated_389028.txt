What kind of method would show the association between these two sets

First of all please excuse my total lack of stats knowledge. I have only taken a couple back in my college days that I do not quite remember too much. I have a time series of data such as this: X | Y ---------------- 1 1000 10 1020 5 900 6 901 7 902 8 950 2 800 Every time X goes up or down so does Y. The amount X goes up/down each time is different than Y, but still there is some sort of relationship there. I am trying to figure out if there is a method to determine that there is a relationship here. If I try to check the correlation it will give me an R value of R value of ~0.40 which is a weak relationship. What are the method or methods out there to determine that there is a relationship between these two sets? Regards. Visually I can see there is a relationship but not sure how to quantify it.
