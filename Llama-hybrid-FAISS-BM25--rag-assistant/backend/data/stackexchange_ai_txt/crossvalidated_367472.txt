The between-group variance in the intercepts need not be less than 1, although your estimates suggest there is considerable heterogeneity. This seems implausibly large to me. If you are going to calculate an ICC, you should specify ppd = TRUE , which is somehow not the default for non-Gaussian models, despite the documentation of sjstats::icc saying Logical, if TRUE, variance decomposition is based on the posterior predictive distribution, which is the correct way for Bayesian non-Gaussian models.
