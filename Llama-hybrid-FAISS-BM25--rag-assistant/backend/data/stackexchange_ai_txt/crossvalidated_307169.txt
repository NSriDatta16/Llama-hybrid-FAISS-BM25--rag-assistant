Two statistical tests would be used to check the stationarity of a time series â€“ the Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF) test and the Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) test. Both tests should be used. The ADF test null and alternate hypothesis are: Null Hypothesis: The series has a unit root . Alternate Hypothesis: The series has no unit root. If the null hypothesis in failed to be rejected, this test may provide evidence that the series is non-stationary. For the KPSS test the null and alternative hypotheses are reversed: Null Hypothesis: The process is trend stationary. Alternate Hypothesis: The series has a unit root (series is not stationary).
