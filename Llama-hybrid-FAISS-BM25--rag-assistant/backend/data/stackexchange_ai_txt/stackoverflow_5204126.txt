Managing events on a custom UIControl

I am subclassing UIControl to compose a custom control that contains different standard controls. For this discussion let's assume that my custom UIControl contains a UIButton only. What I would like to achieve is that clicking anywhere in the custom UIControl generates a click event for that custom UIControl. The standard behavior is that the UIButton will process and consume (i.e. not forward) the click event. As subclassing UIButton is discouraged, I can't really find a straightforward way of achieving this. Any suggestions?
