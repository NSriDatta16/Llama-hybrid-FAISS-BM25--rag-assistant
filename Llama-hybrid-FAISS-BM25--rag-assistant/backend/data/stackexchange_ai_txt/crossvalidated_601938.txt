Time series forecasting for dataset spanning a week

I am a newbie in time series data forecasting. I have a week long data and the counts represent arrivals per 5 mins period. A part of the dataset is shown below. DATE COUNT 2018-06-01 10:00:00 4922 2018-06-01 10:05:00 7924 2018-06-01 10:10:00 8352 2018-06-01 10:15:00 7865 2018-06-01 10:20:00 5642 I am trying to model it to forecast data for the next day. I tried SARIMA model in Python using the following code to model it since it clearly has a seasonal component to it but the results are not good as shown. train, test = train_test_split(data, train_size=1600) arima_model = auto_arima(train, seasonal=True, m=7) prediction = pd.DataFrame(arima_model.predict(n_periods = 416),index=test.index) Do you have any recommendations on what other approaches may work best for this data? Since my data does not contain multiple seasonalities, do you think bats or tbats would be suitable for it? SARIMA may not be working since my dataset is pretty small and does not span months or years plus I am not entirely sure that about the value of m in my code.
