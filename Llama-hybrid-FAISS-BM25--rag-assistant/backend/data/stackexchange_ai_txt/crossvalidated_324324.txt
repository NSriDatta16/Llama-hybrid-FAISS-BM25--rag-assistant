I think part of your problem is that you like math and you seem to have an intuitive bent. Both of these are getting in the way of you understanding why the professor does what the professor does. First, a lot of people in math courses, even upper division math courses, are not math or statistics majors and they may very well hate math. They are in the audience too. Second, sixty-five percent of the population are concrete, step-by-step thinkers. They will struggle if you explain the implications before doing the proof. Indeed, they may not value the implications as the person providing them could be over-valuing or under-valuing their true, long-run importance to that person. Because the instructor is teaching to both groups, but your group is a definite minority, the instruction satisfies nobody. There are definitely students out there who wish the professor would spend more time with the proofs and solving things as algorithms and skip the "meaning." How can anyone determine the meaning or importance of anything for anyone other than themselves? Now let me tell you how I would alter math education from K-undergraduate. I would ban $y=7x^2+2x-16$. Everything would be a word problem from beginning to end because no user of math (I am purposefully ignoring the makers of math) will ever be asked by a customer to turn to page 83 and solve problem 5. Instead, they will provide a very messy account of the problem they are facing. The solution of that problem may very well be $y=7x^2+2x-16$ but the breakdown in math when you are outside the academic field of math is converting language into flexible problem solutions. I mean that more than simply deciding that a solution should algorithmically follow from the word problem. In many cases, algebraic solutions, trigonometric solutions, and geometric solutions are available to solve a problem. The problem's specification shouldn't lead you to form unless you want to narrow the thinking. To think about this in statistics, if there are three different solutions in Frequentist, Bayesian or Fisherian statistics, then which one follows from the question and why? Could it be more than one? Why?
