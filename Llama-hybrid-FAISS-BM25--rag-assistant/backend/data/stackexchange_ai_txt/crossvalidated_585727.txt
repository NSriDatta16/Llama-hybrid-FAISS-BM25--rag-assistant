Under what conditions do different choices of link function for GLMs result in considerably different models?

The statistical folklore I have heard is that the choice of link function usually does not considerably affect the resulting fit of a GLM. For example, usually probit regression and logistic regression give models that generate similar predicted probabilities. D. R. Cox made a similar comment in Analysis of Binary Data . How would one mathematically describe this similarity and under what conditions it holds?
