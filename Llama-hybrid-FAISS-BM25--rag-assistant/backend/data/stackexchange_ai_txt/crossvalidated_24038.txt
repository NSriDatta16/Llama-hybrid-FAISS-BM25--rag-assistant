Note that ridge penalisation/regularisation is basically doing model selection using pca. Although it does it smoothly by shrinking along each principal component axis rather than discretely by dropping small.variance pcs. Note that because you are doing pca on different subsets of variables this would roughly correspond to having different regularising parameters for each group rather than one for all the betas. The elements of statistical learning explains ridging quite well and provides some comparisons.
