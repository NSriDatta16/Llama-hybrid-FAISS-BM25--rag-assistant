A note on definitions: From your clarifying comment for examples of what you mean by "probabilistic": K-means (non-probabilistic) vs. Gaussian mixture model (probabilistic). It sounds like you're talking about what the literature usually calls parametric vs. non-parametric model. I'd suggest reading [this post][1] from the Machine Learning Mastery blog, and following the references at the bottom of the page under "Posts".
