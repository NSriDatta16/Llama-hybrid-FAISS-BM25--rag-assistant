I understand the Question, since panel data (and multiple, parallel time series and ...) can look like examples for functional data analysis. But functional data analysis is much more general and cover much more. For examples look t some earlier posts: When/where to use functional data analysis?

The answers to this questions (and many others) can be summarized swiftly by saying that functional data analysis answers other questions, and is more general.
