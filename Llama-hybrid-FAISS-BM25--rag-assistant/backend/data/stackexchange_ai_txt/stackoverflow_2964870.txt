Have you tried adding a listener in form contained fields ? I know you don't have full control over that class, but, well, it's some java code ! Run it in your debugger, and you'll see the code organization for that DataWindow. Then, you'll be able to add a Key/Action/Anything/Listener to trigger your code execution.
