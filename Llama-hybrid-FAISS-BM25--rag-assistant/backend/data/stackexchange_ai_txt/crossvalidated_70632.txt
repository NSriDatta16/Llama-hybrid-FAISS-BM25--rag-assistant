If you use Stata, Introduction to Time Series Using Stata by Sean Becketti is a solid gentle introduction, with many examples and an emphasis on intuition over theory. I think this book would complement Ender rather well. The book opens with an intro to Stata language, followed by a quick review of regression and hypothesis testing. The time series part starts with moving-average and Holtâ€“Winters techniques to smooth and forecast the data. The next section focuses on using these for techniques forecasting. These methods are often neglected, but they work rather well for automated forecasting and are easy to explain. Becketti explains when they will work and when they won't. The next chapters cover single-equation time-series models like autocorrelated disturbances, ARIMA, and ARCH/GARCH modeling. In the end, Becketti discusses multiple-equation models, particularly VARs and VECs, and non-stationary time series.
