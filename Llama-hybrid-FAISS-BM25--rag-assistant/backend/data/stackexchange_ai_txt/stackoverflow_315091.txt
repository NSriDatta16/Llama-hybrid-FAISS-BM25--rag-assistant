Interleave row/column colors in a GridView

Suppose you have a GridView with a few columns like: | Foo | Bar | Total | and you use a style sheet to make the alternating rows different colors, say light blue and white. Is there a good way to make a particular column alternate in a different color? For example, I might want the Total column to alternate in medium and light red to bring attention to it in a large grid. BTW, I know you can programmatically change the color of a cell. I'd like to stick to CSS if it all possible, however, so all my style stuff is in one place. I also don't see an easy way to tell if I'm in an alternating row when I'm inside the event handler.
