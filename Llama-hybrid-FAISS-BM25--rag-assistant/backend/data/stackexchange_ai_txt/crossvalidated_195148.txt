These are, in my opinion, very good books. R. Rojas: Neural Networks C. M. Bishop: Neural Networks for Pattern recognition The books have some similarities: They are both around 500 pages long, and they are fairly old, from 1995. Nevertheless, they remain very useful. Both books start from scratch, by explaining what neural networks are. They provide clear explanations, good examples and good graphs to aid understanding. They explain in great detail the issues of training neural networks, in their many shapes and forms, and what they can and cannot do. The two books supplement each other very nicely, for what one cannot figure out with one book, one tends to find in the other. Rojas has a section, which I particularly like, about implementing back-propagation over many layers in matrix form. It also has a nice section about fuzzy logic, and one about complexity theory. But then Bishop has lots of other nice sections. Rojas is, I would say, the most accessible. Bishop is more mathematical and perhaps more sophisticated. In both books, the maths is mostly linear algebra and calculus of functions of multiple variables (partial derivatives and so on). Without any knowledge of these subjects, you probably would not find either of these books very illuminating. I would recommend reading Rojas first. Both books, obviously, have a lot to say about algorithms, but neither says much about specific implementations in code. To me, these books provide the background, which make an on-line course, (such as Hinton's, on Coursera) understandable. The books also cover much more ground, and in far greater detail, than can be done online. I hope this helps, and am happy to answer any questions about the books.
