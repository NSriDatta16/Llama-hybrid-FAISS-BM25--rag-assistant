Where to draw the line - is it possible to love LINQ too much?

I recently found LINQ and love it. I find lots of occasions where use of it is so much more expressive than the longhand version but a colleague passed a comment about me abusing this technology which now has me second guessing myself. It is my perspective that if a technology works efficiently and the code is elegant then why not use it? Is that wrong? I could spend extra time writing out processes "longhand" and while the resulting code may be a few ms faster, it's 2-3 times more code and therefore 2-3 times more chance that there may be bugs. Is my view wrong? Should I be writing my code out longhand rather than using LINQ? Isn't this what LINQ was designed for? Edit: I was speaking about LINQ to objects, I don't use LINQ to XML so much and I have used LINQ to SQL but I'm not so enamoured with those flavours as LINQ to objects.
