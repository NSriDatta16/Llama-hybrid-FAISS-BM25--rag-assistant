well... once i worked with a php soap server and a php soap client. I think that when the client calls the service, it passes through the wsdl and if there's a problem during the conection (or even the execution) server side, the response of the client will be a SoapFault object.. id di something like $resp = $this->client->__soapCall($serviceName,$serviceParams); if (get_class($resp)=="SoapFault"){ throw new Exception("Webservice error - Message: ".$resp->faultstring); }
