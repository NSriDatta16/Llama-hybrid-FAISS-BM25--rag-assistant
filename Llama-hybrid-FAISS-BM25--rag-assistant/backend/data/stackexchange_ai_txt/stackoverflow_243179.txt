Throttle traffic in Apache based on User-Agent

We are running Apache (IBM HTTP Server 6.0.2.0) in front of WebSphere 6.0 on linux. We are getting excessive traffic from a specific User-Agent from varying IP addresses. We do not want to block the User-Agent or IP addresses, but would like to slow them down a bit. Best scenario for us would be to use out of the box Apache config options to solve the problem. Any thoughts or suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks!
