a few observations: declaring the attributes in the constructor is possible, but it's not elegant. I'd rather do: class ann { private $context; private $orgs_id; the "->" operator won't work inside a string. You'll need to concatenate the query: "INSERT INTO anns(context,orgs_id, created_at) VALUES('".$this->context."',".$this->orgs_id".", '".$this->created_at."'" but be careful on sql injection The rest should be fine! Good Luck.
