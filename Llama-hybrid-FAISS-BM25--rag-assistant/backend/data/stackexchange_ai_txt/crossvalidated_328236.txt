The general term for this kind of problem, in which you want to predict one variable using another, and you have input-output pairs with which to train a model, is "supervised learning". Supervised learning is the most common application of statistics and machine learning. Machine-learning people like to call supervised learning of a continuous variable "regression", although to statisticians, this term refers to a certain family of models. In any case, there's a wide array of tools available for such problems, from linear regression to neural networks.
