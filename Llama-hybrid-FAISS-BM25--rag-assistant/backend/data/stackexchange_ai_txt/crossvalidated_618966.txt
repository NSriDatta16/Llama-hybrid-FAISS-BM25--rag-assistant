Is it necessary to do train-test split when we are interested in understanding the model rather than predicting?

In machine learning we are taught to always do validation of some sort, for instance by creating a hold out validation set that is used to test the performance of the model. However, in some use cases we are interested in understanding the underlying relationship between variables. If we take a linear regression for instance, we could use the coefficient to interpret the effect of each metric. In this paradigm, should we also do train/test split? if I use a random forest for instance?
