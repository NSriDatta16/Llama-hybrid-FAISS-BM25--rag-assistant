How to append no. of bytes to a byte array?

I am doing a project in 'Steganography' in which I want to encrypt the contents of file using 'Blowfish' algorithm and then want to embed the encrypted text in the image and do the reverse procedure for extracting the image. The 'update' method from class 'Cipher' encrypts only some no. of bytes but, here I want all the bytes(encrypted contents) of the file in only one array. Same is the case with 'update' method in decryption. This array later will be passed to a method in which I embed the text in the image and extract when required.So what can be the better approach towards this problem? Thank you.
