AJAX & Python: Response text from python script is an object

Edited out silly mistake I am using AJAX to access a python script, get some TEXT from the python script & display it on my webpage. My Problem: is that the response text is this "undefined" when it should be this "bbbb" I am confused as to where I am going wrong? Is it my python script is incorrect (not handling AJAX (?requests?) correctly), is it my javascript or is it my WSGI server I made? HTML & Javascript: abcdef Click it My python script: import cgitb; cgitb.enable() import cgi import os input_data = cgi.FieldStorage() print "bbbb" #print "you said: " + input_data['email']
