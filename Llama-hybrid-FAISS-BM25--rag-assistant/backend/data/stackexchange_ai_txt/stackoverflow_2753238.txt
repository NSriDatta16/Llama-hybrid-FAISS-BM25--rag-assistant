There are good and bad points. And it depends on who you are. about 5 years ago it became all the rage to put all images in the database. But with server space sizes bigger today, its not really about saving space. A negative would be you will always require understanding of server side programming to use images. If this development my be passed to another person, it could prove problematic. As far as I can see, if it works, it works and I can't see performance issues - it seems very quick.
