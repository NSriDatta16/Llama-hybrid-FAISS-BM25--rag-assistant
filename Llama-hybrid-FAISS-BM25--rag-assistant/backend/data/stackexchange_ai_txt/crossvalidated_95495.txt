Guideline to select the hyperparameters in Deep Learning

I'm looking for a paper that could help in giving a guideline on how to choose the hyperparameters of a deep architecture, like stacked auto-encoders or deep believe networks. There are a lot of hyperparameters and I'm very confused on how to choose them. Also using cross-validation is not an option since training really takes a lot of time!
