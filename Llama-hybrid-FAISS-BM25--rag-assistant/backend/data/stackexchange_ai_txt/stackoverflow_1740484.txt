In addition to the other hints provided, you should take notice of the line b = strcat(b, str_temp); which seems rather inappropriate for b is merely defined as a char pointer to a single byte storage ("" defines an empty string, i.e. an array of chars with a single element containing '\0') So when strcat appends to b, it creates a buffer overrun. Edit :Actually I just noticed that b was assigned to point to a, (thanks to the line preceding the one mentionned) so that would then be ok, since a may have the room for this... It doesn't make sense however, to need the two variables. Maybe what you do not understand, is that although strcat() returns a pointer, this return doesn't need to be "consumed", it is merely a convenience, for when we chain commands an such. In other words you can simply write: strcat(a, str_temp); Not requiring any char * b.
