The higher the number of filters, the higher the number of abstractions that your Network is able to extract from image data. The reason why the number of filters is generally ascending is that at the input layer the Network receives raw pixel data. Raw data are always noisy, and this is especially true for image data. Because of this, we let CNNs extract first some relevant information from noisy, "dirty" raw pixel data. Once the useful features have been extracted, then we make the CNN elaborate more complex abstractions on it. That is why the number of filters usually increases as the Network gets deeper, even though it doesn't necessarily have to be like that.
