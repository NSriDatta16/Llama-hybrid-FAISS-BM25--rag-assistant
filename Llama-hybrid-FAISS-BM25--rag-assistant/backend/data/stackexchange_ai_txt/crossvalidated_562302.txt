The probability of a particular sample in the training set not appearing in the bootstrap sample is $$p=\left(\frac{m-1}{m}\right)^m=\left(1-\frac{1}{m}\right)^m\rightarrow e^{-1}$$ as $m$ grows. That means probability of this particular sample being present in the bootstrap sample is $1-p=1-1/e\approx 0.63$ . This means, on average, $63\%$ of the training set is expected to be in the bootstrapped sample.
