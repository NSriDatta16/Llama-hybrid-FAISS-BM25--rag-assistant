Combining Probability/Forecasts within Groups

I am familiar with the concept of combining forecasts. In the simplest scenario, that could be just averaging the forecasts. For example, let's say I have three forecasts representing the likelihood of an event such as (35, 50, 40). The combined forecast would be (35+50+40)/3 = 41.67 (although I realize there are some more sophisticated methods). This seems straightforward enough. Although I understand there are some risks associated with this, I was under the impression that combining forecasts is a common approach as in this question's answers. However, let's say I have a situation that has multiple forecasts for multiple different groups (alternative options). As an intuitive example, a list of orders to be picked up from different locations. order prob location 1 0.4 A 2 0.5 A 3 0.35 A 4 0.95 A 5 0.6 B 6 0.5 B 7 0.75 B 8 0.15 B Each order has a probability of being accepted (i.e. forecast). I want to say the probability of which location an order will be accepted. My initial instinct was to average the probabilities but I'm hesitant. Note - the number of probabilities could exceed 100 per group and there could be >20 groups.
