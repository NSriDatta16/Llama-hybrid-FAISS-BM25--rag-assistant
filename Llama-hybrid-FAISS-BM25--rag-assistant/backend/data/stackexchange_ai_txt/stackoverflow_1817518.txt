Short answer: You can't Changing a value in the TreeList will result in any current user editing being cancelled, reguardless of the use of Binding or not. Official response from DevExpress: Unfortunately, there is no way to prevent an active editor from being closed when the data source values are changed. It is impossible to achieve because the TreeList should be always synchronized with the underlying data. This functionality is implemented via the IBindingList interface in a usual manner. In response to the "change" notification the treeList must refresh itself and, as a result, reload data. This causes the active editing state to be reset. However, there are several different ways to introduce required functionality. For example, you can create a separate form that will contain a set of editors that will provide the ability to edit a specific object directly. Another possible way to achieve this goal is to create some intermediate storage that will cache all changes. The synchronization with the TreeList's data source should be performed by user request.
