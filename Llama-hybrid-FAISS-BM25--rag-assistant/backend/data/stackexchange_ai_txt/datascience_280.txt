Feature selection for tracking user activity within an application

I am developing a system that is intended to capture the "context" of user activity within an application; it is a framework that web applications can use to tag user activity based on requests made to the system. It is hoped that this data can then power ML features such as context aware information retrieval. I'm having trouble deciding on what features to select in addition to these user tags - the URL being requested, approximate time spent with any given resource, estimating the current "activity" within the system. I am interested to know if there are good examples of this kind of technology or any prior research on the subject - a cursory search of the ACM DL revealed some related papers but nothing really spot-on.
