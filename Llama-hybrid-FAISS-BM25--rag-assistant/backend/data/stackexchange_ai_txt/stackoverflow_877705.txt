Assumption: Application is web enabled/web based I'm surprised no one has really mentioned this ... delegate it out to others who are specialists -> use a 3rd party image/file hosting provider . Store your files on a paid online service like Amazon S3 Moso Cloud Storage Another StackOverflow threads talking about this here . This thread explains why you should use a 3rd party hosting provider. It's so worth it. They store it efficiently. No bandwith getting uploaded from your servers to client requests, etc.
