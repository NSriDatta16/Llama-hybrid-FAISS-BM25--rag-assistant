You need to use a distributed filesystem (GlusterFS comes to mind) that can guarantee the synchronization and locking depending on cluster's usage of the files. Otherwise, you may want to consider a centralized storage served via NFS for the simplicity. Beyond that but still centralized would be a SAN filesystem like GFS but be aware that setup requires more to it like fencing.
