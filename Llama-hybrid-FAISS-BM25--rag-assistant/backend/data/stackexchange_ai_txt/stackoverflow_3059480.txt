Wow, so after a few days of testing I went down a path that led me to tracking down Zombies & memory mgmt. This was a situation where the errors I was recieving were leftover from issues in another area. When parsing the data and placing it into Core Data I released an object that was to be autoreleased. So any subsequent calls to that item within core data (save, deletec, etc) caused a crash. Thank you all for your help and I vow to pay closer attention with my memory mgmt calls.
