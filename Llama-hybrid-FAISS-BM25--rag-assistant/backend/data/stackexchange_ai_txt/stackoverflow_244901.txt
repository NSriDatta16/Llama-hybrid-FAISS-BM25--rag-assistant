Design patterns are great for various reasons: gives you a starting for solving common problems. gives developers a vocabulary to talk about certain ways of solving problems in a very compact manner. when working with developers who know design patterns and you use design patterns in your solutions they will understand the solutions a lot faster. But when your goal is just to learn design patterns I think you are missing the fundamentals. All design patterns are based on more common principles. High Cohesion, Low Coupling Open Closed Principle, DRY, Liskov Substitution Principle etc. For these fundamentals I would read the following books in this order: Head First Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (Head First) [ILLUSTRATED] (Paperback) Applying UML and Patterns (Hardcover) Agile Principles, Patterns, and Practices in C# (Robert C. Martin Series) (Hardcover) After that you are ready for the basic gang of four design patterns Head First Design Patterns (Head First) [ILLUSTRATED] (Paperback) The BIBLE A nice website (don't buy anything, it is not worth it) http://dofactory.com/Patterns/Patterns.aspx (some implementations of this site are worth a discussion The next step: Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture (Addison-Wesley Signature Series) (Hardcover) The POSA books And always remember : the pattern is not the goal !
