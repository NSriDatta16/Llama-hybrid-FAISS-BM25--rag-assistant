I think the question is too broad to be answered. But one example would be : assume $A$ is your data matrix, If you center columns (variables) of $\bf A$, then $\bf A'A$ is the scatter (or co-scatter, if to be rigorous) matrix and $\mathbf {A'A}/(n-1)$ is the covariance matrix. Details can be found in Is there an intuitive interpretation of $A^TA$ for a data matrix $A$? If no centering, such nice property will disappear. A related post here, explains why it matters in the application of PCA How does centering make a difference in PCA (for SVD and eigen decomposition)?
