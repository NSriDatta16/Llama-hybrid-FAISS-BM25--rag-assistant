The default storage engine in MySQL is MyISAM . If you need transactions and row-level locking, you often chose InnoDB . Using MySQLInnoDBDialect , Hibernate appends type=InnoDB to the table creation statement. This explicitly creates an InnoDB table. MySQLDialect does not append an engine string, thus, would create a MyISAM table. However, you can also change the default storage engine of the MySQL server by using the following line in your my.cnf , MySQL configuration, file. default-storage-engine=innodb
