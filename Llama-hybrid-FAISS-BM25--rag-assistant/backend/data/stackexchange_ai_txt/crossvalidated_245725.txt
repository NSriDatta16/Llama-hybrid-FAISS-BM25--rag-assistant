For clarity, I would add that any time series where the datapoints are normally distributed through time with a constant mean and variance is considered a strong stationary time series since given the mean and standard deviation the normal distribution will always have the same probability distribution curve (the inputs to the normal equation only depend on the mean and the standard deviation). This is not the case with a t-distribution, for example, where an input to the t-distribution equation is gamma which impacts the shape of the distribution curve despite a constant mean and constant standard deviation.
