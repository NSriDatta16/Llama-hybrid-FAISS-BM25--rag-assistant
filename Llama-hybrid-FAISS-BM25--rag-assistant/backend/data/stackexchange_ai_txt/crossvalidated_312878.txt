Most probably, you do not need dimensionality reduction. People do dimensionality reduction if the problem is intractable, but with 62 features, it is not the case. People also sometimes reduce dimensionality because the number of observations is too small in comparison with the number of features. But if your sample is small, using neural network is a bad idea anyway - use logistic reression or SVM instead, as it is more robust. Dimensionality reduction and feature selection are also sometimes done to make your model more stable. But you can stabilize it by adding regularization (parameter alpha in the MLPClassifier ). Dimensionality reduction and feature selection lead to loss of information which may be useful for classification. So if you don't have a very serious reason for this, do not use PCA or LDA fith MLP.
