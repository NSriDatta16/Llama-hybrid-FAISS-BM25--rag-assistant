Model-free resampling of time series is accomplished by block resampling, also called block bootstrapping, which can be implemented using the tsboot function in Râ€™s boot package. The idea is to break the series into roughly equal-length blocks of consecutive observations, to resample the block with replacement, and then to paste the blocks together. For example, if the time series is of length 200 and one uses 10 blocks of length 20, then the blocks are the first 20 observations, the next 20, and so forth. A possible resample is the fourth block (observation 61 to 80), then the last block (observation 181 to 200), then the second block (observation 21 to 40), then the fourth block again, and so on until there are 10 blocks in the resample. How do you do bootstrapping with time series data?
