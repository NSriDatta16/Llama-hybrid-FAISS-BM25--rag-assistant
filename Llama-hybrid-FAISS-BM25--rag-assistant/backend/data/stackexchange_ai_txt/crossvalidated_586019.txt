Show that the posterior mean can be written as a weighted average of the prior mean and the MLE

From the geometric distribution pmf, $f(x_i |\theta) = (1-\theta)^{x_i -1} \theta; x_i = 1, 2, \cdots$ , I have obtained the 1-parameter exponential family as $$exp \left\{\log \frac{\theta}{1-\theta} + x_i \log (1- \theta) \right\} $$ How can I show that the posterior mean can be written a a weighted average of the prior mean and the MLE. I have found this but can't relate it to my particular question. Thanks in advance. EDIT: I got the prior as $\theta^{a-1} (1-\theta)^{b -1}$ and the posterior as $\theta^{a + n -1} (1-\theta)^{b + S + n -1}$ , with $S = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i$ .
