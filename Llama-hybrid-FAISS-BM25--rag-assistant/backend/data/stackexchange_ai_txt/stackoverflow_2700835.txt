The simplest solution would be to do this in two queries: SELECT ... FROM YourTable WHERE SomeColumn IN (10,4) If and only if the above query yields no results, then run the second query: SELECT ... FROM YourTable WHERE SomeColumn = 3 Running two queries may seem "inelegant" but it has advantages: It's easy to code It's easy to debug It often has better performance than a very complex solution It's easy to understand for a programmer who has to maintain the code after you. Running two queries may seem like it has extra overhead, but also consider that you won't run the second query every time -- only if the first query has an empty result. If you use an expensive single-query solution, remember that it will incur that expense every time .
