Getting people interested in unit testing on someone else's/sample code will not be as effective as having folks "start with the testcase" on some new code they have to write. Cover the basics of starting with a test case and triangulating to a valid result (all the while emphasizing that a failing test is progress). That said, my personal experience is that things like this are better done in a pair programming environment. It's extra work for you, but the combination of one-on-one, some ownership and a working example they can reference at the end of it will make adoption much easier. Getting a coverage tool running at some point later on can, given the right environment, provide a fun, competitive and gratifying way of marking progress. Making this in any way part of compensation/bonuses is a real bad idea. Done correctly, folks will adopt it because it works.
