How to track network usage of my app on iPhone?

My application play video from internet using MPMoviePlayer. I should display: transferred data size and average data transfer speed (for current playing video). I cant get this information from MPMoviePlayer. So I decide to monitor network traffic of my app and use this information. My question is: How to track the network usage of my application? Can I determine how much data my application download from the net? How much time application does downloading of this data?
