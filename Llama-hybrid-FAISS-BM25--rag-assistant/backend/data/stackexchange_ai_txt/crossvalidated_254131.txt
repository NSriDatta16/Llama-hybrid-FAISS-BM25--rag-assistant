I am working on a very similar project to you, and I'm also doing it as an introduction to machine learning. One of the best methods I've seen for getting a tic-tac-toe AI is a reinforcement learning method described in this paper and formally discussed in this book . Basically, you have a program run through possible moves and then update probability of how likely that move is to be correct based on whether or not it ends up winning when playing against a random player. If the player is not random, or you would like a more formal analysis, you can use minimax or alpha-beta pruning as detailed here . Then, I'd recommend training a neural network on the data you've received for an additional challenge. You can also use more advanced methods such as the Monte Carlo Tree Search (similar to the reinforcement learning method above).
