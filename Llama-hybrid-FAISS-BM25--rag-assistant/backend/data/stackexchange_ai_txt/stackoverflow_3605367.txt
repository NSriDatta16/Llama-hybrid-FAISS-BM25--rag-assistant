chrome vs FF/IE/Opera in calculating table cell width ? (table-layout:fixed)

I've searched now for almost half a day... but I couldn't find out why chrome6/7 seems to be the only browser in comparison to IE8/FF3.6/Opera that does not add the padding to the specified width of an table cell. Of course this becomes crucial if you're working with table-layout:fixed, due to the fact that all of a sudden they have to pay attention to the specified px widths. Okay finally my question: does anyone know why Chrome calculates differently, and which browser is right (standard conform), and hopefully, is there an elegant solution? At the moment, my only solution would be a conditional comment with a chrome.css where I add the padding to the width manually ... shiver... (btw: anyone who feels tempted to tell that px widths are not proper webdeveloping... feel free to leave this page silently) ADDITION: ( in respect to the replys ) first of all thank you for your immediate replys... i was trying to make it as short as possible, and there for i reduced the facts to the minimum... but, as you mentioned, there are a lots of varibales in webdeveloping and so i try to clarify... div { width:300px; } table { table-layout:fixed; width:100%; height:50px; } td.col1 { width:20px; background-color:blue; } td.col2 { width:40px; background-color:red; } td.col3 { width:60px; background-color:yellow; } td.col3 { width:auto; background-color:yellow; } td { padding:5px; } now if you toggle the css line td { padding:5px; } in different browsers, you'll see that chrome includes the padding, within the width, while the others add it hope thats helps to clarify and thanks in advance berny
