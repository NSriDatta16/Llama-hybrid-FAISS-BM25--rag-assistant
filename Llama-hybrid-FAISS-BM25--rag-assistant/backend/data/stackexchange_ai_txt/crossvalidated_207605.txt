Cox Proportional Hazard model is not really appropriate for churn modeling because the hazards are almost never proportional to each other in practice (they cross each other over time.) You should consider using Discrete-time Flexible Hazard model using logistic regression. Check out the summary of this method in the following paper: http://www.lexjansen.com/nesug/nesug05/pos/pos6.pdf There are more references mentioned in the link above, which should be helpful for further background information. SAS used to offer a course on this topic (with instructor Will Potts) -- not sure if it's still offered. You can check it out if you're interested.
