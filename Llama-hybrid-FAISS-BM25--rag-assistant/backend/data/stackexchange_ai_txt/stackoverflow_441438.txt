Which algorithm should I use for signal (sound) one class classification?

Update I summarized the question and its answers here My objective is to detect the presence of a given pattern in a noisy signal. I want to detect the presence of a species of insect recording the sounds with a microphone. I have previously recorded the sound of the insect in a digital format. I am not trying to do voice recognition. I am already using convolution between the input signal and the pattern to determine their similarity level. But I think that this technique is more suited to discrete time (i.e. digital communications, where signals occurs at fixed intervals) and to distinguish an input signal between 2 given patterns (I have only one pattern). I am afraid to use neural networks, because I never used them, and I don't know if I could embed that code. Could you please point me some other approaches, or try to convince me that my current approach still is a good idea or that neural networks may be a feasible way? Update I already have 2 good answers, but another one would be welcome, and even rewarded.
