Can an ADF-test distinguish between stationarity and trend stationarity?

I am learning Time series analysis and I am studying the augmented Dickey Fuller test. My understanding of the null hypotheses is clashing with all the explanations I find online and in books. I refer to the notation of the picture attached. For a series I am working on all $\tau$ - and $\phi$ -nulls are rejected, for all three options "none", "drift" and "trend" in R. Many places online I see if $\phi_2$ is rejected they conclude "trend stationarity" even tho $\tau_{\tau}$ also rejects. But if $ \gamma \neq 0$ as tested in all the $\tau$ -Nulls, my thought is that all the other hypotheses will be rejected as well. My understanding of the Null $\phi_2$ is that $a_0=0$ AND $a_2=0$ AND $\gamma=0$ . And if just 1 of them is different from 0 the Null hypothesis is rejected. Hence if $\tau_1$ is rejected all the other Nulls will also be rejected. So I can't see how I can conclude anything more than "No unit root" if the $\tau$ is rejected. The only case where I see I can conlude a trend is if a unit root is present AND a time trend present. Because then all $\tau$ would fail to reject, but $\phi_2$ would reject. What do I miss here? So the main questions: How do I conclude trend stationarity if there is no unit root? How do the results of the 3 different ADF-tests relate to each other?
