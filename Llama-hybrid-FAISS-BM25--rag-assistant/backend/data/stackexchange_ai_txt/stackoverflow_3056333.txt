per build configuration files on iPhone?

I'm looking for the best way to store per-Build configuration information for an iPhone app. In my iPhone app there are several url's and storage location settings that are specific to a particular build (DEBUG RELEASE etc) Currently i have three recipients for my app, QA/Test, myself and the customer, each has specific settings for the url's and storage locations mentioned above. whats the best way to do this? NOTE: they don't necessarily have to be defined in the build but what im looking for is advice on the best way to store alternate configuration settings. ALSO NOTE: i do not want these settings to be editable through the settings app thanks
