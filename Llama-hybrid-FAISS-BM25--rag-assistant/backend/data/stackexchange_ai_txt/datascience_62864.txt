How to get an intution for generating Keras CNN layers for a model

I am going through tutorial for handwritten text recognition. And to do hand written digit recognition the author has constructed a Keras model as follows: # # Creating CNN model input_shape = (28,28,1) number_of_classes = 10 model = Sequential() model.add(Conv2D(32, kernel_size=(3, 3),activation='relu',input_shape=input_shape)) model.add(Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu')) model.add(MaxPool2D(pool_size=(2, 2))) model.add(Dropout(0.25)) model.add(Flatten()) model.add(Dense(128, activation='relu')) model.add(Dropout(0.5)) model.add(Dense(number_of_classes, activation='softmax')) model.compile(loss=keras.losses.categorical_crossentropy, optimizer=keras.optimizers.Adadelta(),metrics=['accuracy']) model.summary() history = model.fit(X_train, y_train,epochs=5, shuffle=True, batch_size = 200,validation_data= (X_test, y_test)) model.save('digit_classifier2.h5') Source ( here ) I am very confused that on how has the author choose these layers. I know how Conv2D works by applying filters to an image, I know what is activation function . In short I have a rough understanding of what each term means. What I am finding it difficult is how do I know what is happening in each step of this code? For example lets take this python code: values_List=[11,34,43] for index, num in enumerate(values_List): print(index,num) I know that line 1 initializes a list named values_List Line 2 iterates through this list Line 3 prints output as (index of a number , number) This python code is easy to understand and debug. But I am confused that if there is any error inside the keras layers. How do I proceed to debug this Keras code ?
