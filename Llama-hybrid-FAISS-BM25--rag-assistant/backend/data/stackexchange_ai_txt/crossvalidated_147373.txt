It turned out that the problem was a normalization problem. In fact, I trained the Neural Network on a reference signal that was preprocessed and an output signal obtained with an unnormalized signal. This causes problems in case of nonlinear systems. Now I generate training outputs using a normalized inputs and everything works fine. If anyone need more details, feel free to contact me regards Andrea
