You can use a combination of three (or four) approaches, depending on how obfuscated the schema is: dynamic methods observation : enable tracing in the RDBMS (or ODBC layer), then perform various activities in the application (ideally record creation), then identify which tables were altered in tight sequence, and with what column-value pairs values occurring in more than one column during the sequence interval may indicate a foreign key relationship static methods (just analyzing existing data, no need to have a running application) nomenclature : try to infer relationships from column names statistical : look at minimum/maximum (and possibly the average) of unique values in all numerical columns, and attempt to perform a match code reverse engineering : your last resort (unless dealing with scripts) - not for the faint of heart :)
