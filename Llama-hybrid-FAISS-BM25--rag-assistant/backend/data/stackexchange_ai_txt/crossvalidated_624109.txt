Converting a continuous metric to a proportion for increased power

I run online A/B tests and I guess I have some basic stats background, but I've encountered a situation where I don't feel confident about. We plan to track page load time in each experiment to make sure that our alternative variant doesn't cause a significant drop in the page load time. However, since this metric is a continuous variable with a big variability, in our setting it may be greatly underpowered since we calculate the required sample size based on the main metric which is conversion rate. I assumed that we may convert the continuous metric to a proportion: if the page load time is lower that the industry acceptable threshold of 3 second - we consider it a success if the page load time is higher than 3 seconds we consider it a failure. My reasoning is we should get more power and a greater chance to detect the change in the page load time since and we are not particularly interested in by how much the page speed increases or decreases - we are only interested in whether it changes or not. Of course the most obvious caveat is we can have a situation where the average page load time increases but the proportion of relatively fast page loads (under 3 seconds) remains the same, but I am actually not sure this is possible. Is this a valid statistical approach or should I take a different route?
