Generating dependent strictly stationary random processes

for some nonlinear prediction experiments I'd like to generate a nonlinearily dependented, strictly stationary process. Does anyone know a resource explaining how to do this? One idea would be to define joint probabilities distributions f(x1, ..., xn) from which I sample data at every time step and to adjust the probabilities to my liking. If markov chains are strictly stationary then I could also define transition probabilities P(a|b, c, ...) and create these processes that way. Any idea? edit (adding my comment): By "nonlinearly dependent" I mean that the optimal predictor (in the mean square sense) of a process {x_n} given solely past observations/using solely random variables x_k with k
