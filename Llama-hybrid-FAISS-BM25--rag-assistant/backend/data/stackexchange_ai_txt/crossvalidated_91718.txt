So to begin a 95% confidence interval is basically saying that I am 95% sure that given mean of a probability is within these limits [a, b]. This is incorrect. Specifically you are committing the Fallacy of the transposed conditional . 95% of confidence intervals calculated will include the true mean (if assumptions are correct, etc), but the probability the interval contains the true mean is not 95%. The two are related by Bayes' Rule shown in the picture below, where P(A|B) is the probability the hypothesis is true given the data and P(B|A) is the probability of getting the data observed given the hypothesis is true. P(A) is the probability the hypothesis is true regardless of the data and P(B) is the probability of getting the data whether or not the hypothesis is true. The confidence interval is calculating P(B|A). A is the hypothesis that the true mean comes from the distribution with observed mean +/- sd/sqrt(n) and B is each other value. It is the same as saying your null hypothesis is that the true mean equals your observed mean and asking at which observed means would you "reject" this null hypothesis. The answer is for values outside mean +/- 1.96*sd/sqrt(n). The problem is that we don't know how probable it is that A is true from this information, you need previous data, theory, or expert opinion to guess that. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem This recent paper Robust misinterpretation of confidence intervals may be helpful. Perhaps someone else could explain it clearer than I. EDIT: Also, the code you were given is detecting discontinuities by looking at the difference between each adjacent value. It then calculates the average difference and sd of the differences. From this we would then say it is likely that differences much larger than usual ( greater than +/- 1.96*sd/sqrt(n) from the average) represent discontinuities. However, as described above, you need prior/other information on what distance between values represent a discontinuity to know if you are properly choosing them.
