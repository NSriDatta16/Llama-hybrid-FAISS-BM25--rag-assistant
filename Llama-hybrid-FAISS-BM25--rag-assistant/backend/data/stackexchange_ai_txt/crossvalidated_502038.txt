Existence of limit distribution

I know that in a Markov chain if it is aperiodic and irreducible, the stationary distribution coincides with the limit distribution. But is there anything that guarantees me the existence of the limit distribution? And when the chain is not irreducible, can it still present a stationary distribution? Like for example the chain below. Any reading tips? Thankful!
