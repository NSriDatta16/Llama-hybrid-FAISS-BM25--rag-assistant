Issues with nesting elements in

So the quick background is that I have a page listing a set of results and for each I display a thumbnail (image tag), short description (paragraph tag) and title (header tag). The result item links to it's brochure. I want each result (about 100px in height and full width) to be a single link rather than have the image and title being seperate links. This is for both design reasons and SEO (to have 1 link rather than two for a given result with help control internal linking and the number of links on the given page etc.) The issue is that html4 and xhtml don't allow nesting of headers or paragraphs in links. I have managed this before by using spans for the header and p but this time I need the header in the result item. What I'd like to know is if anyone has a way around this and if not what are the issues with not meeting the standards in this scenario? Thanks Denis Edit: Aplogies if this wasn't clear, hopefully it is now.
