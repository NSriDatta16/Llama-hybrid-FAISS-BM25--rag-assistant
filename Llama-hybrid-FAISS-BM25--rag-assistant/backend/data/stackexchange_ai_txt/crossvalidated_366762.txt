Does high training accuracy for an NN mean that it has a potential to reach high validation accuracy?

I saw quite a few discussions related to the problem of high training accuracy with low validation accuracy and what steps to take to address it. I have the same problem with a binary classification case. However, I just want to know if the fact that the neural network reaches high training accuracy (25-30% higher than the validation set) means that it has the potential to be improved for the validation set too? Is there a possibility that the training accuracy would remain high in any case but I have nothing to do to improve the validation accuracy?
