We prototypically think of logistic regression as having a response that is distributed as a Bernoulli (every study unit has a single $0$ or $1$). But logistic regression is more general than that: it can handle binomial response data where the number of trials is $>1$. If your four trials don't differ in any meaningful way, you can think of each person as having a single response consisting of the number of times they selected OUT (from $[0, 4]$ times). Statistical software can handle this, but typically needs to be informed that that is the setup of your data. For example, in R your response would be: cbind(number_of_times_OUT_is_chosen, number_of_times_IN_is_chosen)
