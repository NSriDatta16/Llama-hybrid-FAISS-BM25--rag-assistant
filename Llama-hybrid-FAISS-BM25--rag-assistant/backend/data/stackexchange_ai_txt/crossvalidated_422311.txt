For correlations between continuous and categorical variables see Correlations between continuous and categorical (nominal) variables and Correlations with unordered categorical variables . But your main question seems to be about classification into two classes, since the target is binary. It is in most cases better to see this as a risk estimation problem, and that can be modeled via logistic regression , see Choosing between logistic and discriminant , Why isn't Logistic Regression called Logistic Classification? , When is logistic regression suitable? And finally, you want to eliminate features. Doing that by bivariate correlation/association is seldom a good idea. See How to reduce predictors the right way for a logistic regression model .
