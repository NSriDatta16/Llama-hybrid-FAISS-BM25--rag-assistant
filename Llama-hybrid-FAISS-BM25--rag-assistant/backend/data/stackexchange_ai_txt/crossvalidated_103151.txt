Markov Chain exercise in an exam

Suppose that $X_1, X_2, X_3... $ is a Markov chain with the following transition matrix: State: | 1 2 3 --+----------- 1 |0.2 0.4 0.4 2 |0.5 0.0 0.5 3 |0.6 0.3 0.1 (forgive my attempt at a table if you can) Calculate expectation and variance of $ S_n = X_1 + X_2 + X_3 + X_4 ... + X_n $ This seems like a random walk to me where I do not know the distribution of the random variable that will follow. I can't use the linearity of the expected value if I don't know what probability distribution $ X_i $ will take on, this is the only way I know to find an expected value of a random walk so I am stumped.
