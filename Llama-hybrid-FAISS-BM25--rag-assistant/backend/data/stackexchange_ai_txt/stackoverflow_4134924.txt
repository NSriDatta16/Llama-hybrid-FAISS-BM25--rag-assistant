First have your developers load client tools of all three versions on their machines. You have to start from 2000 and work out to work correctly. Then have them work in Query Analyzer for projects supporting 2000 and in SSMS for projects supporting 2005 or 2008. Insist that they always work only against the lowest version of the database the client will be using. Most things that work in 2000 will work in 2008 (not so true of the next version, so customers on 2000 should strongly be encouraged to upgrade.) Have them do all work in scripts (even database changes and inserts to lookup type tables) and check the scripts into source control just like any other code. If you have testers, make sure they are connected to the correct version of the database and that they do tests against that and not some higher version. I also would have a cheat sheet made up for your developers concerning what T-SQL code will work on which version. Best way to do this is to look in Books Online for 2005 and 2008 to see what new features were added. But it is critical that they only work in the database the particular project will support or you will have to rewrite large swaths of code when it goes to prod. Newer devs don't know 2000 and are used to using things like CTEs that are not supported. It is best they find out immediately when they write the code that it won't work not in test or worse on prod.
