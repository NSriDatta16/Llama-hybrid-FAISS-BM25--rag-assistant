Standardized (to unit variance) principal components after an orthogonal rotation, such as varimax, are simply rotated standardized principal components (by "principal component" I mean PC scores). In linear regression, scaling of individual predictors has no effect and replacing predictors by their linear combinations (e.g. via a rotation) has no effect either. This means that using any of the following in a regression: "raw" principal components (projections on the cov. matrix eigenvectors), standardized principal components, rotated [standardized] principal components, arbitrarily scaled rotated [standardized] principal components, would lead to exactly the same regression model with identical $R^2$, predictive power, etc. (Individual regression coefficients will of course depend on the normalization and rotation choice.) The total variance captured by the raw and by the rotated PCs is the same. This answers your main question. However, you should be careful with your workflows, as it is very easy to get confused and mess up the calculations. The simplest way to obtain standardized rotated PC scores is to use psych::principal function: psych::principal(data, rotate="varimax", nfactors=k, scores=TRUE) Your workflow #2 can be more tricky than you think, because loadings after varimax rotation are not orthogonal, so to obtain the scores you cannot simply project the data onto the rotated loadings. See my answer here for details: How to compute varimax-rotated principal components in R? Your workflow #3 is probably also wrong, at least if you refer to the psych::fa function. It does not do PCA; the fm="pa" extraction method refers to "principal factor" method which is based on PCA, but is not identical to PCA (it is an iterative method). As I wrote above, you need psych::principal to perform PCA. See my answer in the following thread for a detailed account on PCA and varimax: Is PCA followed by a rotation (such as varimax) still PCA?
