Logistic regression algorithm in Ruby

I have been using R to calculate logistic regression with many independent variables for a Ruby on Rails web application. However, I can no longer import data from the database to R using RPostgreSQL. The web host has stopped allowing insecure connections to the database. The point is, I either need to get a new web host, or write my own logistic regression algorithm in Ruby. Ruby probably isn't the best programming language for that kind of thing, but I don't really have a choice. Is there an easy to implement algorithm for multiple logistic regression?
