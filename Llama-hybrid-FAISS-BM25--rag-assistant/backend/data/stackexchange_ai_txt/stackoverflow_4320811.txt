I'm not sure what this would actually do, but in the server's POM you are listing core as a dependency and then also excluding it: at.ac.inso.tuwien.verteiltepraxen core 1.0-SNAPSHOT jar compile core at.ac.inso.tuwien.verteiltepraxen Why would you do this? Exclusions are used to tell Maven to ignore some dependencies dragged in by other dependencies in your build.Try removing the exclusion.
