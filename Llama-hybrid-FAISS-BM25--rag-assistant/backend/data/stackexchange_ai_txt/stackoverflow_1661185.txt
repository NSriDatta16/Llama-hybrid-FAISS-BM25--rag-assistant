What is an elegant way to make two fields auto increment?

In SQL Server, I have two fields, one is primary and has an identity (AN_ID) then I have another one that for legacy reasons (don't ask) has to be updated reflecting the AN_ID. Currently they have the exact same value. I was wondering if there are pure T-SQL query (no stored procedures) to make it auto incremente. Thank you very much Edit: I'm forced to SQL Server 2000
