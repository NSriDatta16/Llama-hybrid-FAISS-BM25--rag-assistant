There's no way to a Random Forest to extrapolate like an OLS do. The reason is simple: the predictions from a Random Forest are done through averaging the results obtained in several trees. The trees themselves output the mean value of the samples in each terminal node, the leaves. It's impossible for the result to be outside the range of the training data, because the average is always inside the range of its constituents. In other words, it's impossible for an average to be bigger (or lower) than every sample, and Random Forests regressions are based on averaging.
