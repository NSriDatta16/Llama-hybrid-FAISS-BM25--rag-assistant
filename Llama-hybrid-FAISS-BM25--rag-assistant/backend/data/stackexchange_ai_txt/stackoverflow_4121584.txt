You can read-in the words as Lisp symbols, with just a few lines of code: (defun read-words (file-name) (with-open-file (stream file-name) (loop while (peek-char nil stream nil nil) collect (read stream)))) Example input file - words.txt: attack attempt attention attraction authority automatic awake bright broken brother brown brush bucket building comfort committee common company comparison competition Reading the file: > (read-words "words.txt") => (ATTACK ATTEMPT ATTENTION ATTRACTION AUTHORITY AUTOMATIC AWAKE BRIGHT BROKEN BROTHER BROWN BRUSH BUCKET BUILDING COMFORT COMMITTEE COMMON COMPANY COMPARISON COMPETITION) The case could be preserved by enclosing the symbols in pipes (|) or declaring them as strings: |attack| "attempt" ... Reading without losing case: > (read-words "words.txt") => (|attack| "attempt" ...)
