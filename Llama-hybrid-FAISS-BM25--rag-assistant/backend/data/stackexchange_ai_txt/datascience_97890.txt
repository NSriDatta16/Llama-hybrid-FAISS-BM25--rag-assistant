Some solutions are better worked out when we understand the underlying layer behind it. In the field of NLP which utilizes Recurrent Neural Networks, ideally allows varying input sizes. Even in Convolutional Neural Networks which is commonly used for images allows varying input sizes. Research discussion on dealing with varying inputs You have two choices to either downsize your input samples to a fixed size or to up sample your input samples so both the input samples match. For up sizing, you can pad the sequences with zeros to ensure both the inputs have fixed size. Data cardinality issue resolved by using pad_sequences For CNN models where the neural network graph for multiple inputs is as shown below: ( source ) Code sample for multiple inputs example for CNN as mentioned Do take a look at the below links for better understanding and make your call on best approach to solving your problem.
