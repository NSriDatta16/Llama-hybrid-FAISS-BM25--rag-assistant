Simple enhancement: you may want to use line.find_first_not_of(" ") to get the first non-whitespace and then check if that is a '#'. That would also cover to the zero length case. Something like this fragment: found= line.find_first_not_of(" \t"); if( found != string::npos) { if( line[found] == '#') continue; } More info
