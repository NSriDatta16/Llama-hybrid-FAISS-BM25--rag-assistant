You need to use fiddler and firebug to figure out what is being sent when you login using your browser. You then run your curl request through fiddler and make sure the exact same thing is posted. You might need to set a refer, user-agent or cookies. You have too look at the request to tell what you need to send. Web developer is a useful tool to disable cookies and javascript. See if you can login without cookies or javascript. Use firebug will let you know if there are any ajax requests going on behind the scenes. Blindly posting using curl will drive you insane.
