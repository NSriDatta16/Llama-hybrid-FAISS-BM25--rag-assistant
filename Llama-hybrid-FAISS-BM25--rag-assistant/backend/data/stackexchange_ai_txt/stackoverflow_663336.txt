Extending Eclipse's JavaEditor (to act like Vim/change KeyListener)

Introduction a.k.a. what do I intend to do feel free to skip this part, no real information is comprised in here Because of the lack of a good, free (as in speech) vim -Mode for the otherwise excellent JavaEditor in Eclipse(3.4), I'm thinking about writing one. The available solutions are: ViPlugin : commercial and not good (e.g. no vim text-objects , such as daW ) VimPlugin : new editor, not the power of the built in JavaEditor see SO: Painless integration of Eclipse with Vim? : nothing really good turned up (However feel free to mention other solutions than the ones above which could help me.) In my opinion, it's the wrong way of writing a completely new editor based on TextEditor , because you will then loose the cool features the standard JavaEditor gives you for free (such as 'organize imports', 'refactor menu', ...). I'm thinking of a 'skin' to the normal JavaEditor which behaves like vim , everything else should be unchanged. Now the questions How can I detect if a IWorkbenchPart given by IPartListener.partActivated() is the JavaEditor? How can I then replace JavaEditor's KeyListener ; something like the ITextViewerExtension.prependVerifyKeyListener is needed? Is this a good way to go on?
