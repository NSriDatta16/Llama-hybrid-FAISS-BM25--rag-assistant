I found this SciPy.org page helpful, even though it works better for the other direction and doesn't directly address many core language features. Along the same lines: The "Comparison with MATLAB" section of this Numerical Computing in Python presentation NumPy for MATLAB Users cheat sheet But none of these really explain the MATLAB language and data structures to me like a good book about the language, in a way that leverages my existing knowledge of Python . (The question Jonas links to does though - check that out.)
