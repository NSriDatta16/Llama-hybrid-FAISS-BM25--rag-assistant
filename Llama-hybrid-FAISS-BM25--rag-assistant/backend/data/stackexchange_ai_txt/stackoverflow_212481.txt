How do I get output to show up in the Messages pane of the Error List for Visual Studio 2005?

I have a header file like this: #ifndef __GEN_NOTE_MARKERS_TO_DEVELOPERS_HPP__ #define __GEN_NOTE_MARKERS_TO_DEVELOPERS_HPP__ #ifdef _DEBUG // macros for turning a number into a string #define STRING2(x) #x #define STRING(x) STRING2(x) #ifdef TRIAGE_MESG_AS_WARNING #define TRIAGE_TODO_TAG(description) __pragma(message(__FILE__"("STRING(__LINE__)") : warning : TRIAGE TO-DO: " STRING(description) )) #define TRIAGE_FIXTHIS_TAG(description) __pragma(message(__FILE__"("STRING(__LINE__)") : warning : TRIAGE FIXTHIS: " STRING(description) )) #else #define TRIAGE_TODO_TAG(description) __pragma(message(__FILE__"("STRING(__LINE__)") : message : TRIAGE TO-DO: " STRING(description) )) #define TRIAGE_FIXTHIS_TAG(description) __pragma(message(__FILE__"("STRING(__LINE__)") : message : TRIAGE FIXTHIS: " STRING(description) )) #endif #else #define TRIAGE_TODO_TAG(description) #define TRIAGE_FIXTHIS_TAG(description) #endif #endif // __GEN_NOTE_MARKERS_TO_DEVELOPERS_HPP__ Which outputs notes to the output pane in Visual Studio 2005. When 'TRIAGE_MESG_AS_WARNING' is defined, Visual Studio will harvest these messages and list them as warnings in the Error List. It does this because the text format matches a warning. However, I don't want them to show up as warnings all the time, I would rather they show up in the Messages pane of the Error List. How do you format lines you put in the "Output Window" so that Visual Studio will auto-magically show them in the "Messages" tab of the "Error List" window? The format I have setup for messages in the above code looks like a message from other output, but does not get harvested in the same way. A co-worker suggested to me that I might need to write a 'custom automation object' to write to the Messages pane. That seems like a pain, especially since it is trivial to end-up with entries in the Error pane and Warning pane simply by proper formating. Is this a possible avenue? We're using unmanaged C++, so we can't rely on managed (.NET) only tooling. We do not want to extend VS with hooks.
