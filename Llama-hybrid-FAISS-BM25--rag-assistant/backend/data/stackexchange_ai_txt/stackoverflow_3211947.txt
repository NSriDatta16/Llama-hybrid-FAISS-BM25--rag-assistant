I worry about it - but only a little. Although storage space is incredibly cheap nowadays, ansd cheap enough today to buy a duplicate storage device to backup onto, there are costs due to "bloat". As the amount of stuff increases, you have to load more of it into memory - using up RAM, but also taking more and more time to read it off the disk and pass it over the memory bus. And, as the RAM gets used, parts of the data read from disk is swapped out, meaning even more time writing, and then even more time reading when you want it back! Its a vicious circle of slowness, disk grinding and finger-tapping as you try to use your computer. (just look to examples like Outlook or Visual Studio with a few plugins like Resharper to see what I mean). So, although its not a big deal individually, the idea that "disk space / RAM is cheap so use as much as you like" is not good, you should worry about the bloat in your apps, and try to make your apps more efficient and therefore more responsive. Of course, this applies double for laptops. triple for netbooks, and quintuple for mobiles. Perhaps we should worry about disk space after all!
