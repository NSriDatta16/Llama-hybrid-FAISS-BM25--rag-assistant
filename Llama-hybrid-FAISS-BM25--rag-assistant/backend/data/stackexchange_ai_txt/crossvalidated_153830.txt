Observations get in a line in a PCA score plot. Something wrong with the data?

I ran a clustering and in the resultant PCA score plot some observations getting in a line drew my attention (I marked them with a red line) . How come they distribute like that? I doubt there is something wrong with the data. What can I do with the data?
