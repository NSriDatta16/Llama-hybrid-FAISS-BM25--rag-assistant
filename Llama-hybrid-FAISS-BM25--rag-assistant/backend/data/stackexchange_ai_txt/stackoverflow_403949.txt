If your code is going to work together all the time anyway, and isn't useful separately, there's nothing wrong with keeping everything in one file. I can think of at least popular package (BeautifulSoup) that does this. Sure makes installation easier. Of course, if it seems, down the road, that you could use part of your code with another project, or if maintainance starts to be an issue, then worry about organizing your project differently. It seems to me from the questions you've been asking lately that you're worrying about all of this a bit prematurely. Often, for me, these sorts of issues are better tackled a little later on in the solution. Especially for smaller projects, my goal is to get a solution that is correct, and then optimal.
