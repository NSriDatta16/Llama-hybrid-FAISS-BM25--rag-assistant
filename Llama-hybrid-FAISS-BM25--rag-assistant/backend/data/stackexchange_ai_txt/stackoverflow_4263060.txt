Organic Groups "Context"

Im using OG and Views. Currently my views have to have a page display to show an event list for each group. So this means that every time a create a group I will have to create another page display in my view for another event list. So Im wondering if I can just have 1 view with 1 page display that will show a specific event list for a specific group that would be determined through URL. I beleive this is possible using "arguments" in views but I have no idea how this works.
