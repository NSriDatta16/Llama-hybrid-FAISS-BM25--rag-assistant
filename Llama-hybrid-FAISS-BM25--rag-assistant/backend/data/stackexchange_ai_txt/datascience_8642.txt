What is the difference between concept learning and classification?

I've recently read about concept learning in a machine learning class. They defined a concept as (translated from German): Concept: Describes a subset of objects or events defined on a bigger set. Boolean function defined on bigger set Given: Examples which are labeled as members or not-members Searched: Automatically infer the definition of the underlying concept Definition of concept learning: Infering a boolean-valued function from training data of its input and its output. I would call this a 2-class classification problem. Is there a difference?
