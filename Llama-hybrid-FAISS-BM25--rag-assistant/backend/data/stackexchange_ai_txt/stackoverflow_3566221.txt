Best practices for a PDO class?

I want to create a PDO class for handling data base connections. Here is what I have: require('php/packages/store/store_db_settings.php'); class store_pdo { private $DBH; // Data Base Handler function __construct() { $DBH = new PDO(DB_DSN,DB_USER,DB_PASSWORD); } public function getHandler() { return $DBH; } } I think this seems ok, however I am used to just using things like mysql_query and not really sure what problems I could run into in the future. So I thought the experience here could offer guidance. Is what I have sufficient? should I make my class Singleton, or use static functions? Is there a best practice? I don't want to go with this, then I after have several other classes using it, discover that I should have written it differently. P.S. I just noticed that the best-practices tag is no longer allowed... does that mean questions like this are discouraged now too?
