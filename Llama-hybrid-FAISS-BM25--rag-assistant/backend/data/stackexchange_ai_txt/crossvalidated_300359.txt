You could use decision trees, they have some desirable properties for your application: they will automatically search among your many variables and select the ones that best predict the outcome they are very easy to interpret. Basically they tell you that for each record you look first at a specific variable and compare the value to a cutoff. Based on the result of that comparison, you go on the corresponding branch of the tree to the next branching based on some other variable etc. When you arrive in a leaf, the majority class among the training records in that leaf will tell you how to classify your new record. they can natively deal with classification into more than two classes. Some algorithms like support vector machines would need workarounds to be able to predict your three possible outcomes. Random forests would usually have better classification performance than a single tree, but they are more difficult to interpret.
