Detecting biasing columns and removing bias in machine learning

I came across a multivariate machine learning problem in which I need to detect the biasing column and remove the bias of that particular column in predicting final target variable. train data-> [x1,x2,..xn,BiasColumn,y] (BiasColumn does not contain all the X columns. Its only a fixed subset of X). What should be the standard way to approach this problem?
