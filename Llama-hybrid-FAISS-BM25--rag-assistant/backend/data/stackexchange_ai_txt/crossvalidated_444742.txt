Very bad spatial R² after detrending but good spatial RMSE

I am very new to data science and I have this problem that I just can't explain. The data I am using is 3-d time series data. I split the time series by years and predict the last four with a multiple linear regression. When computing the spatial R² and spatial RMSE for each year they behave as expected. But when I am doing the same for the detrended data, my R² becomes horrible, even though the RMSE stays similar. Please help. The functions I am using are these: (Using scipy) rmse = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_obs_detrended, y_pred_detrended)) corr, _ = pearsonr(y_obs_detrended, y_pred_detrended) r2 = corr**2
