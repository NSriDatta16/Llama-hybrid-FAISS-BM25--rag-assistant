It sounds like the slow part of the search is the full-text searching, not the result retrieval. How about caching the resulting resource record IDs? Also, since it might be true that search queries are often duplicated, store a hash of the search query, the query, and the matching resources. Then you can retrieve the next page of results by ID. Works with AJAX too. Since it's an intranet and you may control the searched resources, you could even pre-compute a new or updated resource's match to popular queries during idle time.
