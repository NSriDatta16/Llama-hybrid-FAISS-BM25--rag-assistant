You might use a paired t test on the 120 pairs of monthly returns for your series minus the benchmark monthly returns. For example, if your 120 monthly returns are in the vector x and the corresponding returns are in the vector b , then a paired t.test gives the following results. set.seed(828) # for reproducibility u = rnorm(120, 10, 2); e =rnorm(120, .05, .2) x = u+e; b = u t.test(x, b, paired=T) Paired t-test data: x and b t = 2.5802, df = 119, p-value = 0.01109 alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 95 percent confidence interval: 0.01144941 0.08700116 sample estimates: mean of the differences 0.04922529 Notice that I simulated the data so that your month-to-month series is a little higher than the benchmark on average (no compounding). However, if you multiply both x and b by 12 to annualize them (obtaining series X and B , respectively), then the P-value of the test is the same. Means, standard deviations, standard errors, and ends of the CI all just get multiplied by 12. So it makes no difference which method you use. Paired t-test data: X and B t = 2.5802, df = 119, p-value = 0.01109 alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 95 percent confidence interval: 0.1373929 1.0440140 sample estimates: mean of the differences 0.5907034
