Goodman Gamma for nominal variables

I need to give a direction to the association between an ordinal (independent) and a nominal variable (dependent). This, after having performed a Chi-square test. The ordinal variable is like a blood test score with values (high, low, average) and the nominal variable is yes/no (reflecting the possibility of being sick). Is it OK to use the Goodman gamma to do this? If not because one variable is nominal, which is a good alternative?
