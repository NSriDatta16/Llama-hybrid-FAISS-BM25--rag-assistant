Like @jalf, I sometimes find myself writing int main(int argc, char** argv) { std::vector args(argv, argv+argc); But yes, like everyone said, main has to be C-compatible. I see it as an interface to the OS runtime, which is (at least int the systems I use) is written in C. Although some development environment encourage replacements such as wmain or _tmain . You could write your own compiler/IDE, which would encourage the use of int vmain(const std::vector & args) .
