I see no problem in using NHibernate and webservices together - I just don't think it's a good idea to send the entities themselves over "to the other side". A better approach is to use a set of DTOs that are made for the service - then you won't be running into issues like that of serializing unknown types and such. You can use a library like AutoMapper to do the mapping from the entities to the DTOs. There's a lot of stuff written about this, some of it: http://martinfowler.com/bliki/FirstLaw.html http://ayende.com/Blog/archive/2009/05/14/the-stripper-pattern.aspx http://elegantcode.com/2008/04/27/dtos-or-serialized-domain-entities/ DTOs vs Serializing Persisted Entities As a side note for the service it self, you could design wise use an approach like Davy Brion describes here: http://davybrion.com/blog/2009/11/requestresponse-service-layer-series/
