Update view when new record is inserted in a specific table

I'm doing an auctions website (not for any institution, just as part of my learning of php and cakephp). At Home page I have all the items displayed. What I need to do now is to refresh price / last licitation and time remaining in each item when any user makes a licitation. So do you know how can I, in a view, keep watching licitations table for new records and then update those values in the view? Attention: The new record in the database can be inserted by any other user. Thanks.
