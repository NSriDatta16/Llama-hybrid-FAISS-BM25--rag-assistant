Adobe Reader Text Drag&Drop issue

I've discovered issues with the Adobe Reader and the Drag&Drop feature for simple text. When I simply select some text and drop it into some of my .NET applications (or any texteditor like notepad++ or VisualStudio) the text gets random characters attached to it. I tried hard and observed the problem and as far as my observation goes I can say the following: It does not happend twice whith the same text selected for dragging. The attached text is always just a few characters long (at least ten) Sometimes it seems like that the attached characters are the fragments of text dargged and dropped earlier Some other times the attached characters are not alphanumeric characters which makes it hard to recognize The selected text could be anywhere (not just a whole paragraph) I compare the dropped text with other texts in my application and this obviously fails since there are some characters which I did not dragged. On the .NET side of things I use the standard IDataObject interface and tried multiple Formats but the behaviour is always the same. It can be reproduced but it is not predictable because it occurs randomly. So my questions are: Is this a buffer filling issue of Adobe Reader (btw it happends in version 8,9, X with turned off secure mode)? Is this dependend on which third party program created the pdf? Has someone experienced the same behaviour (since I can find nothing on this)? In advance I must say no other pdf-Reader is an option beacause it is a business policy here :). Big thanks in advance for the one who could answer this questions.
