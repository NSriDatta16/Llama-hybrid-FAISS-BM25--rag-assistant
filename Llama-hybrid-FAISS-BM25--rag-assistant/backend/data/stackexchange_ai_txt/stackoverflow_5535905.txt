Regarding the lack of user privileges in Webistrano, you can try the Webistrano Privilege plugin : https://github.com/espace/webistrano_privileges/ "Webistrano privileges, is a Rails plugin for webistrano 1.3 to introduce user access control to projects. It will secure and organize access of users to projects and give them privileges to deploy project which they have access to only."
