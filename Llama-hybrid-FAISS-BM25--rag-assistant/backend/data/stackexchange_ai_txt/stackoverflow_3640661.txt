silverlight resource incompatibility with VS designer?

I have the following defined at the top of my XAML: Then later on I use the AlignmentListViewSource as an ItemSource that I bind to a ComboBox. Everything seems to work correctly except the Designer doesn't like the AlignmentsVM resource. It complains like this: [Xml_CannotFindFileInXapPackage] Arguments: ServiceReferences.ClientConfig Debugging resource strings are unavailable. Often the key and arguments provide sufficient information to diagnose the problem. See [broken hyperlink] at System.Xml.XmlXapResolver.GetEntity(Uri absoluteUri, String role, Type ofObjectToReturn) at System.Xml.XmlReaderSettings.CreateReader(String inputUri, XmlParserContext inputContext) at System.Xml.XmlReader.Create(String inputUri, XmlReaderSettings settings, XmlParserContext inputContext) at System.ServiceModel.Configuration.ServiceModelSectionGroup.GetSectionGroup() I verified that the ServiceReferences.ClientConfig file IS part of the SilverlightUI project and is marked as "Content". The AlignmentsViewModel calls a webservice in it's constructor, but I'm pretty sure this is a problem with the VS designer, not the class. I can compile and run the project and it runs exactly like I want it to from cassini, populating the combo box. it's just the VS designer that isn't cooperating. Can anyone advise me as to how I can get the designer to recognize the fact that ServiceReferences.ClientConfig IS available?
