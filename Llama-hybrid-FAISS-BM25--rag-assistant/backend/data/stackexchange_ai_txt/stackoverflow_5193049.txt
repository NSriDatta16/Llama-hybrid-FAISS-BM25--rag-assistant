How to create font preview image from font file on Linux?

I am wondering if there is any easy / possible way to create a "font preview image" file for a given font file on the Linux command line. You know, like when you click on a font file in Linux or Windows file explorer and you get a little font preview window with "The quick brown fox jumps overs the lazy dog" in different sizes etc. The input font file would be .PFB (Adobe type 1 font) or .TTF (TrueType font). So, for example: createfontpreviewimage somefont.pfb [which creates somefontpreview.png or whatever] Any thoughts? Or will I have to go down the hard work route of embedding the font file in a PDF document and generating the preview as a PDF document with PDFLib or some such?
