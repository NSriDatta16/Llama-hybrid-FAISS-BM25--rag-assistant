There is no hard limit for the number of categories in multinomial logistic regression, but the number of parameters will grow very fast, so you will need a lot of data with many categories. Also, the interpretation of results will be difficult with many categories. This question is very broad, you are probably better off asking a more focused question about your real problem!
