Ives' answer is nice. There is one gotcha you really want to consider with emailing an html page. Html emails and Html pages are two totally different school. Html emails take you back 10 years (hello tables!) in what you can do to support as many email clients as possible. It's very likely a straight email-a-webpage thing will look total crap on the recipient email.. and then you've got to consider embedding stylesheets, etc..
