Should I train the model on the whole dataset in recommender systems?

After reading some tutorials and articles about recommender systems, I can't really figure out whether I should split the dataset into train/test sets or use the whole dataset to allow the model to memorize every users/items interactions during the training. If I consider I can retrain the model everyday, would it make sense to let the model overfit data on the whole dataset since the model will only recommend known items for known users (when considering this use-case) ? Moreover, when using embeddings like in two-towers models, can the embedding know how to embed a user with an unseen user id ? Is it sufficient to use user's features to embed an unseen user ? Thanks, Jérémy
