Depends on a lot of things. For example, what format are those numbers in? You could do a HTTP POST to a netcat sitting on the desktop machine: NSURL *url = [NSURL URLWithString:@"http://desktop:3000/"]; NSMutableURLRequest *request = [[NSMutableURLRequest alloc] initWithURL:url]; [request setHTTPMethod:@"POST"]; [request setHTTPBody:…]; NSURLConnection *connection = [[NSURLConnection alloc] initWithRequest:request delegate:self]; NSAssert(connection, @"Failed to create connection."); And on the desktop: $ nc -l 3000 You’ll get something like this: POST / HTTP/1.1 User-Agent: YourApp1.0 CFNetwork/422.15.2 Darwin/9.6.0 (i386) (MacBook4%2C1) Accept-Language: en-us Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Content-Length: xxx Connection: keep-alive Host: 127.0.0.1:3000 //data
