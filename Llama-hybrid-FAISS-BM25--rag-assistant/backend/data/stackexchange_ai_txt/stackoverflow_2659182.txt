If the blob is public you can, of course, just send an HTTP HEAD request -- from any of the zillions of languages/environments/platforms that know how do that -- and check the response. The core Azure APIs are RESTful XML-based HTTP interfaces. The StorageClient library is one of many possible wrappers around them. Here's another that Sriram Krishnan did in Python: http://www.sriramkrishnan.com/blog/2008/11/python-wrapper-for-windows-azure.html It also shows how to authenticate at the HTTP level. I've done a similar thing for myself in C#, because I prefer to see Azure through the lens of HTTP/REST rather than through the lens of the StorageClient library. For quite a while I hadn't even bothered to implement an ExistsBlob method. All my blobs were public, and it was trivial to do HTTP HEAD.
