This is the geometry of (orthogonal) projections and Pythagoras' theorem. Let $J$ be the all 1's $n\times n$ matrix, note that $J^2=nJ$ . Now the centering operation $x_i \to x_i-\bar{x}$ is the operator $\text{Id}-\text{Average}$ which can be represented by the matrix $H=I-n^{-1} J$ . $H$ is a projection matrix called the centering matrix ( $H^T=H, H^2=H$ ). Now $$ \sum (x_i-\bar{x})^2 = \lVert Hx \rVert^2 = x^T H x \quad\text{and}\\ \sum (x_i-\bar{x}) x_i = (Hx)^T x =(Hx)^T (x-Hx+Hx)=0+x^T Hx $$ since by general properties of projections, $(x-Hx) \perp Hx$ so the dot product is zero. So this is simply an expression of the general geometric fact that the dot product of a projected vector by itself equals the dot product of the vector by its projection. Just draw a diagram in the plane, since there is only two vectors $x$ and $Hx$ involved, all the real actions occurs in the plane generated by those two vectors: (Image contributed by @Martijn Weterings)
