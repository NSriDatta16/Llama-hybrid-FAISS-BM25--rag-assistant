Simulating data with local correlations

Im writing my thesis, which a monte-carlo study aimed at generating datasets for comparing the performance of various regression models (Neural networks amongst others). And since neural networks can fit some very complicated distributions, i am simulating breakpoints in the data (currently by different local means, and different distribution families). But my question is then; is it possible to simulate a dataset with two different correlation matrices? (eg. different local relationships with the Y-term) For at timeseries, I assume it would be suitable/ok, but does it make sense for an experimental setup, with no relation to time series? Here's an illustration of the idea: #defining the two correlation matrices for the cholesky transformation: R1 Ideally I would want different relationships around the two local means. Am I breaking some statistical assumptions in this way? Snce the goal is to predict the first column of the dataset, I would be able to validate the performance of the algorithm of choise, which is the overall goal of my thesis.
