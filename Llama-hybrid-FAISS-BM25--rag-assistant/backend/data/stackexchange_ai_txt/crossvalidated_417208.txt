If your goal is prediction/forecasting and you have a continuous outcome, you can try a variety of machine learning-based methods that don't require assumptions about functional form, unlike generalized linear models. For example, random forests will flexibly find a relationship between the covariates and the outcome, from which you can generate predicted values on a new data set. You should use cross-validation to choose the tuning parameters of the random forest model so that the model doesn't overfit. A benefit of these tree-based methods is that they won't create predicted values outside the range of the data, so if your variable is bounded below by zero but unbounded above, the predicted values will remain above zero.
