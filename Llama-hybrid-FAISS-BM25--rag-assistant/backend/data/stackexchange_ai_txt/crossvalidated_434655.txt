As I understand your model, it is an RNN trying to predict a time series of plant heights from time-series of rainfall and of solar exposure. There is no problem in principle with combing different indicators like these, but finding a good way to normalise them is often difficult. Ideally you want the variances of all the series and the variance of the differences of all the series to be similar. Even harder, you would also like the distributions of both values and differences not to contain any outliers. In your example, if you are using daily data then rainfall may well pose problems because most days are zero and if you set variance to 1 the spikes indicating rain will often be large. You might find a boolean indicator for the presence of rain worked better. You might also find that smoothing is a helpful part of normalisation. Plants grow relatively slowly, so applying an EWMA (Exponentially Weighted Moving Average) filter with a time constant of a few days to your data before normalising seems unlikely to be damaging, and it will give the RNN friendlier distributions to work with.
