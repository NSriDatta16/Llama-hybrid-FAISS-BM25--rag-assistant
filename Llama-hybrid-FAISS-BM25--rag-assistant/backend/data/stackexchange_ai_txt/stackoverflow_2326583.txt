Free Postcode and Ordance Survey Information For EVERYONE Wait until April the 1st. The government are releasing all of this information then. I will find a link for you. Read this: http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8402327.stm The government is planning to give anyone free access to postcode data. The move will be made as part of its commitment to make more use of technology and the web to transform official services. Currently organisations that want access to datasets that tie postcodes to physical locations cannot do so without incurring a charge. Following a brief consultation, the postcode information is set to be freed in April 2010.
