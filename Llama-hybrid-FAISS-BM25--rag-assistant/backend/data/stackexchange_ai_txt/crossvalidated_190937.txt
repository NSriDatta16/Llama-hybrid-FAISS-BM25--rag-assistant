Automatic Feature Extraction in Caffe

I am a beginner to frameworks like Caffe, Theano for deep learning. But, I would like to know how do I use Caffe framework for only feature extraction without performing classification. I want the feature vector which is input to the deep neural network for classification. I want to perform automatic feature extraction for several images. The output for this task should be a text file containing : image_name1, feature_vector1 image_name1, feature_vector1 image_name1, feature_vector1 ... Kindly help me with this. Thanks in advance.
