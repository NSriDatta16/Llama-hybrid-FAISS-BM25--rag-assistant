To summarize my comments on the original answer: Stevens (UNIX Network Programming Vol. 1) gives a solution for mapping device name to interface number. This involves querying the OS routing table for the interface number over a raw socket. In the Second Edition this is in section 17.6 and in the Third Edition this is in section 18.6. You can also use the proc filesystem to gather the same information in option one. Of particular interest is the /proc/net/dev_mcast file. This file gives a mapping between interface name and interface number; mapping from IP address to interface name is presumably just as easy. Presumably option 1 is the most robust since the proc filesystem can change how it's organized, what information is available and how it's formatted. I am not personally familiar with how often the Linux Kernel changes these attributes, so, someone with more information about this is welcome to comment or edit this post.
