saving pictures in Core Data in 'to-many relationship' environment

I'm working on my small project which take pictures and save them, very simple, using Core Data. I have two entities; one is 'Person' and the other is 'Image'. the relationship from Person to Image is to-many and from Image to Person I got inverse relationship as well. All I need at the moment is to add multiple number of images (taken from iphone camera or chosen from library) to one Person entity . I'd like to know whether there is any kind of sample code that deals with to-many relationship with UIImage using Core Data. many thanks. ===================== Actually I wish I could specify the problem. What i'm trying to do is using access methods that are given for free in to-many relationship to add object such as - (void)addPersonImageObject:(PersonImage *)value; and also I've implemented methods related to ImageToDataTransformer. I spent almost a week on this matter and I think I need a guiding sample code that I can study first for my add project.
