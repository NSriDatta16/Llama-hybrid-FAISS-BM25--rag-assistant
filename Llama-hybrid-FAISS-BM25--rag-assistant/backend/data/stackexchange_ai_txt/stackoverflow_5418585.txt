Not only is it not standard practice (except, presumably, in your organisation), but the W3C advises against it . Class names should be used to further describe the contents of semantic HTML tags, rather than as reference points for design or development. I would expect well-structure HTML pages to have consistent classes for similar content types which would be perfectly suitable for JavaScript usage. A designer who cannot write HTML correctly, remembering that the HTML markup is supposed to describe the content not style it , should not be writing HTML IMO.
