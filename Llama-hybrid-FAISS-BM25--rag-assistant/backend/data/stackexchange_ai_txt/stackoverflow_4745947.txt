There are some patterns that would help you in splitting User Stories in a way that they would remain INVEST, which means you would try to save dependencies, size, testability and value in particular. You can read more about that here: http://www.richardlawrence.info/2009/10/28/patterns-for-splitting-user-stories/ Richard is actively applying and improving them, and he is not alone ;-) Just be aware that splitting and keeping dependencies (which is like creating a critical path in a Gantt chart) is going to trump the capability of the team to be creative, and to negotiate on those stories, and might also hide a "non-valuable-proposition".
