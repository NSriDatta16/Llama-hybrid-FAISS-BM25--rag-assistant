The hard core physics engines use vectorization of floats, which gives a x16 boost on current hardware if lucky, and way more on specialized hardware. Larrabee for example can handle 1024 simultaneous calculations for a theretocal x1024 boost in math processing (but it needs this because it's also GPU) Haven't looked at the code yet, but are you using math optimizations like fast square root and binary absolutes, or bitwise sign flipping? These things alone don't help, but when your churning large amounts of data, these techniques reroute some math to the main CPU, freeing the FPU, basically giving you a larger throughput. Also GCC's SIMD code generation litteraly sucks, I've seen upto a 16 fold increase by using VC or IntelCompiler, that means, if you've paid attention, that GCC wasn't using any SIMD instructions at all! Also those allegded 10k collisions aren't in such close quarters as you sim, so it's not directly comparable.
