As Rex M mentioned, this is bad practice for multiple reasons. If I found that I needed to reference the parent page from the control, I would pass a reference to the page into the control, instead of having the control reference the parent. I might consider making an interface that all of these pages might implement and pass that into the control. The interface would guarantee the type safety. If you started using this control on a new page that page would need to implement the interface before you could use it with the control. This would help with occasions where you throw the control on a new page and forget that the control has this relationship with the parent (this relationship can be fragile, which is one of the reasons that it is a no no).
