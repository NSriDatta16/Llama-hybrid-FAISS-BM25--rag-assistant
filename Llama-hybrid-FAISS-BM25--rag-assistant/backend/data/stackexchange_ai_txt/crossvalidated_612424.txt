Classifying data contained in a file with Machine Learning

I have a file (corresponding to one and only one person) with n columns (or classes) containing different data: Name (class 1) , address(class 2) , number (class 3), username (class 4), etc (class n). I wish to classify an incoming data as one of these classes. Example : If I get an incoming data to be : "John Smith" ..my ML model should classify it as : "Name". If i get "Ronald Reagan Avenue 3456" : the output should be "address" and so on. I wonder if the naive Bayes model in ML would be suitable for such task? I have been looking at the naive Bayes model that make me skeptical : It assumes independence between features . Would that be a problem in this case?
