The eigenvalues of the centered Gram matrix (centered kernel matrix) are exactly the same as the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix. So whatever method you would want to use with the usual eigenvalues in PCA (e.g. certain proportion of variance explained, or looking for an "elbow" on the "scree plot", etc.), you can use the same method with the kernel eigenvalues.
