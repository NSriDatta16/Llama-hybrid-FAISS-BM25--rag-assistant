I built custom controls that used by three different applications in same machine. When I maintain scripts for controls, I can forget deploying the new script file to every application. In this scenario, it's good to embed resources into assembly and deploy assembly to GAC. But the good point about external files (not embedding resources) is that, sometimes you realize a bug in script files. deploying it without resetting application is a good thing in an online application.
