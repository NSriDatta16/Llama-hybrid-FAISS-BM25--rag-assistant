With Delphi's limitation to 32 bit address space, such problems are becoming more common. The first and simplest thing you can do is to run on a 64 bit OS and move from 2GB available address space (as you get on a 32 bit OS) to 4GB address. This doesn't happen automatically. You need to mark your application as being LARGEADDRESSAWARE. Do this by adding the following to your .dpr file: const IMAGE_FILE_LARGE_ADDRESS_AWARE = $0020; {$SetPEFlags IMAGE_FILE_LARGE_ADDRESS_AWARE} The other common reason for out of memory errors is not that there is a shorage of memory, but that you are asking for a large block of contiguous memory and there is no single contiguous block of address space available. Dealing with this problem is more difficult. You first need to identify the parts of your code that are currently demanding large contiguous blocks of memory. Next you have to modify the objects that are doing so and arrange that they instead ask for small chunks of memory which you can then "stitch together" to give the appearance of a larger block. This typically happens with code that uses dynamic arrays, in my experience.
