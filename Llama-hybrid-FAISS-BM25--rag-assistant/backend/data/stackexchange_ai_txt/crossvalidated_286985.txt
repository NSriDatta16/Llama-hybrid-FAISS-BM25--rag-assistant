The GEE requires fewer assumptions. And if you are interesting in keeping your model as close to OLS as possible, then it is the way to go, as your fixed effects are population-averaged. Your sample size of 92 seems large enough not to be a problem. If you want to model cluster specific features, understand the decomposition of variance, then you should use a mixed-effects model. McNeish and Stapleton (2017) provide a good comparison of these methods. Here's the best approach if you have the time. Run both methods, and see the differences in the results. There is always something to be gained from doing this. In the paper below, the authors state that both methods can lead to different conclusions especially with discrete outcomes.
