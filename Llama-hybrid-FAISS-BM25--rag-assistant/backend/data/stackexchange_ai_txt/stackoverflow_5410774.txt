Which of these projects should I choose for summer workshop on NLP?

I am planning to attend a project oriented advanced summer workshop here in India on Natural Language Processing. Before start of the workshop, I have to make a project preference out of the following four areas about which I have limited knowledge. Machine Translation Develop an English-Indian language translation system. Parsing Build an Indian Language (IL) Parser. Morphological Analysis Develop and test Morphological Analyzers for Indian Languages. Speech Spoken Dialog Systems, Emotion/Prosody Detection, Synthesis and Conversion I have taken a course in Artificial Intelligence where NLP was introduced and fundamental sub-topics like POS tagging(Transformation Based Learning), word prediction using N-grams, Hidden Markov Models, Viterbi Algorithm, Natural Language Parsing, Context Free Grammar, CKY Algorithm were covered. I understand this is a slightly vague question and the choice would depend primarily on my interests, but would appreciate guidance on which area would be better in terms of the research scope, practical application, industry opportunities etc. EDIT: Application of skills/experience acquired while working on the project, outside NLP would also be a factor in the decision.
