.NET provides CounterSample and CounterSampleCalculator , which provide convenient access to performance counter data and the ability to compute some simple metrics (count, rate per seconds, average over a time interval) based on samples taken. I would have the web application write to the counters, and then create a Windows Service that owned responsibility for reading them (i.e., this would be in place of perfmon.exe , which you mentioned in your original question). Performance counters can be read from remote machines. Depending on your load and sampling rate, perhaps this service would run on a separate machine and collect data from multiple web servers. It would also own persisting your statistics. This would minimize the overhead to the web servers themselves.
