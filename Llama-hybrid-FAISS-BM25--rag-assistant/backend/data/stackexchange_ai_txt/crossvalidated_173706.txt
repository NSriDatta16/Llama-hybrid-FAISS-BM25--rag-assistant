R repeated measures: lme specification for multiple replicates per subject and time point

I have a repeated measures problem where my dataset has multiple replicates per per subject per time point. The number of repicates varies per subject. My objective is to use a mixed model to measure the effects of time in four week periods (Week), Type of call (Skill_Name), AgentLocation, CallerRegion, and LanguageCall on MeanCallTime. AgentLocation does not change per agent but there are multiple replicates for each week depending on the type of call, caller region, and language of call. Due to these multiple replicates I've been unable to specify a covariance structure. This is a sample of the structure of the data for a single subject: DataFrame I want to allow intercepts and slopes to vary per subject (AGENT_NUID). On consultation, I have tried the following lme specification: library(lnme) Model But I receive the following error: Error in lme.formula(MeanCallTime ~ Week + AgentLocation + CallerRegion + : incompatible formulas for groups in 'random' and 'correlation' Is my error obvious to anyone? The corAR1 structure is to account for calls of the same CallerRegion, LanguageCall, and Skill_name handled by the same agent having that residual structure from one time period to the next.
