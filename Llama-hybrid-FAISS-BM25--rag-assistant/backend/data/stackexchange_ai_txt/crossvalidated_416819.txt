How to predict weekly or monthly sales from daily time series model?

I've been given daily data and I've trained a SARIMAX time series model in Python so that I can predict daily data if given daily input. However, I need to forecast on a monthly or weekly level, meaning my input would be in monthly form and not daily input. How do I go about forecasting with my current (daily) model in a different time interval? Do I need to recreate my model so that it's trained on weekly/monthly data?
