Google Maps and Rails 3

I built an app back in the day on rails 2.3x using geokit and y4mr-gm. I am now building an app and Rails 3 and curious if there are any better solutions. Basically I have a model Business that has an address. When a user searches for or browses the Businesses I want to have a map at the bottom that displays a marker for each business. I could do this via geokit and y4mr-gm (though I hear there can be some trouble with Rails 3) but I am hoping for a more elegant solution. Is there anything recent I could use? Thanks!
