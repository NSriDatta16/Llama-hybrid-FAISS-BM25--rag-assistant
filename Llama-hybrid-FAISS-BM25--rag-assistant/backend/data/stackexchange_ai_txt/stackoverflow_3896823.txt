I have been writing C++ code for close to 10 years. During that time I have learnt how to use C++ in a way that minimizes the number of errors (bugs) I create. Probably some will disagree with me, but I would recommend you to only use for and while to do looping. Never do-while. Learn these two well and you will be able to loop successfully any time you want. To illustrate my technique, I have taken the liberty to rewrite your code using my style. It has complete error checking, uses a while loop with read-ahead, some C++0x, and simplified stream handling: #include #include #include #include int main(int argc, char** argv) { // check program arguments if (argc Save to main.cpp , compile to print.exe and run with print.exe main.cpp . Good luck with learning C++!
