Differences between Visual Studio 2005 and 2008

I would like to find out what is the most significant differences of MS Visual Studio.NET 2005 Pro and MS Visual Studio.NET 2008 Pro? I was given a copy of Visual Studio.NET 2005 Pro as the previous person who used that has left the organisation. Therefore, I am considering upgrading this version to VS.NET 2008 Pro. At my organization, we use a mixture of technologies (java, php and .net) to develop mostly web based applications. I know that 2005 uses .net framework 2.0 and the 3.5 framework can be only used in 2008.. OTher than that, I am at a bit of a loss.. Therefore could I get some feedback from the stackoverflow crowd on those who have experienced the differences between those two versions? If it's not too much to ask, could you please post the top three or five reasons to use VS.NET 2008 Pro? Thanks!
