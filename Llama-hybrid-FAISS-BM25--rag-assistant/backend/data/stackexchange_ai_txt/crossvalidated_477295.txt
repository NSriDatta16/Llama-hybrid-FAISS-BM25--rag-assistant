Well, one reason that I see is that probably your patterns are almost completely described by the information contained in the points, and are not necessarily dependent on the temporal factor. Imagine a very simple time series with univariate points, with a sinusoidal shape. If we want to recognize patterns as in "points below 0" and "points above 0", K-means can easily do so, as the information is already contained in the points themselves, and the temporal component can be ignored. However, if we want to separate patterns as "decreasing" and "increasing", we cannot do so with an algorithm that ignores the time dependency, unless make our points multivariate including some feature on the lagged inputs (change from last point, or mean of the past days). In your case, if K-means manages to fully discern your patterns, it would probably mean that these are fully described by the information that your sensors supply, and that they do not depend on their lagged values, or on their momentum.
