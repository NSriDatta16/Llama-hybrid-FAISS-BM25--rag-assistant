PCA, why variance of eigen values is measure of its utility?

Source - Murphy, 12.3 Heuristic for assessing applicability of PCA. Let the empirical covariance matrix Σ have eigenvalues λ1≥λ2≥···≥λd>0, with mean λ. Explain why the variance of the eigen values, σ 2 =(1/d)∑(λi−λ) 2 is a good measure of whether or not PCA would be useful for analysing the data (the higher the value of σ 2 the more useful PCA)
