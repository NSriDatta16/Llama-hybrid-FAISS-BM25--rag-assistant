jQuery: what is the best way to restrict "number"-only input for textboxes? (allow decimal points)

What is the best way to restrict "number"-only input for textboxes? I am looking for something that allows decimal points. I see a lot of examples. But have yet to decide which one to use. Update from Praveen Jeganathan No more plugins, jQuery has implemented its own jQuery.isNumeric() added in v1.7. See: https://stackoverflow.com/a/20186188/66767
