Generally speaking "supervised" learning", "classification" and "regression" are actually very different levels of meaning. Supervised learning is a high level categorization of ML problems which defines all challenges where we have at least some solved/labeled data. This is opposed to unsupervised learning (we don't know the solution) and reinforcement learning (data and labels are generated procedurally). Classification is specific goal of ML which you can compare to targets like prediction, outlier detection, dimension reduction, etc. Finally regression is a specific mathematical algorithm which can help us achieve tasks and might be opposed to algorithms such as a Neural Net, Naive Bayes, etc. A specific ML model can be described in all three terms: An unsupervised classification problem solved with a K-Means clustering algorithm A supervised prediction problem solved with a linear regression A reinforcement learning optimization problem solved with a monte carlo model.
