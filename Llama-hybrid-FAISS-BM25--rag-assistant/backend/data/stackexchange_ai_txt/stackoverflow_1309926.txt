Why would mobile phone emulators be losing POST variables?

I'm developing a web app specifically for mobile phones, and I've run into a doozy of a problem. On the Blackberry emulator I've installed, everything works fine. But when I run my Openwave or Nokia N60 emulators, I can't log into my app any more. When I check the logs, I find that the reason is that ALL of the $_POST variables are empty. I've run through just about everything I can think of that would be the problem, and I'm still stuck. I've tried all three of the DOCTYPEs that Wikipedia lists, on the off chance that that's it, I've tried sending all kinds of different headers, and I'm just stumped. My last idea is that perhaps my form code itself is wrong? I enclose a table in my form, and all the examples I've seen enclose a paragraph with the form. I.e. In the examples I see: ... stuff ... And I have: Email address Password You must enter a password. Sign in to: Web interface Mobile interface Save interface choice on this computer. Could that be it? Where would I find the documentation/specifications that would demonstrate this?
