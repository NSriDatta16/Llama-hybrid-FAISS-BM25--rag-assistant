I'm not aware of a deeper concept. I believe it's generally considered in the context of a maintainability index. The more branches there are within a particular method, the more difficult it is to maintain a mental model of that method's operation (generally). Methods with higher cyclomatic complexity are also more difficult to obtain full code coverage on in unit tests. (Thanks Mark W !) That brings all the other aspects of maintainability in, of course. Likelihood of errors/regressions/so forth. The core concept is pretty straight-forward, though.
