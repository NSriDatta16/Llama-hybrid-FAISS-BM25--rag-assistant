the main principle of OOP is Reusable Code , so create a class for a user you should be able to reuse the code over and over again. Every object is unique to an entity, in most cases, example of what i mean below: class identification User user id Curl Web Address Logger Log File With an objects you should pass in the identification with the constructor, so user would be like so: $Robert = new User(12); $Peter = new User(15); because your using the constructor each class can only be created once as its dedicated to its identifier. In the user class you would be able to create methods like so: public function addFriend(User $User) { //Insert into the database with $User->getID(); } $Robert->addFriend($Peter); in specific regards to your class I would certainly take on Philippe Gerber 's ethod as this to me is the standard. You also should take not that in Philippe Gerber 's method he is never changing the variable to upper-case but mealy returning an upper-case version of that string, the reason for this is that if you changed the state of the string during runtime it may not work as expected later in the process. You should only ever change variables data if they have been replicated in the database or on file, so not matter what your script does not gets messed up.
