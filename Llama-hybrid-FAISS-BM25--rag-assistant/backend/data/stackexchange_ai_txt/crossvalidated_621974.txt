Will synthetic data (e.g. from a generative model) produce valid statistical inference?

Especially with chatGPT now, there is a lot of interest in generative models for healthcare for creating synthetic patient data to amplify patient counts, e.g. for rare diseases. These are then supposed to be used for purposes of statistical inference, e.g. to compare patient outcomes, estimate risk ratios etc. My question is whether synthetic data can, in theory and practice, produce valid statistical inference, e.g. confidence intervals. Edit: Adding some more detail, assume we have some measured data $X$ . We are interested in estimating some statistics (mean, variance) based on this sample of data. Assume the data $X$ has $n$ observations, and we have a very flexible way of learning the joint distribution of the data using some state-of-the-art methods (e.g., GANs, sample sitting) which we can then use to simulate some artificial data $\hat{X}$ . If we augment actual data with this simulated data, can we still validly estimate statistical quantities like means and variances for any/every possible scientific question/target of inference?
