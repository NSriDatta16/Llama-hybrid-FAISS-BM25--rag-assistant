How to test a linear relationship between log odds and predictors before performing logistic regression?

In case of a linear regression, it's easy to test a linear relationship between a continuous dependent variable and each independent variable. For example, I can plot a scatter plot between the dependent variable on Y-axis and one of independent variables on X-axis to visualize the relationship before using the linear regression. But, a logistic regression is different, it assumes a linear relationship between log odds of a binary dependent variable and independent variables. I want to test this assumption to determine if the logistic regression is appropriate for my dataset. Can I test it? and How? Besides, is there any package in R to do the task?
