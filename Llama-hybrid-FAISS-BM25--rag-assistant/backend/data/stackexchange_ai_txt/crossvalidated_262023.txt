Deep learning is quite of broad topic. I can not say that you can not learn everything ( human capabilities are unlimited ) but working in every field is little difficult. As far as I can see you have grasped all the basic concepts so its time to choose a field where you want to apply your knowledge or do more research. If you want to work choose a field where you want to apply your knowledge and learn with it. Natural Language Processing , Image processing , Object recognition, Audio signal Processing and many more fields are there. Choose a field and build something useful. If you want to read more and do research, new experiments/research are being done daily. You can improve them or can develop your new concept. GAN ( Generative Adversarial Networks ), using Reinforcement learning with Deep learning, deep dream (Inceptionism: Going Deeper into Neural Networks ), Generative context aware encoder decoder and many more new things are there.
