I could be wrong (and I welcome the correction if so), but I believe the rationale is driven by an attempt to adhere to some normality distribution assumption. That is, if I have a normal distribution, I know $P_{25} \approx -\frac{2}{3}$. So, if my distribution is not normal to start, and if I can transform it to a reasonably normal distribution, then I can use this approximation. Of course, as you noted, the final results will not be the same. A quick example would be the average of 1 and 9 is 5, but if you log the values (0, 0.95), average (0.477), and then antilog, you get the average as 3.
