Specialize a generic variable

I have a generic method where I want to do something special for Strings . I've found DirectCast(DirectCast(value, Object), String) to get the String value (when I've already confirmed GetType(T) Is GetType(String) ) and DirectCast(DirectCast(newvalue, Object), T) as mentioned in a number of answers to similar questions works. But is there anything more elegant and is it performant?
