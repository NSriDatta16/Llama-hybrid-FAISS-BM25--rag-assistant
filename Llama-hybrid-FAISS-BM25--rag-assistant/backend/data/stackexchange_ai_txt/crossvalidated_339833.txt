Problem of extremly increasing Partial Autocorrelations in time series data

I'm currently trying to make a forecast of the use of prepaid payment instruments using ARIMA modelling in Stata. I have a time series data set, containing monthly oberservations from April 2011 to October 2016 (67 observations). This is the data set I am using (copied from csv format. If you have an other suggester how to better upload my data, give it to me): month,Vol_PPIs,lnVol_PPIs Apr 2011,3.08,1.12493 May 2011,3.21,1.166271 Jun 2011,2.59,.9516579 Jul 2011,2.98,1.091923 Aug 2011,.68,-.3856625 Sep 2011,2.38,.8671005 Oct 2011,2.22,.7975072 Nov 2011,.58,-.5447271 Dec 2011,3.08,1.12493 Jan 2012,3.19,1.160021 Feb 2012,2.99,1.095273 Mar 2012,3.62,1.286474 Apr 2012,3.6,1.280934 May 2012,3.71,1.311032 Jun 2012,3.260761,1.181961 Jul 2012,3.744257,1.320223 Aug 2012,4.070717,1.403819 Sep 2012,5.12,1.633154 Oct 2012,5.700896,1.740623 Nov 2012,6.184041,1.821972 Dec 2012,7.18,1.971299 Jan 2013,6.682868,1.899547 Feb 2013,7.329987,1.991974 Mar 2013,10.353717,2.337346 Apr 2013,8.680184,2.161043 May 2013,9.19,2.218116 Jun 2013,9.037625,2.201396 Jul 2013,10.09,2.311545 Aug 2013,10.892093,2.388037 Sep 2013,10.804673,2.379979 Oct 2013,10.359762,2.337929 Nov 2013,9.64968,2.266925 Dec 2013,10.784192,2.378081 Jan 2014,13.460249,2.599741 Feb 2014,14.11,2.646884 Mar 2014,16.571989,2.807714 Apr 2014,15.725985,2.755314 May 2014,16.248582,2.788006 Jun 2014,16.584616,2.808475 Jul 2014,18.709978,2.929057 Aug 2014,20.003466,2.995906 Sep 2014,22.842242,3.128612 Oct 2014,31.08,3.436564 Nov 2014,26.379108,3.272572 Dec 2014,28.98,3.366606 Jan 2015,33.492338,3.511317 Feb 2015,30.312295,3.411553 Mar 2015,54.104713,3.990921 Apr 2015,74.361793,4.308942 May 2015,46.914643,3.84833 Jun 2015,55.426342,4.015055 Jul 2015,64.533643,4.167187 Aug 2015,52.948234,3.969315 Sep 2015,58.00953,4.060607 Oct 2015,61.823247,4.124279 Nov 2015,62.659297,4.137712 Dec 2015,68.670216,4.229316 Jan 2016,65.248441,4.178202 Feb 2016,65.369233,4.180052 Mar 2016,72.052751,4.277399 Apr 2016,69.299994,4.238445 May 2016,70.946566,4.261927 Jun 2016,76.980277,4.343549 Jul 2016,77.851066,4.354797 Aug 2016,96.282689,4.567288 Sep 2016,97.074452,4.575478 Oct 2016,126.90475,4.843437 In order to make the data stationary, I took first differences of the data. Plotting the data it looks quite stationary, but the variance is increasing over time. Nevertheless, the Augmented-Dickey Fuller test did reject the null hypothesis of a unit root, so I concluded that the differenciated data is roughly stationary. In order to find the appropriate ARIMA specification I follow the general procedure plotting the autocorrelation function (ACF) and the partial autocorrelation function (PACF) of the differenciated data. Unfortunately, my PACF shows a very uncommon pattern: The partial autocorrelation are increasing extremly from lag 17 onwards. I was wondering if the increasing partial autocorrelations are maybe due to the heteroskedasticity of my data. Taking the logarithm, the Problem of heteroskedasticity seems to be avoided (despite two outliers in the beginning). Nontheless, the PACF has its Peak with the last lag. So my question is if anyone can explain to me what is the reason for the PACF to behave like this? And how can I counteract the increasing partial autocorrelations? I appreciate any hint you can give me. I did a lot of Research but have never seen a PACF like mine anywhere.
