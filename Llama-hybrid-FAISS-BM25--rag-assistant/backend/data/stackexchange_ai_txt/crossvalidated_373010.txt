Hierarchical clustering in R - centroid linkage - problem with dendrogram heights

I have got a problem with understanding the hierarchical clustering algorythm, especially centroid linkage method. I have read many articles with description and they seems to be quite easy but I connot understand the results on real values. I have got sample set like this: test_list I can generate a cluster using this function: test_dendrogram The dendrogram looks like this: The list of heights is: 1.000000 4.250000 5.000000 8.138889 I understand the results as below: 1 = 2 - 1 5 = 16 - 11 4.25 = 6-((2+1)/2 + 2)/2 But I have no idea how to calculate 8.13. I did the same exercise with single, average and complete linkage methods and the results are obvious.
