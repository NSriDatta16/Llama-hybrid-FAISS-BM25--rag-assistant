K means clustering with survey data

I have a dataset obtained from a survey, where all questions are likert-type, but with different scales (1-5 or 1-2). Is it possible to run k means clustering if I rescale all to 1-6? Additional questions: Would it make more sense to run PCA first and apply clustering to the PCs?
