what does it mean that there is leakage of information when one uses a test set?

I have read about the term "leakage of information" that occurs when one tries to estimate the generalization error by using a test set in Machine Learning models. However, I was not able to find any formalism (maths or statistics) that could help me to clarify why this situation happens. Could anybody explain to what does this term refers to?
