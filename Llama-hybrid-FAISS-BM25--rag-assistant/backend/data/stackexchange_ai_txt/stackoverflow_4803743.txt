Have a look at the source code for BitMeterOS , it works on xp+. you many also want to look at TCPDump/Libpcap as well. both of these monitor network network traffic, libpcap will probably be what your after though there is also Winpcap , a more windows orientated 'version', a simple tutorial on network traffic stats can be found here , you'll also be interested in this for filtering based on connection and this for the size of the raw packets.
