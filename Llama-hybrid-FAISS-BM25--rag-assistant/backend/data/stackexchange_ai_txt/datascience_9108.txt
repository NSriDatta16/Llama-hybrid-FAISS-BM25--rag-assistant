The way I view it: 'Classification' (in the context of machine learning) is a type of problem in which you assign a 'label' to an object. Formally, 'Classification' is a type of problem whereas labeling is a function from an object to a set of labels (maybe infinite). Much the same way Regression is a type of problem where you, again, assign a label to an object only this time the label is some real number. Both in Classification and in Regression you are attempting to find the 'best' labeling function with respect to some metric/loss function.
