how to start a sql server agent job from java code

I have few SQL Server Agent Jobs running in my project. The jobs run perfectly as scheduled, no issues. But now I need to be able to start these jobs from the front end (Like on a click of button or so). How can I do it ? Do these jobs behave just like a functions ?
