Top misrepresentations in programming?

I often find that design patterns, libraries, and frameworks promise great things and sound awesome - until you actually study them and realize that what they say sounds better than it actually is. Forklift Code http://xeoncross.com/images/funwithforklifts.jpg Completely modular and stackable - use only what you need! For example, how do you properly Unit Test your database if your application is tightly coupled to a global database singleton? Singletons maybe all the rage in frameworks - but unless you're careful you will break Dependency Injection which is important for Unit Testing. What is the most misleading representation you want to warn your fellow programmers about? Itâ€™s kinda the same idea as facebook, with functionality more like Twitter, but with the innovation of Microsoft. - clientsfromhell
