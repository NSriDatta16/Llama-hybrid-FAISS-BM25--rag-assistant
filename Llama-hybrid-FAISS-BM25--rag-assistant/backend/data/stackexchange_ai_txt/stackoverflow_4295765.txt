Sort LIs in different ULs with jQuery

I have this markup dinamically generated through PHP/MySQL Italy Record > 1 Record > 2 Record > 3 Europe Record > 4 Record > 5 Record > 6 World Record > 7 Record > 9 Record > 8 I can drag the LIs with jQuery UI sortable to new positions, and get their new order with "serialize", ready for database update As you can see, there are 3 ULs, but their N LIs are all related so I get a N-items "serialization" with each drag, and that's exactly what I want So, ie, if I move Record 3 in Record 1 place, I get this: 3,2,1,4,5,6,7,8,9 and not this: 3,2,1 This is my jQuery code: $("#sortable").sortable({ items: 'li', opacity: 0.6, cursor: 'move', update: function() { var order = $(this).sortable("serialize") + '&nAction=move'; $.post("mypage.php", order, function(response){ $("#response").html(response); }); } }).disableSelection(); It's working, but not as I'd like: I mean that I need to drag/drop only LIs within their respective UL, and NOT from one UL to another (always retaining the N-items serialization) In other words, I'd like to be able to sort records 1, 2 and 3 among them, 4, 5 and 6 among them and 7,8,9 among them, without mixing (i.e., record 1 can't go in group 4,5,6 nor in group 7,8,9) Of course, always getting the N-items serialization! (and that's the main reason why I applied "sortable" to a container dive and then specified LI items) I tried with "containment: 'parent'", but it works only for the first drag/drop Here are two online examples made with jsFiddle: The original one , with LIs going from one UL to the other The version with "containment" , that works only on the first drag but it's a mess in the following drags
