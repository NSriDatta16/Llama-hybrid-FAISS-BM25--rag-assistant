You could always use PHP. It is a decent command-line / programing application. Other than that all I can say is that you knowledge of database access and storage will be helpful but by the end of the day you are going to need to learn a new language. Most languages have libraries for database access. Just pick one that you like the feel of. It is also a good idea to choose one that is popular (for the community support) and free libraries are always nice. Also look for good documentation and one that is fairly standard. A nice thing to know is that javascript and php syntax are very similar to many other languages. (Javascript looks almost identical to C and C++). Just read the main language tutorial then the database API tutorial and you should be good to go
