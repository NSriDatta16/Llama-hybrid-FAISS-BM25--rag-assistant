You could change the column to be a normal column and then update its value when you INSERT/UPDATE that row using a trigger. create table Answers ( [ID] int not null identity(1, 1), [ID_Question] int not null, [Text] nvarchar(100) not null, [Index] Int null ) CREATE TRIGGER trgAnswersIU ON Answers FOR INSERT,UPDATE AS DECLARE @id int DECLARE @questionID int SELECT @id = inserted.ID, @questionID = inserted.ID_question UPDATE Answer a SET Index = (select count([ID]) from [Answers] where [ID] NB* This is not fully correct as it wont work correctly on UPDATE as we wont have the "inserted" table to reference to get the ID and questionid. There is a way around this but i cant remember it right now :( Checkout this for more info
