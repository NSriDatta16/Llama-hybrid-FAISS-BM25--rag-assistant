swing editor ui for applicationContext.xml beans?

I asked this in spring forums but got no answer, and I just discovered stackoverflow, so Ill try here. I am using spring 2.0.5. In my app I need to let the user add/modify/delete (via the UI) beans that are described in the applicationContext.xml file. The beans that are to be edited are all of the same class (like a db table crud editor really, but faster do develop and easier to evolve regarding the code). I have been searching the web and forums and cannot find any existing code. I guess my need is quite usual, does somebody know some code I can leverage? If not, is there at least a way to get the xml (as a string) element from a java bean? thanks in advance.
