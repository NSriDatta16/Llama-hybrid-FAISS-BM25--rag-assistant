Calling an asynchronous method serially

I have the following (simplified) asynchronous method: void Transform (X x, Action resultCallback) {...} and what I want to do is transform a list of Xs into a list of Ys. The problem is that even though the Transform method is asynchronous, it has to be called serially (i.e. I have to wait for the callback before calling it with the next value). Is there any way to do this elegantly? (I'm on .Net 4.0) I'm guessing there might be some way to do it with continuation passing... UPDATE I forgot to specify that I don't want to block the calling (GUI) thread.
