This is indeed a field being researched. Look at the milepost branch for GCC, which relies on profile-guided optimization and machine learning. The recent scientific literature for compilers is full of papers using a combination of data mining, machine learning (through genetic algorithms or neural networks), and more "classical", pattern-recognition of certain code patterns.
