These are books that might be helpful: Introduction to Data Mining by Pang-Ning Tan, Michael Steinbach, Vipin Kumar. This was the suggested book during my Data Mining classes at university. I like its layout and the theoretical approach; Data Mining: Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques by Ian H. Witten, Eibe Frank, Mark A. Hall. A very interesting book. This book covers also many implemented techniques with the Data Mining Framework WEKA ; Machine Learning by Thomas Mitchell. It is a bit old book but it can be useful. Then remember that you can attend free classes of Machine learning at Stanford have just started: www.ml-class.com . And for your particular problem, that is SNP analysis, I would suggest to have a look to the Di Camillo's group at University of Padova.
