Ordinal Logistic Regression

My dataset looks like this: Depen Indep1 Indep2 Indep3 1 1 1 Continous 2 0 2 3 1 3 1 0 4 2 1 1 3 0 2 So as you can see I have an ordinal dependent variable with three categories, and one ordinal independent variable with four categories, I have one binary variable and one continuos variable. Can I run an ordinal logistic regression?(Depn ~ Indep1+Indep2+Indep3) If not an ordinal logistic regression then which other models do you recommend?
