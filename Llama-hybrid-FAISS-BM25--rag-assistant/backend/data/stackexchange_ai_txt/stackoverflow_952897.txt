A variation on your idea is to have a server-side USER-AGENT detector that will figure out what style sheet to attach to the page. This way you can have a firefox.css, ie.css, opera.css, etc . You can accomplish a similar thing in Javascript itself, although you may not regard it as clean. I have done a similar thing by having a default.css which includes all common styles and then specific style sheets are added to override, or enhance the defaults.
