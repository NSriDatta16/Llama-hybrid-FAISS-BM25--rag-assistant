Can a RNN make a joint prediction and if so, is this implementable in Python software like Tensorflow or Pytorch?

I was wondering, can a RNN make a joint prediction (or predict two outputs at once)? For example, let's say I want to predict tomorrow's weather. I want to predict both temperature and humidity as a joint prediction. For my specific case, I don't think it makes sense to build two models, one for humidity and one for temperature. Is this something that is possible with the current free technology out there, and if so, is this able to be implemented in Keras/Tensorflow or Pytorch? Thanks!
