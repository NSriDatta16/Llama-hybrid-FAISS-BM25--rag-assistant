Using logistic regression on groups of candidate SNPs in genetic study

I'm working with a large number of candidate SNPs (about 55) in a smallish sample (n=157), looking at a binary sub-diagnosis of schizophrenia (my dependent variable). Basically I am trying to determine which genotype of which SNPs, if any, are associated with this sub-diagnosis. I am trying to sort out a model which will account for the multiple comparisons problem. I have settled on grouping my SNPs into phenotype (e.g. this group previously associated with symptom x, this group with symptom y), running logistic regression on each group, and using the omnibus test to determine if the group is significantly associated - this would tell me that one or more members of that group are driving the association. I would then correct for the number of groups, which represents the number of tests I have performed. My question is twofold: first, does this make sense? Second, can anyone help me find precedence: a paper in which something similar was done (doesn't have to be in genetics).
