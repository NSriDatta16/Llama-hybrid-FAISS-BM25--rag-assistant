In C,C++ local variables have automatic storage class and are stored in Stack . When function returns then stack gets unwound and locals are no more accessible, but they still persist in memory and that's the reason when u define a variable in function it may contain garbage value. It is just stack pointer manipulation in stack and on memory for local is removed actually.
