It sounds more like canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to me. R has canonical correlation ( cancor ). Depending on the dimensions of your dataset it might not be possible: if your datamatrices are singular then standard CCA will not work. As far as I can see one of your datamatrices is singular with the size 14-by-24. I have worked a bit on singular CCA and I tried two ways: Canonical ridge (regularized CCA) and PCA projection followed by CCA in the reduced space. There seems to be an R package called CCA with canonical ridge [1]. I haven't tried that one. I worked in Matlab. [1] https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v023i12/v23i12.pdf
