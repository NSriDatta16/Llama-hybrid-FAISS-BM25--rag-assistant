According to documentation: Leveraging lambdas, the ILog interface offers a new & safe way to write log statements log.Debug( m=>m("value= {0}", obj.Value) ); This ensures, that the whole expression is only evaluated when LogLevel.Debug is enabled and thus saves you from having to write if (log.IsDebugEnabled) { log.Debug("value={0}", obj.Value); } to avoid this overhead. So the second option in your quesetion considered a best practice.
