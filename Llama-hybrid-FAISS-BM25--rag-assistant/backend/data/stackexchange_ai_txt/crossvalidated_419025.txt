Deep learning book RBM Equition 20.15 how is the conditional distribution derived?

I was reading the DL textbook from here . I understand how the probability of individual elements of hidden layer h gets derived. However, I could not understand the equation (20.15), which derive the conditional distribution of hidden layer h over visible layer v. Here is a screenshot from the textbook I hope to get some explanation of how it is derived. Any help would be appreciated. Thank you very much!
