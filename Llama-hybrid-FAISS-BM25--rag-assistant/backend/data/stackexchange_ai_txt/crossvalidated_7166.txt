General approaches to model car traffic in a parking garage

a friend of mine has asked me to help him with predictive modelling of car traffic in a medium sized parking garage. The garage has its busy and easy days, its peak hours, dead hours opening hours (it is opened during 12 hours during weekdays and during 8 hours during weekends). The goal is to predict how many cars will enter the garage during a given day (say, tomorrow) and how are these cars supposed to be distributed over the day. Please point me to general references (preferably, publicly available) to strategies and techniques. Thank you
