variable error on logistic regression/ proc catmod- Building predictive model

I am using logistic regression to fit a model with categorical/multinomial varaibles. data-description: There are over 300 variables as independent variables, sample size is 5000 which is divided into 80/20 for train/validation. I am getting the following error on 2 different procedures that I have tried upon, here is the code: proc logistic data=a outest=b covout; model dependent= list of independent; /selection=stepwise slenrty=0.70 slstay=0.75 details lackfit; run; I know step-wise is not the best approach but my question pertains to this: error: "variable x should either be numeric or in classes list" So I formatted the variable into numeric, but it still is giving me the same error? I cant figure out what to do? I applied proc catmod on the same exact data/variable to fit the multinomial logistic model and it gives me this error: "variable x in list does not match type prescribed for this list". The error comes for the same set of variables. Can anyone suggest a solution? Also, HOW DO i tell sas to treat all of these variables as categorical? or is it just a programming error? I cant understand why am I getting this error? Any help would be much appreciated; I am stuck at this point and my experience level on statistics/modeling is of a beginner!
