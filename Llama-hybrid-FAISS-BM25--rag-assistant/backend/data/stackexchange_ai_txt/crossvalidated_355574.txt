mAP calculation in object detection

I'm quite confused as to how I can calculate the AP (average precision) or mAP (mean average precision) to evaluate an object detection model. I specifically want to know if the True Positives (TP) from one image related to one class should be calculated after or before applying the non-max suppression . Thanks!
