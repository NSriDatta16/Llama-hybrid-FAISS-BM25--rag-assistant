A time series is invertible if errors can be inverted into a representation of past observations. For the time series data, the error ( $\epsilon$ ) at time $t$ ( $\epsilon_t$ ) can be represented as: $$\epsilon_t = \sum\limits_{i=0}^{\infty}(-\theta)^i \, y_{t-i}$$ With every lagged value ( $y_{t-i})$ , its coefficient is $i^{th}$ power of $\theta$ term. So, the infinite series converges to a finite value only if $|\theta| , which also means that recent past observations are given more weight than distant past observations. Therefore, time series is invertible if $|\theta| (possibility of representing errors as linear combination of past observations)
