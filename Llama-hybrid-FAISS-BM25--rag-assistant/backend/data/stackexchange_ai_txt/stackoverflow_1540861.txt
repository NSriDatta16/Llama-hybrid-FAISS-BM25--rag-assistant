Ignore "The" and "A" when sorting a listview in C#

Currently I am making a mini music player / organizer for myself. However, when using a list view, it sorts alphabetically, and doesn't ignore "The" and "A": A Lot Like Me Adiago For Strings Stay Crunchy The Foresaken Time to Pretend should be: Adiago For Strings The Foresaken A Lot Like Me Stay Crunchy Time To Pretend It's all loaded from a multi-dimensional array, and I've even tried filtering out "The" and "A" manually, and then display the real name (from a different array), but then it just sorts the displayed name (including "The" and "A")
