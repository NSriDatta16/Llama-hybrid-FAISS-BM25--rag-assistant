Deploy the applet using Java Web Start. From Java 1.2 this could be done to get a 'free floating' applet (outside a web page), but since 1.6.0_10+, it can also be done for embedded applets. Put each theme in a separate Jar and in the JNLP (launch file) & mark them as 'lazy' download. Notate which package is contained in which Jar (also in the JNLP file) so the JWS client knows which Jar to download for each theme. (a) Everything else will work 'like magic', and the JWS client will show a progress bar when downloading the lazy Jars. (a) For this to work properly, each theme needs to be in a separate package, as well as a separate Jar.
