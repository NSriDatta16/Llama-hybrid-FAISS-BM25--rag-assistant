As I usually use UML more as a communication tool rather than a modeling tool I sometimes have the need to flex the language a bit, which makes the strict modeling tools quite unwieldy. Also, they tend to have a large overhead for the occasional drawing. This also means I don't give tools that handle round-trip modeling well any bonus points. With this in mind... When using Visio , I tend to use these stencils for my UMLing needs (the built in kind of suck). It could be that I have grown used to it as it is the primary diagramming tool at my current assignment. OmniGraffle also has some UML stencils built in and more are available at Graffletopia , but I wouldn't recommend that as a diagramming tool as it has too many quirks (quirks that are good for many things, but not UML). Free trial though, so by all means... :) I've been trying out MagicDraw a bit, but while functional, I found the user interface distracting. Otherwise i find the Topcased an interesting project (or group of projects). Last I used it it still had some bugs, but it worked, and seems to have evolved nicely since. Works great on any Eclipse-enabled platform. Free as in speech and beer :) As for the diagramming tool Dia , it's quite ugly (interface and resulting drawings), but it does get the job done. An interesting modeling tool free alternative is Umbrello , but I haven't really used it much. I definitely agree with mashi that whiteboards are great (together with a digital camera or cellphone). Probably some of the nicest tools I've used belong to the Rational family of tools.
