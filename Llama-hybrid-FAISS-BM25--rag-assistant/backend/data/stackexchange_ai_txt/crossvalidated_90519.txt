Two words: concept map. That's the only effective way I have found to divide and conquer large data sets or any concept that's really convoluted. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_maps Personally, I think better on paper than on screen, so I just mind map what I'm dealing with before I even start to do any basic analysis. For a more professional diagram, there are lots of mind mapping software http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_concept-_and_mind-mapping_software Mind mapping has several advantages: tells me what I have in terms of "core" variables and derived variables (if any) allows for the organization/formulation of a model based on theory/logic points to what variables I may be missing and/or could add if the relationships between the core variables don't pan out like I think they should Edit : As an example, here is the concept map for factor analysis: http://www.metacademy.org/graphs/concepts/factor_analysis#focus=factor_analysis&mode=explore Now this is purely for learning the concept, not performing analysis, but the idea is the same: to map out ahead of time what it makes sense to do, and then do it. If you're looking for an automated/coded version of this, I don't think one exists. You can't automate the concept of modeling when you're trying to understand a system. (And that's a good thing because it would put plenty of people out of a job.)
