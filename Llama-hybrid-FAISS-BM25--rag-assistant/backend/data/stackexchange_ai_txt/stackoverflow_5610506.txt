ASP.NET MVC: Relationship between MembershipUser, Identity, MembershipProvider and Principal

I need some functionality in an ASP.NET MVC application and after doing some research, I feel that I have to implement custom MembershipUser, MembershipProvider, Identity and Principal. My problem is: I don't understand the relationship, if any, between MembershipUser and Identity and where exactly MembershipProvider and Principal come into the picture. Could someone please shed some light. I have seed several articles and tutorials around the web about all the four players, but none addresses the relationship between them fully. Also: is there an elegant way of assigning the custom principal to Context.User other than during AuthenticateRequest in the Global.asax? I have seen many examples on how to do this in ASP.NET WebForms applications and I was wondering if ASP.NET MVC has a better way.
