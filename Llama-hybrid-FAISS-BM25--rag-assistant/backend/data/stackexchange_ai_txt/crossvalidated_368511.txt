Is it possible, that the get.weights command in Keras returns only rounded numbers?

I am trying to construct a neural network, which i have previously trained in keras, in another program. Therefore, i use the get.weights command from keras to acces the weights. Now the problem is, that the results from the other program seem horrible so I am trying to figure out why. Keras tells me, that the format of the weight is float32 and all the weights have a format looking like "5.30527434e-01" - which leads me to the conclusion, that keras is rounding the number. Is that correct? And if it is, is there a way to access the full weights of the network?
