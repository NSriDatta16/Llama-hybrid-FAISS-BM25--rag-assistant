Adding a simple UIView from a class to the main ViewController

Dear scholars, code gurus. My question is rather simple, I have been searching and trying for some time now without any luck, I would greatly appreciate some tiny help. I have a simple class that should generate a view as following: // vipcardclass.h // #import @interface vipcardclass : UIViewController { } +(IBAction)newsletter; @end and // vipcardclass.m #import "vipcardclass.h" @implementation vipcardclass +(IBAction)newsletter{ UIView *vipcard = [[UIView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(10.0, 0.0, 290.0, 280.0)]; UIImageView *vipcardBG = [[UIImageView alloc] initWithImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"vip_card.png"]]; //background.png [vipcard addSubview:vipcardBG]; CGRect webFrame = CGRectMake(6.0, 0.0, 300.0, 210.0); UIWebView *content = [[UIWebView alloc] initWithFrame:webFrame]; [content setBackgroundColor:[UIColor clearColor]]; [content setOpaque:NO]; NSString *urlAddress = @"http://www.google.com"; NSURL *url = [NSURL URLWithString:urlAddress]; NSURLRequest *requestObj = [NSURLRequest requestWithURL:url]; [content loadRequest:requestObj]; [vipcard addSubview:content]; [content release]; [???????? addSubview:vipcard]; NSLog(@"Newsletter was called"); } @end (Kindly look at the ?????? , few lines above , if it was the main view controller I would use self.view addSubview: , My question is what is the proper syntax when using it from a class) In my main view controller I #import "vipcardclass.h" and at some point calling the class function [vipcardclass newsletter]; Which works just fine, apart from adding it to the main controller. I would add as a side note, that the class functionality is not communicating or relevant to any function in the main view controller, its a fire and forget thingy and I just want to open and display this view. Thank you kindly.
