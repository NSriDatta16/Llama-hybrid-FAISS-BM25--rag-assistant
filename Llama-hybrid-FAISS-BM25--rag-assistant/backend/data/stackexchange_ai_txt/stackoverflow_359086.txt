.NET Designtime Datasource (for Combobox)

i'm trying to create a ObjectDataSource which I can use to bind to a BindingSource which on his turn should be bound to a ComboBox. I've created a simple class and a simple list for this class (see below) The Times list class is not showing up at my toolbox, so I cannot drag it to the form so I can select it as the datasource for a bindingsource. Second option is to create a new project datasource (ObjectDataSource). Here is asked to 'select the object your wish to bind to'. I've added a friend/public/private variable to Form1 which instantiates the Times class. However this variable does not show. The only object which appears in my project namespace is Form1. What am I missing? Public Class Time Private _timeValue As String Private _timeDisplay As String Public Sub New(ByVal Value As String, ByVal Display As String) Me._timeDisplay = Display Me._timeValue = Value End Sub Public Property Display() As String Get Return Me._timeDisplay End Get Set(ByVal value As String) Me._timeDisplay = value End Set End Property Public Property Value() As String Get Return Me._timeValue End Get Set(ByVal value As String) Me._timeValue = value End Set End Property End Class Public Class Times : Inherits List(Of Time) Public Sub New() End Sub End Class
