Survival analysis with only a few time points

I'm investigating the survival of patients with a certain disease, and whether or not they progress to a more severe form of this disease based on several covariates (see EDIT). Currently, I'm attempting to run two standard survival analyses -- Kaplan-Meier and CoxPH. My dataset consists of ~80,000 patients, each of whom has a measurement for at least 2 time points (clinic visits). The dataset is restricted to only those patients who do not have the severe form of the disease at their first visit. I've run the model, and something jumped out at me -- 60%+ of the patients in the dataset have only 2 measurements. My question: is this problematic? The survival time of these patients appears to be entirely dependent on when they come for their second appointment, and would seem to reflect that rather than their true disease progression. Should I use a time-invariant model like logistic regression instead of CoxPH/KM? Thanks! EDIT: I'm trying to estimate the time from treatment initiation to onset of severe disease. In particular, I want to test whether patients with an intermediate level of the disease when they initiate treatment progress to the severe form more quickly than those with a low level of the disease at initiation.
