What is obtained from the product of a probability and a log probability ratio?

I'm looking at the commonly used artificial neural network model that has nodes and connections. Quick refresher A connection has a source and target node, and a weight. The output of the source node is multiplied by the weight to give the connection's output value. A node sums the value of each connection feeding into it, and applies a sigmoid activation function. This is the node's output value. A commonly used activation function is the logistic function . I'm just exploring some ideas around this commonly used model. So for instance, the logistic function is the inverse of the logit function . That's interesting because the logit function is commonly used to calculate a log-odds from a probability. Therefore if we work backwards we can think of the summed input into the activation function as being a log-odds value. So let's say we have one input node (x), one output (y), and one connection (w) then we have: y = logitInverse(xw) (logitInverse being the sigmoid logistic function, same thing). We've inputed xw into logitInverse() function, so in one sense we are treating xw as a log-odds value. But x was the output from a previous node so is from the output of a previous node's logitInverse() and it can therefore be considered to be a probability with range [0,1]. Hence we have multiplied a probability (x) with a log-odds (w) and treated the result as a log-odds (the input to logitInverse). Regarding w. This definitely hints at being amenable to being treated as a log-odds value since the range 'fits', e.g. typically a weight would be observed to be in the range [-5,5] (but could go far beyond that), but crucially a weight of zero corresponds with a probability of 50% [ consider log(50/50) = 0 ], i.e. the target node is not correlated with the source node. So everything sort of fits, except we multiply a probability (x) with a log-odds (w) and treat it as a log-odds. Final thought. Again, taking w to be a log-odds value, then we can write it as: w = log(a/b) And we multiply xw, therefore we have: xw = x * log(a/b) = log((a/b)^x) I have no idea if that has any significance on the question or not.
