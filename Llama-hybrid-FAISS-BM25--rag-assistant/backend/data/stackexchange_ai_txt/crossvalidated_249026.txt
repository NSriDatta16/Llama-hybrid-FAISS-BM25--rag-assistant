There is no particular reason for wanting to transform your data as far as the adequacy of the model is concerned. However you may want to re-scale your outcome to make the coefficients lie in a more manageable range. For instance instead of having sales as the raw count you might express it as so many millions or so many thousands. This would have the effect of dividing your coefficient for rainy days by 1000 or 1000000 which might make it look more sensible. This is often done for predictor variables but in your case from your description it is the outcome which needs attention. Your model adequacy is not changed though which is the important thing. As pointed out by commentators I am assuming that sales are billions of some currency unit which if it is the sales of different products sold at different prices may well fulfill the usual assumptions of linear regression. However if it is billions of umbrellas and hence a count then a different model such as Poisson may be appropriate.
