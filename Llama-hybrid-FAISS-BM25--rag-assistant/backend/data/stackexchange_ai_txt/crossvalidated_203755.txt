Why do we calculate pooled standard deviations by using variances?

Why do we calculate the pooled standard deviation by averaging the variances and taking the square root, rather than averaging the standard deviations directly? Edit: this came up in the context of creating an effect size for a paired samples t-test, but if the answer varies across contexts I am interested to learn about that as well.
