First, this post ends up in "use SSIS" :-P As long as your library contains links to System.Web.dll I don't think that you will be able to register it in SQL Server as SQLCLR assembly. SQLCLR assembles are very restricted and cannot contain any reference. You could move front-end specific parts of your business logic into a separate presentation layer library. This is generally a better solution than mixing business logic and presentation classes like a web application context. After that you can try to deploy your assembly to SQL Server. Now you are able to create a second SQLCLR library, containing the .NET stored procedures that orchestrate your business objects. However, I don't really see the advantage of SQLCLR, here. It would require huge changes in your source code and causes several restrictions for your whole application. My personal preferences would be Either use a SSIS package. Here you can refer any other DLL and consume its functionality. Or write a simple .NET console application which will be started by SQL Agent. In both cases, the implementation is almost equal. SQLCLR is especially designed to handle purely database specific tasks that hit the wall of possible (and suggestive) T-SQL features.
