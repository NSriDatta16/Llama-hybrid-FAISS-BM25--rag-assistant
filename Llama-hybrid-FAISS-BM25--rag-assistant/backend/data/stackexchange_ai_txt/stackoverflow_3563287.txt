NSTableView drag items "count badge"

When you start dragging items in the table view in Mail or iTunes, you see this count badge neatly showing (in a red "starred" circle, or rounded rectangle if the count gets big enough) the number of dragged items. Is there a ready-made code somewhere available for me to do this? Because if it is, it could save me a whole lot of time writing the drawing code for this myself.
