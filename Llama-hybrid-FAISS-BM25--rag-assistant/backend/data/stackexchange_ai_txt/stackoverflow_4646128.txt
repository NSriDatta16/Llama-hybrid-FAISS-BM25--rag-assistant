Javascript: Recreate window reference with parent or vice versa?

Is it possible somehow to keep reference with opened windows all the time, even after refresh or opening new tab and closing previous where windows were initially opened? The only solution is to to create and keep register(track) of all open all windows. So basically it will cause to refresh content of all opened windows if same name were provided while opening it. It's may be a solution if template is cached and messages are stored in localStorage but: it's not cross browser solution it's not a solution for COMET application at all as there will be connections opened from all windows instead of one(via parent window) So is there any way to recreate or keep references of all opened windows? Thanks ;)
