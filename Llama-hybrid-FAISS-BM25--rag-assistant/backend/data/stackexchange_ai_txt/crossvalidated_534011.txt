How do you know that the model is fitting well to the data? How do you know that the results look good? RMSE and MAE are in units of your target value, and they do not have a common/general range. The values could be bad. If you have to predict a value around 0.01 meters and you are predicting 0.145 meters, that would give a MAE of 0.135. That is not good. But if you are predicting a value of 34.001 meters and your output is 34.145, that looks good, and have the same MAE. The two values that are dimensionless and have a common range is MAPE and R^2. Your MAPE is 29% which means that you are erring (on average) by 30% of the correct value) Is this good or is this bad for your case?
