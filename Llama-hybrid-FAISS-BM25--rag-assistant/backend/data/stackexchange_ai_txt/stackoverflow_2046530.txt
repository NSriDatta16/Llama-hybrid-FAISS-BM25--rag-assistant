What's the opposite of a nbsp?

A &nbsp; character is a space which doesn't allow for line breaking. lorem ipsum here&nbsp;are&nbsp;some&nbsp;words and so on | lorem ipsum | | here are some words and so | | on | What's the opposite of that? That is, a character which is NOT rendered as a space, but CAN be used for line breaking. foo supercalifragilisticexpialidocious bar |foo supercalifragi | |listicexpiali | |docious bar | or with wider size: |foo supercalifragilisticexpiali | |docious bar | I'm aware of the soft-hyphen character , but for my purposes, I specifically do not want a hyphen added at the break.
