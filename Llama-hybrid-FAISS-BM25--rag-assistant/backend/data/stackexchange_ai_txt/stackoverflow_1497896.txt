The Windows® Scripting Guide provides technical resources, information and source code to help you automate the Windows® operating system using Windows® Script Host (WSH) and the VBScript and JScript scripting languages. There is much information out there to get you started. There are many things you can do with it. I'm using a VBScript that makes the window handling work as in Linux ( alt + Drag moves a window) with jus a few lines of code. You can access many hooks to the system, including the file system. You can use any language that has registered itself with Windows Script Host , by default, VBScript and JScript.
