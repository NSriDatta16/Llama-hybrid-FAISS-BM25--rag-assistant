How can I mathematically explain the convolutional neural network?

How can I give notations to the whole CNN network? Like, if I feed input 'x' to feature extractor, we will get the extracted feature embedding vector at the end that will be passed to the linear classifier and at the end we will apply the softmax? Can any one explain this whole process in the notations.
