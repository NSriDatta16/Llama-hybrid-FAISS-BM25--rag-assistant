Extract values from a 'binary format' file and create text file with fixed field sizes

I've used JavaScript to get the data through the internet (I'm interfacing with a brokerage firm's API functions), but unlike most of the rest of their API's, this one returns the data in a 'binary' like format. Here is the layout of the file I get back: Field -------- Type ------------ Length(8 bit bytes) --------------- Description Symbol Count----Integer------------- 4--------------------------- Number of symbols for which data is being returned. The subsequent sections are repeated this many times REPEATING SYMBOL DATA Symbol Length Short 2 Length of the Symbol field Symbol String Variable The symbol for which the historical data is returned Error Code Byte 1 0=OK, 1=ERROR Error Length Short 2 Only returned if Error Code=1. Length of the Error string Error Text String Variable Only returned if Error Code=1. The string describing the error Bar Count Integer 4 # of chart bars; only if error code=0 REPEATING PRICE DATA close Float 4 high Float 4 Low Float 4 open Float 4 volume Float 4 in 100's timestamp Long 8 time in milliseconds from 00:00:00 UTC on January 1, 1970 END OF REPEATING PRICE DATA Terminator Bytes 2 0xFF, 0XFF END OF REPEATING SYMBOL DATA As you can see, this file is a mixture of different types of fields. My requirement is to convert this file from the way it is into a fixed field text file (or CSV file). I'm not very good at JavaScript, but I know enough to get by. My main language is MAPPER from Unisys (it is actually called "Business Information Server"). Currently I get all HTTP responses as text files, but this one is a 'binary' file, and MAPPER can not process it because it is a text-based language (a 4GL). I've spent days trying to find a snippet of JavaScript code that I could use, but to no avail. I think this is really simple stuff for a guy that knows JavaScript.
