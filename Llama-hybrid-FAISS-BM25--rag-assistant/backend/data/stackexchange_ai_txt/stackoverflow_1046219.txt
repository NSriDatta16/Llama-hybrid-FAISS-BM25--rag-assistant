executing eclipse.buildscript task on a feature misses the fragment

I have a feature called foo, plugin called foo, and a single fragment foo.win32.x86. I should be able to execute a call to eclipse.buildscript within an ant file on a feature and have it create a build.xml for the feature, plugin, and fragment; however, all I get is the build.xml for the feature and plugin. The foo feature.xml: %description %copyRight %license The foo plugin MANIFEST.MF file: Manifest-Version: 1.0 Bundle-ManifestVersion: 2 Bundle-Name: %Plugin.name Bundle-SymbolicName: foo; singleton:=true Bundle-Version: 0.0.0.200906251500 Bundle-Vendor: %Plugin.providername Bundle-Localization: plugin Eclipse-LazyStart: true The foo plugin.xml file: The foo.win32.x86 MANIFEST.MF file: Manifest-Version: 1.0 Bundle-ManifestVersion: 2 Bundle-Name: %Plugin.name Bundle-SymbolicName: foo.win32.x86 Bundle-Version: 0.0.0.200906251500 Bundle-Vendor: %Plugin.providername Fragment-Host: foo;bundle-version="0.0.0.200906251500" Bundle-Localization: plugin Can anyone explain why I'm not getting the build.xml for the fragment? If I force a call to eclipse.buildscript for the fragment it works fine, but doesn't this defeat the purpose? Thanks
