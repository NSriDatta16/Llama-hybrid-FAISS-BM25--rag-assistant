Python distributed machine learning

I occasionally train neural nets for my research, and they usually take quite a long time to run (especially when I'm working on my laptop). I'm looking for a way to build the model on any computer and send it up to a server for training and have it return the graphs/accuracies/weights etc. I know there are paid solutions for this but I'm looking for a distributed solution I can run myself. I have a server set up at home which is about to get a CPU and GPU upgrade. I'd like to be able to set it up so that when I'm working on the LAN, or when I'm working remotely on my laptop, I can send code to the server and have it train the model and return to me the results (or save the results if the sender machine is switched off) Are there any existing solutions to accomplish something like this? I'm not tied to any specific library, but would prefer to stick with Python if possible
