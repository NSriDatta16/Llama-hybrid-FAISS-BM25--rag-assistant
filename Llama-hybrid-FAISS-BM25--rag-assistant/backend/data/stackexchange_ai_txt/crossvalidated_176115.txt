As a sanity check, consider a constant daily "escapement probability" of 0.0004 (0.04%), without replacement of escaped fish back into the lake. After 365 days, the probability that an individual hasn't escaped is $(1-0.0004)^{365}$, 0.864, or a 13.6% probability of having escaped. That's about equivalent to the annual escape probability based on tagging and recapture in the cited paper. So you should be looking for a typical daily escape probability of 0.04% to account for an annual rate of about 13%. From page 646 of the cited paper: "Model averaging indicated that daily escapement probability was approximately 0.01%"; that's only a 3.6% annualized rate, similar to what you are finding. You should note, however, that the authors state earlier on that page, at the end of Methods: "Escapement estimates obtained from Program MARK ... only provided a daily estimate of escapement that could not be extrapolated to an annual escapement rate ." (Emphasis added). I am not familiar with the analysis program, but evidently its estimates as provided in this paper cannot reliably be used in the way that you intend. You might want to check with the authors of the study (or of the analysis program) for why this is the case. Also, you should note that for 3 months during the study "daily discharge rates increased to 85 $m^3/s$" (page 649), above the upper limit of the plot in Figure 5 showing the relation deduced between "emigration probability" and discharge. "Escapement increased exponentially as mean daily discharge increased from 8 to 61 $m^3/s$" (page 646), so it's maybe not surprising that daily escapement estimates based mostly on low-discharge conditions would underestimate the annual escape rate.
