Autoencoders can be used for Image Denoising (Xie) with exceptional results. Essentially, imagine a network where the input is your image (NxN) and the output is of the same dimension (NxN). If the hidden layer were the same or a greater dimension, the network would simply memorize your image. However , if you make the hidden layer smaller than your image, it must compress it. In this compression process, it removes noise. Not sure if it's good, but here is a tutorial in TF. Also see this video .
