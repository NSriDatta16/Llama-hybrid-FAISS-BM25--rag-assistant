jQuery drag n' drop won't let me drag outside of a scrollable div?

ok i've got a table with drag and drop classes in a div that has it's overflow set to "auto", this allows me to hide part of a schedule and only puts a scroll bar on the bottom. however, i just created some droppable elements outside of the scrollable div and my draggable elements can't leave the scrollable div. any ideas?
