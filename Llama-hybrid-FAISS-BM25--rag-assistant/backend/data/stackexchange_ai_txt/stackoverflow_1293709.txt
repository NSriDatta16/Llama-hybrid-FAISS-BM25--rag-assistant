To be semantically correct, tables should only used for tabular data and not for laying out a page. David Dorward brought something to my attention in a comment. According to the HTML 4.01 Specification 's section on Tables in HTML Documents : Tables should not be used purely as a means to layout document content as this may present problems when rendering to non-visual media. Additionally, when used with graphics, these tables may force users to scroll horizontally to view a table designed on a system with a larger display. To minimize these problems, authors should use style sheets to control layout rather than tables.
