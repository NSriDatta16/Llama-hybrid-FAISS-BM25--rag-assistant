Arbitrarily pick one of the DLL projects as the startup project, it doesn't matter which. Right-click + Properties, Debugging. Set the 'Command' setting to the path of a test EXE that will load the DLLs. If you don't have a good one then just write one, might as well add it to the project and make it the startup project. Pay attention to the Output window while the EXE starts. You'll see notifications for each DLL that gets loaded. As soon as one of the DLLs that's in your solution gets loaded then the debugger jumps in, looks for the .pdb file for the DLL and activates any breakpoints you'd have set in the DLL source code. You cannot debug the DLL unless the EXE loads it. If that still doesn't enable breakpoints then use Debug + Windows + Modules and locate the DLL in the list. Right-click it and choose Symbol Load Information to find out where the debugger looked for the .pdb file. This doesn't go wrong very often since the DLL contains the path to the .pdb file. The far more typical failure mode is that the EXE simply didn't load the DLL.
