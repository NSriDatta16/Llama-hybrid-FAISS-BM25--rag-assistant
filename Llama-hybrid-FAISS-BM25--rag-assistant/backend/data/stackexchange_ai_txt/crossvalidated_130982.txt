The innovations are used in the time series the same way as errors in cross-sectional analysis (such as OLS). For instance if you data generating process is $$y_t=0.9y_{t-1}+\varepsilon_t$$, then we estimated it as $$y_t=0.85y_{t-1}+e_t$$, we call $\varepsilon_t$ innovations (or errors), and $e_t$ - residuals. For instance, take a look at this MATLAB help page on ARIMA class, where they always refer to innovations in the place where you'd expect to see errors in cross-sectional analysis such as in this MATLAB help page for LinearModel class. In cross-sectional context the model could look like $$y_i=0.9x_i+\varepsilon_i$$ In this MATLAB help page for arima.infer() method, which estimates innovations, the estimated errors are called residuals as usual. So, I conclude that innovations are ok to interchange with errors . It's called innovations because in time series context the errors bring new information to the system. In cross-sectional context it doesn't make a sense to call them new, as the observations come not in time-ordered sequence. So, observation number 10 is not newer or older than observation number 9. In time series, 10 comes after 9, so in this regard the error/innovation can be seen as a new information from the point of view of the observer who hold the information set up to time 9.
