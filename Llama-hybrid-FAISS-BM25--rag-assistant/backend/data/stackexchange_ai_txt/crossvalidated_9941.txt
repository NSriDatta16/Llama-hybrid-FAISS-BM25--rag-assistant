The standard tools, at least in psychology, in your situation would be exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis to assess the convergence of the inter-item correlation matrix with some proposed model of the relationship between factors and items. The way that you have phrased your question suggests that you might not be familiar with this literature. For example, here are my notes on the scale construction and factor analysis and here is a tutorial in R on factor analysis form Quick-R . Thus, while it's worth answering your specific question, I think that your broader aims will be better served by examining factor analytic approaches to evaluating multi-item, multi-factor scales. Another standard strategy would be to calculate total scores for each group of variables (what I would call a "scale") and correlate the scales. Many reliability analysis tools will report average inter-item correlation. If you created the 50 by 50 matrix of correlations between items, you could write a function in R that averaged subsets based on combinations of groups of variables. You might not get what you want if you have a mixture of positive and negative items, as the negative correlations might cancel out the positive correlations.
