Like mipadi said, you should be terminating the server (ctrl+c) and returning to the command prompt before calling manage.py runserver again. The only thing that could be disrupting this would be if you've somehow managed to make runserver act as a daemon. If this is the case, I'm guessing you're using the Django test server as the actual web server, which you should NOT do. The Django test server is single threaded, slow and fragile, suitable only for local development.
