Feature selection using deep learning?

I want to calculate the importance of each input feature using deep model. But I found only one paper about feature selection using deep learning - deep feature selection . They insert a layer of nodes connected to each feature directly, before the first hidden layer. I heard that deep belief network (DBN) can be also used for this kind of work. But I think, DBN provides only abstractions (clusters) of features like PCA, so though it can reduce the dimension effectively, I wonder that if it is possible to calculate the importance (weight) of each feature. Is it possible to calcualte the feature importance with DBN? And are there other known methods for feature selection using deep learning?
