So the first that comes to mind for me is to ask, "What is the end goal"? Are you trying to classify them by how active they are and at what times? If you are then I would refer you to this paper here . The relevant section is 2.3 where they explain that there are two main approaches to dealing with this issue in the literature. "The first approach is to feed time-series features to RNN and then concatenate with static features." "The second approach for combining the two types of features is to include the time invariant features as part of the temporal features and feed them together to RNN units." In short, you can either train it all in one model or first use the time series model and feed to another model for the time invariant features. Where the paper mentions these solutions, there are further citations to other sources that discuss this further.
