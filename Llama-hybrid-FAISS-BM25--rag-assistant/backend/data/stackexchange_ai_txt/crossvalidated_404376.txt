Is margins simply a probability? (STATA)

I've run a logistic regression on two binary 0,1 variables. One is "seizure yes, no" the other is "sex, male, female". Now if I run a margins command on these variables, I get a number as a result. I don't quite understand this number despite looking around what exactly it means. It seems it means a probability. Does this mean that I have the computed probability of getting a seizure if you are a male and if you are female? Also, can I somehow use the margins command for my entire multiple regression model, computing the probability given you are male but in the model instead of by itself?
