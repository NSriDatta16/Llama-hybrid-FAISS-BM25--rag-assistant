I'm unfamiliar with Disco and Condor, but I can answer regarding Hadoop: Hadoop pros: Robust and proven - probably more than anything else out there. Used by many organizations (including the one I work for) to run clusters of 100s of nodes and more. Large ecosystem = support + many subprojects to make life easier (e.g. Pig, Hive) Python support should be possible through the streaming MR feature, or maybe Jython? Hadoop cons: Neither simple nor elegant (imho). You'll have to spend time learning.
