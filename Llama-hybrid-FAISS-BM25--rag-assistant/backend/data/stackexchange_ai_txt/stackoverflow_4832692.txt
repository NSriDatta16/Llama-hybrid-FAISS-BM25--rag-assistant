STL containers: iterating between two iterators

I am storing values in a std::map I am finding two values in the map, and I want to iterate between the first through to the last item - however the void foobar(const DatedRecordset& recs, const double startstamp, const double endtstamp) { DatedRecordsetConstIter start_iter = recs.lower_bound(startstamp), end_iter = recs.lower_bound(endtstamp); // Can't do this .... ( Is there a more elegant way of iterating between two known iterators?
