Pro Spring is a superb introduction to the world of Inversion of Control and Dependency Injection. If you're not aware of these practices and their implications - the balance of topics and technical detail in Pro Spring is excellent. It builds a great case and consequent personal foundation. Another book I'd suggest would be Robert Martin's Agile Software Development (ASD). Code smells, agile techniques, test driven dev, principles ... a well-written balance of many different programming facets. More traditional classics would include the infamous GoF Design Patterns , Bertrand Meyer's Object Oriented Software Construction , Booch's Object Oriented Analysis and Design , Scott Meyer 's " Effective C++ '" series and a lesser known book I enjoyed by Gunderloy, Coder to Developer . And while books are nice ... don't forget radio ! ... let me add one more thing. If you haven't already discovered safari - take a look. It is more addictive than stack overflow :-) I've found that with my google type habits - I need the more expensive subscription so I can look at any book at any time - but I'd recommend the trial to anyone even remotely interested. (ah yes, a little obj-C today, cocoa tomorrow, patterns? soa? what was that example in that cookbook? What did Steve say in the second edition ? Should I buy this book? ... a subscription like this is great if you'd like some continuity and context to what you're googling ...)
