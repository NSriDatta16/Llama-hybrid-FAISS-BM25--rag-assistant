Ok, let's try again :) I assume you mean you're trying to preserve the order of entities in a many-to-many relationship? If so, it seems this isn't possible with a stadard EF many-to-many join. Instead, you'll need to add an additional entity in the middle, which stores the sequence. This isn't elegant, but it's likely the only way. Here's some info from Rowan Miller @ MS: In EF a true many to many (i.e. without the join entity) can not contain any payload and the contents are not ordered. Adding a join entity is the best way to achieve what you are after. Source: http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en/adonetefx/thread/6fe9f4fc-9979-4885-ad15-8c5ddebb45b1
