It is possible to run Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on proportions?

I have an apparently simple question, but quite surprising I can't find any answer online. The question is: is it possible to run PCA on proportions? Since I am not specifically trained in statistics or mathematics it would be great if someone could give a simple answer, besides giving an appreciable mathematical grounded answer. Thank you
