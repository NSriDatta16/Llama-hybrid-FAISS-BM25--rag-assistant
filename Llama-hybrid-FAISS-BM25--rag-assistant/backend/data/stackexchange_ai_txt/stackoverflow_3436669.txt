What is a good way to format sql of a view from MYSQL

As most of you would know, when you save a view in MYSQL and then retrieve it later, it's all in native MYSQL, looks terrible - no line spaces, indents, plenty of UTF encoding tags littered around the place making your code look like sql soup. Does anyone have a program or recommend a plugin to netbeans that i can use to format this sql. Here's my view, give formatting it a go and repost it as an example if you like :) /* ALGORITHM=UNDEFINED */ SELECT `e`.`Australia` AS `audit_anps`,`e`.`audit_end_date` AS

(`s`.`currentstatus` = _latin1'complete')) Ugly, right? Whenever I use code formatting in Netbeans, or in Heidi SQL all it does it put each section (FROM/WHERE/LIMIT/SELECT) on a new line. This is no good because my select statement is so long. I need something that will at the very least put each select field on a new line. Can You help me? Thank you.
