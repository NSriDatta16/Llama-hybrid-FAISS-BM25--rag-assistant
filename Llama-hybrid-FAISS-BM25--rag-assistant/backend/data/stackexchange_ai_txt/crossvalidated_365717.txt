The marginal density of $Y$ can be found by "averaging over" the $X$ values: $$ f_Y(y) = \int_{0}^{y} 2 \, dx . $$ Once you have this marginal density you can combine it with the joint density to arrive at the conditional: $$ f_{X|Y}(x, y) = \frac{f_{XY}(x, y)}{f_{Y}(y)} . $$ If you carry out these calculations you should get the answer you gave.
