Due to changes in security models, it's not possible to have a totally chromeless popup window any more and attempts to strip all the chrome off will simply be ignored. Have you considered using JQuery to create a pseudo-popup that is skinned to look like a window, give it drag handlers and a dismiss button? you could gracefully degrade to a standard pop-up. http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/
