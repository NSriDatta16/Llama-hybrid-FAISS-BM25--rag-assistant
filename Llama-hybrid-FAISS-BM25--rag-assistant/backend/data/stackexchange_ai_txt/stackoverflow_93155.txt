I just found this: Object-oriented modeling is a formal way of representing something in the real world. It draws from traditional set theory and classification theory. object-oriented modeling is not limited to computer-related elements. One may use object-oriented modeling to represent many different types of things, from organizational structures, to organic materials, to physical buildings.
