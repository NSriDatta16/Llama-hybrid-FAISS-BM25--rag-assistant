I can't find anything about it, which is indeed a bit surprising. If it has a C interface, it is possible to write your own bindings to the routines you need. Just use the interfacing pragmas . The types defined in the package Ada.Interfaces.C would also be of help. Getting things linking and tested on a custom binding can be a wee bit of a challenge though. Also, it looks like recent versions of Gnat come with a binding generator that can create Ada bindings for you out of C header files. There are six more such tools available here , including one that works on Windows COM DLLs that I've heard good things about.
