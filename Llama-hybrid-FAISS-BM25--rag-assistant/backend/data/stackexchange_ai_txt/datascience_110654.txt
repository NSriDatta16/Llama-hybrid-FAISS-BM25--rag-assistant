In the book "Machine Learning Engineering" by Andriy Burkov (chapter 4.12.4), it is recommended to consider "Zip Codes" as categorical like "country" would be. The goal being reducing cardinality (i.e the number of unique values) of such variables in order to avoid "several modes" depending on that feature.
