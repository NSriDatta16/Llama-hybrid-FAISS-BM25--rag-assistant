Identifying change-points in time for survival curves, including for Cox proportional-hazards (PH) models, can pose problems as outlined on this page . Questions to consider are whether you think that the change-point is independent of the predictor values and how abrupt a change in baseline survival you expect from acclimatization. If the change-point in time is independent of predictor values, then simple examination of the baseline hazard/survival estimated from the Cox model might be all that you need. In that case your scenario would mean a rapid drop in survival at early times followed by a much flatter survival-versus-time baseline curve. (Survival can't "increase" with time, it can just stop decreasing so quickly as it had been.) The baseline survival-over-time function is necessarily discrete in a Cox model, but you might be able to submit those discrete baseline survival values to generic change-point software noted in the page linked from the first paragraph to get a change-point, and estimate variability by repeating the modeling on multiple bootstrap samples of the data. As Frank Harrell noted in a comment on that linked page, however: "The sample size required for reliable estimation of such change points is quite large." If the acclimatization is gradual (which would seem to make sense), you might consider a smooth parametric model. A Weibull model, for example, can fit a situation with a continually decreasing hazard, consistent with acclimatization, in a PH setting. That, and other accelerated failure time models used in non-PH settings (e.g., log-normal, log-logistic) can have nice interpretations in terms of shrinking or stretching the time axis as a function of predictor values, allowing acclimatization rate correspondingly to depend on predictors. A Bayesian model combining what you've already found in the literature with a Bayesian survival model sounds appealing, but I have no experience with that. There are a few threads about Bayesian survival on Cross Validated , and a brief Wikipedia page links to a couple of references.
