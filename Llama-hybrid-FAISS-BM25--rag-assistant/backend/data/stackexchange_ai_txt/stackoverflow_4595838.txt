If you want to send emails from localhost directly, you need to install a Mail Transport Agent (MTA), or if you like, a SMTP service. IIS provides one. You can otherwise find some others on Google . You can also change your php.ini mail settings . This won't use localhost per say to send emails, but a relay host that will allow you to send emails from a PHP script.
