You can try to compute the tangent of an interpolating curve that passes through the given points (I'm thinking of a cubic spline, which is pretty easy to derive) or compute the tangent directly from the data points. You can find a rough approximation of the derivative in the following manner Let a curve C pass through points p1,p2 and p3. At point p2 you have two possible tangents: t1=p2-p1 and t2=p3-p2. You can combine them by simply computing their average: 0.5*(t1+t2) or you can combine them according to their lengths (or their reciprocal 1/length) Remember to normalize the resulting tangent. In order to compute the angle between the tangent and the curve, remember that the dot product of two unit vectors gives the cosine of the angle between them. Take the resulting tangent t and the unit vector v2=|p3-p2|, and acos(dot(t,v2)) gives the angle you need.
