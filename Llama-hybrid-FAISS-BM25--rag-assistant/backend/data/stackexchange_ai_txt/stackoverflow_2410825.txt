as far as I know, you need to obtain an instance of nsIFile in order to get the file path (the File class does not offer this feature). This MDC page explains how to do this: https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DragDrop/Recommended_Drag_Types#file . Note that although not listed in the previous link, obtaining an nsIFile instance requires privileges escalation (cf. my answer to Can I drag files from the desktop to a drop area in Firefox 3.5 and initiate an upload? show how to do this).
