Normally, you should not have to explicitly load the HttpBrowserCapabilities class; ASP.NET will load it for you, as long as you have your .browser file in the right place (in App_Browsers). However, testing it will be another problem. You can't modify the "User-Agent" HTTP Header from within either the HttpApplication (global.asax) or a custom HttpModule. This leaves only awkward techniques, such as using Reflection to force the value, or using an external tool (such as Fiddler). Alternately, if you're good with C/C++, you could take a simple example for an ISAPI filter and modify it, then install it in IIS.
