Suspicious Amount of Zeros in Confusion Matrix

I have a data set with about 45000 observations and three features. When I apply machine learning classification algorithms like naive Bayes, kNN and SVM I receive a lot of zeros in the resulting confusion matrix. In particular for naive Bayes and SVM with linear, polynomial and sigmoid kernel (with e1071 R package) I receive a confusion matrix like following: pred aaa bbb ccc ddd eee fff ggg hhh aaa 1639 2888 2985 2945 2174 1345 1549 1648 bbb 137 217 236 290 272 239 426 156 ccc 0 0 41 0 0 0 0 0 ddd 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 eee 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 fff 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ggg 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 55 hhh 671 787 940 702 0 442 122 1945 For kNN (with kknn R package) and SVM radial kernel the confusion matrix looks more non-suspicious. pred aaa bbb ccc ddd eee fff ggg hhh aaa 749 593 736 352 68 208 413 273 bbb 393 1742 1076 1246 662 916 789 924 ccc 322 235 1002 191 420 64 90 127 ddd 26 29 45 79 94 69 5 34 eee 3 239 44 363 476 299 170 5 fff 42 112 56 386 90 15 307 73 ggg 346 54 503 636 99 99 258 57 hhh 566 888 740 684 537 356 65 2311 Is there maybe a problem with the complexity of the data set or is this just the correct classification result?
