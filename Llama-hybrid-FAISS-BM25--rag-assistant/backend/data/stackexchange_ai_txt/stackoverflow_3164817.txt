In order to get help you might consider providing a non-minified version of your script. I see that there are 8ms setIntervals in your code. As mentioned above, Firefox never goes below 10 ms (yet). Playing your game in FFox 4 it is very enjoyable, though. I saw two very small hickups that clearly were caused by garbage collection. Chrome has an edge over the Fox in that regard. Even though SpiderMonkey (that handles GC in Firefox) has improved dramatically from 3.5 to 3.6 it's still not good enough for many games. In 4.0 it is a lot better, but still not quite as good as in Chrome or Opera. (It is being worked on.) Playing the game and looking briefly at your code, I see no complexity that would cause Firefox not to be able to handle what's going on. Also Firefox 4 has hardware accelerated Canvas that is marginally faster than IE9 and a lot faster than Chrome. There is a notion on the web that Chrome is faster than Gecko when it comes to canvas, but that is because people rarely profile their pages. In fact, canvas in Firefox 3.6 is already at least as fast as in Chrome, but many tests don't show it since the JavaScript is slower. (And some JavaScript tests are slower because Firefox does not handle the test harness well.) All this leads to lots of confusion and misinformation. The bottom line is that your game should be OK in Firefox 4. You should see if there is anything you can do to avoid triggering unnecessary GC. E.g. are you re-using variables or creating unnecessary new ones? However, in Opera 10.53 it was not enjoyable. Not because Opera could not keep up with the speed, but since instead of moving the bottom piece, it was kept stationary and the whole playing field moved instead. (I managed to go to level 17 in my first try in spite of this.) In Opera 10.6 the page fails to load properly. You probably need to debug your code - or perhaps file a bug with Opera if it's a regression. (I'll tweet this to get their attention.)
