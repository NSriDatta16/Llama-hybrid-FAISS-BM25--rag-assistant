Basically, you can have multiple convolutional modules in one layer. It is called grouping and was introduced in AlexNet . The inputs are the same in this case and the outputs of all convolutional modules should be concatenated after passing the input. I quote from the link the benefit of grouping in conv nets. Group convolutions provide elegant language for talking about lots of situations involving probability ... Group convolutions naturally extend convolutional neural networks, with everything fitting together extremely nicely. Since convolutional neural networks are one of the most powerful tools in machine learning right now, thatâ€™s pretty interesting... About stacking, the provided answers will suffice.
