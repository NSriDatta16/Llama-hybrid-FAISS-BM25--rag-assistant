You say in a comment that The songs themselves can not be both jazz and folk, but each participant can choose both a jazz song and a folk song from the list. Therefore, in the crosstab, each participant can contribute to more than one cell. The real problem here is what you state in the second sentence above: each participant can contribute to more than one cell . The "problem" mentioned in the title non-exclusive categories is here a non-problem: Your categories are exclusive . So please update/correct your title and question! If your interest is in comparing musical preferences between men and women, you could present your data as a two-way contingency table, and the usual chisquared statistic would give useful description of the (lack of) homogeneity. The question is if it has the usual chisquared distribution. That could maybe be investigated using simulation, or you could try a permutation test, permuting the male/female labels ( so the fifteen counts pertaining to the same person would be permuted together.) Another approach is multinomial logistic regression. It would be very interesting if you could answer your own question now, comparing different approaches!
