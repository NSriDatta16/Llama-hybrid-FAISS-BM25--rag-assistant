I think this is due to Wuform embedding that surely listen for load events on IE before getting its maximum size. var s7x3k7 = new WufooForm(); s7x3k7.initialize({ 'userName':'cbtech', 'formHash':'s7x3k7', 'autoResize':true, 'height':'514'}); s7x3k7.display(); Maybe you should remove autoResize and put a fixed width in the options.
