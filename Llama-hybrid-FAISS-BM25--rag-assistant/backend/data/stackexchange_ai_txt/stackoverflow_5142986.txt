If some event is triggered, then store the event on database (with ajax or without ajax). You will be needing a script in server to check if some event has been triggered or not. This script should be able to check events that are stored in database. You need to execute script in step 2 periodically. This can be acheived with with ajax (javascript or jquery) and a function settimeout (on javascript) to send ajax request to server periodically. Changes are sent from server. So parse the response and update in page using javascipt and jquery. So, it can be summarized as Register an event (for one user) Check the event (for other user) Parse the response and update the page There are several elegant ways to do this as answered by others. The best would be the start the project and ask for help where ever stuck.
