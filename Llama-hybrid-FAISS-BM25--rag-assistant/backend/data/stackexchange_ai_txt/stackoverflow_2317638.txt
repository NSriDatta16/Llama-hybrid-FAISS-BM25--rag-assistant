PHP serialize - Store an image

Would it be possible to write a script that gave the user the ability to upload a file (Image gif,jpg,png) and the serialize it and store as text? Essentially the user doesn't have any storage so wouldn't be able to upload a file and store as a file, but I've hijacked a profile field that can store user specific strings. Any help appreciated?
