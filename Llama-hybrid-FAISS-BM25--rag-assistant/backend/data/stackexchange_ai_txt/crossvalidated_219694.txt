Is it possible to run multiple logistic regression for small sample size?

I have collected data, there are 300 non-injury and only 17 injury. Four categorical variables are significant according to Chi-squire, then I used Multiple logistic regression for significant variables. Three of them are significant again. Does it make any sense? I would like to know whether can I use Multiple logistic regression because only 17 respondent had injured from 317 of the respondents. I used SPSS to analysis of data. If I can not run it what should I have to do? There is any way to solve it. Is there any software better than SPSS for this situation, for example STATA software or SAS......
