The default value of t from the documentation is 0.7*max(Z[:,2]) where Z is the linkage matrix that you pass to the dendrogram function. When you use different linkages, in your case ward and average, you obtain different values and scales for the distance between clusters. Thus, the value for t is different in both dendrogram. If the two methods are not related via a monotonic function (and I believe they do not in this case), then the default t value will not cover the same nodes for each dendrogram.
