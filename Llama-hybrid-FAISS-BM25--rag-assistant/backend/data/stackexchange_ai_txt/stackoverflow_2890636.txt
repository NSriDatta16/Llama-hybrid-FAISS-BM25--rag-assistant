Whether to put the classes of each layer in a separate library depends on if you would need to write more applications in the future that would need to use these same classes. You might think that you need and start doing right away. From my experience, I start to have better ideas after coding and having at least some kind of proof of concept. Organizing code, such as re-factoring, organizing into libraries, etc at some point during the middle of the project is easy. It's trying to do that right before going live which is risky and not a good idea. Regarding the remaining parts of your question, I would refer to you what I learned from Martin Fowler as I can't say better than him and if I do, I am just repeating after him: http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/serviceLayer.html http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/
