If I am understanding your question correctly, you could think of this in terms of a multinomial logistic regression with repeated measurements. If you used a cumulative logit link function you would have one have one regression parameter to interpret for 2019 vs 2013. If you used a generalized logit you would have a separate 2019 vs 2013 comparison for each level: low, med, high, very high. Using standard software the test and confidence interval method would be a Wald test on the cumulative or generalized logit scale that accounts for the correlation between repeated measurements on the same subject.
