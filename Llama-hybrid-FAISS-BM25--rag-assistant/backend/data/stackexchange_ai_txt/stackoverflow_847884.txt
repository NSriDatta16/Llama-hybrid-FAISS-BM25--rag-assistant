Encrypting and decrypting data using NHibernate

I'm writing a publicly accessible web application which will contain personal user data, such as names and birth dates, and I'm required to encrypt this data in a form that will be difficult for a human who might access the raw data to decrypt. I'm using Fluent NHibernate , mySQL, and C# 3.5. What method should I use for industry standard encryption and decryption of user information? The method of encryption should not be database dependent. How do I tell nHibernate to do transparent encryption/decryption on certain mapped classes with a simple property, like StorageType = StorageType.Encrypted . I don't mind if the resulting database table has just one or two columns, or one for each encrypted field. From what I've found, I should create my own data type from IUserDataType and encrypt the data in the constructor. Is this correct?
