$b_2$ here corresponds to the conditional effect of $X_2$ when $X_1=0$ . A common mistake is to understand $b_2$ as being the main effect of $X_2$ , i.e. the average effect of $X_2$ over all possible values of $X_1$ . Indeed. I typically answer at least one question per week where this mistake is made. It it also worth pointing out for completeness that $b_1$ here corresponds to the conditional effect of $X_1$ when $X_2= 0 $ and not the main effect of $X_1$ which is easily seen by rearranging the formula $$Y=(b_0+b_2X_2)+(b_1+b_3X_2)X_1$$ In practice, it seems that $b_2$ and $B_2$ are reasonably close to each other. I think this is false in general for this model and will will only be true when the interaction term $b_3$ is very small. Are there any "common knowledge" examples of situations where $B_2$ and $b_2$ are remarkably far from each other? Yes, when the $b_3$ is meaningfully large then $B_2$ and $b_2$ will be meaningfully apart. I am thinking of how to show this algebraiclly and graphically but I don't have much time now, so I will resort to a simple simulation for now. First with no interaction: > set.seed(25) > N > dt > X > betas > dt$Y > (m1 (m2 as expected. And now with an interaction: > set.seed(25) > N > dt > X > betas > dt$Y > (m1 (m2 Are there any known upper bounds to $|b_2-B_2|$ I don't think so. As you increase $|b_3|$ then $|b_2-B_2|$ should increase
