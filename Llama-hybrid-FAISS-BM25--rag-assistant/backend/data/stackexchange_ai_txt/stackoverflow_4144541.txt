Like @Fabrizio Calderan said, maybe the script URL is wrong? Or maybe because of lack of js extension server doesn't send proper mime type and browser has a problem with interpreting the file. Also if it's wordpress, you probably rewrite post's URLs somehow - if the script is in your domain's root directory you should put / before filename, if it's in a template directory try what @Nick Pyett proposed. Yes, you can debug JavaScript in Opera - check out Opera Dragonfly
