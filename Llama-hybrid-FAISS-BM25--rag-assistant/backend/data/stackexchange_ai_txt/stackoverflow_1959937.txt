The answer from Dan Herbert helped me really. I appreciate your help. Just want to post my usage - hope it helps some one at some point of time. My requirement is that I need to send back cookies from first http post response to second http post request. 1st: CookieContainer cookieJar = new CookieContainer(); request.CookieContainer = cookieJar; .... CookieCollection setCookies = cookieJar.GetCookies(request.RequestUri); 2nd: CookieContainer cc = new CookieContainer(); cc.Add(setCookies); request.CookieContainer = cc;
