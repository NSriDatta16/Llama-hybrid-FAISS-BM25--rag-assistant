I'd recommend joining an existing open-source project. Starting your own may be fun, but it will likely have little usefulness for the open-source community. People will be unlikely to join a project you start for school because you are likely to abandon it once you graduate. Helping with an existing project will let you make a long-term difference without a long-term commitment. There are plenty of open-source projects that would be fitting for your PHP skills: Drupal , Wordpress , or any of the Sunlight Labs projects. Personally, I like Sunlight Labs because they have a purpose beyond just creating software (to make governments more open and transparent), and the organization appears to be healthy and growing. No matter which project you choose, you can't go wrong by contributing to an active open-source project.
