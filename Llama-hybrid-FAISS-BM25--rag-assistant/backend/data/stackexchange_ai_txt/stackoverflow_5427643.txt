Xcode4 workspace sharing projects

I am trying to use the new Xcode4 workspace feature to migrate some Xcode3 projects that has dependencies between them. I have a project which creates a static library and then an application project which depends on the static library. So, as the guide mentioned, I created a new workspace and dragged both the projects into the workspace. However, when I build my application, it's unable to find the header files from my static library. I get "No such file or directory" error. My intention is to let Xcode auto detect the dependencies. But, not sure what I am doing wrong, I couldn't get it to work. Any help is greatly appreciated. There isn't much documentation out there either.
