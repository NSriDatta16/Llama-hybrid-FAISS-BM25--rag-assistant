[...] where the top-5 error rate is the fraction of test images for which the correct label is not among the five labels considered most probable by the mode. First, you make a prediction using the CNN and obtain the predicted class multinomial distribution ( $\sum p_{class} = 1$ ). Now, in the case of the top-1 score, you check if the top class (the one with the highest probability) is the same as the target label. In the case of the top-5 score, you check if the target label is one of your top 5 predictions (the 5 ones with the highest probabilities). In both cases, the top score is computed as the number of times a predicted label matched the target label, divided by the number of data points evaluated. Finally, when 5-CNNs are used, you first average their predictions and follow the same procedure for calculating the top-1 and top-5 scores.
