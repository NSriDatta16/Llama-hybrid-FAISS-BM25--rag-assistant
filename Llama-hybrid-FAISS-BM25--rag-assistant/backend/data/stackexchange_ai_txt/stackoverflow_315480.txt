Depends on how you're indexing them, for how to retrieve them. There's nothing particularly against storing them all in a single folder, but it becomes difficult to manage. If you're storing them by filename, and the filenames are reasonably normally distributed, you might want to have subfolders separated by first letter of the name, etc. If you're indexing by date added, you may want to segregate them by that. As far as I know, there's no "faster" or "slower" way to store the images for browser retrieval.
