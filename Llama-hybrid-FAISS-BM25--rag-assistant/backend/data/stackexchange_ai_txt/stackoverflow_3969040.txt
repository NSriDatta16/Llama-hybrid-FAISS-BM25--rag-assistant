I know you already accepted an answer but if you are running your server 24-7 it may just be cheaper to get dedicated hosting. Doing the math it would cost 86.40 to run a small instance (I did small instead of micro because you also have to calculate in EBS pricing for the data, the micro instance has no local storage). Doing a Google search for "Cheep dedicated hosting" gave me this provider for 66.95/mo. ($37.95 for the server + $29 for using windows instead of Linux) If you are doing testing I would recommend using EC2 to get things working smoothly but when you are ready to deploy and want the game running all the time you can save a lot of money by going with a traditional hosting provider instead of doing cloud computing.
