Books advice: Advanced Programming in the Unix Environment , by Stephens and Rago. Accelerated C++ , by Koenig and Moo IDE: my favorite choice would be Eclipse , which has a c++ plugin (and many more interesting plugins), but I would also advice you to learn to use at least one among the Sacred Monsters: VI/VIM and Emacs. OS: I would go for a dual boot system with some linux distro, maybe Ubuntu.
