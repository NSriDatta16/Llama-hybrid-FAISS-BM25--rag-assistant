$Z=Y/X$ may be meaningful for individual users as their individual average volume per upload, but $\text{Mean}(Y/X)$ does not look meaningful in aggregate as some users use the system more than others. If you took a weighted mean of $Z=Y/X$ to account for this, the natural weights would be the numbers of uploads $X$ and the resulting weighted mean would turn out to be $$\text{Weighted Mean}(Z)=\text{Sum}(X \times Y/X)/ \text{Sum}(X)=\text{Sum}(Y)/ \text{Sum}(X) \\ =\text{Mean}(Y)/ \text{Mean}(X)$$ which would also be the aggregate average volume per upload across the system. Your concerns are justified: It would probably be better to use the latter option.
