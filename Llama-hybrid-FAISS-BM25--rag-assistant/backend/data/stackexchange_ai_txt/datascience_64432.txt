Yes. one-class SVM is actually designed for your problem. The question it answers is "how similar a new sample point (unlabeled tweet) is to my training data (hash-tagged tweets)?" Regardless of what is a good answer to this question, I can share my brainstorming. Try to find the answer of "How can I model my data in a way that activism tweets stick together and separated from other tweets?". A way would be to find some Activism-specific dictionary and using that dictionary for modeling dataset with TF-IDF. To do that, you can use non-activism text (just find a corpus of text about mathematics!) and subtract the set of its vocabulary from your activism vocabulary. Remaining can give you a good idea about activism "key-words". Please not that if the activism topic is something in the concept and not much about keywords, then you need more sophisticated language models e.g. BERT . In that case use your activism tweets as positive examples and create negative samples (e.g. from that Math corpus) and use Sequence Classification . I just realized that in (2) I answered actually (3)! Hope it helps!
