What Dimensionality reduction should I choose?

I have dataset with 38k obsevations and 12 variables (11 binary and 1 numeric). I am interested in exploring different clustering techniques but before that which dimensionality reduction technique should be more appropriate for visualization? PCA? t-SNE? Any others? Thank you
