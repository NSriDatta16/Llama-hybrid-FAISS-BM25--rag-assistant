I'm not aware of any specific implementation in Python that handles categorical data as you are asking. DecisionTreeClassifier of sklearn does not handle categorical data as the documentation says, and as this post discusses. Historically, Quinlan's ID3 is the most well-known algorithm that handles only categorical variables, which has been later extended by the same author into C4.5 to handle both numerical and categorical variables; the latter holds also for CART developed by Breiman et. al. If you are willing to try different frameworks and/or programming languages, you can explore the J48 implementation of WEKA in Java (Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis Machine Learning) or DecisionTree.jl in Julia; in the latter case, I suggest you read this issue which is essentially your doubt. I hope that this gives you some hope in solving your problem as both codes are open-sourced and can be inspected, if necessary.
