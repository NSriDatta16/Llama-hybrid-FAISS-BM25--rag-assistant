If you drag a control from the toolbox to somewhere within the design canvas but not onto your form, the toolbox will remain visible despite auto-hide being enabled. Notice the mouse cursor will have the "NO" symbol (circle with a line through it) while over the canvas area. Once you successfully place the control onto the form somewhere, the toolbox will auto-hide.
