Using OpenID to prove Stackoverflow membership

Here's the deal: - Flair pretty much demands a Facebook app -I'm working on learning the Facebook platform Therefore, I've written a dinky little Facebook app to embed your Flair into a box on the side of your profile. If you're interested and on Facebook ; beware that this is very much a work in progress, prone to change and has a whole bunch of rough edges. However, I don't have an elegant way to say "this is MY Stackoverflow profile" from this dinky app. My current solution is best demonstrated this image . It is, frankly, idiotic; and there's nothing preventing impersonation. Having no experience with OpenID, I'm wondering if there's some way (and some example of this way, please) to get a user to provide their Stackoverflow identify to a third party? Behavior changed to that suggested by Noldorin's answer. Request for a saner way to do this declined on UserVoice .
