Comparing logistic regression coefficients across models?

I've developed a logit model to be applied to six different sets of cross-sectional data. What I'm trying to uncover is whether there are changes in the substantive effect of a given independent variable (IV) on the dependent variable (DV) controlling for other explanations at different times and across time. My questions are: How do I assess increased / decreased size in the association between the IV and DV? Can I simply look at the different magnitudes (sizes) of the coefficients across the models or do I need to go through some other process? If I need to do something else, what is it and can it be done/how do I do it in SPSS? Also, within a single model, Can I compare the relative size of independent variables based on unstandardised scores if all are coded 0-1 or do I need to convert them to standardised scores? Are there problems involved with standardised scores?
