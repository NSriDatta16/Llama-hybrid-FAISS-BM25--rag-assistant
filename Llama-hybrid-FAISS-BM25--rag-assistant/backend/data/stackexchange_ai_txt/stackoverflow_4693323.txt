In case your "N" is intended for display and not for computation, you can drag ouround the fact that there is no such "a" in a None until display: val solution = // this is an Option[String], inferred hashmap.get("a"). // if None the map is not done map(_.split(" | ").last) // returns an Option, perhaps None Which can alse be written: val solution = // this is an Option[String], inferred for(x And finally: println(solution.getOrElse("N"))
