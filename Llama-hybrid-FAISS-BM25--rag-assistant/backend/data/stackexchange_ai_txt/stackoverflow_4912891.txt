UIView bottom not showing

I'm doing a navigation based app. My rootview is a UITableView and from that I'm navigation to a UIView. For some reason the height of the UIView seems bigger than it should, meaning that the bottom of the view is not showing. I did a really simple test using a UITextView with a button at the bottom, and only the top half of the button shows in the view when i run it in Simulator even though the height is set to 460. Here's the code I use to navigate: TestViewController *t = [[TestViewController alloc] initWithNibName:nil bundle:nil]; [self.navigationController pushViewController:t animated:YES]; In my test the .xib is just made in IB dragging a textview and a button to the UIView. I don't have the same issue when I'm navigating to another UITableView. What am I missing?
