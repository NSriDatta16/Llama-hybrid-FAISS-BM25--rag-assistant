The method you selected from the page you cite is incorrect, or at least not standard, as the author of that answer explains below the code that you used. It applies the varimax rotation to the original eigenvectors from the PCA, which is not standard practice. For this type of analysis, "Loadings are eigenvectors scaled by the square roots of the respective eigenvalues," as explained on that page in the answer from @amoeba , while your prc$rotation values are unscaled eigenvectors. Of the 3 correct methods shown in that answer, the one perhaps closest to your code (using the first 4 principal components) might be translated to: rawLoadings $rotation[,1:4] %*% diag(prc$ sdev, 4, 4) # scaling rotatedLoadings To avoid errors, you should consider using packages that have been vetted to provide correct results, like the R psych package . That's also illustrated in the answer from @ameoba .
