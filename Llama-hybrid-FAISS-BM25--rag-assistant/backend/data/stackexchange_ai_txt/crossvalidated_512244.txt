Finding Cosine similarity threshold (cut-off point) with Logistic Regression

I want to preprocess my data sets, removing similar articles. To do this, I'll perform cosine similarity, I don't know the best threshold (cut-off point) of my data set. I Found in this paper , there's no exact value of threshold because threshold values is depending of our data sets. So I found this notebook code in that paper the way to get threshold. This examples use manually labeled 1000 pairs of similar and unsimilar data sets and making Logistic Regression model to find the cut-off cosine similarity(CSS) on 0.5 probability with variable: x = cosine similarity values from pair of 2 sentences y = "1" or "0" ("similar" or "unsimilar") So, I try to perform it to my manually labeled data sets (I prepare just about 50 pairs similar and unsimilar manually labeled data) weighted by TF-IDF. Then I just wanna have fun to removing and adding my pairs data train sets.. but I got diverse threshold value. Then I tried to adding my labeled data to 250 pairs on each, but I found the threshold values is getting smaller, and I will losing a lot of data that are not actually similar, but are considered similar. Why I got the inconsistency threshold values? Thank you for your kind help.
