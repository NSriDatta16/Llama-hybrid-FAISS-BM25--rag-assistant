One fundamental issue here is that small changes to the model can and will cause hard flips in predicted classes. If you compare predicted class membership probabilities to some threshold, then one prediction might be just below that threshold, and the next one just above it - so while the predicted probability of belonging to a particular class has moved only barely, the hard classification will flip to a different class. I would therefore strongly recommend that you move to probabilistic classifications and separate the decision aspect out. See Reduce Classification Probability Threshold . Now, at any time $t$ , you have a prediction $p_{tk}$ for the probability of the object to belong to class $k$ . The predictions should sum to 1 at any point, but that is not really overly important here. One simple way to assess the "persistence" of probabilistic predictions would be to fit an autoregressive model to the $(p_{tk})_t$ series for each $k$ , specifically one of order 1, an AR(1) model, possibly with an intercept. Then check the AR coefficient. If this is close to 1, your predictions at time $t$ are close to those at $t-1$ , and your series is more persistent than if it was farther away from 1. This even allows you to look at the persistence of predictions for "secondary" classes. Maybe your model stays quite certain that your object is a dog, but the secondary probabilities that it might be a cat or a spaceship may be jumping all over the place. This may be helpful. ARIMA models in general assume unbounded space, whereas your spaces are bounded within [0,1]. You could first transform your probabilities to the entire real line and see how this changes matters. Also, since your predictions sum to 1, they are actually a time series on a simplex. I am not aware of any specific work on ARIMA modeling on the simplex, except for some people doing compositional time series forecasting, but forecasting is not what you are trying to do.
