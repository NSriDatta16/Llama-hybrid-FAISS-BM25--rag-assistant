How bad does MAR have to get to be inevitably of concern?

The textbook literature says that multiple imputation is valid if data is MCAR or MAR. MAR means that the probability of missingness is dependent of observed information, but not unobserved information. If i consider the variables the missingness depends on, my imputations are valid and unbiased ([2] p.8). A widely used test for MCAR vs. MAR is running logistic regression and identification of significant predictors 1 . Problem: The larger the number of observations, the higher the probability that parameters become significant as standard errors decrease with larger n. What bothers me is, how small or large does a MAR-Variable-Coefficient have to be to really make a difference in the imputation model? Here is an example. Same influence of V4 and V5, different n. rm(list=ls()) tdf $mis V2 + 5*dat $V3 + 1*dat$ V4 + .5*dat $V5 range01 mis $mis) dat$ e $V1[dat$ mis > .5 & dat$e] $ismi V1)) mod If i would leave V4 and V5 out at a nobs of 1000 (p > .05), would it make my imputations invalid, as formally V4 and V5 are not independent if missingness? As the influence is small, i would guess not. Van Buuren says in [2] p.168 that In addition, include the variables that are related to the nonresponse. Factors that are known to have influenced the occurrence of missing data (stratification, reasons for nonresponse) are to be included on substan- tive grounds. Other variables of interest are those for which the distri- butions differ between the response and nonresponse groups. These can be found by inspecting their correlations with the response indicator of the variable to be imputed. If the magnitude of this correlation exceeds a certain level, then the variable should be included. This "certain threshold" is to be determined by the analyst, i guess? Lets say i have some hypotheses about the missingness mechanism, and the variables i assume show a really low but significant influence, while i have variables with high significant influence with no theoretical explanation. Would it be okay then to leave out my theoretically "important" variables as they are numerically not that important and fall under my defined threshold?
