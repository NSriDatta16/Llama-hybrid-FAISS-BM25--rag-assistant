Profile doesn't match application identifier

I have just created a AdHoc distribution provisioning profile for the app id 49776ZQRBG.com.gfeed.ride I have the Bundle ID in the info.plist set to this, yet this provisining profile in the project settings is greyed out and states "profile doesn't match application identifier '49776ZQRBG.com.gfeed.ride'" If I look at the profile in the organizer within XCode it gives me the same App Identifier as whats in my plist. Is there something else I am missing? Is the application identifier different to the bundle identifier?
