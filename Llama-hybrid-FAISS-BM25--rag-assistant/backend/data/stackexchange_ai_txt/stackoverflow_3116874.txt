This is how I organise my component files within my svn. Assume that my component name is comname. repository/components/comname/trunk/ comname comname_admin com_comname.xml com_comname-1.0.zip license.txt comname_userguide.doc comname_userguide.pdf All your front end code should be in comname folder while all your admin code should be in comname_admin. This is the standard way in which to layout a Joomla component structure. You can then tag your versions and keep them in repository/components/comname/tags/1.0 for example. Hope that helps. Cheers
