Optimal way to generate list of PHP object properties with delimiter character, implode()?

I am trying to find out if there is a more optimal way for creating a list of an object's sub object's properties. (Apologies for the crude wording, I am not really much of an OO expert) I have an object "event" that has a collection of "artists", each artist having an "artist_name". On my HTML output, I want a plain list of artist names delimited by a comma. PHP's implode() seems to be the best way to create a comma delimited list of values. I am currently iterating through the object and push values in a temporary array "artistlist" so I can use implode(). That is the shortest I could come up with. Is there a way to do this more elegant? $artistlist = array(); foreach ($event->artists as $artist) { $artistlist[] = $artist->artist_name; } echo implode(', ', $artistlist);
