Scheme is a functional programming language. It is designed to provide a mathematically well-founded language based on lambda calculus (with eager evaluation). It follows a minimalist design philosophy specifying a small standard core with powerful tools for language extension. Its compactness and elegance have made it popular with educators, language designers, programmers, implementors, and hobbyists. The Scheme language belongs to the lisp Family. Since Scheme uses a single namespace for naming functions and other values, it is called a lisp-1. Over the years, attempts at standardizing Scheme have been made including the R5RS standard, the somewhat controversial R6RS , and the most recent standard R7RS which is attempting to split the language into small and large (ongoing) standards.
