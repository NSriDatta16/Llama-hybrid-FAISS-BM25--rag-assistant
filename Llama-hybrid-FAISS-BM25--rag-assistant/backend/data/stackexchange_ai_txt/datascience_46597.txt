The most used loss function in tensorflow for a binary classification?

I am working on a binary classification problem using CNN model, the model designed using tensorflow framework, in most GitHub projects that I saw, they use "softmax cross entropy with logits" v1 and v2 as loss function, my questions are: 1- Why this loss method is the most used one? 2- What is the type of this function because of the name I am confused about its type. 3- What is the equation for the function? in tensorflow website, the equation is not available.
