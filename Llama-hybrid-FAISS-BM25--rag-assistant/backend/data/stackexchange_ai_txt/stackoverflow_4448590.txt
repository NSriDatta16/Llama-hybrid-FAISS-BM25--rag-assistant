Debugging Java Webstart: System Process is opening tons of ports

I'm trying to debug a Java Webstart application which is causing the System Process with pid 0 to open thousands of tcp ports between 1000 and ~4000. The remote host is always localhost port 80, on which an Apache webserver is listening. The state of all connections is TIME_WAIT and there is no traffic at all. After two days I have still no idea what's causing this behaviour since the application is running fine without using Java Webstart. This is my JNLP file generated by Netbeans: CWTicket tstegman CWTicket CWTicket Thank you very much for any hints! Edit: The operating system is Windows XP SP3.
