How to store bits to a huge char array for file input/output

I want to store lots of information to a block by bits, and save it into a file. To keep my file not so big, I want to use a small number of bits to save specified information instead of a int. For example, I want to store Day, Hour, Minute to a file. I only want 5 bit(day) + 5 bit(Hour) + 6 bit(Minute) = 16 bit of memory for data storage. I cannot find a efficient way to store it in a block to put in a file. There are some big problems in my concern: the data length I want to store each time is not constant. It depends on the incoming information. So I cannot use a structure to store it. there must not be any unused bit in my block, I searched for some topics that mentioned that if I store 30 bits in an int(4 byte variable), then the next 3 bit I save will automatically go into the next int. but I do not want it to happen!! I know I can use shift right, shift left to put a number to a char, and put the char into a block, but it is inefficient. I want a char array that I can continue putting specified bits into, and use write to put it into a file.
