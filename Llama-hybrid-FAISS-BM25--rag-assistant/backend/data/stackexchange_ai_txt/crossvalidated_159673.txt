repeated measures threeway linear mixed model

I'm new to using R, only started in the last 2 weeks so I apologize if I'm missing something very obvious. I am analyzing data from a repeated measures experiment with three factors, diversity (2 levels), temperature(2 levels) and par (3 levels), with ecosystem respiration as my variables. So far I've been successful in running a mixed model with the code lmermod.e I now need to do a pairwise comparison, I've tried ... summary(glht(ermod.e,linfct=mcp(div="Tukey"))) but get this error message... Error in summary(glht(ermod.e, linfct = mcp(div = "Tukey"))) : error in evaluating the argument 'object' in selecting a method for function 'summary': Error in mcp2matrix(model, linfct = linfct) : Variable(s) ‘div’ of class ‘integer’ is/are not contained as a factor in ‘model’. I am aware that wouldn't be appropriate to test the interactions I have. I have also tried the aov, with anovaer but I just get this Error in TukeyHSD.aov(anovaer) : no factors in the fitted model In addition: Warning messages: 1: In replications(paste("~", xx), data = mf) : non-factors ignored: div, tem 2: In replications(paste("~", xx), data = mf) : non-factors ignored: tem, par 3: In replications(paste("~", xx), data = mf) : non-factors ignored: div, par when I try lsmeans lsmeans(ermod.i, pairwise~tem*par*div, adjust="tukey") I get... Error in solve.default(L %*% V0 %*% t(L), L) : Lapack routine dgesv: system is exactly singular: U[1,1] = Any help would be much appreciated
