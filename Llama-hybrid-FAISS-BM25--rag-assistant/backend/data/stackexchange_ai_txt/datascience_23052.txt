I am trying to solve a similar problem. Does your dataset contain a mix of text and numerical features ? If so the complexity of detecting anomalies increases ( I don't know by what factor). If your dataset is uniform, for example containing only numeric values, you can potentially use a RNN which still needs a labelled dataset but it can detect time series like patterns ( since you mention comparison with pervious day's values for ex)
