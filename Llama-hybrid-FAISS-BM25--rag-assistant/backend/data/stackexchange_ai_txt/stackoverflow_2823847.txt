Javascript/iframe/embed/object question

OK, so here is my issue. I'm building a system which will allow people to embed lists of links on their pages. When the link is clicked, i'd like to use something like Lightview or Lightwindow to open it up over the whole window, not just in the iframe. I don't have access to the page that the user will be embedding this object into. Everything I've tried so far tells me that I can't open anything over the parent window, since I don't have access to it from the iframe or object, javacript security issue. However, I've seen sites that do that kind of overlay. so it must be possible. If anyone can point me to any resources that could help, that would be great. if it matters, i'm using Ruby on Rails... Thanks...chris
