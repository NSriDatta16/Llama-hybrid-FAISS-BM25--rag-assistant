Well I was utterly unable to find a XPS Document Viewer example or whatnot, but I was able to come up with this working sample . It doesn't use the overlay idea, but it's a pdf that you can resize... edit the thing that made this work without the overlay was the wmode param being set to transparent . I'm not really familiar with the details but it made it play nice on IE7. Also works on Firefox, Chrome, Safari and Opera. new edit having serious trouble getting it to work with frames. Some information I've found is not very encouraging. Is it impossible to have it with an ? Or an inside the iframe?
