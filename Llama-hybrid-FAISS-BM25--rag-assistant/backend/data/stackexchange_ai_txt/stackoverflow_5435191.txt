Word 2003 vs. 2007/2010 Automation

I'm automating Word in a VB6 application and I'm getting an exception when the host machine is using Word 2007 or 2010 but not on a machine running Word 2003. The exception is Runtime error '4605': "This method or property is not available because the object refers >to the end of a table row." The exception is thrown on the seventh iteration of the following loop, on the line which attempts to insert a page break: For num = 1 To breakArrCount Set myRange = oworddoc.Paragraphs(breakArr(num)).Range With myRange On Error Resume Next .Collapse Direction:=wdCollapseEnd .InsertBreak Type:=wdPageBreak End With Next The array, breakArr, stores the indexes of the paragraphs in the document which are to be followed by a page break. Interestingly enough, if I break out of the loop prior to the exception (i.e. after the 6th iteration) and view the generated document, I notice that the page breaks (for the first 6 pages) are inserted in different points in Word 2007/2010 than in 2003. Why would there be a difference? Does anybody know what I should be doing differently? Thanks.
