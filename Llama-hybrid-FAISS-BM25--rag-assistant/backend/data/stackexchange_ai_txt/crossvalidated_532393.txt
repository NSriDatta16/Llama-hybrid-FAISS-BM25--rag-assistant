What is the state of the art for analyzing a mediated moderation in a multilevel logistic regression context?

I had participants in two groups respond to a series of dichotomous decisions. I investigated the interaction between group (level 2) and a level 1 predictor X on the criterion Y. I could confirm this cross-level interaction in my first study. Now, I have the hypothesis that the two groups differ in the effect X has on Y because the groups differ in the level 2 predictor M. Therefore, I am interested in analyzing whether the interaction group:X on Y is mediated by the variable M. I have read that mediated moderation might be the term for what I am trying to do, however I did not find any examples of this for a cross-level interaction and with a binary outcome. I also read that using multilevel SEM might be a good way to do this analysis. What is the best way to test this hypothesis? I ran the multilevel logistic regression with glmer and I would prefer a solution that I can perform using glmer. Suppose I'd have to use a multilevel SEM, how would I have to setup my model in lavaan to run this analysis? What group size (level 2) and overall sample size (level 1) would I need for such an analysis?
