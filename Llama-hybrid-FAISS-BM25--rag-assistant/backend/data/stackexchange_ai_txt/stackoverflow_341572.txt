There are a good number of modules in CPAN for finding this information, the most likely candidates look to be Module::Find, Module::Which, and Module::Locate. I'd probably go with Module::Locate: use strict; use warnings; use Module::Locate qw/locate/; my $to_find = "Some::Module"; print "Perl would use: ", scalar locate($to_find), "\n"; In list context locate returns all found copies of Some::Module in order based on @INC. Edit: derobert suggests a much better way , I didn't realize %INC already had it... This module based solution would still be useful if you wanted to know before loading the module where it was going to be loaded from.
