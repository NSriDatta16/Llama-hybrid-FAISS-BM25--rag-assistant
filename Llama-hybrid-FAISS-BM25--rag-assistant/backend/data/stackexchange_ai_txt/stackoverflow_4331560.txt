How to use an IBOutlet from parent class?

I'm working on an iOS and having some trouble accessing to an IBOutlet from a parent class, in this case a label with the life of the character. My ViewController (parent) are like this: @interface OpponentViewController : UIViewController { IBOutlet UILabel *opponent_life; IBOutlet OpponentView *opponentView; } @end The OpponentView (child) class is where the character (image) reside and where player do all touch interaction. When the player touch OpponentView the label should be refreshed. - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { } Thanks.
