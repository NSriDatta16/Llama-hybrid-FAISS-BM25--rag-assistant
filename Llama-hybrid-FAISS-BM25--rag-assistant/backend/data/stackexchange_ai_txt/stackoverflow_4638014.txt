Can you reuse a mysql result set in PHP?

I have a result set I pull from a large database: $result = mysql_query($sql); I loop through this recordset once to pull specific bits of data and get averages using while($row = mysql_fetch_array($result)) . Later in the page, I want to loop through this same recordset again and output everything - but because I used the recordset earlier, my second loop returns nothing. I finally hacked around this by looping through a second identical recordset ( $result2 = mysql_query($sql); ), but I hate to make the same SQL call twice. Any way I can loop through the same dataset multiple times?
