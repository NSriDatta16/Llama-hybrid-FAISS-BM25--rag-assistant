Different data has very different characteristics. Depending on these characeristics, different algorithms and approaches may be beneficial. I would not be surprised if one-item-transactions are often removed in preprocessing for performance reasons. There is no way you get a meaningful association rule out of them. A different characteristic to pay attention to is the granularity. Consider a supermarket: association rules found on the item category level ("beer", "beverage" etc.) are more likely to be meaningful and statistically sound than on the individual item barcode level (single 0.3 can of brand A light beer). Just use whichever support threshold you consider meaningful for you application; just make sure to not get millions of results. On many other data sets, a minimum spport of 0.1% would cause exessive results, likely to run into out-of-memory.
