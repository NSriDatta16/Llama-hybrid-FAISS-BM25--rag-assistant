Your problem is that instead of doing a delta translation, you just set the translation. That works when it just comes to panning, however, when you scale, you don't store the translation due to the scale, and it is erased on the next translation action. So what I would do, instead of setting the translation is I would increment it. So when you drag the mouse, get a delta from 2 gluUnProject calls, then add that delta to the matrix translation values. That will prevent it from erasing the slight translation created by the scale around point action. So: public void pan(Vector3f delta_pan) { root.markAsDirty(); matrix.m03 += delta_pan.x; matrix.m13 += delta_pan.y; matirx.m23 += delta_pan.z; }
