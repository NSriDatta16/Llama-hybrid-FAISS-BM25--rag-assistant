Can it Work to Run PCA only on a Subset of Highly Correlated Predictors prior to Regularization? (Cox)

I'm running Cox-LASSO (using glmnet as explained by Tay et al ) on about 50 variables with about 300 observations. The variables fit into different categories like "clinical scales" or "risk measures". One category of variables is highly correlated to each other and only each other. It's about 12 of them. My thinking is: these are in a similar category, so if I run PCA on them only, the loss of interpretability wouldn't be so bad. I would like to do PCA on that subset, and then run LASSO on a set of variables that is the 1-2 principal components, plus the other predictors as-is... is this a bad idea?
