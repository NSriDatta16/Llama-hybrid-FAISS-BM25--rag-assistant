You could use alternate data streams to store the old revisions of your file. There is no built-in support in the .NET framework, but there exist some helper classes and articles like here and here . I have never used this myself, so I can't really tell if this is a good option. But it seems, it would make an elegant solution, since you could store each file version in a separate data stream and only the current version in the "main file". In any case, it will probably only work on NTFS drives.
