With a parametric survival model, you have the advantage of a closed-form expression for the survival probability as a function of time. With a continuous distribution like the Weibull, the survival function is simply $1-F(t)$ , where $F(t)$ is the cumulative distribution function. For the Weibull in the standard parameterization : $$F(t;k,\lambda) = 1- \mathrm{e}^{-(t/\lambda)^k}$$ so the survival function is: $$ S(t;k,\lambda) = \mathrm{e}^{-(t/\lambda)^k}.$$ Once you've established the parameter values from your model, you plug in the value of time $t$ and get your point estimate of survival up to that time. Unfortunately, there are several parameterizations of the Weibull, so you have to pay attention to which parameterization your software is using . To get a nice plot of survival over time with confidence intervals, the last example on the manual page for predict.survreg shows how to proceed. The trick is to use the "quantile" type of prediction while specifying a large range of quantiles (e.g., 1st to 98th; the 100th is at infinite time) and plot each survival percentage along the vertical axis against its corresponding predicted time, plus/minus confidence intervals.
