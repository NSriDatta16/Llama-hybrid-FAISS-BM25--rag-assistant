While you could detect a mobile browser through it's user agent the browser war on the PC platform has shown that sniffing user agents isn't really such a good thing to do. What ideally should be done is that specific styles should be applied based on media type or that a different answer should be sent based on a header other than the user agent - such as the Accept-header which tells which kind of content that the browser prefers. Right now it might be enough to code a site that works with the iPhone and with Opera through browser sniffing - but Googles Android is coming any minute now and there are many other mobile phones that will have browser functionality close to the iPhone's in the near future and it would be a waste to develop a mobile website that didn't support those devices as good as possibel from scratch.
