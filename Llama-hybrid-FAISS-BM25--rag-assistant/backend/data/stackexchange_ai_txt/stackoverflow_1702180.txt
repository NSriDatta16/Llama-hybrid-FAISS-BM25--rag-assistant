How do you keep your backing fields organized? (Styles/Patterns)

c# 3.0 offers us getters and setters with compiler generated backing fields - this is really great, but there are plenty of times that you still need to use a backing field. In a perfect world (opinion), you would be able to do something like class MyClass { ... stuff ... public string MyProperty { private string _myBackingField = "Foo"; get { return _myBackingField; } set { _myBackingField = value; } } } instead of class MyClass { private string _myBackingField = "Foo"; ... stuff ... public string MyProperty { get { return _myBackingField; } set { _myBackingField = value; } } } Does anyone have suggestions or techniques which come close to this? Or to put it another way - what is the clearest way to keep your backing fields and properties organized.
