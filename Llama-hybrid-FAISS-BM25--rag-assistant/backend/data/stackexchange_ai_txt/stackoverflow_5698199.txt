Koala rocks my world! Assuming you have asked for write permission to their wall (first read this: http://developers.facebook.com/docs/authentication/ [pay attention to the 'scope' parameter] refer to this for the permissions: http://developers.facebook.com/docs/authentication/permissions/ [you'll need to ask for publish_stream permisson], then read https://github.com/arsduo/koala/wiki/OAuth ), and have a valid oauth token, its as simple as: @graph.put_wall_post("hey, i'm learning koala") https://github.com/arsduo/koala/wiki/Graph-API Also, read https://github.com/arsduo/koala/wiki/Koala-on-Rails for Koala on ROR. See the oauth examples at:http://oauth.twoalex.com/ (Source code: https://github.com/arsduo/oauth_playground )
