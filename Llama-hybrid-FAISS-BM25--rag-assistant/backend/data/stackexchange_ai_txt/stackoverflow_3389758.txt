The UML Distilled book, which is a summary of the Booch/Rumbaugh/Jacobson book , says to use UML Activity Diagrams to model parallel tasks. At the end of Chapter 9: Activity Diagrams, the summary says: The great strength of activity diagrams lies in the fact that they support and encourage parallel behavior. This makes them a great tool for workflow modeling and, in principle, for multithreaded programming.
