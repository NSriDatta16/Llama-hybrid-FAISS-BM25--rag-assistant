mean(abs(return)) is not the mean of observed standard deviations, it is the mean of absolute returns. Daily standard deviations are not observable given only daily returns data. Try sd(return) for empirical standard deviation of returns. But even this is not quite what you need. Your GARCH model assumes the mean is equal to zero. Then you should also use the same assumption when calculating the standard deviation for direct comparability. Use sqrt(mean(return^2)) instead of sd(return) . But this is not quite what you need either.* What you may reasonably expect given a decent GARCH model is that the average fitted conditional variance from the GARCH model, mean(fitted^2) will match the variance of the data calculated using the assumption of zero mean, mean(return^2) . This is the comparison to make. *Note that if the GARCH model provides an unbiased fit of conditional variances, it need not provide an unbiased fit of conditional standard deviation (just as sample variance being an unbiased estimator of variance does not imply its square root is an unbiased estimator of standard deviation).
