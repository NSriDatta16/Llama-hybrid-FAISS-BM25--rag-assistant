The Multi-Layer Perceptron does not have an intrinsic feature importance, such as Decision Trees and Random Forests do. Neural Networks rely on complex co-adaptations of weights during the training phase instead of measuring and comparing quality of splits. A simpler approach for getting feature importance within Scikit can be easily achieved with the Perceptron , which is a 1-layer-only Neural Network. from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer from sklearn.linear_model import Perceptron X, y = load_breast_cancer(return_X_y=True) clf = Perceptron(tol=1e-3, random_state=0) clf.fit(X, y) coeffs = clf.coef_ The coefficients will return an array for binary classification or a matrix [n_classes, n_features] for a multi-class classification.
