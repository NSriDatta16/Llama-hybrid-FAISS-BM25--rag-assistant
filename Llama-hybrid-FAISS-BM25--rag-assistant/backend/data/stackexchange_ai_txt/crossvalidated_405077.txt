Tweak Model or Process to Focus More on Category Values for Regression

I have built a machine learning model using Catboost and I noticed something as I examine the results. When I am looking at the results there is a big fluctuation in the errors between my test set and the prediction for certain values in a category I have. I call this 'Category1'. Here's what I see: Category1 value is 1, the error is off by 10%. There's about 100 rows. Category1 value is 2, the error is off by 5%. There's about 150 rows. Cateogry1 value is 3, the error is off by 40%. There's about 120 rows. If I just did a simple average instead of a Catboost prediction for Category1 when the value is 3, the error would be much lower. Is there a way to emphasize this Category1 feature more instead of the other features I have? There's 10 other features in my data. What I believe is happening is it is putting more of an importance on other features before Category1. I don't have to stick to Catboost if there a way to do this outside of this model.
