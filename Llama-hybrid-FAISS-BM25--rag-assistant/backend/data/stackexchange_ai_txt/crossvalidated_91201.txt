Different group size average comparisons

I have 3800 stocks for which I calculate their return correlations. So I end up with a 3800 by 3800 matrix. Each stocks is related in some way to all the other 3799 stocks. For each stock, I create seven groups out of 3799 stocks based on their relatedness. So say for stock A, group 1 (closest in relatedness - based on a pre-specified knowledge based linkage of like-industries) will have 60 stocks, group 2 will have 300 stocks, and group 3 700 stocks and so on up to seven groups. I then average for each group their correlations with stock A. I want to see if there is a decay in the correlation when we move from group 1 to group 7 . But the group size varies... can this be a serious issue? I then take an average across all group s for each stock and see if the decay holds cross-sectionally? Now the issue is that for each stock, say stock A and stock B the size of each group is different. There may be 60 stocks in group 1 for stock A while there is 40 in group 1 for stock B . How problematic can this be?
