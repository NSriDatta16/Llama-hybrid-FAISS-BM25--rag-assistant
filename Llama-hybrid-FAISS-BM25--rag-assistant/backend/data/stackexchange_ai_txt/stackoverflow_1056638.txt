"Cancel" means to give up on an action before it begins . If the action has already started, the command should be named "Stop" instead. That makes it clear to the user that the button might interrupt something in mid-stream. A real Cancel action doesn't need confirmation because it doesn't cause any problems. A Stop action might, but only if stopping partway through could leave things in a messed-up state. (And in that case, you should consider finding a way to have the stop back out all the already-made changes so that the state reverts back to what it was before the action began. This isn't always possible, of course, like if you're deleting files.)
