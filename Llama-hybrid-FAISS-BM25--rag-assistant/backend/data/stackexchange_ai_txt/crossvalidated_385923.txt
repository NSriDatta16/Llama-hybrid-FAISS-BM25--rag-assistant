Compute posterior expected loss for choosing B over A

The bayesAB package in r computes the posterior expected loss for choosing B over A when running the following commands: library(bayesAB) test This is the r code behind this function which can be found here : # Expected loss from switching from B to A getPostError A_samples loss Shouldn't the Bayesian expected loss be computed by multiplying the posterior probability of each variant with an assigned risk as mentioned in this video? Can someone explain the logic behind using the last line coalesce(mean(BoverA) * mean(loss[BoverA])) ? Is this the squared loss?
