GEE Logistic Model with Subject Specific Predictions?

I have fit a marginal logistic model or GEE Logistic Regression model using SAS' proc genmod to obtain estimated parameters associated with mortality (death). Using SAS, I am able to obtain subject-level predictions, $\hat{p}$. However, as I understand it, marginal models are population average models, so does it make sense to obtain these subject-level predictions? I was thinking about taking these $\hat{p}$'s and making prediction of death based on a cut-point and then performing a cross-validation with the actual known values of death as a means to validate my model. Does it make sense to do this with individual level predictions with GEE?
