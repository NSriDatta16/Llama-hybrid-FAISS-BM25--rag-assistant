Your appserver is likely using different classloaders for each module in your EAR, preventing one module from seeing resources in another. This is the default behaviour of JavaEE classloaders. You either need to reconfigure your appserver to use a "unified" classloader across the whole EAR (which is highly appserver-specific, but great if you can get it to work), or package everything into one module (e.g. your WAR could contain everything), or declare a formal manifest for the WAR module, allowing it to declare the its dependencies on the individual JAR modules, which should allow the WAR to see the resources in the JAR module.
