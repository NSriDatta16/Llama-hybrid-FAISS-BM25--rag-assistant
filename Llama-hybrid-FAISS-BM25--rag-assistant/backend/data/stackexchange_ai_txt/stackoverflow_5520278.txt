I've never purchased a cert from Comodo, but there are generally no limits on the numbers of items you're allowed to sign, only a limit on the amount of time (1 or more years, typically) for which the cert is valid. Update: From the Comodo Code-Signing FAQ : Is there a limit to the amount of applications allowed to be signed with a Code Signing Certificate? Comodo does not limit you to any specific number. You can sign as many applications with a Code Signing Certificate as you wish, provided that the applications are going to be used for and distributed by the Organization that owns the certificate.
