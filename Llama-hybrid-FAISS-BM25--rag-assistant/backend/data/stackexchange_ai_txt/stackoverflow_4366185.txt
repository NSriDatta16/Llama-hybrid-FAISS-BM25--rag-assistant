In Operator in Linq

I tried to use the suggestion provided here for using In operator in linq but, i am not able to convert my requirement into LINQ statement. Below is the SQL query which i need to convert to Linq select * from navigator_user_field_property where user_id = 'albert' and field_id in ( select field_id from navigator_entity_field_master where entity_id = 1 and use_type = 0) order by field_id I want this to be converted to a Efficient Linq. Most of the answers deal with the predetermined list of string array which is not working in my case. Thanks
