Geometric interpretation of generalized linear model

For linear model $y=x\beta+e$, we can have a nice geometric interpretation of estimated model via OLS: $\hat{y}=x\hat{\beta}+\hat{e}$. $\hat{y}$ is the projection of y onto the space spanned by x and residual $\hat{e}$ is perpendicular to this space spanned by x. Now, my question is: is there any geometric interpretation of generalized linear model (logistic regression, Poission, survival)? I am very curious about how to interpret the estimated binary logistic regression model $\hat{p} = \textrm{logistic}(x\hat{\beta})$ geometrically, in a similar way as linear model. It even does not have an error term. I found one talk about geometric Interpretation for Generalized Linear Models. http://statweb.stanford.edu/~lpekelis/talks/13_obs_studies.html#(7) . Unfortunately, the figures are not available and it is quite hard to picture. Any help, referencing, and suggestion will be greatly appreciated!!!
