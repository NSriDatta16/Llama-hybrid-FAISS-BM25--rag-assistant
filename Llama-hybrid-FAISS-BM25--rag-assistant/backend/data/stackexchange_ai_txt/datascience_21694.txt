Indeed tree_method is a parameter for Tree Booster. There are 4 choices, namely, auto , exact , approx and hist . The default is set to auto which heuristically chooses a faster algorithm based on the size of your dataset. Approximate algorithm ( approx ) is chosen in your case since your dataset is huge. To change the tree construction algorithm, you have to pass tree_method in the train function as follows: import xgboost as xgb ... parameters = {'tree_method': 'exact'} #You can add other parameters as well model = xgb.train(parameters, x_train, num_round) #num_round is the number of rounds for boosting prediction = model.predict(x_test) ... I hope this helps.
