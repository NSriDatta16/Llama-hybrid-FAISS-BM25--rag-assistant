IANAL, but this indicates to me that you cannot use the loops in your application: ...however, individual audio loops may not be commercially or otherwise distributed on a standalone basis, nor may they be repackaged in whole or in part as audio samples, sound effects or music beds." So don't worry, you can make commercial music with GarageBand, you just can't distribute the loops as loops.
