When performing Markov chain Monte Carlo, you never know when and if the ergodic steady state is reached. Gelman-Rubin statistic is a test for reaching this state. An important assumption for the Gelman-Rubin statistic is overdispersion of the initial states. This is needed to guarantee that the between-chain variance approaches the variance of the posterior from above. Make sure that this assumption is satisfied.
