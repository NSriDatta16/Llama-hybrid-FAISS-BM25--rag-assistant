they are somewhat the same, and which way to go is ATM as good a guess either way, and for the record, there's one you missed, http://html5boilerplate.com/ This is sort of a repeat of some years ago when prototype and jQuery were fighting in the same space. I'd personally hazard that jQuery won but for now there's no telling which one of these will win this particular fight. I don't think I could recommend dean edwards ie7-js as it mostly deals with just getting IE7 to act like other more intelligent and likable browsers as opposed to leveraging the whole HTML5 thing as much as the other frameworks.
