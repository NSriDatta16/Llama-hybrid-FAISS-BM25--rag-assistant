Please let me know if I am on the right track to being an NLP Expert

I am a college student(rising senior) and became interested in Natural Language Processing last semester. I decided to focus on studying this area this summer and become skilled in this area. I wanted to get some advice for studying this particular subject. Right now, I am taking Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course on Coursera to get a sense of how Machine Learning works. After finishing this course, I am planning to take Standford's CS224n NLP course on Youtube and do its class activities. I am assuming AWS and Tenserflow is also important since they are included as topics of CS224n. I want to know if my summer plan sounds reasonable. If not, could you please give me an advice of how to make a better plan. If this sounds reasonable, it would be great if you can add more or specify which part is particularly important in these areas.
