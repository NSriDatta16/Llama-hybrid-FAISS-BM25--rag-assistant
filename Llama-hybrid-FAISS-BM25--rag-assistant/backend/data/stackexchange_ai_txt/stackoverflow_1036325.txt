How configure delete-selection-mode to only delete?

I am using GNU Emacs 22.3.1 on Windows. In my Emacs I have enabled delete-selection-mode , and it's very useful to select a region and delete or replace it. But I have a drawback. When I write or press DEL over the selection, Emacs does not only remove the text, but it kills (a.k.a. send to the clipboard*). This is very annoying for me, because I don't have control of my kill-ring (a.k.a. clipboard) and may cause unexpected effects. There is a way that delete-selection-mode does not kill the text, just delete it? Perhaps modify the source code ? (*: I have synchronized the kill-ring and the Windows clipboard, so for me (for practical purposes) it's the same) Edit[Jun 24, 2009] Thanks, danielpoe. Even with the idea of Trey Jackson the selection is still killing. And I found the reason. I discovered that the problem was not in delete-selection-mode . The problem is, when I selected the region, I did it with the mouse. And never have imagined that it was the mouse who was copying the text . Using the set-mark command and the arrow keys the text finally aren't killed, only deleted. I disabled this behavior writing this in my .emacs: (require 'delsel) (setq mouse-drag-copy-region nil) (global-unset-key (kbd " ")) (global-unset-key (kbd " ")) Thanks for the advice. If this method of disable this mouse behavior can cause conflicts with other options, please comment.
