FWIW, we have been using WatiN and MbUnit for web integration testing for the past 3 years. We have separated the tests into 3 projects: QA.Framework: Contains glue code for setting up test fixtures and various custom MbUnit and WatiN extension. QA.SiteMap: Contains Page and Control classes arranged hierarchically into namespaces that correspond to different domains and parts of the sites. This project serves to decouple tests from the major part of the web site structure. You can think of it as a model of the sites. QA.Tests: Contains the actual tests also arranged hierarchically into namespaces. Tests leverage the SiteMap and Framework as needed to interact with the web site. This way there is much less code duplication than if each test contained the same button ids over and over... Jeff.
