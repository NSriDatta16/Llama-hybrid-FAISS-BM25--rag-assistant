Embedding webpage in Flash

I know very little about Flash, and so is not programming in it. I have a website in PHP, and obviously, HTML, CSS, JS, etc. What I want to do is to allow users to full-screen certain pieces of the DOM. So my question is, is there any way to wrap flash around certain portions of the DOM dynamically in order to allow full screening of that portion. Edit: The current responses are very interesting and could be the only options. But in my ideal world there would be an embedded flash object, and inside that would be some sort of iframe or the flash equivalent so that the rendering is still handled by the browser and not flash itself.
