Every organization is different. If they are operating in this capacity then you should adapt and make the best of the situation. It's either happening because that's how things are done and they are aware of it, or they don't know the wiser or don't want to invest to improve the process of delivering strategic/tactical projects. In a perfect world everyone would have a robust Quality Methodology in place which would provide a framework for Project delivery and systems implementation. It's just not a reality. Here are some tips to help you operate more effectively: Identify your sponsors (the people who own the product) and determine the high level benefits and driving objectives of the business problem they seek to solve Identify your stakeholders (who has influence and who has interest) and get them to communicate their needs as much as possible Involve both sponsors and stakeholders in the process as much as possible or as much as they want Capture what requirements you can from them through written form (email) Provide opportunities for them to gain visibility into the delivery and to provide feedback
