Handling a multi-dimensional data structure in .Net 3.5 and above

I want to build a 2 dimensional (non ragged at this point) object array. I can easily build a 2 dimensional Array[,], and will do so if it is the best option available, but have tended to avoid arrays in favour of the advanced functionality of .NET's List and Dictionary structures. I could also use a List > to store a 2 dimensional array, but was wondering if there was any best-practice or implemented data structures in .NET 3.5 or above to handle Typed 2 - n dimensional structures with more flexible / comprehensive functionality than an array? I am not interested in SSAS/OLAP style answers.
