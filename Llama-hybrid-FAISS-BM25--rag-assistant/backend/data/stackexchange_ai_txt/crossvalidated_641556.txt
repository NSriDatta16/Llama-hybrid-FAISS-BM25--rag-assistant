Statistical error analysis of vector data

Reaching equilibrium in a Monte Carlo simulation often refers to a state where the system has evolved sufficiently such that its statistical properties no longer change significantly with additional sampling. This is particularly important in simulations used for statistical mechanics and thermodynamics, such as molecular dynamics or Metropolis Monte Carlo, where you want to obtain the average properties of the system at a given temperature or other thermodynamic conditions. # File: r_end_to_end_squared_scalar.dat # Description: Monte Carlo simulation data representing protein dynamics. #r-end-squared 15398.447852474459 15907.581694436145 15146.459803846192 13690.330559817616 14581.703711851666 14224.026089792113 14084.006450353565 13580.238453116126 13960.916991568824 14369.807625278698 13980.19145816181 14202.61497898913 ... To perform statistical error analysis (computing statistical errors for chunks of data taken from different parts of a simulation) on the scalar data, I followed these steps: Collect Data: Run your Monte Carlo simulation and collect the data of the observable(s) of interest at each step. Divide Data into Chunks: Split your data into several equal-sized chunks. The size of each chunk should be large enough to be representative of the simulation but small enough to allow for multiple chunks to be compared. Compute Mean and Standard Error for Each Chunk: For each chunk, calculate the mean and the standard error of the mean (SEM). The SEM is the standard deviation (SD) of the sample divided by the square root of the number of observations in the chunk. Compare Across Chunks: Analyze the means and SEMs across the chunks. If the simulation has reached equilibrium, the means should be consistent with each other, and the SEMs should be of a similar magnitude. Now, I need to do the same in the case of vector data. # File: r_end_to_end_distance_vec3.dat # Description: Monte Carlo simulation data representing protein dynamics. # r_end-X r_end-Y r_end-Z 30.713 56.601 -106.073 31.413 58.011 -107.497 31.178 54.376 -105.913 28.199 49.573 -102.165 33.765 42.533 -107.854 33.714 45.822 -104.822 31.339 46.162 -104.742 32.223 43.949 -103.007 31.195 45.567 -104.458 26.245 44.850 -108.025 24.671 50.060 -104.238 28.268 46.925 -105.838 ... Suppose I want to perform statistical error analysis on this data to check if the simulation has reached equilibrium. What formula can I use to do that? N.B. I am using this formula to compute vector autocorrelation: $$C(t,{v}n) = \frac 1{n-t}\sum{i=0}^{n-1-t}\vec v_i\cdot\vec v_{i+t}$$
