I think you can borrow ideas from color quantization. For each photograph, calculate it's average color. Since it's small, that's how it will look when viewed from a distance. Then split your target image in photograph-sized rectangles and calculate their average colors. Or, for better results, properly downsize it so, that every photograph corresponds to one pixel in the target picture. Then, for every pixel of the target picture, choose the photograph which has the color value closest to the pixels color. (Closest - as in closest in the 3D RGB cube). You can also apply some dithering for it to look better (Floyd-Steinberg's algorithm is one of the best algorithms out there).
