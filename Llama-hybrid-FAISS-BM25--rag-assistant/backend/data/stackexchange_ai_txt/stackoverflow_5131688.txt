Simple OO design: where to put the Add responsibility?

My application domain has Users. It also has Organisations. Users can create Organisations. My question is On which controller should I put the CreateOrganisations method? Does it belong on the UserController? Or does it belong on the OrganisationController? And how do I make that decision? In any case, I plan to have an Add method on the Organisation model. Any thoughts?
