Rendering splash screen on the iPhone using Open GL ES

I want to render a splash screen on the iPhone whilst using an Open GL view. The iPhone screen as we know is 320x480, which is not a power of 2. Before I enter into the world of chopping the texture up and rendering sub parts, or embedding the screen on another texture page I was wondering if there was another way? Is it possible to overlay another view that I could render to using CoreGraphics functions? Or is it possible to render to a Open GL surface using Core Graphics functions. What would you recommend? Cheers Rich
