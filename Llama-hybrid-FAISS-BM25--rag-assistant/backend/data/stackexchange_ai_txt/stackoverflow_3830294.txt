ensuring dynamic image urls in a web-app: use a blob store?

I want to serve images in a web-app using sessions such that the links to the images expire once the session has expired. If I show the actual links to the filesystem store of the images, say http://www.mywebapp.com/images/foo1.jpg this clearly makes stopping future requests for the image (one the user has signed out of the session) difficult to stop. Which is why I was considering placing the images in a sqlite db, and serving them from there. It seems that using the db for image storage is considered bad practice (though apparently the GAE blob store seems to provide this functionality), so i was trying to figure out what the alternatives would be. 1) Perhaps I do somesort of url-re-writing like so: http://www.mywebapp.com/images/[session_id]/foo1.jpg Thinking of using nginx, but it seems (on a first look) that this will require some hackin to accomplish? 2) Copy the files to a physical directory on the filesystem and delete when the session expires. this seems quite messy though? Are there any standard methods of accomplishing this dynamic image url thing? I'm using web.py - if that helps. Many thanks!
