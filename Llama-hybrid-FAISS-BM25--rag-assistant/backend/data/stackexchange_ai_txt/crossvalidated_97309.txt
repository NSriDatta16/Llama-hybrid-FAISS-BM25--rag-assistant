As I explained in my comment on your other question, step uses AIC rather than p-values. However, for a single variable at a time, AIC does correspond to using a p-value of 0.15 (or to be more precise, 0.1573): Consider comparing two models, which differ by a single variable. Call the models $\cal{M}_0$ (smaller model) and $\cal{M}_1$ (larger model), and let their AIC's be $\text{AIC}_0$ and $\text{AIC}_1$ respectively. Using the AIC criterion, you'd use the larger model if $\text{AIC}_1 2$. But this is simply the statistic in a likelihood ratio test. From Wilks' theorem, we'll reject the null if the statistic exceeds the upper $\alpha$ quantile of a $\chi^2_1$. So if we use a hypothesis test to choose between the smaller model and the larger, we choose the larger model when $-2\log\cal{L_0}-(-2\log\cal{L_1})>C_\alpha$. Now $2$ lies at the 84.27 percentile of a $\chi^2_1$. Hence, if we choose the larger model when it has smaller AIC, this corresponds to rejecting the null hypothesis for a test of the additional term with a p-value of $1-0.843=0.157$, or $15.7\%$ So how do you modify it? Easy. Change the k parameter in step from 2 to something else. You want 10% instead? Make it 2.7: qchisq(0.10,1,lower.tail=FALSE) [1] 2.705543 You want 2.5%? Set k=5 : qchisq(0.025,1,lower.tail=FALSE) [1] 5.023886 and so on. However, even though that solves your question, I advise you to pay close attention to Frank Harrell's answer on your other question, and to search out responses from a great many statisticians on other questions relating to stepwise regression here, which advice tends to be very consistently to avoid stepwise procedures in general.
