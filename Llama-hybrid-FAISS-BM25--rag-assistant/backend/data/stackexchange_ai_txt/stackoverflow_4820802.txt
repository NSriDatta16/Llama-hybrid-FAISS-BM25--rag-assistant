That's one way of doing it: Make your flash component call a javascript function through ExternalInterface.call() . Make the called javascript function change a hidden field inside the form. When the form is posted, the hidden field will send the desired value to the server. I guess this is also the safest way - since the Flash component will not communicate with the server. Everything you need is a standard, non-AJAX form post. Edit Sorry, I guess I should have paid more attention... If there is too much data being sent from the flash component, maybe you should post it directly to the server. Still, you could use ExternalInterface to synchronize the whole process. Make Flash call a server-side method (I would use FluorineFX for that, but your opinion may vary). Then .NET will return an ID, meaning it has received and saved the binary data for future use. Then call ExternalInterface to set that ID to a hidden field. After that, when the HTML is posted to the server, the server-side action method just need to retrieve the binary data using the posted ID... The problem here is that you will end up with some binary data that will never be associated to any form post... But that's OK I guess, just run some "garbage-collector" script from time to time. About the authentication issue: FluorineFX does implement .NET authentication , and it is able to retrieve the current logged in user. Of course, there are some issues .
