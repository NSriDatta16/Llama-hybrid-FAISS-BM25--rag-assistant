Good question! I think the short answer is that the working independence linear model and the random effects model by design estimate different quantities, and in your example these quantities are not the same. In the simplest example... m = lm(y ~ 1, data = data) mixed_m = lmer(y ~ 1 + (1|id), data = data) $$ \begin{align} \text{m: }&y \sim Normal(\mu_y, \sigma_y); \\ \text{mixed_m: }&y_s \sim Normal(\mu_s, \sigma) \\ &\mu_s \sim Normal(\mu_p, \sigma_p); \end{align} $$ (s for subject, p for population) ...the simple linear model m estimates the average across all observations ( $\mu_y$ ), while the mixed model mixed_m estimates the average of each of the subject-level averages ( $\mu_p$ ). As you say, these aren't necessarily the same thing, but that's doesn't mean one model is "biased", it's just being used to answer the wrong question.
