I did some work once with the author of Terragen to incorporate some atmospheric rendering algorithms of his into a landscape rendering program I had written. I was most impressed that the code actually emulated the atmosphere - you fed in black as your base colour (because the sky is black out in space) and the light source colour (effectively white, a slight touch of yellow maybe), various values for atmosphere height, density and red/green/blue decay then kicked the whole thing off - whereby it produced a nice blue graduated sky and a glowing yellow sun - or if you positioned the sun correctly a nice red to dark blue sky and sunset. Actually it wasn't particularly complex - just some extremely well chosen mathematical equations emulating the behaviour of at most a dozen different parameters - but it was beautifully put together. I spent a lot of time thereafter playing with it - and eventually rewriting it completely for GLSL, but it certainly taught me a few things about how to approach a certain class of problem.
