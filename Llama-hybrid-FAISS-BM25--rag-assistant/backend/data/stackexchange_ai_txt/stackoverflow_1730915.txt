... how do you link them or are they automatically linked when you have identical names in different tables. This is not automatic, you have to add a foreign key constraint on the customer_id column of the order table. This can be done at the table creation time or using an ALTER statement. Check the documentation for the details. As others pointed out, note that both tables need to be InnoDB tables (foreign key constraints are not supported by the MyISAM storage engine that will ignore them). With or without a FK constraint, the query would be something like: SELECT * FROM CUSTOMER C, ORDER O WHERE C.ID = O.CUSTOMER_ID AND O.ID = ... A FK constraint would "just" guarantee that the CUSTOMER_ID column of the ORDER table cannot contain values that doesn't exist in the CUSTOMER table (except potentially NULL) and thus enforce referential integrity.
