I've had this problem recently and found a couple of things that help. First, try out a Naive Bayes model (package klaR) which sometimes gives you better results when the minority class in a classification problem is tiny. Also, if you do choose to stick with an SVM you might want to try oversampling the minority class. Essentially you'll want to include more examples of the minority class or synthetically create cases for the minority class This paper :http://www.it.iitb.ac.in/~kamlesh/Page/Reports/highlySkewed.pdf Has some discussion and examples of these techniques implemented in Weka, but implimenting them yourself in R is possible too.
