Http POST.. why doesn't print anything?

I'm writing a sniffer program with the pcap library that checks the http traffic. I succeed when I m looking for GET messages or status codes but I don't know why it doesn't work for the post requests. I tried to use wireshark and I saw that for POST requests, in addition to the http protocol there is also an Line-based text data: application/x-www-form-urlencoded "protocol". When I try to print the content of the payload I didn't get results or I get strange characters.. so I was thinking that maybe the problem is this "Line-based.." stuff.. Any idea of the possible cause?
