You can't do this with a plain SQL query - you need to have a defined set of tables that your query is based on. The fact that your current implementation queries from whatever table is named by tablename from the first result-set means that to get this all in one query, you will have to restructure your data. You have to know what tables you're querying from rather than having it dynamic. If the reason for these different tables is the different information stored in each requiring different record (column) structures, you might want to look into Key/Value pair storage in a large table. Once you combine the dynamically named ones into a single location you can integrate your two queries together.
