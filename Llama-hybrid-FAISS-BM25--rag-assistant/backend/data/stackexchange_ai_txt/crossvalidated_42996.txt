Depends what assumptions you're willing to make about the sizing of shoes. For instance, I think it's safe to assume the difference between a size 9 to 10 Redwings Iron Ranger is similar to the difference between a 10 and 11 Adidas Samba. If a 9 IR wears a 10 Samba, then we'd know a 10IR would wear an 11 Samba. It also depends on whether you have information on multiple shoes within individuals in which case you'd get more information with your repeated measures. Assuming you didn't, you can simple take the grand average of sizes within each shoe group and compare the average difference between groups under the assumption people don't own shoes that don't fit. If you did have multiple measurements, you can get a more precise recommendation by fitting a mixed effects model which will average over the individual effects and estimate a categorical individual difference between sizes in each shoe. $$ \mathbb{E}[ \mbox{Size} | \mbox{Brand}, \mbox{Individual}] = \beta_{0, i} + \beta_{1, b} * \mbox{Brand} $$ SPSS, R, SAS and statistical software can fit these, but not your plain vanilla Excel. It's worth noting that shoes in general run both wide and long, so you might consider asking a more refined question about how to recommend someone buy a pair of shoes based on fits which are purported to run long/wide.
