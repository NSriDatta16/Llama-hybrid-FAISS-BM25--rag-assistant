The best reason to follow a standard is to reduce fragmentation of the standard, which leads to instability. If everyone breaks the standard in exactly the same way and it's well thought-out, then that's not as much of a problem. Over time the standard will evolve to match what has become the common practice. Look at how modern HTML has moved on from SGML comment rules, tag minimisation, etc, and how is enough to trigger standards mode. These are all against the standards but are common practice, and now the new standards (HTML5) are even evolving to support these. If everyone breaks the standard in a different way, through general sloppiness or through wanting to invent their own 'hack', then the standard does not evolve, but it fragments. Browsers have a harder time supporting every different direction that people have gone in to hack something so that it looks right (or just through sloppy mistakes). They've done a good job so far of remaining backwards-compatible, but it's been at the cost of a huge increase in parser complexity. Sooner or later, however, less popular or more obscure hacks or errors stop being supported, because they were just stupid ideas to begin with (various CSS selector hacks come to mind) or they were just too far out of left-field (the element, and so on).
