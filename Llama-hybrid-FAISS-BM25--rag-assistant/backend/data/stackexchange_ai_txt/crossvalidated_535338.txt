how do I have a term for the co-occurrence of two variables in logistic regression?

lets say I code variables in data : sick : 0 or 1 for someone sick or not. cough : 0 or 1 for someone having a cough or not. fever : 0 or 1 for someone wearing a fever or or not. cough_fever : 0 or 1 for someone having both a cough and fever or not lets say I wanted to determine if having a cough, fever, or having both a cough and fever is most significantly associated with being sick. Would I set up my regression in R like this: glm(sick ~ cough + fever + cough_fever, data = data, family='binomial') or like this: glm(sick ~ cough + fever + cough*fever, data = data, family='binomial')
