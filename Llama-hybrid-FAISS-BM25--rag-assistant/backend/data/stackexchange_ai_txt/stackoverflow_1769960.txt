Although it took me a long time to prepare for the SCJP exam (because I was working during the day that time), I think 7 months is long enough and perhaps too long depending on your mad skills. The only resource I had that time was Sun Certified Programmer for Java 5 Study Guide by Kathy Sierra and Bert Bates. I think it was all the resource I needed. Although I have to admit that I had to read the chapters again and again and answered the quizzes and practice exam multiple times to make sure I got it in my head. As far as I know, questions such as "implement this and this" or "write a piece of code which does..." is for the SCJD exam, not SCJP. This is also mentioned in the book by Sierra and Bates, together with other information about the exam.
