When use a cache system with WordPress

(sorry if this is duplicated but I couldn't find anything related) I have an WordPress 3.0.3 instalation with some custom coding and tried the W3 Total Cache plugin but had some problems...so I've decided to deactivated it. And now I'm wondering that there are any average number of daily visits that becames necessary the use of a cache system. I'm not saying with this that I don't want to use a cache system, but only managing priorities. Thanks in advance!
