I'm not really sure what you want. But it sounds like you're trying to ensure that there is only one instance in memory for each number. If that's the case, what's wrong with something like this: static public class ObjectMapping { static Dictionary dictionary = new Dictionary (); static public object GetObjectForNumber(int x) { object o; if (!dictionary.ContainsKey(x)) { o = CreateObjectForNumberTheFirstTime(x); dictionary.Add(x, o); return o; } return dictionary[x]; } } Of course, I left out things such as thread safety and creation of the objects in the first access, for you to do on your own.
