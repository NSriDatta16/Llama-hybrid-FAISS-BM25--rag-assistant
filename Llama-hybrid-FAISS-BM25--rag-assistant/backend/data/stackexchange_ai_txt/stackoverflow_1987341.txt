preg_split commas not inside parenthesis

Test string: Organic whole wheat bread, Monterey Jack Cheese (milk, cheese culture, salt), Hormel Natural Ham (salt, turbinado sugar, lactic acid (not from milk) Desired output: Array ( [0] => Organic whole wheat bread [1] => Monterey Jack Cheese [2] => Hormel Natural Ham ) I don't mind if the sub-ingredients appear with the original item (i.e., "Monterey Jack Cheese (milk, cheese culture, salt)"), I just don't want them on their own because they aren't added ingredients. I found a couple other questions here that I tried applying to my problem, but I never got the expected output. Oh, and in case preg_split isn't PHP-centric, I'm using PHP. Thanks in advance!
