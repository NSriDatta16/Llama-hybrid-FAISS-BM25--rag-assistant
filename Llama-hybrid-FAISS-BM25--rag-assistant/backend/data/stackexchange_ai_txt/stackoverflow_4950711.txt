Guard Compile contents of dir to dirname

I'm using guard to compile coffee-scripts in a Rails 2.3.8 app. I was previously using bistro_car bundles, so my scripts are organized in app/scripts/{bundle_name}/{bundle_files} What I would like to do is compile all {bundle_files} to public/javascripts/{bundle_name}.js so I don't have to re-organize everything. Any ideas on how to approach this?
