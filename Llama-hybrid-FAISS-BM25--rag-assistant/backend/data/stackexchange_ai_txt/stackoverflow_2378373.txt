The simplest way to test these type of problems (where serialization is incomplete or incorrect) is to unit test - nothing complicated. Create an object of your serializable type Set all of the properties Serialize it Take the serialized output and deserialize it into a new object Check all of the properties of the object to make sure they're still populated Fail the unit test if any of the properties aren't set to the expected value Remember that it's usually the behaviour you're trying to prove - not the implementation. Tools that check for specific attributes are only of value for testing a single implementation of your code: a unit test like the above could work for any form of serialization or storage without rewriting the test.
