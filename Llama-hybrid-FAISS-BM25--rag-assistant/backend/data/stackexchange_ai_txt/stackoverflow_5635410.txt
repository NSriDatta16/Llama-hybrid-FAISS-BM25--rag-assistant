Simple Word Wrap Function Last Line Problem

I have a function that takes a long string and breaks into smaller strings and adds them to an array so that they can be outputted in a nicer looking paragraph. It works fine except for the last line doesn't output. How would I get it to output? Here's the code: void WordWrap(string inputString, string formatedAr[], const int SIZE) { unsigned int length; unsigned int index; unsigned int word; unsigned int max = 65; string outWord; string outLine; length = inputString.length(); outWord = ""; outLine = ""; word = 0; for(int i = 0; i max) { formatedAr[word] = outLine; word++; outLine.clear(); } outLine += outWord + " "; outWord.clear(); } } }
