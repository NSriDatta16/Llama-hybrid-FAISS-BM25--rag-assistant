The name for the problem you're trying to solve is " feature extraction ". It's decidedly non-trivial and a subject of active research. The naive way to go about this is simply to map each pixel of the image to a corresponding input neuron. Obviously, this only works for images that are all the same size, and is generally of limited effectiveness. Beyond this, there is a host of things you can do... Gabor filters, Haar-like features, PCA and ICA, sparse features, just to name a few popular examples. My advice would be to pick up a textbook on neural networks and pattern recognition or, specifically, optical character recognition.
