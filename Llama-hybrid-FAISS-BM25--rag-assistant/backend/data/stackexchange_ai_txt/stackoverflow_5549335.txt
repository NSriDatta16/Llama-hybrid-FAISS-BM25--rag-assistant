Simple installed tool for digital Scrum Board

I am looking for a basic and simple-to-install digital version of a Scrum board. I do prefer physical index cards, but in this case logistics makes it hard. Thus, I need to have it on the computer. No real need to share data between several clients. To us it is enough if it runs on one single machine. Just need basic functionality. A drag-drop board and a sprint burndown would do fine. Due to regularly constraints I cannot use an online SaaS, must keep the data local. Time is short, so simple install and ready-to-go. Does not need to be free, but of course price is interesting. I have not had this set of constraints earlier, so I am unfamiliar. I have done some research and have some general experience. For example VersionOne, Mingle and Hansoft seem to have a good reputation. Anyone can comment on how those fit the above list? Anyone have other recommendations?
