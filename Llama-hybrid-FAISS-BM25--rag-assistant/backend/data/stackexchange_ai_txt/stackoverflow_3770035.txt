No, you can't add a starting and ending commend tag like that. The comment tag is a single tag, it's not a seprate starting tag and ending tag. So, and --> are not a valid HTML fragments, as they don't contain complete tags. If you want to put an element inside a comment, it's no element any more, so to do that you would have to get the HTML code for the element, put a comment tag around it, and replace the element with the comment. If you do this to hide the element, you should simply use the hide method instead.
