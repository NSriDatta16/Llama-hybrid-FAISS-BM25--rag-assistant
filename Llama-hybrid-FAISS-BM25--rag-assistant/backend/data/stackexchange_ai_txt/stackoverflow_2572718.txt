Ideas on simulating webservices for local automated testing

I am testing an app, which talks to different webservices over the internet. For my automated testing, I don't want to go over the network. To achieve this, I need to simulate the webservice on my machine using another app. My initial thought is to record all the requests and responses between client and webservice, and then just write a simulation app which replays these responses. The disadvantage here is that everytime the webservice protocol changes a bit, I have to modify all my recorded resposnes. so I am looking to see if there are more elegant solutions. have anyone solved a similar problem? any thoughts, suggestion are appreciated.
