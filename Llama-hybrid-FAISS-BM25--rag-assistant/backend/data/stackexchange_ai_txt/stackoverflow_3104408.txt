NewLine Characters not working when formatting email with StringBuilder

I am doing simple formatting for an email with StringBuilder and have code that looks like the following. StringBuilder message = new StringBuilder(); message.append("Name: " + model.getName() + "\r\n"); message.append("Organization: " + model.getOrganization() +"\r\n"); message.append("Comment: " + model.getComment() +"\r\n"); contactMessage.setMessage(message.toString()); I am logging the formatting and it works correctly, but it is coming out as one line when we actually check the emails being sent. What if I am not using HTML though is my real question...thanks for the help.
