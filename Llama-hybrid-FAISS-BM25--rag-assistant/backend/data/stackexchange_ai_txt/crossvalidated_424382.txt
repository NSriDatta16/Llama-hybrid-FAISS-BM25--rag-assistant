How does an observation condition the next one, if the numbers are exp. distributued with uknown average?

We have a process that generates exponentially distributed random numbers, i.e., $P(X=x) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x}$ . However, we don't know the value of $\lambda$ . We observe the first realization with a value of $x_1$ . The second, $x_2$ has not yet been realized. $x_1$ and $x_2$ are assumed independent. The question is : what is the predictive distribution $P(x_2 | x_1)$ ? Both frequentist and Bayesian results are welcome. (Extra: which estimation would perform better? the frequentist or the Bayesian?)
