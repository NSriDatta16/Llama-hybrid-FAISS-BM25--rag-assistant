Windows Azure Cloud Storage - Impact of huge number of files in root

Sorry if I get any of the terminology wrong here, but hopefully you will get what I mean. I am using Windows Azure Cloud Storage to store a vast quantity of small files (images, 20Kb each). At the minute, these files are all stored in the root directory. I understand it's not a normal file system, so maybe root isn't the correct term. I've tried to find information on the long-term effects of this plan but with no luck so if any one can give me some information I'd be grateful. Basically, am I going to run into problems if the numbers of files stored in this root end up in the hundreds of thousands/millions? Thanks, Steven
