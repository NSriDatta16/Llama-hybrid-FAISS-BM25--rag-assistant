It sounds like MySQL is ill-suited for the task (sorry). I would check out Tokyo Tyrant, maybe MongoDB or any other distributed key-value storage system. There are also specialized commercial products. MongoDB is able to swap out some of it's indexes to the HD . I guess your problem is that MySQL just can't do that (I'm not a MySQL-guy though).
