Could someone please give an concrete example to illustrate how exactly validation set be used for pruning a decision tree?

Chapter 3 of Tom M. Mitchell. Machine Learning (free) says: the available data has been split into three subsets: the training examples, the validation examples used for pruning the tree, and a set of test examples used to provide an unbiased estimate of accuracy over future unseen examples. I understand this conceptually and am trying to understand this operationally. Could someone please give an concrete example to illustrate how exactly a validation set being used for pruning a decision tree? for example, how a exactly validation set in iris dataset for pruning a decision tree? Note: this post is different to the one discussing how to divide dataset . this post focus on pruning.
