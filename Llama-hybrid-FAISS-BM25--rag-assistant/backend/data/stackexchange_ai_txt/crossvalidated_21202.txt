"The variance of the sums is the sum of the variances". So: Square each of the 365 standard errors so they become variances. Add them together; this will give you the variance of the annual total. Divide that variance by 365^2; this will give you the variance of the annual average. Take the square root of that variance; this will give you the standard error of your annual average. From there, I suspect your sample size is big enough (bigger than 500 in total, right?) it doesn't matter too much what the underlying population is (log normal etc) as your estimate is probably roughly normally distributed due to the central limit theorem. So multiply the standard error calculated above by 1.96 to give the +/- of your 95 percent confidence interval. Edit / addition On reflection, my answer above is probably incomplete. I should have asked you for more context. Most importantly there is a question about where your original data come from. Are they themselves the averages of sets of independent observations? (or something similar, eg output from a regression) If so, are they each based on the same number of observations? If not ie if they are based on different numbers of observations, you will need a weighted average, and hence a weighted estimate of the variance. Arguably, you may want to do this anyway. In this case, weighting should be proportional to the inverse of the variance of each "prediction" in your data set; or to the number of observations behind each "prediction".
