As it is generally believed that non-linear models should not be used unless absolutely necessary. I don't think this is accurate. GLMs are fairly flexible. Are you including regression splines, interactions... in your model? Regularization is often used with GLMs - the number of parameters don't need to be fixed. As mentioned by Scortchi, I don't think you can prove that any linear model will be outperformed by random forest - given the large number of options available.
