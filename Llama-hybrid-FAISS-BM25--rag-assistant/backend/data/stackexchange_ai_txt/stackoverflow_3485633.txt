If you're trying to use the custom HTML forms to submit to Drupal-managed submit handlers, the biggest pitfall you're going to run into is that most Drupal modules verify the form via the use of form IDs and checksums, which you can't hard code. Your forms are also going to be incredibly fragile: if what you're submitting to changes a form element, your forms will break. Forms API isn't particularly hard to learn, is easy to maintain, and you get it for free. Unless it's absolutely impossible to use it, you should use it.
