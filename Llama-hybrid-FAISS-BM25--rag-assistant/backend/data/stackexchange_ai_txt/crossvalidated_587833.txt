Is there an improved canonical polyadic decomposition for symmetric tensors?

Let us suppose I want to find a CP decomposition of a $n$ -mode tensor $\mathcal{A}$ . Fortunately the tensor has the permutation symmetry $$\mathcal{A}[i_1, \cdots, i_n] = \mathcal{A}[\sigma (i_1), \cdots, \sigma (i_n)]$$ for all permutations $\sigma$ on the index set. I have read this to be either a symmetric tensor or a supersymmetric tensor depending on the author. One of the limitations I have discovered about CP decomposition is that it requires a lot of memory. But clearly a symmetric tensor has a ton of redundant information. Is there an improved canonical polyadic decomposition that leverages the fact that symmetric tensors have a lot of repeated entries?
