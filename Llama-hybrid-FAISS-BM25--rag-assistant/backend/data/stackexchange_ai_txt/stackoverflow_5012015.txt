Git branch structure for Client & Server

For one of my CS classes, I and a group are writing an application using a client/server architecture. I was curious what the best-practices would be for organizing the project in a Git repository. What I mean, is whether we should structure the directories like this: ProjectDir/ Clients/ Client1/ # files... Client2/ # files... Server/ files.... and track everything on the same git branch, or whether we should create separate branches for the clients and the server, like: on branch Server : Project/ Server/ # files... on branch Clients : Project/ Client1/ # files... Client2/ # files... I don't know if it makes much of a difference, but this will be the first project I undertake using git where the team consists of more than a couple people, and I want to make sure the pulls and merges are as simple as possible...
