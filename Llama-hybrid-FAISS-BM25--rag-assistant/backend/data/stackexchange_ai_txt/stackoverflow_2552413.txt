Where can I put my source files?

I am developing a web form using Visual Web Developer Currently I have class source files in the same directory as the web form, or in the App_Code folder. I'd like to organise the files into folders within the web form folder, but I can't find a way of adding a reference to the folders, and they don't seem to be being picked up automatically. These are files that are under constant development. What is the asp.net/c#'s equivalent concept to c++'s #include? This is a Web Site rather than a Web Application
