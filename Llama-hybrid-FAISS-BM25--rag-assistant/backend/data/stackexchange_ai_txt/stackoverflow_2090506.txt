Magento Store - Extensions Breaking Admin

Previously I was able to download extensions without a problem. Now when I click on admin > system > magento connect > magento connect manager I get a blank screen with a few characters: http://skitch.com/a1anm/ntb31/http-127.0.0.1-8888-thefix-index.php-adminalan-extensions-local-index-key-9318fe8596ce8bec19757cc8ef4d8447 I am able to access the downloader via mysite.com/downloader. The problem is evertime I download an extension now and then try to access admin > system > config I get the same blank screen error. If I uninstall the last extension it starts working again. I’ve tried a number of different extensions but get the same problems. I also tried disabling all current extensions and it didn’t dix this. Anyone know how I could fix this? Or is it possible to reinstall the downloader without reinstalling my entire store?
