There is a very careful formulation in Gelman, Hill, and Vehtari Regression and Other Stories: From the data alone, a regression only tells us about comparisons between units, not about changes within units. Thus the most careful interpretation of regression coefficients is in terms of comparisons, for example [...] "Comparing two items $i$ and $j$ that differ by an amount $x$ on predictor $k$ but are identical on all other predictors, the predicted difference $y_i - y_j$ is $\beta_k x$ , on average. This is of course a bit of a mouthful.
