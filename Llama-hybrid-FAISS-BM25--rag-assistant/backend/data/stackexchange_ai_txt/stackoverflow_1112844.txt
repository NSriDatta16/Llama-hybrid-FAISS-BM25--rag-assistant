I imagine someone has wrapped this into a nice event model already, but I don't know of it, so here's one option: During drag (after dragstart and before dragstop ) you should be able to attach an event handler to onmousemove . That will fire pretty much continuously as the element is being dragged, and you can run basic dimensional math to detect whether the mouse or the dragged element(s) have intersected with any of your potential target elements, and fire your own event then.
