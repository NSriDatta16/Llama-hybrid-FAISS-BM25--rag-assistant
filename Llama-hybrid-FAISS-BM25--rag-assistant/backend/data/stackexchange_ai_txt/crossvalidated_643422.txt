Do we believe in existence of true prior distribution in Bayesian Statistics?

Let $X$ be an $\mathcal{X}$ valued random variable. Suppose that we have observed $X = x$ . We use a parametric model with $\theta \in \Theta$ being the parameter . In frequentist approach, we believe that there exists a true $\theta \in \Theta$ which decides the distribution of $X$ . The inference procedure is that we use $x$ to estimate this true $\theta$ . In Bayesian approach, we impose a prior probability measure $\Pi$ on $\Theta$ . The practical inference procedure is that we find a statistical model (a collection of probability measures $\mathcal{P}$ which $P_{X \mid \theta = \theta}$ takes value in) along with prior $\Pi$ reflecting the believes of the client, update $\Pi$ using $x$ , and make conclusions according to the posterior distribution. There is literally no other way of doing the job. My question is that, when we are adopting the Bayesian framework, after choosing the statistical model $\mathcal{P}$ , do we believe in the existence of a true distribution of $\theta$ , $P_{\theta}$ (such that we view posterior as an estimation of this true $P_{\theta}$ )? I think that, even if we do believe in it, it probably will not impact how we carry out our work practically. But it seems that, once we believe in it, the Bayesian approach completely includes the frequentist approach (let $P_{\theta}$ concentrate on a singleton).
