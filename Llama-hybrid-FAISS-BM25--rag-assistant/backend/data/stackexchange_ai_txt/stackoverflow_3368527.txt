How the fragment is encoded, is unfortunately, browser-dependent : Is fragment ID (hash) encoded by applying RFC-mandated URL escaping rules? MSIE: NO Firefox: PARTLY Safari: YES Opera: NO Chrome: NO Android: YES As to the question of what encoding the browser uses to encode international (read: non-ASCII) characters before converting them to %nn escape sequences, "most browsers deal with this by sending UTF-8 data by default on any text entered in the URL bar by hand, and using page encoding on all followed links." (same source ).
