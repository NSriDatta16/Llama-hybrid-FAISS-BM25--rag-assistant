RL is a very broad field, and the appropriate "test"-game depends on what exactly you're interested in. If similar or better results can be achieved in an hour with simpler/ more common approaches like decision trees or MLP, I'd rather not continue with this project. I suggest you start off with a simple game/task, and once you are confident in your ability to solve that task, then move on to a more challenging one. To do something with RL which no other algorithm/approach can accomplish requires a lot of prior expertise and familiarity with the game and algorithm, so it's not a good way to learn anything. For each area of RL, I've listed an easy environment on which it'd be appropriate to play around, and then a much more challenging environment. Continuous control : Inverted pendulum control is a good starter test project. Robotic manipulation from visual inputs is a much more challenging problem (see Fetch environments in OpenAI Gym). Discrete control : Pong is a simple game to start with. Many harder Atari games are also frequently used, including the infamous "Montezuma's Revenge". Multi-Agent games : OpenAI's multi-agent particle environments provide a set of neat test-cases for both cooperative and competitive settings. For more of a challenge, try out Go.
