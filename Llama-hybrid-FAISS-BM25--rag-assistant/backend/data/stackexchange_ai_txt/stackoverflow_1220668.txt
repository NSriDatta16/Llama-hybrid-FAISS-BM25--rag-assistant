The problem with FireFox and FormsAuthentication is that FireFox doens't seem to delete the auth cookie on SignOut. 3 things you can try: 1) After calling the SignOut method, clear the cookies like this => Response.cookies.clear() 2) Try calling Session.abandon before your SignOut call 3) You can also try the following: Response.Expires = 0, Response.Cache.SetNoStore(), Response.AppendHeader("Pragma", "no-cache") Hope those help!
