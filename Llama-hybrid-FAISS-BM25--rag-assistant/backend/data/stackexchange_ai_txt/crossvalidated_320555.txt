Is there any way to derive the initial accuracy with random initialization?

In many iterative machine learning algorithms, weight/parameters are initialized as random. But is there any mathematical relationship between the random starting point and initial accuracy? For example, in Probabilistic PCA the Principal Subspace "W" is initialized as random, which is refined by Expectation maximization algorithm. In my simulation, the initial error is over 300% which reduces to 30% after running one iteration. Upon running multiple iterations, "W" is polished further so that error reaches 0%. I was wondering if there is any mathematical formula that defines this accuracy of the initial random point. So any help/link to related paper will be much appreciated. Thanks in advance.
