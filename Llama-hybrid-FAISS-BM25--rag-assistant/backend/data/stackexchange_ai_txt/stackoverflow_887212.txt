How-to log user actions in winforms application

I would like log user actions in winforms applications. The "user actions" mean "click to menu item/button", "move/maximize/minimize/close form", "keydown/up", etc... The log should contains time, action type (click/keydown/etc...), target (name/text of control). I have access to source code of target application, but I would like to not override methods like "OnClick" or "OnKeyDown" in every winforms control I'm using, if it is not necessary. Is there some elegant solution, how to do it? Thanks!
