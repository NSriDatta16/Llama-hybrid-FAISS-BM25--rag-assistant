Outlook Contact Properties and Active Directory / Exchange

Are there any references to the Active Directory attributes that Outlook uses when viewing the properties of a contact within Outlook (i.e. when you search the global address book and right click > properties)? In particular, the 'Manager' and 'Direct reports' boxes under the Organisation tab. Interested in this for syncing Active Directory with SharePoint 2010. In Outlook, is it possible to change the properties form so that additional data from custom attributes can be shown and change existing labels (e.g. 'zip code' to 'post code')?
