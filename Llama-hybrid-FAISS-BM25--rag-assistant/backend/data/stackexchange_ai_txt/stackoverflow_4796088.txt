Online game using .net technologies

I am new in game development, but I'm thinking about creating online browser game on asp.net mvc3 using entity framework for ORM data mapping and SQL Server 2008 DB for data data storage. I would like to hear your thoughts about this. What advantages and disadvantages of this approach. Why is it worse than using classic LAMP.
