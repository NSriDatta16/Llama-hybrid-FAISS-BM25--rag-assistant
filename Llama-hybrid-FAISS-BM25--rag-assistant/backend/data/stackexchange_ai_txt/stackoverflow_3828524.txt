magento extension "remember me" not working

I am using the J2T Remember Me Checkbox extension for magento. Has anyone tried this extension? Actually its not working, although I have made all necessary changes and updation for it, and from magento site also I have noticed its not working for most of people so I just want to ask is there any other change which I need to make that is not described here in link? Or its really not working? Please suggest or share your view.
