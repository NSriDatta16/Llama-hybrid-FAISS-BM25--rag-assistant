Given the comment, I think what you want to do is probably look at the outliers and high leverage points from a linear regression. That would identify the points you mention. If you are also interested in modeling this, and whether it is related to the presence of a pulse, then the dependent variable becomes some measure of distance from the regression line and the independent variable would be presence/absence of a pulse.
