jQuery selector to determine 'or'?

Let's say my HTML may look one of two ways: Option 1: My header My Span Option 2: My header Via jAuery, I want to append a span to either the nested span (if it's there) or to the header directly, resulting in one of these: Option 1: My header My Span My Span Inserted via jQuery Option 2: My header My Span Inserted via jQuery Is there a clever selector that would detect both of the above scenarios? I could, of course, first check to see if my header has a span with a class of 'apple' within it. If so, do this, else, do that. I was wondering if there was a more elegant and less verbose solution, though.
