How to make an action for missing actions?

I am very new to cakePHP. I am working on a controller like so: class DesignersController extends AppController { var $name = 'Designers'; function index() { $data = $this->Designer->find('all'); $this->set('designers', $data); } function belle_etoile() { $this->show_designer("belle etoile"); } function ritani() { $this->show_designer("ritani"); } function swarovski() { $this->show_designer("swarovski"); } function verragio() { $this->show_designer("verragio"); } private function show_designer($designer) { $this->layout = 'first'; $data = $this->Designer->find('first', array('conditions' => array('Designer.name' => $designer))); $this->set('data', $data); $this->render('show_designer'); } } As you can see many of the "actions" are shortcuts for show_designer/param action where param is the name of the shortcut action. Every one of these actions is a "designer" in the database. I just don't want to have to make the url designers/show_designer/ritani , I would rather it just be designers/ritani . This works, but the problem is: I have to create a bunch of redundant functions for every designer, and if a new designer gets added, it won't work until I add a function for it. I would rather have a function/action that runs if the action requested is missing, and has the action that was requested as a parameter so if I request url designers/stardust , since stardust is not defined as an action it would call the catch_all action with stardust as the parameter. So instead of a bunch of redundant functions I could just have this: function catch_all($action) { $this->show_designer($action) } Is there anyway to do something like this?
