Use of the F statistic in logistic regression

This paper uses a generalised linear mixed model assuming a binomial distribution for the errors. In the results section, the F statistic and associated P-value is used for the model (page 2150, paragraph beginning 'Males and females also differed') I thought the F statistic could only be used in ANOVA and linear regression. Could anyone tell me how and why the F statistic is being used in the logistic regression in linked paper?
