For your telerik questions you should go to http://www.telerik.com/community/forums.aspx Their support is great and if the forums don't cut it just send a formal request, you will need to create a demo project with your problem. I have used telerik products for years and they never fail to answer your question within a few days. The demo site is also a great source of knowledge (linked above by robert) Guido
