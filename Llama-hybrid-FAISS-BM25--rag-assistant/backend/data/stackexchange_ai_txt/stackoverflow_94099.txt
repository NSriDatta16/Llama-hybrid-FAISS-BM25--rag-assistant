Active record is very heavy, data mapper and domain object are separating those concerns out so you have a more defined set of code doing various aspects for you "domain" or "entity" objects. I personally prefer, not that you asked, going with the separation into domain object, data mapper, probably use an assembly pattern and even a data transfer pattern to assure clear separation of what happens to data between the database an the upper tiers of an application. ...elegant and simple separations always help.
