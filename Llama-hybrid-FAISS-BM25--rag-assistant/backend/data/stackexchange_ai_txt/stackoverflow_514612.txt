The OLE technology predates COM as a separate entity by a significant amount of time. Before that, OLE was implemented as a way of Embedding and Linking Objects. The classic example is that of embedding a spreadsheet within a word document. The underlying technology of COM was enabled so that other languages such as VB could interact with those objects as well. Then, historically, we had a lot of server type programmers which were looking on these cool things like language independence, reference counting and threading models with envy, but really didn't care too much about the embedding technology at all. The logical thing to do was to split out the underlying server functionality as COM - this was a more naturally low-level API. Both technologies still exist. OLE is kind of linked up with or may be the same as ActiveX these days.
