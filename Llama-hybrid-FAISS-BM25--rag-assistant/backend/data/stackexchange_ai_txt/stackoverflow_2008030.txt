SELECT TOP 1 * FROM Products WHERE isActive = 1 likely results in table scan, and returning just one row a time in this case is wasting server's resources. It's better to return top 10 (or even more based on your application) a time and just do concurrent retrieval for the in-memory data, like wallyk pointed out.
