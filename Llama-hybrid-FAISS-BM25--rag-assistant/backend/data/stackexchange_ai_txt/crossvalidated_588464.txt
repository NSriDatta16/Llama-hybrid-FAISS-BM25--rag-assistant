You have probably long moved past this, but I figured I would clarify what the difference is between categorical variables for fixed and random effects. To keep things simple, I'll use less mathematical names for the equations so its more straight forward. A normal regression with a categorical predictor would look like the following: $\text{Y} = \text{Fixed Intercept} + \text{Categorical Predictor} + \text{Error}$ For our example, we can make a model predicting the influence of occupation on average income, expressed so: $\text{Income} = \text{Grand Mean of Income} + \text{Change in Grand Mean Due to Occupation} + \text{Error}$ This equation assumes that the fixed effect of categories predicts a grand mean. So conditional upon whatever the category is, the "y" here should equal the mean outcome plus or minus whatever fixed effects are in the equation. If the reference criterion for occupation is a janitor and their average income is 40k USD, it would be used as the fixed intercept, and every other dummy coding of occupation would add the fixed effect on the grand mean based off each multiplication of the dummy code. Random effects models, depending on how they're formulated, add an additional layer with random effect intercepts and random effect slopes. I will just use random intercepts as an example. If we are interested in occupation as a fixed effect but we aren't interested in the corporation they work for, this may be a good time to use it as a random effect (which by the way should almost always be categorical). We would simply add the random intercepts, or conditional grand means, of each corporation to the model. $ \begin{aligned} \text{Income} = \text{Grand Mean of Income} + \text{Occupation} + \text{Error} \\ \text{+/- Change in Grand Mean from Corporation 1} \\ \text{+/- Change in Grand Mean from Corporation 2} \\ \text{+/- Change in Grand Mean from Corporation ..} \end{aligned} $ This essentially accomplishes the major goal in separating the equation into two separate parts. One part is a predictable fixed effect that you can estimate independent from the random effects. The other part is the actual random effect which you can look at to see how much "noise" it brings if it were to be added back into the fixed effect equation. The selection of a categorical predictor is therefore theoretical...its important to know why you think it predicts an outcome or if it is just unnecessarily confounding your estimate.
