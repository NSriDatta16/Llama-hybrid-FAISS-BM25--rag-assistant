jQuery Draggable Handler inside IFrame

What a mouthful. Basically I have a parent and inside that an . I need an element inside the iframe to be the handle to drag the parent div. Is this even possible? I have tried: $(node).draggable("option","handle",$('iframe',node).contents().find('#handle')); $(node).draggable("option","handle",$('iframe',node).contents().find('#handle')[0]); It is targeting the right DOM element but it just won't drag. It might be possible to overlay a hidden div ontop of the iframe but I have found the iframe takes the event over the div when position is absolute. Strange.
