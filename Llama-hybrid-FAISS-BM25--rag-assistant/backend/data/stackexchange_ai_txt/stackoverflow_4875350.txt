Looking at the linked implementation, if you want an absolute path you should precede it with a slash: // if it's an absolute path, return it: if( src.startsWith( "/" ) || src.startsWith( "http://" ) || src.startsWith( "https://" ) ) return(src); Otherwise a wicket resource path is generated. I'd actually recommend using swfobject for embedding flash - there is some nice wicket integration code at the start of this page , along with a flash-based component that uses it.
