Lets take an example. The league is Premier League and the teams playing are Chelsea, X, Y and Z (sorry I don't follow football!). So now you have data for all 4 teams for Premier League. Now comes Champions League and the teams playing are Chelsea, Y and Z (X did not get selected for some reason). Now ask yourself if you should consider data only for Champions League or other league's as well. The answer is yes you should consider data for each and every league, because what you want is predicting win or lose scenario for Chelsea, and Chelsea played against Y and Z in Premier League and both Y and Z are playing in Champions League too! So considering the performance of Chelsea (which is a measure of weather Chelsea will win or lose) you should be wise to include data from other league's as well. In fact you should take all the data of Chelsea in each and every League and against every team you can find and add it to your database. Now one would be thinking the match against X in Premier League should be considered as noise because X did not qualify for Champions League. I would say no, as predicting if Chelsea will win or not is essentially predicting Chelsea's performance (against any team!). Performance of a team does not change drastically based on a League. If a team is good, it will perform good more or less in every League and the same goes for a bad team. So if Chelsea did good in Premier against X, Y and Z, it will "most probably" do good in Champions against Y and Z too! So, if Chelsea played against X in Premier League and we want to predict performance of Chelsea in Champions, we should include data of it's match against X. It is valuable info as far as performance of Chelsea is considered. As far as models are considered, your best bets would be Random Forest, XGBoost and LGBM models (you should also play around with all the various hyperparameters...optuna! wink wink!)
