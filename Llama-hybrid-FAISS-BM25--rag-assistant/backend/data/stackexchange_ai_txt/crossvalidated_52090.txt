From a quick skim it seems like they're basically taking a Bayesian viewpoint and computing a particular probability (H0 true|reject if I understood what they were getting at) that they argue must go up as the sample size goes down; if that's what the claim was, then as far as that goes, it's valid, because the denominator in Bayes rule must decrease as the sample size goes down while the significance level and P(H0 true) are presumably fixed. A frequentist would argue that their rate of reject|H0 true is fixed, and they'd likely say that's what they care about. On the gripping hand, in the overwhelming majority of studies, the true overall rate of false&positives must be effectively zero at every sample size, since in most circumstances nulls are simply not exactly true. I guess it comes down to what probability you want.
