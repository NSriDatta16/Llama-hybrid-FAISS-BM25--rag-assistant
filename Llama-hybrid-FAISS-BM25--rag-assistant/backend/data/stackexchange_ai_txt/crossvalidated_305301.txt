I would like to help - you put $n$ in your definition, but this is exactly what we don't want. Since $n$ is never referenced elsewhere, its presence serves to inform the reader of your definition that the experiment is repeated a finite number of times. So, we can either remove $n$ altogether and state that the experiment is repeated infinitely many times (which is a problem logically) or we can leave $n$ right where it is and state that the expectation is the limit of the average of the values as $n\to\infty$. That is, in your dice example, let's take the average of $n$ values. As we increase $n$, the average gets closer and closer to $3.5$.
