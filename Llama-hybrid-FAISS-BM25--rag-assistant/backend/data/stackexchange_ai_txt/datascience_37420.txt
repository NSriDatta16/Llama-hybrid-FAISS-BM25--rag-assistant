How to upload a saved file from google colab to a site such as kaggle or github?

We are able to load a file from a site such as kaggle and git hub to google collab, we apply the below code to download from other sites into google colab: !wget nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip but I am very curious to know if I am able to upload a saved file (such as an output from google colab) to kaggle or github with a command like above?
