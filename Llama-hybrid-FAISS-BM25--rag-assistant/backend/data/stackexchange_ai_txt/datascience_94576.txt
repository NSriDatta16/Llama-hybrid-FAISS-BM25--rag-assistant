creating dataset/storing vectors from c++ to python

I am new to the data science field. I need to create dataset which consists of n inputs (vectors of size 5) and n outputs (vectors of size > 10,000). These vectors are generated using c++ code. What is the best way to store them, such that they can be easily readable in python and use to train tensorflow/keras network? I am looking for recommendation on format and tools to be used.
