No values in instance vars of objects after I add them to NSMutableArray

I'm adding an object w/two NSString instance vars to an NSMutableArray. Log statements tell me the vars are set correctly, but after I add them to the array, they seem to be overwritten or later, don't show up at all. This is driving me nuts. I suspect its a memory mgmt issue... Sorry for the long output, but I'm getting desperate... I call this method when I click a button and it takes text from a textview, then I call another method from a menu item, and I have log statements to iterate through the array to check the values of the instance vars (question, answer) and both are blank in each Flashcard object saved in the array... - (IBAction)nextCard:(id)sender { int i = 0; NSLog(@"> Clicked \"Next Card\" button"); NSLog(@"Called method: -(IBAction)nextCard:"); NSString *questionString = [[questionView textStorage] string]; NSString *answerString = [[answerView textStorage] string]; /* Make sure we get input in both fields, otherwise do nothing */ /* Todo: use a regexp lib to make this more robust */ NSString *questionWithoutWhitespace = [questionString stringByTrimmingCharactersInSet:[NSCharacterSet whitespaceCharacterSet]]; NSString *answerWithoutWhitespace = [answerString stringByTrimmingCharactersInSet:[NSCharacterSet whitespaceCharacterSet]]; NSLog(@" questionString: %@", questionString); NSLog(@" answerString: %@", answerString); if ( ([questionWithoutWhitespace length] != 0) && ([answerWithoutWhitespace length] != 0) ) { Flashcard *flashcard = [Flashcard newCardWithQuestion:questionString andAnswer:answerString]; NSLog(@" Flashcard->question: %@", [flashcard getQuestion]); NSLog(@" Flashcard->answer: %@", [flashcard getAnswer]); [cardList addObject:flashcard]; NSLog (@" [cardList count]: %d", [cardList count]); NSLog(@" FlashCard %i, question: %@", i, [[cardList objectAtIndex:i] getQuestion]); NSLog(@" FlashCard %i, answer: %@", i, [[cardList objectAtIndex:i] getAnswer]); i++; [self clearCard]; } } Here is the output after I call it a few times: [Session started at 2010-12-15 22:27:21 -0800.] Called -(void)awakeFromNib > Clicked "Next Card" button Called method: -(IBAction)nextCard: questionString: q1 answerString: a1 Flashcard->question: q1 Flashcard->answer: a1 [cardList count]: 1 FlashCard 0, question: q1 FlashCard 0, answer: a1 Called Method: -(void)clearCard > Clicked "Next Card" button Called method: -(IBAction)nextCard: questionString: q2 answerString: a2 Flashcard->question: q2 Flashcard->answer: a2 [cardList count]: 2 FlashCard 0, question: q2 FlashCard 0, answer: a2 Called Method: -(void)clearCard > Selected "File -> New" menu option Called method: -(IBAction)newCardSet: cardList: [cardList count]: 2 Element 0 = FlashCard 0, question: FlashCard 0, answer: Element 1 = FlashCard 1, question: FlashCard 1, answer:
