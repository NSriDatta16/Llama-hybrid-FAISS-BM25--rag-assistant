In a standard software package (e.g. R's lmer ), the basic difference is: fixed effects are estimated by maximum likelihood (least squares for a linear model) random effects are estimated by empirical Bayes (least squares with some shrinkage for a linear model, where the shrinkage parameter is chosen by maximum likelihood) If you're being Bayesian (e.g. WinBUGS), then there is no real difference.
