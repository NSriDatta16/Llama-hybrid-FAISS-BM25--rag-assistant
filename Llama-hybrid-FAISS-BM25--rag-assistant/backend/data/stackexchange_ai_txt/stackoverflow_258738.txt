Transformation Failing due to xsl:include

I have a Java maven project which includes XSLT transformations. I load the stylesheet as follows: TransformerFactory tFactory = TransformerFactory.newInstance(); DocumentBuilderFactory dFactory = DocumentBuilderFactory .newInstance(); dFactory.setNamespaceAware(true); DocumentBuilder dBuilder = dFactory.newDocumentBuilder(); ClassLoader cl = this.getClass().getClassLoader(); java.io.InputStream in = cl.getResourceAsStream("xsl/stylesheet.xsl"); InputSource xslInputSource = new InputSource(in); Document xslDoc = dBuilder.parse(xslInputSource); DOMSource xslDomSource = new DOMSource(xslDoc); Transformer transformer = tFactory.newTransformer(xslDomSource); The stylesheet.xsl has a number of statements. These appear to be causing problems, when I try to run my unit tests I get the following errors: C:\Code\workspace\app\dummy.xsl; Line #0; Column #0; Had IO Exception with stylesheet file: footer.xsl C:\Code\workspace\app\dummy.xsl; Line #0; Column #0; Had IO Exception with stylesheet file: topbar.xsl The include statements in the XSLT are relative links xsl:include href="footer.xsl" xsl:include href="topbar.xsl" I have tried experimenting and changing these to the following - but I still get the error. xsl:include href="xsl/footer.xsl" xsl:include href="xsl/topbar.xsl" Any ideas? Any help much appreciated.
