Exponential moving averages overweight the most recent observations by a factor $\alpha$ to forecast the next value in a time-series, thus relying mainly on the innovation process found in the recent observations. In plain english, we can say that the larger the difference in the most recent observations (compared to their previous), the larger the forecast will diverge from the long term trend. This is quite different than optimizing for $\mathbb{E}[X_{t+1}|X_{t...}]$, where the regressor optimization is based on the correlation between $X$ and the previous values, rather than the innovation process. Specifically, an exponential smoothing forecast is equivalent to an ARIMA(0,1,1) with the MA $\theta$ parameter matching $1 - \alpha$, while a regression model is equivalent to an ARIMA(1,0,0) model. You can introduce an IV that quantifies the amount of intervention during the program in a regression model. The coefficient should have an inverse sign to the student's truancy value at $t-1$. An exponential moving average can only include data for the same series.
