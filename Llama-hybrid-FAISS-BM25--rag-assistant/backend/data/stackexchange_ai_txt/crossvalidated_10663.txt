If you're looking for statistical significance I wouldn't hold out hope unless you have a very targeted hypothesis and/or there is a very strong effect. But certainly you could generate some new hypotheses with this data via some exploratory analysis. With 6 variables overall I'm not sure I'd start with any sophisticated modeling. Never underestimate the power of scatterplots and histograms :) One really simple thing to do would be to run PCA and see if the scores on any of the components have an apparent relationship with the response(s) you're interested in. It's probably a good reasonable idea anyhow since your measurements are certainly correlated. Edit: My thought on using PCA was basically to reduce the area/perimeter/number variables to a single dimension. Not strictly necessary but it might make visualizing the relationships easier.
