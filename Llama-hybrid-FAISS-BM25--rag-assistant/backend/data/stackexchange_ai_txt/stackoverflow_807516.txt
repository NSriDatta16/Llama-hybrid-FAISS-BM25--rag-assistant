Captured which subview is touched in UiScrollView but cannot access it in another function.

I have UIScrollView which has subviews (pictures) added do it. each time a user touches the a picture in the scrollview, it toggles a checkmark ontop of it. NSMutableIndexSet *picturesArray; - (void) touchesEnded: (NSSet *) touches withEvent: (UIEvent *) event { if (!self.dragging) { [self.nextResponder touchesEnded: touches withEvent:event]; NSLog(@"Touch down"); for (UITouch *touch in touches) { for (int i = 1; i Question 1: is this the best way of doing this? It seems like using a for (int i = 1; i savePhotos is called and basically searches through which of the pictures was touched and saves them to the Photo Album. However the call to UIImageWriteToSavedPhotosAlbum fails. This is in the same file as TouchesEnded. But when called in TouchesEnded, it works. (IBAction) savePhotos: (id) sender{ NSLog(@"The index set is %@",picturesArray ); const NSUInteger arrayCount = picturesArray.count; NSUInteger *theIndexBuffer = (NSUInteger *)calloc(picturesArray.count, sizeof(NSUInteger)); UIImageWriteToSavedPhotosAlbum([(UIImageView *)[self viewWithTag:0]image], nil, nil, nil); [picturesArray getIndexes:theIndexBuffer maxCount:arrayCount inIndexRange:nil]; for(int i = 0; i NSLog(@"Element is %d",theIndexBuffer[i]); UIImageWriteToSavedPhotosAlbum([(UIImageView *)[self viewWithTag:i]image], nil, nil, nil); } } Question 2: Why is it that UIImageWriteToSavedPhotosAlbum is failing ?
