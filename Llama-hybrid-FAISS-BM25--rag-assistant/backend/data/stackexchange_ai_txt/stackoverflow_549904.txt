+1 Andy Hume Was just about to post that. FYI from the article this works in Firefox, depending on your support needs: Testing Make sure to escape all ampersands and I don't know whether it was just because I was trying to validate a page with just the object on but it complained that it needed to be surrounded with a div, paragraph or something... I assume that object just can't come first in the markup.
