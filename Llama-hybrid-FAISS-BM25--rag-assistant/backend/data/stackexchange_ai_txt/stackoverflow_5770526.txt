What is the best development environment for writing Flash websites / games for a beginner

What tools / environment is needed to write professionally looking flash websites (animation, interactivity - image drag /drop, etc.? I am not experienced in flash so take that into acccount It seems like the default environment from Adobe is Macromedia Flash but its unclear if you need this or there are other recommended tools that may be simpler to use or less costly. Someone suggested that i work in swish , which looks interesting, but its not clear if swish is all you need or if you need macromedia IDE as well. I wanted to get feedback from this community on what is the "right" setup to build good looking functional flash websites.
