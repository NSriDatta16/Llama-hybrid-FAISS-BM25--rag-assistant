You should check the solution posted by Carl Meyer some time ago. It internally uses the ContentType approach, but it encapsulates it very elegantly . He also points to an alternative, and more efficient solution, that doesn't need to store an aditional field on the database, but it will only work for direct child classes. If you have several inheritance levels, the first solution is better.
