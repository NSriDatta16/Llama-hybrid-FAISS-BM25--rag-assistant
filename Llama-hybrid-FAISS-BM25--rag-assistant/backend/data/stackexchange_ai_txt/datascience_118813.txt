What to do if my dataset have only One instance for class in classification?

I am working on a benchmark dataset for text classification. The dataset has about 300 classes, and approximately 50 of these classes have a single instance. In a paper that used fine-tuning BERT, the authors split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets. However, they did not increase the number of instances through oversampling or augmentation. This brings up the topic of what happens to classes with a single instance. In which split should they be included?
