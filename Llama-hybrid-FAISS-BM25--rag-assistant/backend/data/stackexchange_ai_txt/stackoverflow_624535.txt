Using Django admin look and feel in my own application

I like the very simple but still really elegant look and feel of the django admin and I was wondering if there is a way to apply it to my own application. (I think that I've read something like that somewhere, but now I cannot find the page again.) (edited: what I am looking for is a way to do it automatically by extending templates, importing modules, or something similar, not just copy&paste the css and javascript code)
