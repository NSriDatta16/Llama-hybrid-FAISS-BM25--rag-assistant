Haskell - Parsec Parsing element

I'm using Text.ParserCombinators.Parsec and Text.XHtml to parse an input like this: This is the first paragraph example\n with two lines\n \n And this is the second paragraph\n And my output should be: This is the first paragraph example\n with two lines\n And this is the second paragraph\n I defined: line= do{ ;t But it returns: This is the first paragraph example\n with two lines\n\n And this is the second paragraph\n What is wrong? Any ideas? Thanks!
