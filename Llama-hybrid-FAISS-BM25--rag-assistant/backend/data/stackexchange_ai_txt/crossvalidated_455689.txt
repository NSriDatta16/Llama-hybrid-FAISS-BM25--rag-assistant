Python lifelines: How to do a survival analysis on panel data?

I have panel data on companies and I'm interested in how several DVs and covariates impact the time until a company gets funded. My data (pandas Dataframe) looks something like that: DV1 ... DV5 CV1...CV12 Funding CompanyFounded Company Period A 1 0 0 5 4 False False B 1 0 0 5 6 False False ... A 2 0 0 5 4 False False B 2 3 5 5 6 False True ... A 45 1 2 5 4 False True B 45 534 42 5 6 True True Now I'd like to perform a survival analysis. I know that I could calculate averages and calculate the time to first funding using CoxPHFitter. But I did not find any model to fit panel data. Is there a workaround? I'm looking for something comparable to STATA's stcox command. Thanks in advace!
