First of all, at age two, a child knows a lot about the world and actively applies this knowledge. A child does a lot of "transfer learning" by applying this knowledge to new concepts. Second, before seeing those five "labeled" examples of cars, a child sees a lot of cars on the street, on TV, toy cars, etc., so also a lot of "unsupervised learning" happens beforehand. Finally, neural networks have almost nothing in common with the human brain, so there's not much point in comparing them. Also notice that there are algorithms for one-shot learning, and pretty much research on it currently happens.
