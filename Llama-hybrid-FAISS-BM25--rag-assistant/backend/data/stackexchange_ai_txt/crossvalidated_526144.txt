The only approaches I've seen that respect the ordinal nature of such a predictor are isotonic regression which forces the relationship between X and Y to be monotonic in X. I'm not clear if this works in the context of also adjusting for other variables. Bayesian shrinkage priors where you model X as categorical with $k-1$ indicators for $k$ levels but connect the $k-1$ effects to shrink the differences between the parameter values. This is done automatically for ordinal predictors in the R brms package brm function.
