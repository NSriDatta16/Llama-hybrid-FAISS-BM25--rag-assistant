I thoroughly recommend the entertaining polemic "Probability Theory: The Logic of Science" by E.T. Jaynes. This is an introductory text in the sense of not requiring (and in fact preferring) no previous knowledge of statistics, but it does eventually employ fairly sophisticated mathematics. Compared to most of the other answers provided, this book is not nearly as practical or easy to digest, rather it provides the philosophical bedrock to why you would want to employ Bayesian methods, and why not to use frequentist approaches. It is introductory in a historical and philosophical, but not pedagogical way.
