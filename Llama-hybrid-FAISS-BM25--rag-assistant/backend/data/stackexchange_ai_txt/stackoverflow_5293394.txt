Get Android OS version from user-agent

I've been trying to find a parser or regex that will give me the Android OS version from a user agent string. E.g. Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; U; Android 2.2.1; fr-fr; Desire HD Build/FRG83D) AppleWebKit/533.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0 Mobile Safari/533.1 Will return: 2.2.1 Can anyone help?
