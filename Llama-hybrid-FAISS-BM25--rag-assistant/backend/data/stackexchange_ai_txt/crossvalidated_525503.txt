It seems that the heuristic described by @whuber in their answer to the linked problem can be modified slightly to yield the change of variables formula for the density in its more familiar form. Consider a finite sum approximation to the probability elements; the "conservation of mass" requirement stipulates that $$h_X(x_j) \Delta_X(x_j) = h_Y(y_j) \Delta_Y(y_j).$$ Here $h_X(x_j)$ is the height and $\Delta(x_j)$ is the width of the interval on which $x_j$ is the center. Suppose that $h_X(x)$ is known and $y = g(x)$ for a monotone continuous function $g(\cdot)$ . The goal is to solve for $h_Y(y)$ in terms of $g(\cdot)$ and $h_X(\cdot)$ . To do so, we will fix either $\Delta_X(x_j)$ or $\Delta_Y(y_j)$ to be some constant $\Delta$ for all values of its argument. Then we will solve for $h_Y(y)$ and take a limit as $\Delta \rightarrow 0$ . Which of $\Delta_X(x_j)$ or $\Delta_Y(y_j)$ is set to the constant determines which of the two forms of the formula is arrived at. Setting $\Delta_Y(y_j) = \Delta$ gives the more common form. $$\begin{aligned} h_Y(y) \Delta &= h_X(x)\left [g^{-1} \left(y + \dfrac{\Delta}{2} \right) - g^{-1} \left(y - \dfrac{\Delta}{2} \right) \right ],\\ h_Y(y) &= h_X(g^{-1}(y))\frac{\left [g^{-1} \left(y + \dfrac{\Delta}{2} \right) - g^{-1} \left(y - \dfrac{\Delta}{2} \right) \right ]}{\Delta},\\ h_Y(y) &\rightarrow h_X(g^{-1}(y)) (g^{-1})'(y). \end{aligned} $$ Setting $\Delta_X(x_j) = \Delta$ gives the other (equivalent) expression. $$\begin{aligned} h_X(x) \Delta &= h_Y(y) \left [g \left(x + \dfrac{\Delta}{2} \right) - g \left(x - \dfrac{\Delta}{2} \right) \right ],\\ h_Y(y) &= h_X(g^{-1}(y)) \frac{ \Delta}{g \left(x + \dfrac{\Delta}{2} \right) - g \left(x - \dfrac{\Delta}{2} \right) },\\ h_Y(y) &\rightarrow \frac{h_X(g^{-1}(y))}{g'(g^{-1}(y))}. \end{aligned} $$ Presumably this argument fails when Riemann sums fail and more measure theory is called for, but this line of reasoning satisfies my curiosity well enough. Specifically, the first approach, setting $\Delta_Y(y) = \Delta$ at the outset, inherits the same intuition as explained in @whuber's answer to the other question, but arrives at an expression that will match most other texts (which is desirable to me for pragmatic reasons). Of course, intuition is very personal, so YMMV.
