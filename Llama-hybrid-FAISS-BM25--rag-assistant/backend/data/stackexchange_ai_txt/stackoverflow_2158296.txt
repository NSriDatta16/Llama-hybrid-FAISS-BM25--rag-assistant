How to Split a Paragraph into Sentences

I've been trying to use: $string="The Dr. is here!!! I am glad I'm in the U.S.A. for the Dr. quality is great!!!!!!"; preg_match_all('~.*?[?.!]~s',$string,$sentences); print_r($sentences); But it doesn't work on Dr., U.S.A., etc. Does anyone have any better suggestions?
