ADO.NET Data Services .NET client caching

On my service, I've added the following method: protected override void OnStartProcessingRequest(ProcessRequestArgs args) { base.OnStartProcessingRequest(args); HttpContext.Current.Response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.Public); HttpContext.Current.Response.Cache.SetMaxAge(new TimeSpan(1, 0, 0)); } My client is the regular generated .net client. Nothing appears to be cached. It's going to the server on every request. What needs to be done to enable caching? Thanks, -jaa
