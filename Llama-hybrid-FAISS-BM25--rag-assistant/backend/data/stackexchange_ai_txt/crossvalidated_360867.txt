Predicting house pricing using MLR

My problem I want to predict housing prices in a city (for an upcoming year). My solution Create a MLR, where average housing price is dependent and macroeconomic fundamentals (population, gdp, household income etc.) are independent. How do I proceed with the forecasting? Do I use time series methods to forecast the independent and model the price? Or is it possible to run a regression between the modeled price and time. I am also looking for a piece of literature related to my question.
