You can't do what you're trying to do because the static is intialized before the program starts running -- argptr doesn't exist in context yet. You could try something like this: va_start( argptr, num ); static bool init = 0; static int min = -1; if( !init ) { min = va_arg( argptr, int ); init = true; } static int all_min = -1;
