This paragraph fully covers the native JSON implementations, and libraries that use native JSON implementations: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON#Native_JSON Using native JSON implementation will be considerably faster/safer than using some javascript libraries for same task. However, if some library claims it will try using native implementation whenever possible - it's even better choice that using native JSON directly (compatibility and stuff).
