How to validate k-fold cross validation results for classifiers?

I've applied 6 classifiers on my data set using 5-fold CV to calculate average AUC for each model. What method do you suggest me to determine which model has the highest AUC? I've heard of t-test and Mann Whitney test. But I don't know if using these tests are useful or should I select the best model simply by considering the model with the highest AUC by looking at them?
