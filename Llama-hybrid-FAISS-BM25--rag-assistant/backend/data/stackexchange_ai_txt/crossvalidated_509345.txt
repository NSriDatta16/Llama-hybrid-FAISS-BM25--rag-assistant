How to test whether a variable is changing over time?

I have a variable called pct_spread(i,t) which is calculated as (ask_price(i,t) - bid_price(i,t))/ask_price(i,t) based on ask and bid prices from a broker for different stocks i and time t . This variable is calculated on a minute by minute basis and spans around 20 years. I would like to know how can I test whether this variable is changing over time? What data frequency would you recommend? Should I be using the Dickey-Fuller test for stationarity? UPDATE: Based on the comments I have received I am reformulating the question here. I want to estimate the average per-year change in the spread cost and test it against the null of no change. Any help would be appreciated.
