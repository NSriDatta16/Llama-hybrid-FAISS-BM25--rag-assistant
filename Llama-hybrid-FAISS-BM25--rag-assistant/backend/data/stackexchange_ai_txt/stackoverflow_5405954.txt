Can TFS 2010 Workflow-based team build get Code Coverage results?

Using Workflow to create a build I'd like for the build quality to change depending if the current code coverage threshold is met. I have everything set up but the condition to check the coverage percentages. Is there a way to test if CodeCoveragePercentCovered > vMinThreshold? Once I figure this out, setting the build qualities is simple.
