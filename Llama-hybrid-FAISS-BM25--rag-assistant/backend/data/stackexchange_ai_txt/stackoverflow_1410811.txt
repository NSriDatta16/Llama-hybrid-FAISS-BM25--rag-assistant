How portable is weak linking? #pragma weak my_symbol

How portable is weak linking? #pragma weak my_symbol I see that question: how-to-make-weak-linking-work-with-gcc discusses how to get it working. But is there a good way to do this such that gcc is not required? What is the difference between weak linking and guarding the declartion with an #ifdef? #ifndef my_weak_fn void my_weak_fn(){/* Do nothing */ return;} #endif
