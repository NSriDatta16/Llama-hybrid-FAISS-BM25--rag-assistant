What is the underlying zoo's to.period aggregate function?

While studying xts time series in R I have come across the to.period() function that converts an OHLC or univariate object to a specified periodicity lower than the given data object. I'm trying to understand how it aggregates the values to new values in the lower periodicity, I believed it to be the mean but that does not seem correct having calculated the value myself using the mean for that same period the results are different. So what is the underlying function? Here is an example that shows the different results: data(sample_matrix) samplexts
