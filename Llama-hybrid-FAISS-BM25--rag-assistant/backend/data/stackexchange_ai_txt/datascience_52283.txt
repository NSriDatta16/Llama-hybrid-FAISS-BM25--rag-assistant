Are flat and non-flat geometry a legit terminology in machine learning and statistics? These are terminologies from Mathematics, they are valid in any field. What is the mathematical definition? (Non) flat manifold In mathematics, a (Riemannian) manifold is said to be flat if its curvature is everywhere zero; otherwise non-flat. This is very different than the definition of flat object in geometry . According to that definition, only points, lines, and hyper-planes are flat (not for example hyperspheres or segments). For example, set $\left\{(t,t):t\in(-1,1)\right\}$ is a 1D flat manifold in ${\Bbb R}^2$ , set $\left\{(t,t^2):t\in(-1,1)\right\}$ is a 1D non-flat (positively curved) manifold in ${\Bbb R}^2$ , and a hypersphere is an $n$ D non-flat (positively curved) manifold in ${\Bbb R}^{n+1}$ . Accordingly, a cluster with a (non) flat shape corresponds to a (non) flat manifold. Here are some examples from the document. Points are concentrated around (A) two 1D non-flat manifolds (circles) which are non-convex, (B) two 1D non-flat manifolds (arcs) which are non-convex, (C) three 1D flat manifolds (segments) which are convex, (D) three 0D flat manifolds (centers as points) which are convex. (Non) flat geometry vs a Flat By "flat geometry" the document means " Euclidean geometry " not " a flat object defined in geometry ". If we measure distances (consequently lengths, areas, volumes, etc.) via Euclidean distance we are obeying the Euclidean geometry, otherwise, we are obeying a non-Euclidean geometry. For example, if we measure a distance between two points by following a non-flat manifold ( a geodesic ), we are obeying a non-Euclidean geometry. As an illustration, In (A), the red line measures a distance obeying a flat geometry, the blue line measures the distance obeying a non-flat geometry (by moving along the non-flat manifold). If an appropriate map of manifold to a lower dimension is possible (B), obeying a flat geometry would be equivalent to obeying the non-flat geometry before mapping.
