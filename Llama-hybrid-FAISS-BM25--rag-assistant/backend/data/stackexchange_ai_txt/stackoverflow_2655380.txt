HTTP compression works by the client specifying an Accept-Encoding header with the compression types it accepts: Accept-Encoding: compress, gzip The server then sees this and will chose one of the encoding types based on the accept encoding rules defined here . The response will be in one of the accepted values or the identity encoding. Requests: In general a request can't come in compressed first because the communication starts with a request. An HTTP client could send an options request though and use that if you have control of the client and server source code you could do this. The OPTIONS method represents a request for information about the communication options available on the request/response chain identified by the Request-URI. This method allows the client to determine the options and/or requirements associated with a resource, or the capabilities of a server, without implying a resource action or initiating a resource retrieval. An example of this is an apache module for SVN, and also an svn client. They can be configured to do HTTP compression on the request data. See RFC 2616: Section 9
