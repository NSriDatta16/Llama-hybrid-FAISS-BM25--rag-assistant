If these are the values for the dependent variable, you can use multinomial logistic regression. However, usually, one would delete the cases where the DV is missing - unless it being missing is meaningful. If you do decide to delete the missing, then it might make sense to use ordinal logistic with recoding so that 1 = yes, 2 = maybe, 3 = no. If this is an independent variable, please specify. Also, if you give context, it would help. My blog post "How to ask a statistics question" may help you formulate this question in a better way
