Sharepoint is not versioning tool for code. It is a document repository with workflow engine. In fact it is much more than that. You can create sites and site collections in the Sharepoint. you can use it as intranet, extranet and internet with tight security. The advantage for c# programmer is that sharepoint is built upon .NET framework, so we can create the same forms, use same membership provider classes as we do with .NET websites. It is having in-built workflow engine, so we can route the documents. Apart from that there is a facility called BDC (Business data catalogue) which allow us to connect with external data sources, like SAP, peoplesoft, sieble etc. Sharepoint is basically a portal which will offer you the facilities, which ordinary person and a business can use.
