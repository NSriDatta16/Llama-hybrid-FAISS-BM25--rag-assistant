Eclipse rcp classloader hell: moved class still visible at compiletime but not at runtime anymore

I've a strange and new issue with an eclipse 3.5 rcp application: Everything worked fine, then I changed the running system and moved a single class from one plugin to a dependent plugin. No big issue, but all of a sudden the application complains with a class not found exception (or NoClassDefFoundError - don't know exactly but will look it up and edit the post...) I double, triple, ... checked all that I know, and made sure, that the manifest contains the dependancy with the correct version number and that the package is correctly exported in the other plugin. Eclipse jdk doesn't complain (no compiler errors/warnings) but when I debug just to the point where the class is instantiated and use 'CTRL+SHIFT+I' to inspect the 'new MyClass()' statement, the inspectors tooltip sais, that it can't resolve that class. Any help, hint and encouraging comment is highly appreciated!
