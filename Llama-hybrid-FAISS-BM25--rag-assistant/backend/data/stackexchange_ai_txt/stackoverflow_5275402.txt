is there built-in way to make DevExpress XtraGrid GridView column headers/captions diagonal to save horizontal space?

I have a whole bunch of very narrow columns in a DevExpress GridView and I want to save on column header width by making the caption text (which is too wide even at 3-4 letter abbreviations) slanted / diagonal. Well, so I guess I could get rid of text captions and replace them with pictures of diagonal text, at least if GridView will allow sufficient height for the header. Is there any built-in way to just display the rotated text without going the image way? I don't think I am the first programmer out there trying to squeeze out horizontal space like that, so this doesn't sound like an outlandish thing to support in a popular grid component :-) If not, and so I do have to use an image for column header, any relevant suggestions or warnings?
