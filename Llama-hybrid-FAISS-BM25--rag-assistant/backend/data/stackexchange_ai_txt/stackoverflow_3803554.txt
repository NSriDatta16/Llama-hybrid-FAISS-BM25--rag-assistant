The code you posted will not work since you are performing an initialization of the instance variable bubbleTimer outside of an instance method. Just call the scheduledTimer: method when you want the timer to start, but from inside another instance method (like touchesBegan: maybe? But be careful or you'll continue to spawn timers...) and not in the open like a static variable initialization.
