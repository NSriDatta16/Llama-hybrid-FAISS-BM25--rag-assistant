Neural networks are too often used as a black box without correct model specification. Indeed, you could take your 256 values per individual and model it as a Feed-forward NN with 256 inputs, maybe 5 to 10 perceptrons on the hidden layer, and hope to get a nice output. However to choose a correct model it would be a good idea to do some preliminary analysis. Maybe you already did, but at least I have now the following questions: How are the values distributed? Normal, symmetric, skewed? (often pre-transformations are very useful!) Do they correlate with each other? How many principal components are needed to explain most of the variation? (If only few, you need not a lot of perceptrons) Do the 256 values measure the same thing? Do you have per subject a time series of 256 values ranging from second 0-2 until 510-512?? After getting a better idea of the data, the model specification is feasible.
