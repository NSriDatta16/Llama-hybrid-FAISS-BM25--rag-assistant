The most common problem I see with running SSIS packages from .Net apps is a misunderstanding of where they're run. SSIS packages are not server-based execution units that are run in the context of the server they reside on, like T-SQL commands or stored procedures. The SSIS package is loaded into the process you're calling it from, and executed locally. This means that: SSIS must be installed on your web server, or You need to architect a remote execution solution for SSIS ( dtExecRemote , SQL Agent Jobs , ...)
