Best recommendation would be to always use a transaction. This link from the NHProf documentation, best explains why. When we don't define our own transactions, it falls back into implicit transaction mode, where every statement to the database runs in its own transaction, resulting in a large performance cost (database time to build and tear down transactions), and reduced consistency. Even if we are only reading data, we should use a transaction, because using transactions ensures that we get consistent results from the database. NHibernate assumes that all access to the database is done under a transaction, and strongly discourages any use of the session without a transaction. (BTW, if you are doing serious NHibernate work, consider trying out NHProf).
