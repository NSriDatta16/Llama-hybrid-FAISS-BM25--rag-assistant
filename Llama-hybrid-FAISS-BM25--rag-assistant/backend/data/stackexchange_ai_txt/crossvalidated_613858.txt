A properly constructed contingency table lets a chi-square test takes the overall sample size into account. For your situation, it's a cross-tabulation based on severe/not in one dimension and mutation present/absent in the other. In your first example, with 8000 total observations, 1000 with severe disease, 30 with the mutation and 27 of those having severe disease, a contingency table looks like this: mat1 If you do similar tests based on 20% of those with a mutation having severe disease, however, you will not find a "significant" result if there are only 30 with the mutation. If there are 300 with the mutation and the same fraction with severe disease, then you will get a highly significant association. There are nevertheless a few problems with your approach. First, if you have many mutations then you must deal with the multiple-comparisons problem . Second, from your last paragraph it seems that you are undertaking a regression model or similar analysis for severity. In that case you should be incorporating the model's predictors into a binary (e.g., logistic) regression model instead of looking at the raw contingency tables from the original data set. Omitting any outcome-associate predictor from a binary regression model tends to bias the magnitudes of estimated association downward for the included predictor. But that's just what you are doing if you ignore the other predictors and just look at mutation and disease status as you propose. Third, this one-mutation-at-a-time approach means that you will miss potentially important associations that depend on combinations of mutations. You might consider a principled approach like LASSO that can evaluate multiple genes together.
