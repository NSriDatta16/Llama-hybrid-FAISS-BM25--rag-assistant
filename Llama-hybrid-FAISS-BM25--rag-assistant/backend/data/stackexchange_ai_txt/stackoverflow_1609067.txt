This Post was my first followed link on a Google inquiry. You could simply grab the Stylesheets and JS files from the iPhone Guide and modify as needed. Everything is there - you'll just have to familiarize yourself with the code. I'm kind of digging how it all works together as well. But I'd want to remove the call ups that force the redirect if it's not an iPhone (or a User Agent hasn't been changed). Just implement some of it's functionality into a standard website - I love how it works in a desktop version of Safari.
