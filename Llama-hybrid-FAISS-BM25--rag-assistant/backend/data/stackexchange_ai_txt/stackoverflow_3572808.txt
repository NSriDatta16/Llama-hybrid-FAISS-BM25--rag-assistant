Do an on-disk external mergesort on the file to sort the integers (counting them if that's not already known). Once the file is sorted, seek to the middle number (odd case), or average the two middle numbers (even case) in the file to get the median. The amount of memory used is adjustable and unaffected by the number of integers in the original file. One caveat of the external sort is that the intermediate sorting data needs to be written to disk. Given n = number of integers in the original file: Running time: O(nlogn) Memory: O(1) , adjustable Disk: O(n)
