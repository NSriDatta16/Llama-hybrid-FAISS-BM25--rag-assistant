Statistical analysis for two questionnaires

I am working on a research paper and I need to organize the statistical analysis part. I have two questionnaires with the same number of participants (15 cases). Basically, we asked the participants to play two different games with two different conditions. Imagine: Game A (under conditions 1 and 2) (questionnaire with 5 questions). Game B (under conditions 1 and 2) (questionnaire with 7 questions). And we asked them to fill out the questionnaire to estimate the overall satisfaction for each condition. I am wondering that whats could be the best statistical method here to analyze the results for each condition. Is (one/two way) ANOVA a good solution? If yes is it a good way to do it on Python? (unfortunately, I am not familiar with R and I'm kinda in rush) Here is an example of the result of the questionnaires for only one person (1 out of 15).
