Hypothesis testing - speeds before and after

I have the following data: A | B --------------- 9,794 | 10,7098 9,8022 | 10,5176 9,7055 | 11,1039 9,7091 | 11,1474 10,1882| 10,4693 10,2204| 10,8072 9,8221 | 11,2713 9,9272 | 11,2888 10,0855| 10,9026 10,108 | 10,872 10,1433| 10,9649 10,1432| 10,9805 9,7451 | 10,5126 9,8088 | 10,4722 10,0242| 10,6095 10,0402| 10,7719 9,5203 | 11,0741 9,5211 | 11,0357 9,4078 | 11,1146 9,4367 | 11,1176 10,3585| 11,0609 10,3234| 11,0389 10,0555| 10,6333 9,9836 | 10,4394 9,8306 | 10,2537 9,8836 | 10,3016 9,9489 | 10,1945 9,9176 | 10,339 10,0038| 10,639 9,9711 | 10,6681 ----------------- 9,91431| 10,77706 - Average 0,2404 | 0,31310438 - Standard deviation It represents the seconds a computer program did when using configuration A and B. I run the program 30 times with configuration A, and another 30 times with configuration B. I want to construct a hypothesis test that proves configuration B runs slower than A (or configuration B runs with a different time than A). What test should I use and what values go where? I did some tests using the formulas and got this value por z (or t, dont remember): -11,769 . Isn't this number really low? The critical point for 5% is 1.96 (two-tailed) and -11.769 is really deep into the critical zone (rejecting H0) with high probability. I think i'm doing something wrong so please help me. Thanks!
