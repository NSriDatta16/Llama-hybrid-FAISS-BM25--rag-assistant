How to statistically test an increase?

I have two temporal networks in which I report their number of nodes and the average degree in different time intervals: time Nodes_Network_1 Nodes_Network_2 Average_degree_Network_1 Average_degree_Network_2 time_1 150 57 3.2 2.8 time_2 477 102 3.7 3.2 time_3 949 170 5.9 3.4 time_4 1137 314 6.7 4.8 time_5 1167 263 8.9 5.9 I want show that: While the Average_degree increases over time for both networks, I'm mainly interested in testing the last time interval (from time_4 to time_5) and I'd like to be able to say "The increase in Average_degree_Net_1 (from 6.7 to 8.9) is statistically higher than than for Average_degree_Net_2 (from 4.8 to 5.9)". what statistical test can be used here?
