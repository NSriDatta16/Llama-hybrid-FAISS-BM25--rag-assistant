I suggest the approach used by Magento. You have a formAction method in your controller that displays the form, then another action formPostAction that handles the form submission. If the validation fails for example, you should create a proper error message, then store in the session an array with the form data just submitted and redirect to the form page. The formAction() method should have a bit of logic to handle data in session, cleaning those once used for the output, to avoid security issues.
