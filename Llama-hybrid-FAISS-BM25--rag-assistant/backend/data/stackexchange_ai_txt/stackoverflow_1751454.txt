Aside from the issue of the range needing to be +1 as so to reach to #3 (cf Remark by Vincent R), (one of) the problem(s) is that the fullname variable is overwritten with each of the new case of non empty label. It's hard to comment about the code to just fix it, i.e. I'd like to suggest and reorganize it a bit. For example by introducing a function to extract the name / path of a given image, given the UI object; this would avoid some of the repetition. Such a function, or the the caller of it, would then add each new fullname to a list thereof, which can then be used by the upload loop. See Tendayi Mawushe's solution, which is respectful of the original structure but introduces a list as suggested. BTW this list then can be iterated over as the basis of the loop, instead of relying on the range() function, and this is much more pythonic (and this removes the need of fixing the problem with missing #3 with the range). While being handy on occasion, with Python, these numeric range driven loops are often an invitation to revisit the design.
