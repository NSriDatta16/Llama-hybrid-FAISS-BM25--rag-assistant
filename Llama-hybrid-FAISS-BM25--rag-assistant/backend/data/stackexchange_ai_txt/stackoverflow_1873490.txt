What are some common SocketExceptions and what is causing them?

I've been caught catching SocketExceptions belonging to subspecies like for example Broken pipe or Connection reset . The question is what to do with the slippery bastards once they're caught. Which ones may I happily ignore and which need further attention? I'm looking for a list of different SocketExceptions and their causes.
