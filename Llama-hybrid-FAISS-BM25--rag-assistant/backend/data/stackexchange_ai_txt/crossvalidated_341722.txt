How to Calculate the multi scale approximate entropy for a financial time series

I want to calculate the multiscale approximate entropy for the financial time series. The code which I got to calculate approximate entropy is as follows: approx_entropy(ts, edim = 2, r = 0.2*sd(ts), elag = 1) But, I need to calculate multiscale approximate entropy which is not available in the particular package.
