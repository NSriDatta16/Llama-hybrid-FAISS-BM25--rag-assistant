If you are using JNI on Windows, Dependency Walker is going to be your friend. But, before we get to that first verify that the JRE can find your JNIOpenCV.dll by adding: System.out.println("java.library.path="+System.getProperty("java.library.path")); to the static constructor block. However, I think the issue here isn't finding your JNIOpenCV.dll file, but a file that it depends on. Open your .dll in dependency walker (just drag it in there) and look out for any error messages (except msjava.dll - ignore that, it doesn't matter). Most likely my hunch is that you need the Microsoft Visual C/C++ runtime libraries, download them from the Visual Studio website and put them in the same folder as your dll. Best of luck!
