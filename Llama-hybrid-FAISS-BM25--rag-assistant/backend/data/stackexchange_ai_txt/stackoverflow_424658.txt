Two things: First you will want one CSS file for the project. The whole point of CSS is to permit you to create UI standardization across your site and to separate these UI specs from the pages themselves. That way you could, for example, change the font for your "warning" (or whatever) labels across the entire site. If you are thinking about tweaking a specific page, your first impulse should be to avoid that temptation and stick with an existing style (by ID or class). If you must create a new styling, I'd still put that in the generic CSS file - just give it a unique name. In all likelihood, you'll find use for it later anyway in another file. Note that this doesn't affect performance; in fact a single file improves performance as it will be downloaded just once and then cached. Separate CSS files for each page will result in more downloads and a bloated profile. Second, take the time to investigate "Themes" if you are working in ASP.NET. This will permit you, for example, to create one CSS class for one overall site appearance (e.g. a "Blue" theme) and to then swap out the entire appearance for another (e.g. a "Green" theme). It also offers you the ability to organize both your CSS and the images to which they refer in ways that I think you'll like (you can provide multiple, alternate CSS files & image directories to customize the appearance of your site).
