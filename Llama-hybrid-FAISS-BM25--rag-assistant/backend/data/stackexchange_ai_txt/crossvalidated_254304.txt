Maybe I'm not getting the point of ilanman's answer as well as of some of the comments here, but afaiks, the answer is simply that OLS = log L(Gaussian) i.e. the OLS corresponds to the log likelihood of a regression with a normal / Gaussian distribution. You can see this by logging the formula for the Gaussian - the $\sigma$ will factor out, and you see that the OLS maximizes the likelihood. So, OLS estimation IS MLE for a Gaussian error. Logistic Regression assumes a Bernoulli / Binomial error, that is why you don't do OLS.
