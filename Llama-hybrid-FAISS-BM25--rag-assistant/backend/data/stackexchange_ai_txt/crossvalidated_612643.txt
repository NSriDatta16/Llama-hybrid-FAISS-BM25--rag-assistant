are moving average and lag modeling the same?

I am not clear on the difference between the two concepts but I am interested in air pollution exposure in a given period of time and in the literature, I know that lag models are used. I have also seen the moving average for air pollution, is this the same as lag models? If not, what is the difference between them?
