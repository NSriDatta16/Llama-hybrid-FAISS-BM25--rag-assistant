Binary classification problem

Im new to ML, I have a data set for Music sales info for Vinyls, the data set contains: Author Album Title Genre Country RevenueGenerated AverageRevenueGenerated My goal is to create a Model which I can help me understand which Music may generate a lot of revenue (Boolean). I created a field AverageRevenueGenerated which is the average of all Revenue generated for all artists. Im looking for a tool that can help me associate or generate insights based on input signals above. This cold be automatically or a specific guide that allows me to say for example if: UK + Industrial IT + Opera Daft Punk + Electro Will be potential high revenues. I found house prices example: https://yalantis.com/blog/predictive-algorithm-for-house-price/ is it the same type of problem? I'm looking which input signals may be the highest revenue. Any insights or pointers will be helpful.
