How can a variable have a positive association through logistic regression, yet a negative association through Cox regression?

I am undertaking some medical research using R. My outcome of interest is mortality in the intensive care unit. Data My data looks like this (there are ~15,000 rows). age illness_score drug_y_use var_x time mortality 1 48 35 1 1 5.88 0 2 84 56 0 0 1.78 0 3 54 25 1 0 6.15 0 4 67 24 1 0 13.71 1 5 71 20 0 0 2.53 0 6 81 28 0 0 1.02 0 I am interested in the effect of variable x (var_x) on icu mortality, correcting for the other variables: age, illness score and use of drug y. logistic regression Using the glm function: glm(mortality ~ var_x + illness_score + drug_y_use + age, data = data.df, family=binomial())) obtains the following: Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -7.074665 0.179259 -39.466 Exponentiating the coefficients reveals a positive association with var_x on mortality exp(glm$coefficients) var_x illness_score drug_y_use age 1.45 1.11 4.07 1.007 Cox regression Now asking a similar question with Cox Proportional Hazards (using the "time" column to determine the time of censoring (mortality = 0) or event (mortality = 1) coxph(Surv(time, mortality) ~var_x + illness_score + drug_y_use + age , data = data.df Gives the following results: n= 15189, number of events= 1331 coef exp(coef) se(coef) z Pr(>|z|) var_x -0.285591 0.751570 0.069976 -4.081 4.48e-05 *** illness_score 0.061434 1.063360 0.003378 18.185 Now we have a negative coefficient and the exponentiated coefficient is below 0 suggesting a negative association with var_x Summary / key question Using the same data- I have a significant positive association (exp coeff = 1.45) of var_x on mortality using glm I have a significant negative association (exp coeff = 0.75) of var_x on mortality using coxph How is this possible please? The only difference is the addition of timing data with coxph :how can this reverse an association?
