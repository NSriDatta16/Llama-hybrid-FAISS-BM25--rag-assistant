How to bulid a new neural network or use a learned one for prediction when some variables are missing

Let's say I have a neural network for weather forecasting. The network uses temperature, wind speed and humidity as its inputs. However, I only have temperature and wind speed data available, so I can't get a prediction with this network. Is there a way to build a new network that can handle variable input size? That is, I need to get a prediction with only 2/3 inputs. Please link papers if possible.
