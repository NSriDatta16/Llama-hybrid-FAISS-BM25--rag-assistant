Profiling what is normal with categorical data

I need some pointers / suggestions ... I like to profile a whole bunch of categorical user data - i.e. things like who talks to who, who deals with what product categories typically, and identify ones that don't follow a norm. An anomaly detection problem perhaps ... but what sort of algos should I be looking at? Should I be hot encoding my fields to achieve this? All the examples I read (k means, one class SVM) are focused on numerical datasets ...
