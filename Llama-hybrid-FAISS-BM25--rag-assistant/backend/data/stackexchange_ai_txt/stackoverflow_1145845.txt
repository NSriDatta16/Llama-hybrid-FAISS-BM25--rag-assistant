That is indeed a database error. One can reproduce the error in the NerdDinner example MVC app: Generate a new Class Diagram Drag the Dinner model class onto it Then right-click >> create instance >> parameter-less constructor Dinner() I believe this error is happening because the class silently depends on things like a connection string in web.config and other things intrinsic to the the web host, which don't exist at design-time in the Class Diagram tool. Are you trying to use the Class Diagram tool on a Web Application project? It appears Microsoft is dead-ending the Object Test Bench due to lack of interest: https://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/ViewFeedback.aspx?FeedbackID=423741
