You can do this more elegantly using listeners and Actions. Use an AbstractAction for each button. (You can reuse them for menu items as well.) Then you can enable/disable the action and the button will update to match. If you add a TableModelListener to your table model it will be notified of all changes and can make the updates to the actions. You won't be creating your own MVC. You will be using the inherent MVC in the Swing classes themselves.
