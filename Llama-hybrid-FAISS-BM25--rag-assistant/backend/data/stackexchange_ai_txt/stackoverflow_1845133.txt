Ok, sorry guys. It turns out I was just over-thinking this way too much. In the end I ended up re-exporting my SWF file (I think I might have done it somewhat improperly the first time) and dumbing down my JavaScript significantly. I still included an embedded copy of all "four" fonts in the Flash file--I set the main dynamic text box to Myriad Pro/Regular, and then I created 3 more dynamic text boxes (with no text in them) set to Bold, Italic, and Bold Italic respectively. Then I made sure to click "Character Embedding" on all of them and ensure the characters I wanted were included. Finally my JavaScript ended up looking like this: var myriad_pro = {src: 'myriad_pro.swf'}; sIFR.activate(myriad_pro); sIFR.replace(myriad_pro, { selector: 'h1.sifr', css: { '.sIFR-root': {'color': '#0000ff'} } }); I didn't have to change the fonts or anything, but I did still have to make sure all four got included in the Flash file. Looking back it seems a bit odd that it did work when I said font-family: "Myriad Pro Italic" , etc., since that isn't technically the font name. But for whatever reason that caused the conflict with the colors, so when I just referred to it as plain old "Myriad Pro" and let it figure out the italicizing and bolding, then it all worked. And @Mark - the lowercase/uppercase color hex codes don't matter. However it does have to be the full 6-digit hex code (i.e. #00f won't work).
