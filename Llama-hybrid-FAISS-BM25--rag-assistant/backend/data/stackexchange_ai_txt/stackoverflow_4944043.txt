Estimate the rate of height growth of humans in km/ hr?

Someone asked me this question during an interview. How would you go about this? This is not a random BS question but has good math behind it. The profile was for an analytic position so they wanted someone with good math skills. I couldn't really figure out a good way of calculating this. Here is some data I collected after the interview which might be helpful: Height growth depends mainly on genetic factors, diet, standard of life etc. Human grow rate is fastest at birth rapidly declining between 0 & 2, tapering to a slowly declining rate & then a rapid rise at puberty say 13 which gives you a second maxima followed by a steady decline to 0 at roughly age 18. You may use this data or make your own assumptions to answer the question. Also how would you go about answering based on just the title of this question, knowing that you need to demonstrate strong math skills?
