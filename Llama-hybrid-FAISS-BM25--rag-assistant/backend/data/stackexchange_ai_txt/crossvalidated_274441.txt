No, it is not paired. Paired and un-paired depend on the randomization used to apply the treatment. So to justify the use of the paired t-test, you would have had to select 15 pairs of plants - presumably on some grounds of common similarity. For each pair, you would toss a coin and randomly assign a drag to one member of the pair. In the end, you would have 15 with drags and 15 without, but the randomization would be different than in the study you describe. The idea of doing a paired test is to reduce the plant to plant variation by randomizing across similar plants. In an unpaired study with a treatment applied randomly to 15 of 30 subjects, there are $\binom{30}{15}$ possible samples. But with a paired experiment, there are $2^{15}$. The sample spaces are different, so the model is different.
