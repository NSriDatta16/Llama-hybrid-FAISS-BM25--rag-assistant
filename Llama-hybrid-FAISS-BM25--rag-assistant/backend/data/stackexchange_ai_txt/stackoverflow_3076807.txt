VS 2010, NUNit, and "The breakpoint will not currently be hit. No symbols have been loaded for this document"

Using Windows 7 32 bit, VS 2010, .NET 4 DLL, NUnit (2.5.5) to unit test the application. I'm currently getting the following error; seen plenty of posts and tried the following: restart machine restart VS delete bin/obj and reload clean/rebuild But I cannot get NUnit to hit my breakpoints when running; I set the NUNit test project to point to the nunit.exe, and to load the testing .NET 4 DLL, but when I run it doesn't find the breakpoint, "no symbols have been loaded". I tried debug >windows > modules, it doesn't even show my unit testing project when I run it. I found this, to use the nunit agent: http://groups.google.com/group/nunit-discuss/browse_thread/thread/5680d7def5b6982f But I get an error when I use the nunit agent too. I was using nunit-agent-x86.exe, but I get a system.formatexception and it crashes... Can anybody help? Thanks.
