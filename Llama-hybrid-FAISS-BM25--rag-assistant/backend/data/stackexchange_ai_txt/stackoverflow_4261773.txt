Not sure why that breaks it, but the values aren't being written to the DOM. Though, the css() function is really just a shortcut to editing the "style" attribute inline on the element, so you could do this to get the same result: $("#dragable").attr('style','cursor: url(images/grabbing.gif), -moz-grabbing, auto');
