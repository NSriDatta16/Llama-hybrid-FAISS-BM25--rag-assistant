Perplexity is essentially a geometric average of inverse probabilities . So for your case, a natural interpretation would be to compute the sample average over the discrete points, i.e. $$\exp\left[-\tfrac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N\log\left[f\left[x_i\right]\right]\right]$$ So log perplexity would be the average of negative log likelihood over the data points. (How useful this is may be a matter of debate .)
