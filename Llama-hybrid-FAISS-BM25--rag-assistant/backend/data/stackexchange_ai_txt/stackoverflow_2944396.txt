and i want to add more and more items (buttons and labels ) to my GUI. can you please help me Your question has nothing to do with labels and images. You need to understand how to use Layout Managers to organize the components you add to a frame. So start by reading the Swing tutorial on Layout Managers . There are plenty of examples you can download and play with. Also you can nest different layout managers on different panels.
