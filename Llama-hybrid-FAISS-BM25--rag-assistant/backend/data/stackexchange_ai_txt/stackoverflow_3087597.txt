SQLite is a very small database system. It provides database functionality to things that typically weren't treated as databases, such as application settings. Ruby on Rails uses SQLite (and certainly Django) for testing purposes before web applications are deployed in larger environments. The iPhone uses SQLite to store application settings. A SQLite database is stored on a file system as a single file. Moving a SQLite database is as simple as "mv" or drag & drop.
