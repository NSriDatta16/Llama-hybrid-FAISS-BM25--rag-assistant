Vista window appears at the top and cannot be deleted

I have no idea how he did it but on my dad's laptop, which is running Vista, there is a window at the top; you can only drag it down but not remove, minimize or maximize it as those options do not appear. I restarted but it's still there. Here's a screenshot of what I mean: How do I remove it? It used to be my laptop but I've never seen that when I used it.
