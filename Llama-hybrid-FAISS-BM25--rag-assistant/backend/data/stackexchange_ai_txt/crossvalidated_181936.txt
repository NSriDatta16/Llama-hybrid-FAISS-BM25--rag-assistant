The best I could get to was this research work which mentions about active learning. So what I came up with is that I first performed Kmeans clustering and got the central clusters (assuming 5 clusters I took 3 clusters descending ordered by length) and took 1000 msgs from each. Then I would assign it to be labelled by the user. The next process would be training using logistic regression on the labelled data and getting the probabilities of unlabelled data and then if I have probability close to 0.5 or in range of 0.4 to 0.6 which means it is uncertain I would assign it to be labelled and then the process would continue.
