Getting Bundle [] in Eclipse of all the bundles

I am writing an application that uses Equinox as my OSGi framework. I am trying to discover all of the bundles that are known at the time that my bundle is registered. I attempted to use the following line to retrieve all of the available bundles. However, EclipseStarter.getSystemBundleContext().getBundles(); gives me a warning of... Discouraged access: The method getSystemBundleContext() from the type EclipseStarter is not accessible due to restriction on required library D:\java\eclipse\plugins\org.eclipse.osgi_3.4.0.v20080605-1900.jar What is the proper usage to get a list of all of the available bundles within the framework?
