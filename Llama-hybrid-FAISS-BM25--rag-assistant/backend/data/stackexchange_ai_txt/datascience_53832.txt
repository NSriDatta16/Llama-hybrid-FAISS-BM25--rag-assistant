There are two phases in Machine Learning Training (creation of model) Inference (deployment of model) Now coming to your question of what do we mean by model. Either in neural networks(which is deep learning) or any traditional machine learning methods, what you are trying to do is map an approximate function between input and output. You try to get the parameters of the function using training and then use those parameters during inference to predict output for new unseen inputs. So, model is nothing but parameters. Objective of training is to find these parameters. For example in neural networks, we have parameters as weights and bias . So, weights and bias of all layers of neural network together constitute a model . Final output of training is nothing but weights and bias of all layers of neural network. We store them, deploy them where ever necessary and use them for inference.
