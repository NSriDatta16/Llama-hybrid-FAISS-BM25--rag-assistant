Tool that shows unit dependencies for Delphi 2010 or Delphi 7 program

We're trying to untangle a hairball of 100's of units, removing some. It would be helpful if there was tool that would show us what units were explicitly using unit X. Penganza doesn't seem to have a report that does that. (Although it has lots of other useful reports.) Can anyone suggest a tool or strategy for doing this, other than just hiding unit x and then hitting F9 ... repeatedly?
