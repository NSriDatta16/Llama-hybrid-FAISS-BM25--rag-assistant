where to keep temporary data?

I'm doing a system with Codeigniter , this is my first system with CI, and i'm also novice to PHP too. I'm doing this for a hospital, in this i have the following problem junior doctor first check the 1st visit patients and then if he can't handle them he refer them to the senior doctor from registration room some patients are send to the eye checking room to check their eyes and then they go to the junior doctor like wise i have temporary data to be kept on the system, references from one room to another and so on... i need to get this details to the main GUI of the each person; for example in the Senior doctors UI there will be a tab named 1St time patients, in that the patients that was referred by the junior doctor will be shown to him! so i need to refer to the patients that was sent to senior doctor from the junior doctor and show them in the senior doctor's UI. so my problem is how can i keep this temporary data to be referenced by the system? keeping them in the tables is not appropriate as i think because at the end of the day these data is not stored any where, only the patient table and few other tables will be keeping the data. guys how can i achieve this kind of thing? any method of achieving this? technology that is easier to master that will allow me to keep temporary data?please give me some references or help by code to over come this problem. regards, Rangana
