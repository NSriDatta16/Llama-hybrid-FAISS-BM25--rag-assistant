The Magento autoloader works just fine. Please echo the value of $block and add that to your question. Your block name will probably follow the naming convention: YourCompany_YourModule_Block_Some_Path . If that not the case, that is probably your error. If that is the case, please make sure that the file (obviously, switch path to match your class) app/code/local/YourCompany/YourModule/Block/Some/Path.php exists and contains the right class declaration. If that is also true, make sure that Apache has the rights to read that file. Once you've figured out this issue, you may want to consider moving over to Magento's loading methods. The "right" way to do this in Magento (assuming the above classname again) is: createBlock("yourmodule/some_path"); Using the Magento loader will save you a lot of trouble later down the road, and allow others to use your Magento code with more assurance. Hope that helps! Thanks, Joe
