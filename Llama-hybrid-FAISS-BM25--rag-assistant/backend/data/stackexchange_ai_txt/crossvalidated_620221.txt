Is there a way to estimate dependence between an observed variable and an unobserved variable?

I'm attempting to do some open-ended exploratory analysis/model building on real-valued time series data. I am explicitly not assuming that all elements of my class of models are linear in the lagged values and/or the lagged errors. Let $X_t$ denote a time series (in this case, a sequence of real numbers, indexed by discrete time). Putting aside the discussion of the impact of stationarity/nonstationarity, for purely autoregressive models, learning about the dependence structure between say $X_{t-1}$ and $X_t$ seems relatively approachable in that one can estimate various statistics between them such as correlation or mutual information to quantify the amount of dependence between them and among other methods, can plot one against the other to determine potentially how they depend on each other. Let us assume that for whatever reason, perhaps through use of Auto Mutual Information/Partial Auto Mutual Information and extending the usual heuristics of ACF/PACF plots to the AMI/PAMI plots, we decide that a good model might be a not-necessarily-linear MA(1) model: $$X_t = m(\varepsilon_{t-1}) + \varepsilon_t, m \in \mathcal{M}.$$ where $\mathcal{M}$ is our collection of models under consideration such as linear regressions or neural networks. What I'm wanting to know is, is there a way we can do a similar sort of thing for $\varepsilon_{t-1}$ and $X_t$ as previously described for $X_{t-1}$ and $X_t$ (visualizing/estimating dependence without assuming a relation) despite $\varepsilon_{t-1}$ being unobservable? Moreso, can we do it without assuming a functional form for $m$ and approximating the errors as detailed here ? (very good intuition for MA models in that post, btw) I realize that this may probably not be feasible/really possible due to the relaxing of tractability assumptions and completely get if assuming a functional form for $m$ while recursively approximating the error terms and estimating the parameters of $m$ is the "best" we can do due to the latent nature of the true error terms. I know that this post somewhat addresses my question, but am unsure how to apply what's there to my exploratory data analysis that I want to apply to the error terms. Thanks as always! :)
