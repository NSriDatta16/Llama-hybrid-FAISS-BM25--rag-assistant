Without knowing the "this" in your "there is always this internet explorer script error that I am seeing" : You are aware that PHP scripts need to be executed by the server, for example by Apache with mod_php ? When not having the server execute the PHP code, your browser will not get just HTML, but also the non-executed PHP code that is still embedded within that HTML, which it does not understand. So: where does your program fetch the PHP files from? (If I understand your problem correctly then you would see the same effect when just dragging local PHP files into your browser, without using any server. Does that indeed give you the same problem?)
