Why Not Prune Your Neural Network?

Han et al . (2015) used a method of iterative pruning to reduce their network to only 10% of its original size with no loss of accuracy by removing weights with very low values, since these changed very little. As someone new to the machine learning area, why wouldn't you do this (unless your network is already very small)? It seems to me that for deep learning your network would be smaller, faster, more energy efficient, etc. at no real cost. Should we all use this method for larger neural networks?
