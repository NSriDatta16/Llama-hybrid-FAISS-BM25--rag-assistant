Python subprocess.Popen "OSError: [Errno 12] Cannot allocate memory"

Note: This question was originally asked here but the bounty time expired even though an acceptable answer was not actually found. I am re-asking this question including all details provided in the original question. A python script is running a set of class functions every 60 seconds using the sched module: # sc is a sched.scheduler instance sc.enter(60, 1, self.doChecks, (sc, False)) The script is running as a daemonised process using the code here . A number of class methods that are called as part of doChecks use the subprocess module to call system functions in order to get system statistics: ps = subprocess.Popen(['ps', 'aux'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE).communicate()[0] This runs fine for a period of time before the entire script crashing with the following error: File "/home/admin/sd-agent/checks.py", line 436, in getProcesses File "/usr/lib/python2.4/subprocess.py", line 533, in __init__ File "/usr/lib/python2.4/subprocess.py", line 835, in _get_handles OSError: [Errno 12] Cannot allocate memory The output of free -m on the server once the script has crashed is: $ free -m total used free shared buffers cached Mem: 894 345 549 0 0 0 -/+ buffers/cache: 345 549 Swap: 0 0 0 The server is running CentOS 5.3. I am unable to reproduce on my own CentOS boxes nor with any other user reporting the same problem. I have tried a number of things to debug this as suggested in the original question: Logging the output of free -m before and after the Popen call. There is no significant change in memory usage i.e. memory is not gradually being used up as the script runs. I added close_fds=True to the Popen call but this made no difference - the script still crashed with the same error. Suggested here and here . I checked the rlimits which showed (-1, -1) on both RLIMIT_DATA and RLIMIT_AS as suggested here . An article suggested the having no swap space might be the cause but swap is actually available on demand (according to the web host) and this was also suggested as a bogus cause here . The processes are being closed because that is the behaviour of using .communicate() as backed up by the Python source code and comments here . The entire checks can be found at on GitHub here with the getProcesses function defined from line 442. This is called by doChecks() starting at line 520. The script was run with strace with the following output before the crash: recv(4, "Total Accesses: 516662\nTotal kBy"..., 234, 0) = 234 gettimeofday({1250893252, 887805}, NULL) = 0 write(3,
