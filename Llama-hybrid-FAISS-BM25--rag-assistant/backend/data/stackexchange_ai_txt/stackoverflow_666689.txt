Pointers tend to be a sore point of archives, as you've discovered. Is it possible for you to use NSMutableArray for your storage requirements, as this might simplify matters for you. http://developer.apple.com/DOCUMENTATION/Cocoa/Conceptual/Archiving/Archiving.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000047 If you're not going to use NSMutableArray, you probably want to create a container class that responds to the encodeWithCoder message, and encode the list that way. You're not going to store the pointers, but rather use them to walk your container, and archive it in some deterministic order.
