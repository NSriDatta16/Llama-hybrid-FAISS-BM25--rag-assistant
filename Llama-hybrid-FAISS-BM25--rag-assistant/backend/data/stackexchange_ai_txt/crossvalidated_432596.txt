What is the relationship between quadraric and categorical logistic regression models?

Consider two logistic regression models Y on x, one where x appears in the model as a categorical variable, and one where x appears in the predictor as both a linear term and as a quadratic term. What is the relationship of the log-likelihood for the quadratic model to the log-likelihood of the categorical model? Assuming they are the same; see outout below In short, what is the relationship between the quadratic and categorical model? How could you prove your assertion about this relationship? EDIT: For reference, I have run both models in Stata and get the following outputs: Model estimates for a model with respiratory category as a categorical variable are: Model estimates for a model with respiratory category as a linear term, and a quadratic term are: Using logistic explore the association between lung reactivity and risk of chronic respiratory disease. The dataset contains information on a combined measure of lung function exposure respcat taking values 0, 1 or 2 representing the number of lung deficiencies: 0 = none, 1 = either airway closure (AC) or bronchial hyper- responsiveness (BHR) but not both and 2 = both AC and BHR. The dataset also contains a binary outcome variable copd indicating whether or not the individual has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Stata code: logistic copd i.respcat gen respcat2 = respcat*respcat logistic copd respcat respcat2
