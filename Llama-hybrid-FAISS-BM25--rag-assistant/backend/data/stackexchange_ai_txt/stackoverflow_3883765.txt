I haven't used coverage for pruning out, but it seems like it should do well. I've used the combination of nosetests + coverage, and it worked better for me than figleaf. In particular, I found the html report from nosetests+coverage to be helpful -- this should be helpful to you in understanding where the unused portions of the library are.
