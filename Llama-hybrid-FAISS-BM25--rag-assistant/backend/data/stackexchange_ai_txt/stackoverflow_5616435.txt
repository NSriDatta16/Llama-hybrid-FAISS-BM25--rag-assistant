Passwordprotecting a Single PHP file with Apache2 or PHP independantly from anything else

Dear folks, Inside folder images I would like to password protect a single php file render.php I already have in that folder my .htaccess as well as my .htpasswd files however they dont work .htaccess in folder /images // does not work ?? AuthName "Login" AuthType Basic AuthUserFile /var/www/vhosts/site.com/httpdocs/images/.htpasswd require valid-user .htpasswd admin:818jp2uNLY6ZW # generated with http://www.4webhelp.net/us/password.php As soon as I set the rules in htaccess of that folder, all stuff in that folder seems get weirdly processed, css files insite that folder get corrupted etc. Why does this not work ? PS I am also perfectly fine (in fact would prefer, if possible at all) to use a password setting within php file itself, that way I will be sure nothing else gets affected than only that php file no matter its name or location ( probably more elegant and timess ) though I saw everyone using htaccess so there must be an advantage there, right? Thanks very much for your suggestions!
