Maximum value on a set of die rolls --- how to prove that this is a Markov chain?

Suppose we have a sequence of rolls of a fair die. Suppose we let $X_n$ be the $n$ th outcome and let $Z_n=\max(X_1,...,X_n)$ be the maximum outcome in the first $n$ rolls. For example, if I roll a die $n=2$ times and I get outcomes $X_1=5$ and $X_2=3$ then I have $Z_n=\max(5,3)=5$ . Is the process $Z^{*}=\{Z(n)|n \in \mathbb{N}\}$ a Markov Chain? This is as far as I could go. I know that $Z_{n+1}=\max(Z_n,X_{n+1})$ since $Z_n=\max(X_1,...,X_n)$ , but I couldn't prove that: $$P(Z_{n+1}|Z_n)=P(Z_{n+1}|Z_1,...,Z_n).$$ Do I really need to prove that to for it to be a Markov Chain? Or is it enough to prove that there is some structure of dependence (by which I mean that $Z_{n+1}$ depends only from $Z_n$ )?
