Can really go either way. But if you find yourself using it to adjsut paragraph spacing orsomething like this then you really have to ask yourself "is there a reason why im using breaks instead of applying a class to adjust margins?" &nbsp; on the other rarely if ever makes any kind of sense outside of a paragraph ( ) and half the time theres not much use for it ther any how as using text-indent is preferable for indenting the first paragraph and much to the chigirn of Editors everywhere im completely opposed to the double space prepending of senetences on the web - as far as im concerned that is a print only thing.
