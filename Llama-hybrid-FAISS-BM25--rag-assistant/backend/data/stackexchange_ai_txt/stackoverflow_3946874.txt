How can I parse only part of an HTML file and ignore the rest?

In each of 5,000 HTML files I have to get only one line of text, which is line 999. How can I tell the HTML::Parser that I only have to get line 999? dataset 1: &nbsp; name: &nbsp; myname one type: &nbsp; type_one (04313488) aresss: &nbsp; Friedrichstr. 70,&nbsp;73430&nbsp;Madrid adresse_two: &nbsp; no_value telefone: &nbsp; 0000736111/680040 Fax: &nbsp; 0000736111/680040 E-Mail: &nbsp; Keine Angabe Internet: &nbsp; www.mysite.es the office: &nbsp; mysite_two : &nbsp; no_value officer: &nbsp; no_value employees: &nbsp; 259 offices: &nbsp; 8 worker: &nbsp; no_value country: &nbsp; contryname the_council: &nbsp; Well, the question is, is it possible to do the search in the 5000 files with this attribute: That the line 999 is of interest. In other words, can I tell the HTML-parser that it has to look (and extract) exactly line 999? Hello dear RedGritty Brick - i have little experience with HTML :: TokeParser use HTML::TreeBuilder::XPath; my $tree = HTML::TreeBuilder::XPath->new; #use real file name here open(my $fh, " parse_file($fh); my ($name) = $tree->findnodes(qq{/html/body/table/tr[1]/td[2]}); print $name->as_text; BTW; RedGrittyBrick: See one of the example sites: http://www.kultusportal-bw.de/servlet/PB/menu/1188427/index.html?COMPLETEHREF=http://www.kultus-bw.de/did_abfrage/detail.php?id=04313488 in the grey shadowed block you see the wanted information: 17 lines that are wanted. Note - i have 5000 different HTML-files - that all are structured in the very same way! That means i would be happy to have a template that can be runned with HTML::TokeParser::Simple and DBI. love to get hints
