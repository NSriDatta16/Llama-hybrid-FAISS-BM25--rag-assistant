JavaScript file per view in Rails

As per 'unobtrusive JavaScript' recommendations I want to separate my JavaScript logic into separate files. However I don't know how to organize them. Should I: Just throw all application javascript into Application.js file and load it with layout page? This is simple approach but I will end up with a bloated Application.js. Some users might want to visit only a couple of pages, but this entire file would preloaded which is not good. Or should I create a separate javaScript file for each view and load them independently? This creates a set of questions. How to link each js file to corresponding view? Thanks.
