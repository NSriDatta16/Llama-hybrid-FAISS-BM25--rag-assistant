Before doing a build for submitting (Release) to the app store, in Xcode under project properties ensure you have the settings for Release/Distribution selected. Then in the certificate row check you have your distribution certificate selected. In Organizer check that your certificate is still valid. If not use your web browser and update the distribution certificate under developer.apple.com. THe update certificate takes a few minutes to become available. Back in Xcode use the update in Organizer to load your new certificates. If you get an error logging in then Xcode probably remembers an old or wrong password. When you have your certificated sorted out, and want to do a build for the store use "Build and Archive" to upload your binary to Apple. The app loader still exists but since Xcode 3.2.something this functionality is included in Xcode
