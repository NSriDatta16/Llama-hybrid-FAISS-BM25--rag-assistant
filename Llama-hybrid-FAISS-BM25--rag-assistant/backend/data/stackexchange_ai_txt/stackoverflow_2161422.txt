String parsing help

I have a paragraph of text in the following format: text text text 23 . text text ... I want to be able to 1) Extract the text found between each and tag found in the string. So for example, I would have an array called $ages which will contain all ages found between all the tags, and then another array $hobbies which will have the text between the tags found throughout the string. 2) Be able to replace the tags which are extracted with a marker, such as {age_444}, so e.g the above text would become text text text {age_444}. text text {hobbies_555} How can this be done?
