stochastic vs deterministic trend/seasonality in time series forecasting

I have moderate background in time series forecasting. I have looked at several forecasting books, and I don't see the following questions addressed in any of them. I have two questions: How would I determine objectively (via statistical test) if a given time series has: Stochastic Seasonality or a Deterministic Seasonality Stochastic Trend or a Deterministic Trend What would happen if i model my time series as a deterministic trend/seasonality when the series has a clearly stochastic component? Any help addressing these questions would be greatly appreciated. Example data for trend: 7,657 5,451 10,883 9,554 9,519 10,047 10,663 10,864 11,447 12,710 15,169 16,205 14,507 15,400 16,800 19,000 20,198 18,573 19,375 21,032 23,250 25,219 28,549 29,759 28,262 28,506 33,885 34,776 35,347 34,628 33,043 30,214 31,013 31,496 34,115 33,433 34,198 35,863 37,789 34,561 36,434 34,371 33,307 33,295 36,514 36,593 38,311 42,773 45,000 46,000 42,000 47,000 47,500 48,000 48,500 47,000 48,900
