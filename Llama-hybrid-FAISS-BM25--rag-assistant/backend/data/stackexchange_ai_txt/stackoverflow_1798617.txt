They listen for different events: MouseListener mouseClicked(MouseEvent event) // Called just after the user clicks the listened-to component. mouseEntered(MouseEvent event) // Called just after the cursor enters the bounds of the listened-to component. mouseExited(MouseEvent event) // Called just after the cursor exits the bounds of the listened-to component. mousePressed(MouseEvent event) // Called just after the user presses a mouse button while the cursor is over the listened-to component. mouseReleased(MouseEvent event) // Called just after the user releases a mouse button after a mouse press over the listened-to component MouseMotionListener mouseDragged(MouseEvent event) // Called in response to the user moving the mouse while holding a mouse button down. This event is fired by the component that fired the most recent mouse-pressed event, even if the cursor is no longer over that component. mouseMoved(MouseEvent event) // Called in response to the user moving the mouse with no mouse buttons pressed. This event is fired by the component that's currently under the cursor. Add the listeners according to what event you're after.
