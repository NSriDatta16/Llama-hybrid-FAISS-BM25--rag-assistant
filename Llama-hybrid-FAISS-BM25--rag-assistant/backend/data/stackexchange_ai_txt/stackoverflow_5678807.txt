In Xcode4 you can add a property, create an ivar, get release calls in dealloc and setting to nil in viewDidUnload all by simply dragging a UI component from within the XIB editor into your view controller's header file. All you have to do is name the property and Xcode4 does the rest for you. Nice! Unfortunately if you just want to manually add a property, create an associated ivar and manage memory in an arbitrary class, there is no way to do that. At least none I have found so far! The smart code completion undeniably is an improvement but not the same as an intelligent operation to add all the boiler-plate for the addition of a property.
