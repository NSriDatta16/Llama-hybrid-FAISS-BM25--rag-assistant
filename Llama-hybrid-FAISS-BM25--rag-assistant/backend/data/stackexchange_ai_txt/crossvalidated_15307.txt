Does the order of explanatory variables in logistic regression change the results?

I am curious about the consequences of changing the order of the explanatory variables in a binary logistic regression. In a recent series of logistic regressions I ran in SPSS, I found that changing the order of the explanatory variables ($z, y, x$ instead of $x, y, z$) resulted in different coefficient values and significance levels. Investigating further, I got the same results in R using the same orders. Clearly, shifting the predictors around matters in terms of the resultsâ€”my question is how? (And yes, I checked to make sure I wasn't entering the variables stepwise.)
