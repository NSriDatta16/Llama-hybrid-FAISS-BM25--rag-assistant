How to build a feature vector out of data combining numbers and strings?

I'm new to machine learning and would appreciate some guidence. I'm doing product categorization, using a database of 25,000 products. each product consists of: name ,description, price, image, and few more numeric features. I'm not sure how to deal with a combination of text and numeric features. regarding the text part, i read about "bag of words" but if i do that i'll have thousands of features for only the name and description fields, and i'm not sure if that's the right way to go- wouldn't it make the numeric features irrelevant? how would you create a vector out of this data? p.s i'm going to test 2 classifiers to examine their results- SVM and KNN.
