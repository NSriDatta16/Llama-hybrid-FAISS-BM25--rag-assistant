You can use logistic regression. After all the outputs of logistic functions are probablity of data belonging to each class. In a typical problem you have hard assignments, but the logistic regression produces the class probablities which approach the hard assignments. You may need to modify the standard logistic regression algorithm a bit so that you can use probablities instead of hard assignments.
