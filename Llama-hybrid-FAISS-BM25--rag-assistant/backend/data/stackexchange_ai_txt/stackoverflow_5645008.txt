There really isn't a concept of vertical centering in CSS. It's been a long time gripe. Options: You could use a table. I find this an OK use of one for positioning. You could use JavaScript. Get the height of the window, do some math, then position the image. A little messy. Maybe more effort than its worth. You could use display: table CSS. Alas, doesn't work in IE AFAIK. You could just fake it. Give the image a top margin of 150px and be OK with the bottom space being variable. That's the route I'd go. Pragmatic design. ;)
