The text (after editing due to comments exchanged) shows that a Gaussian is not a good fit to the spectral lines. This link shows the origin of the different widths of the spectral lines depending on how the lines are fit. Half ranges are not a common method of making observations concerning error of location. For two observations this reduces to $\sqrt{2} $ standard deviations. However, for three observations it would have a different, more-variable relationship to standard deviation. Regardless, the half-range is a small number biased estimate, and would be perhaps better expressed as its square to eliminate that bias, i.e., analogous to variance being unbiased. The reasoning behind this is perhaps not obvious, so see Why are we using a biased and misleading standard deviation formula for $\sigma$ of a normal distribution? by way of explanation. In this case, a better measurement is the area under the curve, which (square measurement) should be proportional to luminous flux despite variable width of the absorption lines from whatever cause. The sloppiness of the fitting with Gaussian curves is that the spectral lines are not Gaussian curves. That is, the first step in such problems is the numerical identification of the distribution type appropriate to the problem. That is the first thing I would test in the original data. As it turns out, this obviates $t$ -testing by eliminating the modelling uncertainty. A short-cut that obviates the need for testing fit quality is a search on prior work. That search yielded, among other things, Modeling Stellar Absorption Lines: The FeI 6546.25 $\overset{\small{_{\text{o}}}}{\text{A}}$ Line , which suggests better results from Chi-squared fitting of Voigt profile combination of the Gaussian and Lorentz distributions (Bowers & Deeming 1984), and is often used to model spectral absorption line features. If you can implement this, you may also be able to reduce the uncertainty resulting from Gaussian only modelling. That is, it would appear that there are three different criteria for Gaussian fitting because a Gaussian is not the best possible shape to be fitting to the data. I would encourage you to undertake further searches and consultations with potential coauthors on this approach, precisely because I am not an astrophysicist myself, although I probably should disclose that I have coauthored papers with two outstanding ones. Finally, it was not inappropriate to ask your question on CrossValidated, and although there is a StackExchange companion site for physics , there is no AstroPhysics site per se , and many of the astro questions posed do appear on this site.
