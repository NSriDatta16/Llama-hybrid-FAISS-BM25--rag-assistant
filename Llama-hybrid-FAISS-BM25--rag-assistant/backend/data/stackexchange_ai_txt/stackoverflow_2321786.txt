Best way to store variable-length data in an R data.frame?

I have some mixed-type data that I would like to store in an R data structure of some sort. Each data point has a set of fixed attributes which may be 1-d numeric, factors, or characters, and also a set of variable length data. For example: id phrase num_tokens token_lengths 1 "hello world" 2 5 5 2 "greetings" 1 9 3 "take me to your leader" 4 4 2 2 4 6 The actual values are not all computable from one another, but that's the flavor of the data. The operations I'm going to want to do include subsetting the data based on boolean functions (e.g. something like nchar(data$phrase) > 10 or lapply(data$token_lengths, length) > 2) . I'd also like to index and average values in the variable length portion by index. This doesn't work, but something like: mean(data$token_lengths[1], na.rm=TRUE)) I've found I can shoehorn "token_lengths" into a data.frame by making it an array: d But is this the best way?
