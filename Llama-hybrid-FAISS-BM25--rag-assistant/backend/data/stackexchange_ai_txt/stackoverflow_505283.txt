Ryan and James are correct -- the right way's probably to extract frames at upload/transcode-time. But if that's not an option, you could opt for using some sort of a default/placeholder image of your own (something generic or somehow suitable for all videos whose thumbs haven't yet been captured), and just use VideoDisplay's DisplayObject-ness to grab and then upload a frame to your server, e.g.: = 10) capture(); } private function capture():void { var bmpData:BitmapData = new BitmapData(videoDisplay.width, videoDisplay.height); bmpData.draw(videoDisplay); captured = true; // Now just upload the byte array to your server for the next user var loader:URLLoader = new URLLoader(); loader.dataFormat = URLLoaderDataFormat.BINARY; // ... etc. } ]]> Again, it's perhaps not the most elegant solution, but it certainly works. This way, the first user sees the generic image, but every user thereafter gets the generated thumbnail. (Which, of course, you'll have uploaded and properly associated by then.) Make sense?
