If the values are independent Poisson and you seek a best estimate of the common mean, just sum and divide by the total exposure (or by the number of terms if the exposures are the same, in which case you have a mean per observation rather than per unit of expsosure). This will correspond to both maximum likelihood estimation of the Poisson parameter, and to weighting in the sample average in proportion to the inverse of the estimated variance. Note that in the case of known variances, inverse-variance weighting is optimal for a weighted mean.
