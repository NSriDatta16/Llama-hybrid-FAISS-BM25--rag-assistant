There are many questions here, some are a bit confusing. But to get started, and answer your previous post, Bonferroni correction is applied a posteriori , so that raw p-values for each of the factors are essentially divided by n comparisons (hypotheses). So for the Table 4 example, depending how you define family-wise error rate in the context of this question, and what they meant by "block-wise", it can be by parameter (n=27 comparisons for the 7 parameters) or by parameter-group combination (n=9 for 3 groups sizes) vs. 189 (total number of tests). Secondly, Table 4 refers to interaction terms, not individual effects themselves, which can still be significant. And perhaps clarification is needed on the response variable, which is " Noncoverage " (a type of misclassification indicator) for the 7 regression parameters, not those parameters themselves. What the quoted statement means is that Noncoverage for some of the 7 parameters (fixed and random effects) depends on Number of Groups and Group Size , but effect of Number of Groups does not vary across levels of Group Size , and the third factor, Intraclass Correlation , which is not significant in any of the interactions or by itself.
