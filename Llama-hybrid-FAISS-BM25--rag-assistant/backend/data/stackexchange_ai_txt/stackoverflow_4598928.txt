You should probably created a partners table that takes the id of both people, and a date. The latest date is the active partnership. +----------+ | PARTNERS | +----------+ | user_a | (first partner) +----------+ | user_b | (second partner) +----------+ | date | (date the partnership began) +----------+ This is a rather basic example. Depending on what exactly a partnership is, you may have other fields. A history of partners would reflect as a series of rows: Fizzbuzz Socks | Noke Shoes | Jan 23, 1983 StackOverflow | GoogleDocs | Jan 29, 1992 Fizzbuzz Socks | Life Shoes | Nov 02, 1990 Fizzbuzz Socks | Sutt Shoes | Oct 18, 1995 From this we can see that Fizzbuzz had three partnerships in history, and the present partnership is with Sutt Shoes, started on Oct 18, 1995. For every new partnership, you would create a new record.
