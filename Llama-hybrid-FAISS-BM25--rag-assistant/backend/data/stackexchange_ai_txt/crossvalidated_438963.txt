(From the comments) RNN/LSTM is the obvious first idea. Another is to do a wavelet transform (or similar) of the time series to make it photo-like and run a convolutional neural network. Brandon Rohrer mentions this in his excellent video on CNNs . This CNN approach can be combined with RNN/LSTM, too. Unequal data size presents a problem, and I’m pretty sure you don’t avoid it by doing straight RNN/LSTM instead of CNN-LSTM. Since you have a live feed, I assume you’ll only be looking at the past X-many seconds. Perhaps start by training your models on some restricted amount of data (5 seconds, 30 minutes, whatever seems to matter). You can figure out what the correct duration is empirically and with some subject matter expertise. Then your live feed can give that duration to a trained model to make the predictions.
