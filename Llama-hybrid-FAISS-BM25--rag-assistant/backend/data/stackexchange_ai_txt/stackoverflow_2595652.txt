How to debug a bundle in XCode?

I wrote a nice little program. At some point, it is required to load a bundle with some additional functionality. I, too, am the author of the bundle, so I have the source code and Xcode-projects for both the main application and the bundle. Until now, I simply dragged the bundle into the resources-folder in the main application, which works fine for running it, but I can't debug it (and of course there is an error in it). Is there a way to set up Xcode so that I can debug the bundle?
