how to plot a mixed graph in R?

How can I plot a mixed graph in R? I have used this but doesn't work (in bnlearn he calls 'arc' to a directed edge and 'edge' to an undirected edge): library(bnlearn) dag=empty.graph(nodes = c("E", "F")) graphviz.plot(dag) dag = set.edge(dag, from = "E", to = "F") dag = set.arc(dag, to = "E", from = "F") graphviz.plot(dag) As specified in the documentation https://www.bnlearn.com/documentation/man/arcops.html it will overwrite the arc... (Note that in bnlearn library he calls 'arc' to a directed edge and 'edge' to an undirected edge) I want to be able to plot a mixed graph like: (arc (directed edge) between E and F, also edge (undirected edge) at the same time ). (If R cannot do it, is there any other easy tool I could use?, my goal is just to plot) edit: I just realized thatBayesian Networks need to be acyclic by definition, so I guess I am hopeless with the bnlearn library...
