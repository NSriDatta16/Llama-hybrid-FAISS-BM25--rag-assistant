Your second claim in the first paragraph is wrong. A semilog scale for the conditional (on $x$) relationship $\mu_Y=cx^k$ does not linearize that relationship. Taking logs of both sides the relationship linearly relates the log of the conditional mean of $Y$ to the log of $x$ -- so you need a log-log scale for it .... $\log(\mu_Y)=\log(c) + k\log x$. That alone would be sufficient reason to use it.
