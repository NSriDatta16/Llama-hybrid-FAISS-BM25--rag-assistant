I'm a big fan of using the mobile web for apps if you aren't going to be relying on revenue from app sales. There is a lot of development going on right now (see jQuery Mobile) to allow developers to quickly and easily write native feeling mobile web apps that mimic the UIs common to iOS/Android/etc. In addition, frameworks like PhoneGap allow web apps to use native APIs such as geolocation and the camera. On most mobile operation systems, you can add a mobile web app as a native icon, so I don't see this being a downfall. Also, being able to work offline is also doable on the mobile web with HTML5 local storage and other similar solutions. Overall, I think the largest benefit from a mobile web app is not having to write multiple native versions of your app. This takes a great deal of time/resources and offers little benefit in my opinion unless you are relying on app sales or writing an intense game, as Chris mentioned.
