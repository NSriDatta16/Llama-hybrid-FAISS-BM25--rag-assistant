One possibility is the little-used pure virtual function with implementation: virtual int longDescriptiveName() = 0 { return 0; } This forces deriving classes to override it. They can then call the base-class implementation alone if they only want that behaviour. Also you need to make sure your inheritance hierarchy is flat, rather than multi-layers, which is generally good anyway because inheritance is fragile enough without piling on the layers.
