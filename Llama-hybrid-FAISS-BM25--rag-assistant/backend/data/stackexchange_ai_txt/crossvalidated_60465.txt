No, you won't get single svmtrain output to be anything but binary. SVMs are inherently binary - they simply create a maximum margin plane that separates the two classes of datapoints. You'll need to create 6 one-vs-all ({1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} => {0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0}) sort of thing or use more robust methods like ECOC. See my answer here .
