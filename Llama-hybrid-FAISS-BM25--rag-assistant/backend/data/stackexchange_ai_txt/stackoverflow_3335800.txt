There is a way for unpriviledged JavaScript code (loaded from a web page) to request more privileges in Firefox. This is an old, non standard API that prompts the user for permission and if accepted allows the JavaScript to do things normal JavaScript cannot. One of these things is to bypass Same Origin Policy. Sample code: try { // ask user for permission netscape.security.PrivilegeManager.enablePrivilege('UniversalBrowserRead'); } catch (e) { // user refused permission alert('Permission "UniversalBrowserRead" was denied.'); } //Should now be capable of bypassing same origin policy if user accepted Since the kiosk browser does not restart (I suppose) very often, the dialog just has to be accepted once. Not sure this is the most elegant solution but might work, at least for now (the API is old and might disappear). Here is a link for more details: http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/components/signed-scripts.html#privs-list While looking for the exact privilege name I found this page about Security Policies in Firefox. This would be a much nicer solution. I have never used it, so I cannot give more info, but here is the link, might be a good place to start looking: http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/components/ConfigPolicy.html Hope this helps!
