Almost always the issue with IE and a partial page .load() seemingly doing nothing is due to the selector not finding the element you want, and almost always , the issue is invalid markup causing issues there. Double check that all your elements are valid, opened, closed, matched etc, IE is very intolerant of invalid HTML being used to generate a document fragment (which happens behind the scenes here). You can use the W3C Validator to check the page you're trying to load .
