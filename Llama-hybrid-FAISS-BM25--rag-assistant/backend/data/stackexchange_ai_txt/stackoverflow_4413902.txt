The web is stateless, so every request is always authenticated no matter what technology you're using. However, the trick to not hammering AD is using a session http cookie. You would set this cookie on the first request and check for it on subsequent requests. You would need some kind of cryptographic protection on the cookie, but thankfully this is ready-rolled in ASP.NET. I'd say you could leverage the Forms Authentication infrastructure to set and validate a cookie - you would just offload the initial authentication to AD instead of reading from a posted form. Here's a great place to start: Understanding the Forms Authentication Ticket and Cookie http://support.microsoft.com/kb/910443
