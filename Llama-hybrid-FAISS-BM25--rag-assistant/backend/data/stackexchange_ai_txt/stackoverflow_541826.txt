The thing about WYSIWYG that trips a lot of people up is when people try to paste in items from other sources. I had a site I maintained for a nonprofit group and I used FreeTextBox . It's neat, it's free, and it runs in ASP.NET - all the criteria I needed. the members of this club were simply not going to figure out HTML and use that to make things bold, underlined, etc. So, I gave them FTB which worked a bit like Microsoft Word. Win/win, right? Wrong. Since by default I left in all of the controls FTB gives you, people picked all kinds of weird crap, mainly fonts. Everyone in the organization loved Comic Sans . Ugh. This was made to edit a public-facing site and everything looked hideously inconsistent - the size of the fonts, the types of the fonts, everything. So, I went in and turned off most of the stuff I didn't want people doing, like changing the fonts or the sizes and so forth. You know what people did instead? They would edit everything in Microsoft Word and then paste it in. They noticed that they couldn't do what they wanted in FTB so they just used Microsoft Word to get around it (I'm sure this is how they send screenshots in email as well). And FTB just accepts all of this, usually with really messed up line breaks as well so things looked even more janky. And FTB is designed such that when things get messed up it's hard to fix them without digging into the HTML, which was outside of the range of what these members were capable of. If I ever get around to touching that site again I'm stripping out FTB and putting in something like the WMD editor using Markdown like Stack Overflow uses. I agree that not letting people see what their edits will look like in realtime is an issue that "wiki" editors miss. But I also think that letting people use a true WYSIWYG editor online (or at least one that will just accept the HTML-in-the-background that Word produces) is a recipe for disaster. I like the compromise Stack Overflow uses - don't let them use real HTML but give them a real time preview. So, although WYSIWYG editing is one of your requirements, you may want to rethink that depending on the audience of your site.
