Derive $P(A|C)$ from $P(A|B)$ and $P(B|C)$

I'm working myself through renormalization theory (doesn't matter) and made up a problem to solve for myself, where in the solution seem to be missing one step, which can be summarized as follows: For discrete random variables $A$ , $B$ and $C$ and known conditional probabilities $P(A=i|B=j)$ and $P(B=j|C=k)$ , I'd like to say something about $P(A=i|C=k)$ (the 'coarse graining'). My intuition says it should look something like $$ P(A=i|C=k) = \sum_j P(A=i|B=j) P(B=j|C=k) $$ , a sum over all possible ` paths' from C to A over B to integrate out B. It seems to check out if I plug in some numbers, but I'm unable to prove this to be true using the chain rule, definition of the conditional probability or bayesian rule. What am I missing?
