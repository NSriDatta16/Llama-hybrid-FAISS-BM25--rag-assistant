Any MVC/MTV framework will work for what you're describing. RoR is perfectly well suited to this sort of thing as are: Lift, Django, Pylons/Pyramid, Camping, Web2Py, Plone (yes I said Plone), LuCI, and many many others. You mentioned Oracle as a back end. This may suggest that your organization is big on overpriced 'enterprise-y' software and probably uses Java. Lift is written in/for Scala which runs on the JVM. Web2Py runs on Jython (java implementation of Python). I'm not sure whether Rails runs on JRuby but then there is always Groovy and Grails too. All of them can connect to Oracle (and other databases) It's confusing when you say "To take care of the web part". These frameworks take care of the web part (view/template) as well as the datastore and can even export that data (model) to other formats (controller/view). You'll want to look at one of the AJAXy datagrid widgets if you want to present the data in a nice scrollable and dynamically sortable format. I hope that helps
