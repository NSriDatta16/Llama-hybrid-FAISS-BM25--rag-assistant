You are quite correct that model identification can be a serious issue when you have time series data. What you want to do is to construct a hybrid regression model and an ARIMA component while taking into account the following: 1) potential lead and lag effects of user specified input/causal series e.g. customer is aware of a discount on a following day 2) fixed effects like day-of-the-week, week-of-the-month , week-of-the-year , month-of-the-year, day-of-the-month , long-weekend effects et al 3) latent factors like level shifts and/or local time trends 4) unusual values needing to be identified and normalized to both reveal unknown factors and to provide robust model parameter estimates 5) time varying parameters and/or time varying error variance. The general concept is called a Transfer Function and sometimes referred to as a Dynamic Regression. You can pursue this thread here https://web.archive.org/web/20160216193539/https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat510/node/75/ and here Transfer Function Confidence interval estimation and here http://autobox.com/cms/index.php/afs-university/intro-to-forecasting/doc_download/23-forcasting-family-tree I believe all of this is in the spirit of @F.Tusel's comments aside from his state space preference which is decidedly not my choice as forecasts have to be made and easily interpreted/understood in the observed space. EDITED AFTER RECEIPT OF DATA : The data was submitted to AUTOBOX which found that none of the user specified predictors were ultimately found to be significant. Here is the final model suggesting strong period to period and week-to-week dependency along with a level shift , 2 pulses and 4 seasonal (daily ) factors. Following is the Actual/Fit/Forecast graph [![enter image suggesting sufficiency. The model statistics are here and here
