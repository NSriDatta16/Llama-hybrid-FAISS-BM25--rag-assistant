I use jQuery and Monorail for an MVC framework - and we use both approaches. Here's an example for the jquery approach - ignore the fact it's php. The approach is the same, namely in the postback function in the JSON call, the JSON return object is accessed directly to populate front-end controls that are accessed via the css selector. The alternative is very similar (archived here ) - instead of manually setting control contents, simply apply the html returned in the partial view (ensuring the layout is cancelled as you don't want menus etc just a html fragment).
