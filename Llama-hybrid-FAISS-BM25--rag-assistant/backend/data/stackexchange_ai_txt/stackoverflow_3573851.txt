Html escaping in a Rails 3 view

I'm using Rails 3. I want to display generated html fragment inside erb template Foo Bar " %> Rails encodes div tags. If I'm correct in Rails 2 causes html escaping. Seems that it was changed in Rails 3. How can insert html fragment without encoding in Rails 3? Regards, Alexey.
