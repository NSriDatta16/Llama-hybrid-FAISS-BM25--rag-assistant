If there are 24 possible routes, then you can compute an expectation for the route lengths assuming equal probability of all routes or under some other condition. This can be a population parameter which you intend to compare the critters against. Then pool the critters' data together and run an intercept only model. The intercept will be the average route length for all critters. And obtain a confidence interval for the intercept to see if it includes the expected average of all routes. If it doesn't, this is the first suggestion that the critters are on average behaving differently than expected on average. If it does, then you cannot distinguish their average behavior from the expected under the null. Note that your regression need not be linear regression. You have 48 data points so you might have enough data to identify an appropriate distribution for the travel times other than the normal distribution assumed during inference in linear regression. One problem is that 16 of the 48 data points come from the same critter. So you lack statistical independence. Adjustments you can make to the general model above are: a multilevel regression approach adding a random intercept for each critter. In addition to the overall intercept above, you can use this model to create a confidence interval for each critter so you can see how each specific critter differs from the expected. But some might complain that your number of critters is too small to do this. a critter by critter model. This is a simple approach. You may lose statistical power though and some might complain about multiplicity issues. I like the multilevel regression approach generally, despite the small number of critters. It is not ideal but you have the data you have. You could take a Bayesian approach, and constrain the parameters further with some priors that express skepticism of differential behavior from the average of 24 routes. This will probably be the most interesting approach to take.
