A heterogeneous mixture of $p$'s will make a single-$p$ binomial model have the wrong variance structure. A beta-binomial model allows for a (beta-) distribution of $p$'s and then conditional on $p$, a binomial (specifically bernoulli) distribution of individual responses. If I was taking a Bayesian approach this would be my first thought. If you have good predictors of the $p$'s you might consider a GLM, so that conditionally the distribution is binomial and the model for the mix of $p$'s is determined by the predictors in the model. Outside of that, and in a more general class of models, you might consider random effects models, specifically GLMs with random effects.
