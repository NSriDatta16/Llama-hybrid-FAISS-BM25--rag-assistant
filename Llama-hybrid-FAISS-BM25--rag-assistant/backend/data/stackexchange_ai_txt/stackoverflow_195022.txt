Code coverage is simply a measure of the code that is tested. There are a variety of coverage criteria that can be measured, but typically it is the various paths, conditions, functions, and statements within a program that makeup the total coverage. The code coverage metric is the just a percentage of tests that execute each of these coverage criteria. As far as how I go about tracking unit test coverage on my projects, I use static code analysis tools to keep track.
