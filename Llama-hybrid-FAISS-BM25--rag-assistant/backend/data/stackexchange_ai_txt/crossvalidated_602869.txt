Gain vs Loss in terms of selecting best leaf split value

In the XGBoost Documentation they specify the Gain term as: \begin{equation} Gain=\frac{1}{2} \left[ \frac{G_L^2}{H_L+\lambda} + \frac{G_R^2}{H_R+\lambda}- \frac{(G_L+G_R)^2}{H_L+H_R+\lambda}\right]-\gamma \end{equation} Loss function is: When choosing leaf split, split that maximises Gain can not be the same as split that minimizes loss function. In some XgBoost guides people tell that best split value is chosen by Gain maximization, others say that it is chosen by loss minimization. Is there any connection between gain and loss? And how exactly is leaf split chosen if gain and loss criteria do now show the same optimal split?
