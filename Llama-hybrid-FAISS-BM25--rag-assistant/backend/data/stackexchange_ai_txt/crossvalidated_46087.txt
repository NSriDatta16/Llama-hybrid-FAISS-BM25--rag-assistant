As Steven says, I would generate new samples in a "sensible" way, and then I would use the SVM to classify them and see if they belong to the class you are aiming for. Now, this sampling would not correspond to the true distribution of data What do I mean by sensible? For example, in the case of object recognition or OCR, one applies some kind of transformation (3D and/or 2D rotations, warping, ...), because one expects them to happen in reality, and you want your system to be able to deal with those. Hope it helps
