You'll use time series cross validation which respects the time dimension. This question has very good answers with visualisations. Basically, you'll do something like Fold 1: Training: [2010, 2011, 2012], Test: [2013] Fold 2: Training: [2010, 2011, 2012, 2013], Test: [2014] ... This way, your validation respects the time ordering, and there'll be no data-leakage.
