If quite a lot of keys are going to be in disk and if the storage engines does not provide efficient indexing mechanism then performance will be hit severly. I don't think redis b-trees are ready yet. You can check Tokio Cabinet. It seems to provide key-value storage + btrees. http://www.igvita.com/2009/02/13/tokyo-cabinet-beyond-key-value-store/ http://colinhowe.wordpress.com/2009/04/27/redis-vs-mysql/
