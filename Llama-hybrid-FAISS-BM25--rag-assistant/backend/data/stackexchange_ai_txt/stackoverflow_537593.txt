Multiple images per Model

I'm writing a simple real-estate listing app in Django. Each property needs to have a variable number of images. Images need to have an editable order. And I need to make the admin user-proof. So that said, what are my options? Is there a ImageList field that I don't know about? Is there an app like django.contrib.comments that does the job for me? If I have to write it myself, how would I go about making the admin-side decent? I'm imagining something a lot slicker than what ImageField provides, with some drag'n'drop for re-ordering. But I'm a complete clutz at writing admin pages =(
