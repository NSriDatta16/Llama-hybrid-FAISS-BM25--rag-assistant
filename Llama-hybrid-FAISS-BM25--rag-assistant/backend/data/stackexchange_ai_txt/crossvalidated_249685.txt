Does overfit outside the dataset range in Machine learning really matter?

I was tyring out a pizza price dataset. With two different approaches, the results were different (as shown in the screenshot below). As the dashed line shows, the model was overfitted. But it is clear that it actually started to overfit after the biggest available pizza size. And within the reasonable pizza size range, the dashed line fits way better than the straight line. I've encountered this situation several times with different datasets. So I wonder that when we limit the data parameter range, does it really matter that the model overfits outside of the range?
