Calling finish() on an Android activity doesn't actually finish

I'm calling finish() but my activity keeps on going. I have an activity which is invoked by a menu from the main activity screen. In my activity's onCreate() method I have the following code fragment: // Make sure there are some events in the list. if (theEventArrayList.isEmpty()){ Toast.makeText(this, "Event List is empty", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show(); finish(); } SummarizeCurrentEvent(); graphEvents(); If the list is empty it puts up the Toast, and I can set breakpoint on the call to finish() . If I step from that in the debugger it goes to straight to SummarizeCurrentEvent() . I thought finish() would exit the activity. Is this not the case? Where can I find out more information about this method?
