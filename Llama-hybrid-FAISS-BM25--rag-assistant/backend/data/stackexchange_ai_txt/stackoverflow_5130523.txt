Mustache is fantastic for interpolation and I can't imagine it ever exposing you to server-side vulnerabilities if you're using it for Javascript evaluation. It's the simplest, most powerful option. I don't know that non-programmers would understand it, but I'm sure it's simpler than Liquid. Another option would be to use an existing simpler user markup set like BBcode or a rich-text editing library like TinyMCE. These are much reduced in functionality, but are easier to use for average people.
