int a[5]; is understood implicitly as int a[5] = null; (declaration is invalid in java). int[] a=new int[5]; creates an array of length 5 with each element of the array containing a default value of 0 . Integer[] a = new Integer[5] creates an array of Integer of length 5, all elements have null as default value. There are ways to initialize an array (Just an extra note). Example: int a[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; This creates an array of int of length 5, and each element (counting from 0) are assigned values from the braces {} starting from the left to the right. Furthermore, int is a primitive type, so JVM creates a memory space for the size of int (e.g 4 bytes int) while Integer is an Object so JVM creates a memory space to hold the full object of Integer (which is bigger than the memory space of int ). where to use "int a" and the other one Use Integer if you need to use Generics (since you can't use primitive types in generics but int[] or primitive arrays are allowed) or need functions from the Integer class. Else, storage of values to a persistent storage, use int .
