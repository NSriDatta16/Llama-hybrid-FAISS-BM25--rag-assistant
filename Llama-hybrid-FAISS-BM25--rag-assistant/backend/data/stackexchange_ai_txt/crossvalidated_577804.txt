The assumption in RL is that the agent is observing some state S, and may take one of several actions A in search of a reward. If your song vector is the state, what actions are available in this state? Is there a set of actions one could take which arrive at a future state S which is the answer you seek? You also require a observer function that can issue rewards when the agent has made the correct sequence of actions. If so then RL is a suitable algorithm for your problem. However, due to the non-deterministic environment, I don't think RL would learn very well. It's essentially mapping a path of actions to arrive at the answer from your observer function. If the sequence of actions to the solution is non-deterministic, then there is nothing to learn. Instead I would suggest you apply an Encoder-Decoder model because it is well suited to encoding your song vector and decoding multiple strings (song names) from it.
