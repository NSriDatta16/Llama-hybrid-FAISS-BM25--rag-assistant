What you're seeing is probably an implementation detail. I suspect -[NSString initWithString:] with an immutable string for an argument just retains its argument and returns it. For constant strings like @"Hello world" , they hang around for the life of the program, so retain and release don't do anything. But you don't need to pay attention to any of that. Cocoa just guarantees that if you follow the memory management guidelines, your memory will be managed properly. Exactly how it works behind the scenes isn't normally something you should be concerned with â€” just whether you're following the rules.
