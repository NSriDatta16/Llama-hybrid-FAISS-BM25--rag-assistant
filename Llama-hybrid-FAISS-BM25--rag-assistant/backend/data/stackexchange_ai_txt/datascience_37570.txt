It depends on your education and the accuracy you're looking for. Let me give define the two different types of objects detection algorithms: 1. Proposal based object detection These algorithms consist of two parts, Proposal generation and then object classification. Examples of this approach are fast rcnn and faster rcnn .... etc. 2. The pixel / region based object detection These algorithms divide the image into cells / grid , then classify each part and then process all these recognitions. Yolo is an example of this category. In general, when we evaluate an object detection, we care about performance and speed It is not really recommended to re-invent the wheel, but if you are really interested in learning and implementing your own solution, I recommend the following: 1- use an existing Proposal generation, I recommend Edge Box 2- train a classification model to classify the proposed regions
