Let $P_t$ be the price of a market index at time $t$. Let $p_t = \log P_t$ be the log price. Let $r_{t \rightarrow t+1} = p_{t+1} - p_t$ be the log return. A not insane starting point would be to assume log returns $r_{t\rightarrow t+1}$ are IID , drawn from some distribution that you estimate off the data. Can you easily falsify this model? Yes. What's obviously wrong with the IID model is that you have volatility clustering in real world data. So you can get more and more sophisticated in your analysis. For risk analysis, I'd probably do some block bootstrap off the empirical distribution of log returns (if we're talking about the market return where we have a long time series). --- Another comment -- Something to be aware of when running simulations is that you also have uncertainty over the simulation parameters. Eg. we don't have precise estimates as to the equity premium: the standard errors are huge. So if you're forming subjective probabilities over possible outcomes, there's even more uncertainty than a naive simulation would suggest.
