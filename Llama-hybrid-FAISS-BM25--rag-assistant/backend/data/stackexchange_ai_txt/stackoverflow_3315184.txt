JavaScript Object.prototype by value

I want to do something like Object.prototype.dataTransfer = new DataTransfer(); , but I want every new object to have it's own dataTransfer . How do I do this? For example, if I do var a = new Object(); var b = new Object(); Object.prototype.dataTransfer = new Object(); a.dataTransfer.prop = 1; b.dataTransfer.prop = 2; I want a.dataTransfer.prop to still be 1, not 2. For context, I'm trying to hack WebKit and IE so that the .dataTransfer object of the drag and drop events works appropriately.
