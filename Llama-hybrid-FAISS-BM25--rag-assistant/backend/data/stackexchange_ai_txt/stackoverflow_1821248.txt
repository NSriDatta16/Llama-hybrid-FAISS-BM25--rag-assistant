Injecting script elements via HTML is very difficult to do reliably cross-browser, and consequently broken in various ways in jQuery. It does some things to work around known browser problems, but this can end up just making it worse. With jitter's bug (+1) fixed you'll find the scripts don't get inserted at all, to try to avoid these kinds of problem. Even with the fix, this line is vile and fragile code, trying to process HTML with regex, and will fail if the string /script> is included in the script block (which is quite valid). And will fail for . And so on. So do yourself a favour and leave out of HTML content you intend to load dynamically. Always pass any script content to be executed back separately from the HTML.
