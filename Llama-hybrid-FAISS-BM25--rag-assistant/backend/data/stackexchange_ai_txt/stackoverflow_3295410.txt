IMHO, those JS frameworks you mentioned are overrated bloatware. I would wholeheartedly recommend that you learn JQuery instead. It is a much more minimallistic and elegant framework. Also, by the time IE 9 finally ships earlier next year, all the browsers will be supporting most of the HTML5 standard, including offline storage and websockets, making such complex frameworks completely unnecesary.
