Both the previous answers are correct, but I believe they're somewhat incomplete. GIS is the abbreviation for Geographic Information System. It does include information about location. Wikipedia GIS does have a nice overview, but I think misses the real point. To be really useful, that information about location has to be important to the application/business. For example: A service company wants to be able to know, at a glance, what areas of their service coverage receive the most call-backs. A GIS along with some mapping software can quickly display this information, along with other important information to this company, simply by using different colors or icons for 'Open Calls', 'Overdue Calls', 'Tech On-Site', etc. It is the combination of location data and business specific data that makes a GIS valuable.
