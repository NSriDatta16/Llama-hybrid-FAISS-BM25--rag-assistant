Yee Whye Teh et al 's 2005 paper Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes describes a nonparametric prior for grouped clustering problems. For example , the HDP helps in generalizing the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model to the case the number of topics in the data is discovered by the inference algorithm instead of being specified as a parameter of the model. Detailed explanation on Dirichlet Process can be found here Topic models promise to help summarize and organize large archives of texts that cannot be easily analyzed by hand. The Hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) is a powerful mixed-membership model for the unsupervised analysis of grouped data. Unlike its finite counterpart, latent Dirichlet allocation , the HDP topic model infers the number of topics from the data.
