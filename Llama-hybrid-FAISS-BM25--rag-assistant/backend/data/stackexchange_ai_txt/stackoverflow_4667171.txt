Java: compile on Windows, run on OS X = fail, why?

I don't know much about compiling files: when I tried compiling files on Windows Vista, the JAR file works fine, the application runs just fine. I copied all files to a Mac OS X, tried to run the JAR file, nothing happen, the application doesn't work, why? EDIT: When I try to display a JFrame, I get the error only in Mac OS X: Exception in thread "AWT-EventQueue-0" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: javax/swing/GroupLayout$Group GroupLayout is created by Netbeans by drag-and-drop components to the JFrame. Please help!
