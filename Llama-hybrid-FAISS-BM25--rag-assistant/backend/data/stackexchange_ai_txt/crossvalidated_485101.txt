ARIMA grid search for best $p$, $d$, $q$ orders based on BIC metric

i am new to R, and i was hoping to get some answers to some questions i have is there a function to loop through a range of ARIMA model to get the best order/seasonal based on BIC/AIC ? do i have always to difference the data if its not not stationary or there might be another reason to that and i dont have to take the differencing ? i used Auto ARIMA to find the best ARIMA model based on its BIC, and i specifically specified BIC perimeter in the Auto ARIMA function but when i tried to use some candidate ARIMA order i was able to get a lower BIC than what the Auto ARIMA got, how is that possible ? what could be a better practice, to use the differencing time series data in the arima function , or to use the original one and specify that there is an order of d there?
