cURL not working correct!

I have a question about cURL. I am using cURL with this function: curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION, true); Only this was causing an error: "Message: curl_setopt() [function.curl-setopt]: CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION cannot be activated when in safe_mode or an open_basedir is set" So I asked my hosting provider to fix this, and they did. But, and this is really stupid, they put a "curl" file in my bin directory. And I have no idea how to include this in my php script :S. Never done it before, but can anybody help me. I am really stuck. I hope I posted enough info! Tnx in advanced! Tnx for all the great replies. But How would I fit "exec()" in this code? // create a new cURL resource $ch = curl_init(); // set URL and other appropriate options curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_USERAGENT, "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 5.01; Windows NT 5.0)"); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, TRUE); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_TRANSFERTEXT, TRUE); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT, 30); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, $articleUrl); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HEADER, 0); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION, true); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_MAXREDIRS, 5); // grab URL and pass it to $grabArticle $grabArticle = curl_exec($ch); Edit 2: Ok√©, I almost got it working :). It is working just fine when I run it in putty, but in my php script nothing happens :( I run this: $grabArticle = exec('/home/twittern/bin/curl -L -m 30 -w url_effective --max-redirs 5 http://fok.nl/415758'); echo $grabArticle; Any thing I am doing wrong?
