(C++) Need help with database

I'm trying to make a database and so far, I've been using strings to store my entries from a text file into an array, but this just isn't working out. Thus, I began thinking of a new way of doing it. What I want to do: Lets say I have a text file with the following database... John Smith 00001 jsmith@email pw1 Rob Deniro 00002 rdeniro@email pw2 Al Pacino 00003 apacino@email pw3 Joe Pesci 00004 jpesci@email 307 pw4 Joaq Phoenix 00005 jphoe@email 208 pw5 John Madden 00006 jmadden@email 708 pw6 Alright, so basically what I'm stuck at is making this "inheritance" friendly. What's the best way to go about storing each entry? Individual strings? I've been thinking that the best way is to store each individual character until a whitespace occurs and then storing it into a string, but I'm not sure how that could be done.
