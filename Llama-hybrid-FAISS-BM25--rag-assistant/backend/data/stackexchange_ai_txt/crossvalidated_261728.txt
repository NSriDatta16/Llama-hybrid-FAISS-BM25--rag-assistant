Implementation of CNN

I am new to the field of vision. To get a good understanding of the concepts, I wanted to look at source code of some CNN. Can anybody suggest some place where I can find implementation of simple CNN like LeNet 5(preferred as I'm following it's tutorial) from starch in Matlab or python not using any library like tensorflow Thanks in advance
