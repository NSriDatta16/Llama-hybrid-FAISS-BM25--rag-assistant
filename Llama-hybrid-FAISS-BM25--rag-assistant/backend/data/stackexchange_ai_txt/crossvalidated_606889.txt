How to evaluate patient significant improvement?

Imagine the following study where we want to teach a group of $N$ patients to improve their capacity to hold their breath under the water. We have data for the patients before teaching them and after teaching them. Something like patient_id | duration before (s) | duration after (s) ----------------------------------------------------- 1 | 53 | 78 2 | 28 | 65 ... | ... | ... N | 67 | 70 What I've seen in the literature is to report the fold increase, ie: the ratio of an increased number to the original number. For the above table it would be patient_id | duration before (s) | duration after (s) | FI ------------------------------------------------------------ 1 | 53 | 78 | 1.47 2 | 28 | 65 | 2.32 ... | ... | ... | ... N | 67 | 70 | 1.04 And the reported FI could be $FI = 1.61 \pm 0.53$ . However, I would like to compute the percentage of patients that got a significant improvement in their holding breath duration. For example, I would say that patient N got an insignificant improvement, since moving from 67 to 70 doesn't look like a huge advance, while patient 2 doubled their duration. My objective is to have a result like "X% of the patients showed a significant increase in their holding breath performance". Which evaluation methodology should I use to that end? I thought of computing the average FI and its standard deviation and then marking the patients with $FI_i as "not improved". However, I feel that using the same data to calculate the average fold increase and to filter the patients could lead to data leakage and bias the results.
