For "turning official" you might consider an established project hoster, like Sourceforge or Google Code, github. Once your code is in SVN or another VCS repository, there's a timestamp associated with it. If you use one of the trusted big hosting services, this pretty much establishes proof of your authorship best. As for the license: use the GNU GPL if you don't want code reuse. Use the LGPL if you want to permit and encourage it. Use the AGPL if you want contributions back. Or use MIT or BSD-style licenses if you want attribution and to spread quality code instead. But as you already mentioned, there is an abundance of WebCMSes. So it won't make much of a difference anyway.
