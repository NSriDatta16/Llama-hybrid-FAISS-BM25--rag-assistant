Variable elimination - can I start from the middle of the network

I read that while doing inference in Bayesian network with variable elimination , any order will do. Say I want to have the below network, where every random variable can be T/F with given probabilities given its parents state. I want to calculate P(B=T), and I want to eliminate P(A) first. Can I do that? I started by writing: $P(B) = \sum_a\sum_e\sum_j\sum_mP(B=T)P(E)P(A|B,E)P(J|A)P(M|A) =$ $\sum_e\sum_j\sum_mP(B=T)P(E)\sum_aP(A|B,E)P(J|A)P(M|A)$ and now I'm stuck :( Can you show me explicitly how do I do this first factoring step? Thanks.
