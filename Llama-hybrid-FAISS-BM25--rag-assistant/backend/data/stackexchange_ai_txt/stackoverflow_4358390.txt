SVG piechart with ruby

I've tried to produce a small block of code which would construct for me a SVG piechart, listed below: # piechart-svg.rb: BEGIN { @colors = [] both = %w(coral grey green salmon blue seagreen slategrey cyan) darks = %w(magenta red olivegreen orange turquoise goldenrod khaki orchid slateblue violet) lights = %w(steelblue yellow skyblue pink goldenrodyellow) @colors .wedge { stroke: darkgrey; stroke-linejoin: round; fill-opacity: .2; } EOF } ARGV.each_with_index do |percent,index| print " \n" @prevcoord = "#{x},#{y}" end END { puts " " } The trouble is, if I feed it, say, 50% ( ruby piechart-svg.rb 50 ), the produced wedge is less than half of the circle. I don't understand why.
