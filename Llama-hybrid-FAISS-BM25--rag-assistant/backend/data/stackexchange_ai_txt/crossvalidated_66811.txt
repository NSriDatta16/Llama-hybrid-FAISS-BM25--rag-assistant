I recently did this kind of analysis with CRM data and logistic regression, ANN and recursive partioning regression trees. Software was R. I used R package ROCR to discriminate between results obtained via these different classifiers. But besides AUC I also used various other measures as error rate, accuracy and phi correlation between observed and predicted outcomes with different probability cut-offs.
