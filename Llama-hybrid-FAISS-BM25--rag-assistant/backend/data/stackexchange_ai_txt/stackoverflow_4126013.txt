Bound the movement of a view which is added to UIPanGestureRecognizer, within its superview

I want to know if there is a way to bound the movement of my UIView within its superview while using GestureRecognizer. eg. I have a UIImageview To whom I add UIPanGestureRecognizer with action panPiece. I adjust its center in the following way to avoid its movement out of its superview. But it doesnt work properly. -(CGPoint) centerWithBounds:(CGPoint)center andViewFrame:(CGRect)viewFrame andBoundingFrame:(CGRect)boundingFrame{ CGFloat lowerXBound = boundingFrame.origin.x + ( viewFrame.size.width/2 ); CGFloat higherXBound = boundingFrame.origin.x + boundingFrame.size.width - ( viewFrame.size.width/2 ); CGFloat lowerYBound = boundingFrame.origin.y + ( viewFrame.size.height/2 ); CGFloat higherYBound = boundingFrame.origin.y + boundingFrame.size.height - ( viewFrame.size.height/2 ); if ( center.x higherXBound ){ center.x = higherXBound; } if ( center.y higherYBound ){ center.y = higherYBound; } return center; } - (void)panPiece:(UIPanGestureRecognizer *)gestureRecognizer { UIView *piece = [gestureRecognizer view]; [self adjustAnchorPointForGestureRecognizer:gestureRecognizer]; if ([gestureRecognizer state] == UIGestureRecognizerStateBegan || [gestureRecognizer state] == UIGestureRecognizerStateChanged) { CGPoint translation = [gestureRecognizer translationInView:[piece superview]]; CGPoint translatedCenter = CGPointMake([piece center].x + translation.x, [piece center].y + translation.y); CGPoint center = [self centerWithBounds:translatedCenter andViewFrame:[piece frame] andBoundingFrame:[[piece superview] frame]]; [piece setCenter:center]; [gestureRecognizer setTranslation:CGPointZero inView:[piece superview]]; } } Code help is appreciated.
