Self-contained JNLP launcher + data file

I've got a JNLP editor application that saves data to data files. I'd like to allow users to send self-container viewer applications+data in a single file. Ideally, this self-contained file would be a double-clickable .jar file containing the data file and anything needed to bootstrap the JNLP application. Do you have a recommendation for how to get a .jar file to launch a JNLP and tell it the app open a specific file?
