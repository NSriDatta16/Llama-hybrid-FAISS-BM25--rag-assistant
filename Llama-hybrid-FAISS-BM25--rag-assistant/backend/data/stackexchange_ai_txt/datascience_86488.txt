Do i need sort the data by the eigenvalues with descend (PCA)

after computing the eigenvectors and eigenvalues. the eigenvectors sort by eigenvalues on descending. data * eigenvectors = transformed data how about the standardized raw data, do I need to sort them by the eigenvalues too? before calculating the transformed data. or are they just the same result?
