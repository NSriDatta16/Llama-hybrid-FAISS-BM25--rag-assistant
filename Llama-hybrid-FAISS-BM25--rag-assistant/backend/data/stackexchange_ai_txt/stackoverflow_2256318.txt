UniObjects for .NET - Reading and Writing UniVerse Files

Our organization is using UniObjects for .NET but the CD seems to have gone missing. I need to figure out how to read and write to and from files in Universe. Please note the program is written in VB.NET Dim uniSession As UniSession Private DATABASE_IDENTIFIER As String = "uvcs" uniSession = UniObjects.OpenSession(_hostname, _username, _password, _account, DATABASE_IDENTIFIER) ' Clear the already existing LICENCE_STATUS table Dim nepiLicenceStatusFile As UniFile = uniSession.CreateUniFile("LICENCE_STATUS") nepiLicenceStatusFile.Open() nepiLicenceStatusFile.ClearFile() ' Insert new values in the LICENCE_STATUS table??? ' Read values from the LICENCE_STATUS table??? I need to figure out how to insert new values, and read values from the LICENCE_STATUS table. Can anyone here help me?
