Making the linear and quadratic terms independent in temporal data

I'm looking at the abundance of different groups of humans over time. These abundance data closely follow a quadratic model of the form $y=a_{0}+a_{1}x+a_{2}x^{2}+ \varepsilon$ for all groups of humans, where $x$ is time and $y$ is abundance. For my research I'm paying close attention to both the linear and quadratic terms. I found that the $a_{1}$ and $a_{2}$ have a strong negative correlation. I know that this is expected, since these terms are not independent. I read that you can make $a_{1}$ and $a_{2}$ independent by centering $x$ around the mean before running the regression (Gelman, 2008). I can see how this works when $x$ and $y$ are different physical quantities (i.e. BMI vs. sugar consumption), but I don't know how to make $a_{1}$ and $a_{2}$ independent by centering $x$ (i.e. time) around the mean in a way that accounts for temporal autocorrelation (e.x. the number of humans over time). How can I examine the relationship between the linear and quadratic terms (which are not independent) for temporal data. Gelman, A.
