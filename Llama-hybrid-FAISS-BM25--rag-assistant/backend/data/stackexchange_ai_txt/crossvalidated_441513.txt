How to select best Machine Learning model for unbalanced dataset?

I have a problem statement in which I am trying to predict the occurrence of an event i.e if occurs labeled as 1 and if not occurs labeled as 0 at a time instant. Consider I have a data set in which event occurs at a time instant 't' the time 't' on which event occurs is calculated as (day of the week + hour of the day). I have huge data set in which most of the time instants have 0 values and ceratin has 1 value more precisely they are in the ratio of 8:2. The data set is as: I have tried certain scikit models such as Logistic Regression and the Bayesian model . I also balanced the weights of classes but doesn't get the expected result. It either produces all 0 due to heavyweight or on balancing (using scikit sampling) it will always predict 1 if my existing input is t->[0,0,1,0]. If anyone has any idea kindly help.
