You can remove a fragment using the #remove() method of FragmentTransaction . This method also removes the view from the container it has been attached to. However, from the fragments documentation: Stopped: The fragment is not visible. Either the host activity has been stopped or the fragment has been removed from the activity but added to the back stack. A stopped fragment is still alive (all state and member information is retained by the system). However, it is no longer visible to the user and will be killed if the activity is killed. If you've added that fragment to the back stack it is not going to be killed until the activity gets killed.
