Plotting your time series, we see that they are trended: plot(elec) (Incidentally, that bump in DE in 2012 does not make sense. Could it be that your data are percentages of new registrations, not of all registered cars?) Unfortunately, the trends are not clear enough, and have only started very recently. Thus ets() simply does not pick up on these trends, and instead picks single exponential smoothing - which has a flat line forecast. You can force multiplicative trends through the model parameter: forecasts However, note that this will very quickly give you percentages that exceed 100%. So perhaps an additive trend makes more sense: forecasts This looks slightly more reasonable. But the question still really is whether exponential smoothing or any time series model is appropriate for data such as these, which are driven heavily by political influence. It's probably more useful to include statements by the major parties as to what they plan on doing to push electric cars. (A time series model is still a great idea as a benchmark, of course.) Alternatively, contagion-type models (like the Bass) might be useful - after all there are platform effects: more electric infrastructure will only happen with more electric cars on the road (or with political support), and this in turn will make more people consider buying electrical cars. Alternatively, perhaps you want to start your time series later. Electric cars were still extremely niche in 2010, and almost as much in 2015. So it arguably is not very useful to include the early data in the forecast. Finally, once you approach saturation points, you may want to take a look at models for compositional-data , which can model percentage market shares.
