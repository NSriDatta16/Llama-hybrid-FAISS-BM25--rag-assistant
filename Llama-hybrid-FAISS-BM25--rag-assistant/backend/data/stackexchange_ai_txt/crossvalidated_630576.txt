Why shouldn't I run a logistic regression with dependent vars between 0 and 1?

I'm trying to predict the probability of an individual progressing all the way through a series of tasks. I have participants, they participate in Task 1, if they succeed, they move to Task 2, if they succeed they move to Task 3, if they succeed at Task 3, yay! I want to predict the probability of successfully completing all the tasks. Right now I'm running a binary logistic regression with the dependent variable being T/F on whether a participant succeeded on Task 3. But that's a very rare outcome and so all of my predicted probabilities are very low. I feel like I'm leaving a lot of information on the table in regards to how people have done on Task 1 and Task 2. I was thinking I could modify the dv so that it's 0 if an individual completed no tasks, 0.33 if they only completed Task 1, 0.66 if they completed Task 2 and 1 if they completed all 3. This makes sense to me because I'm going from a case where either an event happened or didn't to a case where I can incorporate information about how close someone got to the critical event occurring. But I can't seem to find anyone else doing it this way so I assume there's something very wrong about it. Q1. Why shouldn't I do it this way? Q2. What is the right way to use the information from the earlier tasks to get better predictions on the participants likelihood of success?
