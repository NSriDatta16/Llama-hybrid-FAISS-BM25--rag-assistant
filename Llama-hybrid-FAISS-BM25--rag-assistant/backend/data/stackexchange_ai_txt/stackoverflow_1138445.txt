Infragistics UltraGrid Selected Cell Value

I am using UltraGrid from Infragistics and facing a problem when selected a cell value. Whenever I select a cell value it shows as 0.000 as default. I want to show it as 0 or 1. I have already made the changes using the UltraGrid designer but for some reason it always displays 0.0000. The strange thing is that when the collection is bind to the Grid it only contains 0 or 1. Although the datatype for the column is decimal.
