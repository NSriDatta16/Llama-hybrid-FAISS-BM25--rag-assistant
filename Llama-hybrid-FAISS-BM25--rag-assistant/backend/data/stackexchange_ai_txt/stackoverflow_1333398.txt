TTPickerTextField DataSource? How do I create my own DataSource?

for my iPhone Project, I woud love to use the TTpickerTextField from Three20 to let the User select a contact from the Addressbook. While I’m really new to cocoa, I don’t understand how to use the Addressbook as a DataSource. As far as I understand, I have to create my own DataSource, that means, get every entry from the Addressbook and put it in my own DataSource, correct? But what Delegate/Protocol do I have to implement in my class, so that my class is a DataSource? Or am I on the wrong way? Can someone give me a hint? Thank you so much dragi
