the perspective divide cannot be done before clipping, which happens after the vertex shader is completed. So there is no reason that you could observe the w divide in the vertex shader. The GL will do the perspective divide before the rasterization of the triangles, before the fragment shader runs, though. What are you trying to do that does not work ?
