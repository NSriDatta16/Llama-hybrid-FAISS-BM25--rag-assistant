I guess the issue is the hr element in IE... it's not treated like other HTML elements. There are a number of solutions out there... but I couldn't get any of them to work when you want to decrease the margins. That being said... through trial and error I managed to get negative margins for IE only rendering to work. Can't be sure it'll work in IE 8 (can't test). The minimal CSS code fragment: hr {padding:0;margin:0;height:1px;border:none;color:#000;background-color:#000;} hr {display:block;margin:-7px 0;} ... I've limited it to IE8 and less since word on the web is things will change in IE9... we'll see once it can be tested :). Note if you want to change the colour of the line, you'll need to change values of color and background-color (depending on the browser one or the other is used: ref ) Tested and working in: IE 8.0.6001... IE 6.0.2900... FF 3.6.15 Cr 10.0.648.134 (on WinXP)
