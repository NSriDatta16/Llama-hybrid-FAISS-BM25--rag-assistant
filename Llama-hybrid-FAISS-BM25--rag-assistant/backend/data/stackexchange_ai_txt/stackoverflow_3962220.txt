I think it's quite common to find a lot of apps in your INSTALLED_APPS . To keep some system in your package/directory structure I think it's recommendable to have your apps inside an apps folder within your project root , while keeping other third party apps, that you do not touch somewhere else on your PYTHONPATH . I think it's very recommendable to use something like PIP and virtualenv to keep track of your apps and organize them. Here you can read another article about a useful directory structure for django projects . If an app is in your INSTALLED_APPS django will always load its models on startup and populate its APP_CACHE with these classes, but I think this is an overhead you can ignore if you are dealing with conventional apps... EDIT: Also consider that apps vary a lot in complexity, eg. something like tinymce mainly just provides a widget and some views, but no model, so if it is not used it just adds a few urls to the urlresolver and thats it...
