This can be done by adding a new build phase to your application. In your Xcode project browser, find the target for your application, and expand it to show all of the build phases. Add a new "run script" build phase to your target. The easiest way is to right-click on the target and choose "Add/New Build Phase/New Run Script Build Phase" Adding the new build phase should bring up an inspector window. In this window, you can enter the entire shell script, or simply a command line to run the script. Here's the gold: At the bottom of the inspector window you can specify input files and output files. Specifying input files sets up dependencies automatically (the shell script will only be executed if some of the input files have been modified). Specifying output files automatically propagates the dependencies to those files. When your shell script is run, Xcode knows that it needs to deal with those files that the shell script has modified. Be sure to drag your new build phase up to the top of the list of phases as shown in the screenshot below. The order will be important if you need those resource files to be included in the bundle. Save, build, commit to the repository, ask for a raise, get some fresh air and have a nice day! :)
