There are a couple ways you can do this. First, and probably most easily, you can do it recursively. (defun remove-low-words (word-list) (if (good-enough-score-p (car word-list)) (list word (remove-low-words (cdr word-list))) (remove-low-words (cdr word-list)))) You could also do it with mapcar and reduce , where the former can construct you a list with failing elements replaced by nil and the latter can be used to filter out the nil . Either would be a good candidate for a "filter" macro or function that takes a list and returns the list filtered by some predicate.
