magento XML RPC problem Class 'Zend_Http_Client' not found in

Any idea on what would make this happen? Im trying to use XML RPC zend version but anytime I try to include the client I get some sort of error. Its like its including the client, but then the client does not know how to include the files after that... test connect script is located in root directory, with the following - require_once 'lib/Zend/XmlRpc/Client.php'; $client = new Zend_XmlRpc_Client('http://mydomain.com/api/xmlrpc/'); Any help would be appreciated!
