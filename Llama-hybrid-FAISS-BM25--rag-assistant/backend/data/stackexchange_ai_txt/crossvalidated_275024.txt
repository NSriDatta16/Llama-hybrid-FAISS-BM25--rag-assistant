how do you show that the average number of periods is 1/(1-a)

we have that the probability of winning a game is b and if you win you keep playing until you loose. And it says that the average number of consecutives wins is $1/(1-b)$, suppose infinite periods. Well what the way i was trying to solve this is using a geometric sum, because the answer looks a little bit like a geometric sum, but i need some help. As allways thank you very much.
