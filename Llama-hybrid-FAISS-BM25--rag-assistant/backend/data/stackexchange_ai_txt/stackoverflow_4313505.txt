Converting Clojure data structures to Java collections

What is the Clojure-idiomatic way to convert a data structure to a Java collection, specifically: [] to a java.util.ArrayList {} to a java.util.HashMap #{} to a java.util.HashSet () to a java.util.LinkedList Is there a clojure.contrib library to do this? USE CASE : In order to ease Clojure into my organization, I am considering writing a unit-test suite for an all-Java REST server in Clojure. I have written part of the suite in Scala, but think that Clojure may be better because the macro support will reduce a lot of the boilerplate code (I need to test dozens of similar REST service calls). I am using EasyMock to mock the database connections (is there a better way?) and my mocked methods need to return java.util.List > items (representing database row sets) to callers. I would pass in a [{ "first_name" "Joe" "last_name" "Smith" "date_of_birth" (date "1960-06-13") ... } ...] structure to my mock and convert it to the required Java collection so that it can be returned to the caller in the expected format.
