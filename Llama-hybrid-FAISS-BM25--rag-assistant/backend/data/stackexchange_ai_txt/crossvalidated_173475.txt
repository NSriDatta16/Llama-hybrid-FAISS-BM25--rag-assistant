ARIMA models ( see my response to ARIMA model interpretation and here Time series and anomaly detection ) are weighted moving average models where the length (# of weights) and the weights themselves are identified empirically. ARIMA models can be easily extended to include trends that are both period-to-period trends (steady state differential) or long=term trends using variables like 0,0,0,0,1,2,3,4,.. or even level shift variables see stochastic vs deterministic trend/seasonality in time series forecasting for an example of this. I suggest that you look into automatic arima with intervention detection both here and on the web.
