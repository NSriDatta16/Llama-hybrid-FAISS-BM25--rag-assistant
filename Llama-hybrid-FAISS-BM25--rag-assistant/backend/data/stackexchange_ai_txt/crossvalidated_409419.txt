K-Fold Cross Validation: Bias in cross-validated effect size measures?

As pointed out by various authors (e.g., Hastie, 2011), K-fold cross-validation has an upward bias of prediction error. I wonder whether the same holds for cross-validated effect size measures such as a cross-validated multiple R^2 from multiple linear regression. The literature I could find deals with the case of bias in the prediction error, not averaged/cross-validated effect size measures. So, is there any formal proof or simulation-based evidence that cross-validated effect size measures yield biased estimates?
