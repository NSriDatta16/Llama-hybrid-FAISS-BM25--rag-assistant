Your model is really $\hat Y$ = $XB+E$ . Notice the hat on top of the y; y hat is your predicted values for Y. Y is the dependent variable; Y is going to be a continuous variable if you're doing regression in the general linear model. You normally know Y, it's data you've collected. Your X matrix (the design matrix) is what you've called Y. X is just your interdependent variables put into a matrix, you know the values already, they are the data you've collected. Each column represents a different variable. If you dummy code a variable, you split it into separate columns of 1's and 0's, one column for each level, so that each level get a different beta estimate. If your model has an intercept, which most models will, then add a column of 1's to the front your X matrix. Otherwise you've correctly made the dummy variables for gender--just remember which column is for which level. If you don't know what B (beta coefficients/weights) is, then beta is estimated using $(X^T X)^{-1} X^t Y$ If this is simulated data, and you've got some made up B vector, you can literally matrix multiply it with your X and add some simulated normally distributed error and get Y hat. Use that to compare to actual Y by subtracting Y and getting the residuals. If your Y (dependent variable) is meant to be a binary variable, you should not fit a regression from the general linear model because that will be biased, but fit using a distribution from the the generalIZED linear model, i.e. logistic regression.
