I think that for a single variable the not operator is simple enough and naming issues start being more relevant. Never name a variable not_X, if in need use a thesaurus and find an opposite. I've seen plenty of awful code like if (not_dead) { } else { } instead of the obvious if (alive) { } else { } Then you can sanely use (very readable, no need to invert the code blocks) if (!alive) { } else { } If we're talking about more variables I think the best rule is to simplify the condition. After a while projects tend to get conditions like: if (dead || (!dead && sleeping)) { } else { } Which translates to if (dead || sleeping) { } else { } Always pay attention to what conditions look like and how to simplify them.
