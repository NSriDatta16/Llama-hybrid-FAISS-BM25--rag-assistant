How to address Boosting and Bagging decreasing the classification accuracy

For my classification, I use several algorithms available in WEKA, but with limited number of features . I got some accuracy levels with the algorithms I used and I tried improving the accuracies using Ensemble methods. I used Boosting and Bagging for that. But the outcome I got is strange. Following figures show, the accuracies I got with and without bagging and boosting. Difference of accuracy level with and without Boosting. Difference of accuracy with and without Bagging. What I expected to see after bagging and boosting was some improvements of the accuracy levels. But you can see that, when I used Random Forest algorithm with boosting, the accuracy has been decreased. I can understand that why accuracies do not get improved. But I do not know why they get decreased. In bagging, both Random forest and Naive Bayed have shown unexpected behaviors. I did all these experiments in WEKA. I need to know why this happens? And also do they happen since I have a limited amount of features for my classification?
