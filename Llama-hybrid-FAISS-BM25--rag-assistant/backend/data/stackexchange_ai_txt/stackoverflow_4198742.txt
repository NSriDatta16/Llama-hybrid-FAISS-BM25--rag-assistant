Did you put \usepackage{multirow} at the beginning of your document? There are probably good examples out there to follow. I've never used this package but in a short time (seconds) was able to find this PAGE via google. Does following along with that example help you? Update: after seeing your actual table, I hate to say it but think your spacing glitch is due to the spill over in the "comments" column into multiple lines. I truncated your comments and got this (column 1 is now vertically centered as desired): \begin{table*}\tiny \centering \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|p{3cm}|} \hline Rule & Factor & Best Value & \Delta_t & \Delta_{do} & Comments \\ \hline % Diagonal Dominance Rule \multirow{3}{*}{Diagonal Dominance} & Line Angle & 45 & 15 & 30 & The angle between... \\ & Line Distance & 0 & 0.25 & 1 & The distance, in... \\ & Corner Distances & 0 & 0.1 & 0.7 & The distance, in... \\ \hline % Framing Rule \multirow{4}{*}{Framing} & Left Distance & 0 & ${Frame Width}*5\%$ & ${Frame Width}*25\%$ & The distance... \\ & Right Distance & 0 & ${Frame Width}*5\%$ & ${Frame Width}*25\%$ & The distance... \\ & Top Distance & 0 & ${Frame Height}*5\%$ & ${Frame Height}*25\%$ & The distance... \\ & Bottom Distance & 0 & ${Frame Height}*5\%$ & ${Frame Height}*25\%$ & The distance... \\ \hline \end{tabular} \caption{The factors of each rule and their parameters.} \label{table:factors} \end{table*} Regarding the {l} argument, I think the link I posted originally is perhaps wrong. LaTeX spits out some errors for me when I try replacing * with l for the \multirow argument. I get this on a test table: ! Missing number, treated as zero. l l.12 \multirow{4}{l}{Batch} & MM & Min-Min \\ ! Illegal unit of measure (pt inserted). l l.12 \multirow{4}{l}{Batch} & MM & Min-Min \\ After finding THIS , I think the second argument in \multirow is not for an alignment but for a width. The LyX wiki linked says the format is like so: \multirow{number of rows}{cell width}{cell entry} We've been assuming that {cell width} was actuall {alignment} and I think the link from earlier makes that confusing. See the note at the LyX wiki about spacing; you can use the following where needed to make it do your bidding: \renewcommand{\multirowsetup}{\centering} And replace \centering with \raggedleft or \raggedright where needed. I still think you're going to run into trouble with the multiple lines. I've at least shown that ditching them makes the spacing work as desired... how to force them to be centered with your default example is beyond me, I'm afraid. But perhaps now you know where the problem lies? I guess if you really, really, really wanted to you could split your sentence up, figure out how many rows it takes, and adjust your \multirow argument accordingly for the increase in rows. Though you'd also probably need a nested multirow structure: | | item 1, 2 rows | comment 1 line 1 | | multirow, 4 rows | | comment 1 line 2 (spill over) | | | item 2, 2 rows | comment 2 line 1 | | | | comment 2 line 2 (spill over) | Does that make sense? Column 1 would span all rows for its section, subsequent rows would span the number of rows required by the split up comments, and each line needed by the comments (some take up 3 or 4) would be on their own separate lines and just appear to be continuous. Not sure if the sentence spacing would look weird, though. Nuff rambling. There's your food for thought. One Last Update: One last hope way to go about this might be with TikZ tables. Essentially, your nodes are like "cells." Then just put them together and make it look like a table. Perhaps a horrible proposal, but I assure you that you'll have all the flexibility you need with cell spacing and such. Some ideas: Fancy Tables 1 Fancy Tables 2 Periodic table in TikZ which might give you some insight about how to do this a bit better than the first two?
