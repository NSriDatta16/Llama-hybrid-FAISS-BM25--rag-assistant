I assume this is transaction replication? If so, the changes to push to the subscribers are harvested from the transaction log by the log reader, so the problem does indeed sound strange. I would try running a trace on the publisher db so you can watch what the replication agents do.. not sure what might be wrong, but maybe something will jump out at you.
