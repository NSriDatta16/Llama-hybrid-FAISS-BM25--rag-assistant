Where exactly does $\geq 1$ come from in SVMs optimization problem constraint?

I've understood that SVMs are binary, linear classifiers (without the kernel trick). They have training data $(x_i, y_i)$ where $x_i$ is a vector and $y_i \in \{-1, 1\}$ is the class. As they are binary, linear classifiers the task is to find a hyperplane which separates the data points with the label $-1$ from the data points with the label $+1$. Assume for now, that the data points are linearly separable and we don't need slack variables. Now I've read that the training problem is now the following optimization problem: ${\min_{w, b} \frac{1}{2} \|w\|^2}$ s.t. $y_i ( \langle w, x_i \rangle + b) \geq 1$ I think I got that minizmizing $\|w\|^2$ means maximizing the margin (however, I don't understand why it is the square here. Would anything change if one would try to minimize $\|w\|$?). I also understood that $y_i ( \langle w, x_i \rangle + b) \geq 0$ means that the model has to be correct on the training data. However, there is a $1$ and not a $0$. Why?
