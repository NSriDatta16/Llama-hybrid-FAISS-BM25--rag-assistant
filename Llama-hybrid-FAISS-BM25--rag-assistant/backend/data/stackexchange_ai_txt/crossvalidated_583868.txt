Hochberg/Bonferonni correction for multiple one-sample t test

I am trying to conduct a content validity analysis where I want to test if a certain item (e.g. a question) can be related to a certain construct (e.g. depression). I've let people fill in a questionnaire, asking them if they would assign an item to a construct and with how much certainty (0 - 100%). I've got my data, did the processing and executed a one-sample t-test for every combination item - construct. For example I test, does the participants average value for item 1 related to construct 1, significantly differ from 0 (there is a positive linkage). I do this for every item & construct combination. I have 20 items & 7 constructs; thus execute 140 t-tests. A paper suggested correcting my p-values with a bonferroni or hochberg correction because I've performed multiple tests. From what I understand a correction looks at an amount of tests to reduce the 'familywise error rate'. My question is, what is a family in my case? Is this 20 t.tests within a construct family, 7 t.tests within an item family or 140 t.tests within my combination of construct-item?
