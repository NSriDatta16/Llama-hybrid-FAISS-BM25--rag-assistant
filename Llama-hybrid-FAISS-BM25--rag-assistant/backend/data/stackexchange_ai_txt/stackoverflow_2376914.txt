Servlet code executes in a thread. This thread is spawned by the Servlet container which is a Java application running in JVM. Upon receiving a request, Servlet container starts a thread which executes the servlet code and this code is given the incoming request to process. Upon finishing the processing this thread goes to either a pool or simply terminates depending upon how the container is developed. The benefit is that: Spawning a new process is more costly (memory, IO and CPU cycles wise) for OS than spawning a thread inside an existing process. A thread also shares memory space with the parent process. Threads can be pooled. Although a thread is less costly to create; there certainly is a performance cost to be paid; however having a pool of threads solves that to some extent. Another good point of having Threads is that the error handling can be elegantly done. If a thread returns by throwing an error it is much easier to handle it than a process terminating with error.
