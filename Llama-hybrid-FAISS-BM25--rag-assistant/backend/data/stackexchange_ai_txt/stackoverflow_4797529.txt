This is a basic table design question. First concept. Like things go in tables together. So you have tables of Pages, forms and fields at least. Forms has FK to Pages, Fields has FK to Forms. Values might be better as a follow-up question once we have this sorted out. Menus are usually stored as a hierarchy in one table, typically menuId, parentId, text, link. So far this gives us four tables, with the advantage of having it well organized, but then we confront the issue of assembling all of this on every page load, with all of those joins. So how stable is the data? If it is highly stable, you can pre-generate lots of HTML into cache file that change only when the data changes. If the data changes once/week or something like that, this will be much more performant. If the data is changing minute-by-minute you have to stay dynamic.
