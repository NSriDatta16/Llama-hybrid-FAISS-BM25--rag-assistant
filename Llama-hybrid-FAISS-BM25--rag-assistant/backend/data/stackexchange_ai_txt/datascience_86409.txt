This deep learning framework is written itself in C but once you train the network you do not need Darknet itself for the inference. OpenCV has built in support for Darknet formats so both model and trained weights are directly usable anywhere where OpenCV is in use, also from Python (see here ). The positive side of this network , there is somewhat normal documentation on how to train the own data set and how to run the inference on the own input. Other popular frameworks are sometimes so heavily "optimized" for training and validation against various existing data sets that it gets surprisingly difficult to break out of this golden cage and build a usable product.
