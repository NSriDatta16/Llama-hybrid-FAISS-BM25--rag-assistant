QT drag and drop - Creating a temporary QLabel using qobject_cast

I'm trying to give a custom class that inherits from QLabel to be draggable. Towards that end, I'm trying to create a temporary copy of the class at the current mouse position using the following code inside of the class' mousePressEvent: QLabel *child = qobject_cast{QLabel*}(this->childAt(event->pos())); NOTE: this line has carrots instead of brackets, but stack overflow interprets it and takes it out if (!child) return; The child is never created, and I can't figure out why. Any ideas?
