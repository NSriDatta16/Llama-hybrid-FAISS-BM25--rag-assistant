As @Aksakal implies, caution is needed here. These don't seem plausible data: else why does the first part of the series follow a quadratic? Data points are shown below in green and a quadratic regression as orange curve. But let's go along with the fiction that this is factual. Locally any interpolant you might take seriously will be exactly linear or nearly so, but otherwise watch out. Any idea that linear interpolation is conservative is belied by its tendency to step boldly into the unknown with just a smidgen of encouragement. Here one of several alternatives is piecewise cubic Hermite interpolation which is a MATLAB staple. Documentation can be found here A lucid explanation by Cleve Moler makes it easy to translate from that into other software (Stata in the case of the graph below). Start here . Suggested rules for extrapolation: Don't. Ask for subject-matter background. Even vague qualitative information can be crucial in knowing what to trust, what is exceptionally high or low, what might be expected in the future. Compare different interpolants. Agreement doesn't guarantee truth, but disagreement counsels scepticism. Also consider building a time series model. It might even help. Note for Stata users: The linear interpolation here is naturally done using ipolate . The pchip method uses pchipolate from SSC.
