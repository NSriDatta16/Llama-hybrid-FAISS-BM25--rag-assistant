Your anchor tags are inline. Just like text in a paragraph, inline text will not collapse white space, but respect it. Set your anchors to display:block;float:left; , and the white space should disappear. As to why Webkit decides to render it that way, I'm not sure, but it may be attempting something that generally works with inline text (e.g., if this were just a paragraph with underlined links). (Why Opera does it's own weird thing is again a mystery to me but, well, par for the course for Opera.)
