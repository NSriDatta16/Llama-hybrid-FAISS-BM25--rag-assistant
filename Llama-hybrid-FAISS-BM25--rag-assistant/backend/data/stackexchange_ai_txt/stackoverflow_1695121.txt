There's a monkeywrench being thrown into this issue by Google : A proposal for making Ajax crawlable . Google is including recommendations for url structure there that may give you ideas for your own application. Here's the wrapup: In summary, starting with a stateful URL such as http://example.com/dictionary.html#AJAX , it could be available to both crawlers and users as http://example.com/dictionary.html#!AJAX which could be crawled as http://example.com/dictionary.html?_escaped_fragment_=AJAX which in turn would be shown to users and accessed as http://example.com/dictionary.html#!AJAX View Google's Presentation here (note: google docs presentation) In general I think it's useful to simply turn off JavaScript and CSS entirely and browse your website and web application and see what ends up getting exposed. Once you get a sense of what's visible, you will understand what most search engines see and that in turn will show you what is and is not getting spidered.
