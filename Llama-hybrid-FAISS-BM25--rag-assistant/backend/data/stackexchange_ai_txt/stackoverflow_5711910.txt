There are Three systems that come to mind - Mogilefs , Mongodb GridFS and a cloud based storage solution. MogileFS (OMG Files!) was developed for Livejournal and stores metadata in Mysql. It uses that to find the actual disk with the appropriate file and streams it out. MongoDB GridFS is a lot newer, and probably easier to get going, certainly for a smaller system. It uses a new 'NoSql' database to store parts of files across its database, assembling as required. Searching around for information will find plenty of information. Finally, you could simply avoid the whole issue and just upload images into Amazon's S3 , or Rackspace Cloudfiles . I've done the latter before (though the site was already running inside Rackspace's system) and it's not very difficult, again with plenty of examples around. For S3 there is also a command-line tool, s3cmd that can be set to sync (or, better) upload and then delete a directory full of files into an S3 'bucket'.
