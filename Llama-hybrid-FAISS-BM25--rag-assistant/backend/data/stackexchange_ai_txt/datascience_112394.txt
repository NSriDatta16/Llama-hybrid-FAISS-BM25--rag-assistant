There is a UMAP parameter called n_component, which is the dimension in output (1D, 2D, etc.). https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/parameters.html#n-components UMAP is not like PCA in terms of n_components: In fact, all the initial dimensions (=initial data having m features) are projected to a lower-dimensional space (=n components). The UMAP axes don't have the same meaning as the PCA axes: UMAP represents a relative space of probabilities, whereas PCA axes represent the main features' abundance of variation. As a consequence, you just have to choose n_components based on data complexity and volume. In most cases, n_components = 2 is the best option because it is easier to read a 2D map than a 1D or 3D map or more. Very simple cases with few clusters would be better with n_components = 1. In complex cases with many features, n_components = 3 or more might be better. Note that for output with n_components >=3, you can extract 2D views from it to see clusters from different angles. Here is a cool website explaining UMAP interactively: https://pair-code.github.io/understanding-umap/
