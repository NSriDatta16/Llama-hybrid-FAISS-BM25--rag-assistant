Its pretty simple, The values you get in the buffer are positive and negative (this is how the waves work) so if you do the average of that values it will give you a near 0 value. So what you have to do is just put all values positive (with the Math.abs() function) and then do the avarage, it will return you the sound level. Hope this helps ;)
