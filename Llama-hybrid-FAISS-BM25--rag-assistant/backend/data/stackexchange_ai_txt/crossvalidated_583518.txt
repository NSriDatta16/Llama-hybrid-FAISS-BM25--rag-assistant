Bayesian structural equation modelling - do all parameters have to show good diagnostics (e.g., autocorrelation, trace plot etc.)?

Would a Bayesian SEM model only be accepted by a scientific journal if all parameters show good diagnostics ? (e.g., autocorrelation, trace plot etc.). Is it realistic to build such a model? Or is it ok to say that some parameters are more trustworthy than others?
