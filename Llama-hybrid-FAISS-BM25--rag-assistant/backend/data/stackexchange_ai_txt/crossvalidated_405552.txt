You should look into the design of experiments. Say there are 12 rowers, and 8 seats in the boat. We start with the model $$ Y= \beta_0 + \sum_{i=1}^{12} \beta_i I_i + \epsilon_i $$ where $I_i$ are inclusion indicators for the rowers, and $\sum_{i=1}^{12} I_i=8$ . I would start with optimal experimental design for this model. The number of possible teams are $\binom{12}{8}=495$ , so trying all teams would be prohibitive. You could just generate all 495 teams, and use as input for some optimal design algorithms, like in R package AlgDesign which implements the Fedorov exchange algorithm using the criterion of D-optimality. I would guess there are theoretical results for this specific kind of model, but cannot find references. ... and typically only 2 or 3 seats are really contentious With some prior information, you could look into Bayesian design of experiments . Not much on this site, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_experimental_design .
