Your URL fragment /~/media/Flash Movies/nameoftheItem.ashx is appears to be badly formed. Typically you'd start a URL in ASP.NET with a tilde ~ to indicate the root of your web application. ASP.NET would then figure out how that translates to a full URL. It could be on the root of the domain or in a virtual directory somewhere, but the idea is that your application shouldn't care. The tilde simply indicates the root of your application. Unfortunately, in this case it appears that a slash got prepended onto the front, so that the interpretation is that the full url will be something like http://www.mydomain.com/~/media/Flash Movies/nameoftheItem.ashx as the tilde is no longer on the front of the URL fragment that ASP.NET sees.
