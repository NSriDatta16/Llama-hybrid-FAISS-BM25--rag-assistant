zend framework losing session

I am trying to implement a Flash uploader in my Zend framework application but I am having problems with the session. The Flash does not send any cookie headers and this is why the session is lost. I am trying to send the sessionId as a post param and in my bootstrap file I added a session_id($_POST['session_id]) but this doenst seem to work. I am using a MySQL table as session storage I tryed to debug the error and as far as I see, the session_id is set, and the storage returns the corect data from the database but it doesn't seem to be set correctly in the $_SESSION global. And even stranger it seems to work on my Windows computer but not on the Linux staging server.
