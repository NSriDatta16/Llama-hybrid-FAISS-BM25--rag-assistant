Has anyone turned Flash Page Flip into a draggable Pick Up Paper?

I am trying to turn the the flash page flip (source: http://76design.com/shiftcontrol/index.php/2005/07/03/dynamic-page-flip/ ) into a single page that can be lifted up, dragged around, and set back down. All looking very realistic. Does anyone think they can accomplish this? Or have you seen this modification anywhere? Thanks
