You're going to be using a lot of bandwidth to transfer all these images from the server to the clients (browsers). Remember appengine has a maximum number of files you can upload, I think it is 1000 but it may have increased recently. And if you want to control access to the files I do not think you can use option #1. Option #2 is good, but your bandwidth and storage costs are going to be high if you have a lot of content. To solve this problem people usually turn to Content Delivery Networks (CDNs). Amazon S3 and edgecast.com are two such CDNs that support token based access urls. Meaning, you can generate a token in your appengine app that that is good for either the IP address, time, geography and some other criteria and then give your cdn url with this token to the requestor. The CDN serves your images and does the access checks based on the token. This will help you control access, but remember if there is a will, there is a way and you can't 100% secure anything - but you probably get reasonably close. So instead of storing the content in appengine, you would store it on the cdn, and use appengine to create urls with tokens pointing to the content on the cdn. Here are some links about the signed urls. I've used both of these : http://jets3t.s3.amazonaws.com/toolkit/code-samples.html#signed-urls http://www.edgecast.com/edgecast_difference.htm - look at 'Content Security'
