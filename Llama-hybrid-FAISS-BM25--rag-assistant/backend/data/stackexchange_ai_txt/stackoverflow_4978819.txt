You have 2 different approaches: As Mark Gilbert and @Tergiver explain, you can remove the focus from the inplace control which will commit the value change before the menu command is triggered. Since you have to do this from your OnSave handler, you put a dependency on the grid from there. You can also do the contrary. Derive from the PropertyGrid and override the ProcessCmdKey. If you detect a Ctrl+S, change the focus to the grid itself then call base.ProcessCmdKey(). Contrarily to point 1, this puts a dependency on the shortcut keys of the application (Ctrl+S at least) from the grid. I should add that I didn't try this method but in theory it should work. Your choice...
