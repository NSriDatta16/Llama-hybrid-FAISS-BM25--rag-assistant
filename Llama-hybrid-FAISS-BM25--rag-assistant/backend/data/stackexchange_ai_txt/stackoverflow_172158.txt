"I'm hearing about a lot of companies that act like they're agile but the only agile thing > they do is the Scrum process. Is this enough to be considered agile" Short answer - yes. In my opinion anyway :-) Of course - they have to be actually doing Scrum - rather than just sticking the name on the wall. There's a lot more to Scrum than daily stand-ups... and if that's all they're doing they're not doing it right. Done correctly Scrum forces companies to identify the bottlenecks in how the organisation is running. By setting up regular timeboxed sprints, getting a decent feedback loop, and splitting responsibility across product owner and team appropriately you actually get useful baseline information on how to improve your process. The organisation has to listen to that feedback - and act on it. It's certainly not the only way to do agile. It might not even be the best way to introduce agile into an organisation. I'm more of an XP fan myself - and find that the extra practices provide a useful framework for kick-starting those process improvements. That said - for many organisations - the biggest problem is bad split of responsibilities & the complete lack of a sane and rapid feedback loop. Scrum fixes that out of the gate. Meetings are a very small part of that :-)
