OWASP (open web application security project) has very good explanation on CSRF, I encourage you to read it and post your questions afterwards. http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_(CSRF) If you are looking for sample implementation on how to prevent CSRF, take a look at Django and its write-up. http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/csrf/
