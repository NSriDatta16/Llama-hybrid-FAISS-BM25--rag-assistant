When sharing archived app via email, why does Xcode attach both the ipa and the mobileprovision?

In Xcode: Window->Organizer Share...->Save to Disk... You get an ipa. Share...->Email... You get an ipa and a mobileprovision file as attachments. But is seems that the very same mobileprovision is included in the ipa as well. Why the out-of-band mobileprovision? What purpose does it serve?
