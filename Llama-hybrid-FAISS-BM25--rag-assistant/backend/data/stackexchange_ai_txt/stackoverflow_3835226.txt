Your data storage structure has no way of telling how many strings in commands[j] are valid. So I think it's putting two pointers each in commands[0] and commands[1] just like you expect. But then your print loop looks at commands[0].args[k] for k all the way up to 4, even though it's only valid to look at the first two. When you get up to looking at commands[0].args[2] , the result is undefined. (Showing memory from somewhere else in your program, crashing, and catching fire are just a few of the things a program is allowed to do if you use undefined behavior.) To figure out how many arguments are in each command, you could add a counter member to your struct test . Or maybe allocate one more pointer than there are arguments, and put a NULL after the last argument.
