CSS: How to remove pseudo elements (after, before,...)?

I would like to use a switch for the layout of paragraph tags on a webpage. I use the after pseudoelement: p:after {content: url("../img/paragraph.gif");} Now I need to remove this CSS code from the page. How can this be done easily? I want to add that: jQuery is already used on the page and I do not want to include or remove files containing CSS.
