IE7 Defaults Elements to 100% Width

I've got a really frustrating problem with a web application I work on (I didn't originally write it). It uses frames for the layout scarily enough. The problem I'm having is that all elements with a background colour and border set via CSS default to 100% width. I've just tested div elements, paragraph elements etc. I removed the stylesheet completely and then tested it and I had the same problem, so it's not the stylesheet causing the problem. I wrote a quick test to make sure it wasn't conflicting code and used the same doctype and xmlns as ours - I get the same problem. Here's the example code. #test { border:1px solid #ccc; background-color:#ddd; } Test information! Any ideas?
