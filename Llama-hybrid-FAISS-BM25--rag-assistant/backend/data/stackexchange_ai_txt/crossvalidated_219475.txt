Is it possible that a single neural network structure can solve multiple problems?

I am an enthusiast of neural network and regularly I try to model simple models in NN. While thinking about neural network's application in artificial intelligence I had this doubt arise in my mind whether a single neural network can solve multiple tasks or problems. A neural network trained to classify digits from images can also be used "simultaneously" for other task such as writing an original article. I know we can retrain same neural network depending on the task but I am not looking for that. In order to check my doubt I created a neural network which should in theory will solve two continuous equations (will add more equations in future) and this is my code library(caret) set.seed(2016) #first equation equ1 and the out put is this size decay RMSE Rsquared RMSE SD Rsquared SD 1 0e+00 187737.1 NaN 373322.1 NA 1 1e-04 187737.1 NaN 373322.1 NA 1 1e-01 187737.1 0.09728231 373322.1 NA 3 0e+00 187737.1 NaN 373322.1 NA 3 1e-04 187737.1 NaN 373322.1 NA 3 1e-01 187737.1 0.15565127 373322.1 0.1361369 5 0e+00 187737.1 NaN 373322.1 NA 5 1e-04 187737.1 NaN 373322.1 NA 5 1e-01 187737.1 0.30146221 373322.1 0.2960712 From the result we can see that its RMSE value is way greater and non of the models can be used for solving the two equations? 1Q.Does a single neural network can solve multiple tasks? 2Q.If yes,Did I made any error in my code which is giving me negative results? 3Q.Can anyone share any neural network example which can be successfully used for different tasks(without retraining them)?
