It's not comprehensive and high-level enough for what you asked, but for doing geodetic transforms you can use the NGA's excellent GEOTRANS library: http://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/geotrans/ That will let you convert between things like WGS84 lat/long and a local cartesian coordinate system. The C code is well tested, documented, and is public domain.
