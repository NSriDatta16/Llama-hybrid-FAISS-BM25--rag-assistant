Even property of Kernel in Non-parametric statistics

In Non-parametric statistics one requirement for the kernel is : $$ K(-u)=K(u) $$ for all values of $u$. This requirement ensures that the average of the corresponding distribution is equal to that of the sample used. Can anyone prove or show me how this criteria comes from even nature of kernel? Reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(statistics) It looks like that: $$ E(X)= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}x K(x)dx =0 $$ This is in definition section in non-parametric statistics. Thanks.
