You should use a separate css for the print media. This allows you to hide/show portions of the page when it gets printed. html : blah print this! include: print.css .dont-print-that{display:none;} The other solution is to open a new window with only the content you want to print. You could either do that in a popup or an iframe. Personally I find the CSS solution more elegant, but that's up to you.
