It's really not that difficult at all... I had students in my design patterns class doing it for an assignment (adding/removing javabean getters and setters) See http://help.eclipse.org/ganymede/topic/org.eclipse.jdt.doc.isv/guide/jdt_api_manip.htm [ EDIT : added the following article reference ] And a great article on it at http://www.eclipse.org/articles/article.php?file=Article-JavaCodeManipulation_AST/index.html (from 2006 -- there may be a few API changes since) Yes, writing plugins takes a little getting used to, but so does any API. And you can modify the AST -- see the page I reference above. (I should note that the above link is from the eclipse help, which can also be accessed via Help->Help Contents inside Eclipse -- there's a lot of good info in there, but it's just a starting point)
