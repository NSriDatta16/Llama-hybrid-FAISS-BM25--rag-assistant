Some answers: Upcasting happens implicitly any time you pass a specific object to a method accepting a more generic object. In your example, when you pass a Dog to a method accepting an Animal, upcasting happens although you don't do it explicitly with parentheses. As mentioned by others here, in method overloading scenarios where you have general and specific methods. In your example, imagine a method accepting a Dog, and another with the same name accepting an Animal. If for some reason you need to call the general version, you need to explicitly upcast your object. Explicit upcasting can be used as a form of documentation; if at some point in your code you no longer need refer to a Dog as a Dog but continue treating it as an Animal, it may be a good idea to upcast to let other developers understand what's going on.
