I had to solve a very similar problem to validate whether an address is valid or invalid. Typically address have the structure "1600 Pennsylvania Ave, Washington DC, 20500" A string such as "I went down 2000 steps and reached Pennsylvania Ave in Washington DC." is not a valid address. This can be solved by classification techniques such as SVM, Neural Networks etc. The idea is to identify a key set of features. Some of these could be: 1) Does the street name start with a valid block number. Most US block numbers are either numbers (e.g. 1200) or a number followed by a single letter (120A) or a number following a single letter (e.g. S200). 2) If the address is well formatted, the street names end in suffixes like Ave for avenue, Dr for Drive, Blvd for Boulevard. It is possible to obtain the US street suffix list from USPS site. 3) The number of words in the street address field can also be an interesting feature. If there are too many words, it is probably not a valid address. E.g. see the example above. 4) How many words occur between the block number and the street suffix in address field ? These can be used to train a learning algorithm and the resulting model can be used to validate if a given address is valid or not.
