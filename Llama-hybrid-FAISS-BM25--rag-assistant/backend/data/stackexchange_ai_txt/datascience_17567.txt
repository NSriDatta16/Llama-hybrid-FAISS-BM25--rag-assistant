EEG data layout for RNN

How should one structure an input data matrix (containing EEG data) for an RNN? Normally, RNNs are presented as language models where you have a one hot vector indicating the presence of a word. So if you input was the sentence "hello how are you", you would have 4 one hot vectors (I think): [1, 0, 0, 0] [0, 1, 0, 0] [0, 0, 1, 0] [0, 0, 0, 1] How do these individual vectors get condensed into a single data matrix? In the case of single channel EEG (with only 1 electrode), 256 samples per second, 1 second long samples, how should this data be structured? Would it be 256 vectors? If so, what does each vector represent/contain? Or should it be 1 vector that is 256 elements long? Furthermore, how does this extend to multi channel EEG with, say, 64 electrodes over 256 time samples? I would prefer to use the raw EEG data, rather than trying some dimensionality reduction (calculating means, spectrograms etc)
