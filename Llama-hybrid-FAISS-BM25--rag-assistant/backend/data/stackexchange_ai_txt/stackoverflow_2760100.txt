I have found that--as everyone will tell you--if you are coming back to code after several months you will have forgotten everything. That said, I hardly comment my own code except for comments like // ew.. hacked because X-beyond-my-control doesn't do Y correctly . But this is because the code itself is written very cleanly and is very easy to read. For instance, all variable and function names are completely descriptive. I don't use abbreviations except for rather long words which are obvious such as 'info'. All functions are extremely brief. All functions do one thing if possible. Nesting is avoided if possible. Logically related functions are grouped via classes or modules. When I read other people's code, I don't read the comments. I read the code. And the difference between clear and well written code and spaghetti is far more important than any comments. Usually I don't care what their intent is/was; I want to change the code. And to do that it easily it needs to be well organized. So the comments are peripheral. But perhaps this is just me.
