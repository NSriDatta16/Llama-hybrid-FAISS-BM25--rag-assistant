One way to find out what R has calculated is make a little experiment. Here I simulate data according to the model $$ \log\left(\frac{p_y}{1-p_y}\right) = b_0+ b_1x_1 + b_2x_2 $$ where I set b0=2, b1=-3, and b2=5. I let x1 and x2 be normally distributed. N That result shows that the coefficients returned by glm are indeed the linear coefficients connecting the Xs to the log odds of Y. As for calculating by hand, the glm function works differently from OLS. It maximizes a likelihood that depends on the distribution of error terms. In the case of logistic regression, the error terms are logistically (not binomially) distributed and that is quite different from Normal, as assumed by OLS.
