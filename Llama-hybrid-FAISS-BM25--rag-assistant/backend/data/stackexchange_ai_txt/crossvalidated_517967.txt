What is this cross-validation technique called?

Say I have a data set. I split the data into 10 chunks. I fit the model on the 1st chunk, and test it on the 9 other chunks. The average result over the 9 chunks is then the average performance of the model. What is this cross-validation technique called? Note that I am ONLY fitting the model ONCE (on the 1st of the 10 chunks). I am NOT refitting it on multiple chunks. So I am not sure what this is called .."1-fold cross validation"? I'm not sure.
