The InnoDB storage engine supports self-referencing foreign keys, and you can use them to emulate a hierarchical structure. To declare the key, you could do something like this in your CREATE TABLE statement: FOREIGN KEY (`folderId`,`siteId`) REFERENCES `folder` (`Id`, `siteId`) An important thing to remember is that this key should be NULL -able, so you can indicate which record(s) are the root of the tree.
