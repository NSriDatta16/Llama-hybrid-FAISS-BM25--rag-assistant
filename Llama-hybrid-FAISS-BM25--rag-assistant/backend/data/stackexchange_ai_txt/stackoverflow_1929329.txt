I'd like to see the code for the organisationMergeMgr but my guess would be that you have transactions staying open when they are not supposed because there is no explicit commit or rollback call that is made in all situations (even if you think it will always participate in a larger transaction these calls must be made to guarantee cleanup of transactional resources)
