How can I profile tomcat on mac os X?

I am running an independent (I mean not inside any IDE) tomcat instance. I want to profile my application because it seams to respond really slow in a particular use case. So, I tried installing TPTP on my mac os x 10.4 (tiger) but it seams that there is no version available. Then I tried to just set "JAVA_OPTS="-Xmx512m -XrunpiAgent:server=enabled" in tomcat/bin/setenv.sh but it threw the following error: Error occurred during initialization of VM Could not find agent library: libpiAgent.jnilib (searched /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/1.5.0/Libraries:/System/Library/Java/Extensions:/Library/Java/Extensions:.) I was pretty happy with the TPTP (with eclipse) on windows. Any ideas? Regards, Sandeep Giri
