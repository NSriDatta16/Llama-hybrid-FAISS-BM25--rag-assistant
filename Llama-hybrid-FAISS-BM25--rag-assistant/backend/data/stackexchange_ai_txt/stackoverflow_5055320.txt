You don't need to download anything to use OpenGL. Just add #include #include to the top of your source file. And you also need to link the libraries, which in MSVC can be done like this: #pragma comment(lib, "opengl32.lib") #pragma comment(lib, "glu32.lib") With the header files provided with microsoft, you are stuck with version 1.1 of ogl. I suggest getting the latest extension headers from the OpenGL website, as well as something like GLEW. This will give you access to the latest available functions and constants in OpenGL.
