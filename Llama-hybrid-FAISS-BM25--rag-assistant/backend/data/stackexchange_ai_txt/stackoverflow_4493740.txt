Exposing properties of an object contained by a control

I have a simple object, could be a struct even, with three properties that I want to expose to the designer. Basically, I want my property to look like the Size or Padding properties of your average control, with an arrow to collapse or expand the properties as a sub-list of the control's properties. However, I cannot find any reference as to how this can be done. Since there are several types of properties with this collapse/extend look and feel I imagine there's something built-in I can use. If I have to implement my own Designer or Editor, forget it; it's not worth it. I doubt that that's the case; there's gotta be some simple attribute I can stick on the property or class that tells the designer to expose the browsable sub-properties.
