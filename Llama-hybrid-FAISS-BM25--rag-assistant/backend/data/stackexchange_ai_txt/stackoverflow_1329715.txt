Changing the culture for was not a good idea, since all my website is in spanish, so the path that I took was to create a SpanishMessageInterpolator and then set it up in my nhv.config like: NHibernateValidator.SpanishMessageInterpolator, Assembly And finally I did modify my global.asax.cs file to include the nhv.config file on NHibernate initialization, like: NHibernateSession.Init( webSessionStorage, new string[] { Server.MapPath("~/bin/Assembly.dll") }, new AutoPersistenceModelGenerator().Generate(), Server.MapPath("~/NHibernate.config"), Server.MapPath("~/nhv.config"));
