I'd say you actually build a non-graphical model of what is going on, disencouraging the use of glGet*/glRead* (latency, portability, etc.). That is of your transform (rotation) matrix. Then you would use glLoadIdentity each frame, push/popMatrix and loadMatrix to apply your transfomation. Saving the current model orientation will be the same as copying the transformation matrix, which is really just a copy of a small bunch of floats.
