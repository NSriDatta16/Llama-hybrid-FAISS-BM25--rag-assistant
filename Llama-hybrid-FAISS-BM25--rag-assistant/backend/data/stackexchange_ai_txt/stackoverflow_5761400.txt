Backbone.localStorage is an external file you can use which overwrites Backbone.Sync. You can use simple feature detection for whether the user is offline or online and then asynchronously load Backbone.localStorage.js if they are offline. If neccesary you can also pass in a specific version of Backbone.sync to your models and collections. If you want to do both at the same time you'll have to write your own version of Backbone.sync that both calls the server and calls localStorage. The easiest way to do this is to just define Backbone.sync = function() { originalSync.apply(this, arguments); localStorageSync.apply(this, arguments); } Edit: As mentioned in the comments, if you use the latest backbone localStorage plugin then you can do the following Backbone.sync = function Sync() { Backbone.ajaxSync.apply(this, arguments); return Backbone.localSync.apply(this, arguments); };
