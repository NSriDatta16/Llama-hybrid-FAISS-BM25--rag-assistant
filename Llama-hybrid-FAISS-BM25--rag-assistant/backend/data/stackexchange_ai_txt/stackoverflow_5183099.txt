Apperance of runtime Infragistics UltraWebGrid different than in ultrawebgrid designer

!I'm trying to get an Infragistics UltraWebGrid to work with one of the Styles provided by Infragistics (Office2007Blue). My problem is that the grid looks nice at design time (image1) ... but bad (and very different) at runtime (image 2). The odd thing is that - judging by the runtime html source - it seems that the Office2007Blue style is actually applied (image 3) but that the referenced UltraWebGrid stylesheet file ig_grid_opt.css specifies an orange header image (images/office_grid_header.jpg) for the TH class, where I am expecting something blueish. In the style's Image folder there is a different file (images/iguwg_header.gif) which seems much more suitable (it is blue!) than the office_grid_header.jpg image. Have I configured my grid wrong, or is this an Infragistics style glitch? EDIT: I cross-posted this question at the Infragistics web site and I think someone is looking into it.
