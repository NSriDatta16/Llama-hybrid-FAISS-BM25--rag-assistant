That paper does not say that an SVM assumes independent and identically distributed data, but just that the statistical analysis undertaken in that paper makes that assumption. Moreover, this assumption does not refer to the different variables ("features") but to the different data points in each class. Scaling may improve SVM performance, but identical distributions for different variables is in no way a prerequisite.
