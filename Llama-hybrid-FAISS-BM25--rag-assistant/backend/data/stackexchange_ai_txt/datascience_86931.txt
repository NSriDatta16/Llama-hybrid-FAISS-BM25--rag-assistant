If you are after a baseline model, which I also strongly recommend, matrix-factorization (MF) approach (aka collaborative models) you mentioned is the most basic one and super fast and easy to implement. Then you can explore others like content-based models or hybrid recommenders, or even the recent ones based on the self-attention mechanism that Media mentioned. Doing this would give you something to compare with during A/B tests, if there is nothing is in place already. Just note that with the traditional MF may run into memory/performance issues if your matrix get very big (well, if your resources are limited!), and for that Deep Matrix Factorization are a better equivalent choice. I have summarized almost a year ago about these three starting recommendation engines, see this answer . I have code snippers/notebooks gathered from references there for practical implementation of these few baseline that might be able to share if needed.
