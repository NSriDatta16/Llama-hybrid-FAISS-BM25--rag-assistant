What does a p-value of 0 imply in a Ljung Box statistic?

What does a p-value of 0 in the Ljung-Box statistic imply? When I use the multivariate time series and fit a VARMA model, the Ljung-Box statistic (applied to residuals) gives values larger than 0.05 for all lags but the first two which are 1. On the contrary, when I use difference series, I get 0's for all the lags but the first two which are 1. According to my understanding, the 0's imply that correlation exists in the fitted model.
