In case anyone cares, I found out what was going on. We had an effect over the entire app that could blur the window when performing a long operation. This effect was always there and a trigger would cause the effect to change from clear to blurry. Because the effect was always 'on' WPF had to do more work when rendering the app. By changing the xaml of the main window so that the effect was only set when needed, and removed afterwards, the dragging issue disappeared.
