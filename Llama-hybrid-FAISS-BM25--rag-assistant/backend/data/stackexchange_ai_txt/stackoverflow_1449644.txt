No, you should not create a specific exception for each precondition because it will go against the principles of the Design-by-Contract. The corollaries of implementing pre-conditions is that they should be part of the documentation and that you should provide the necessary methods for the caller to check that all the preconditions are valid. (i.e. if a method execution is relying on the status of an object, the method to check the status should be available to the caller). So, the caller should be able to check if all prerequisites are met before calling your method. Implementing specific exceptions for each violated pre-condition would/could encourage the caller to use the try/catch pattern around the method call, what is in contradiction with the philosophy of the Design-by-Contract.
