Was it 17 consecutive days that data was not collected ? I no then I would linearly interpolate (while holding my breath !) to get estimates of these 17 missing values. I would then identify a useful model which I would then use to make a prediction. I would use re-sampling of model errors and enable pulses to be incorporated when generating confidence limits. The fact that the data is not continuous is not a real concern to me only a slight bother as reasonable models can be constructed for integer data just as long as the values are not too repetitive. Recall that the airline time series is discrete data. If you can interpolate please do so.
