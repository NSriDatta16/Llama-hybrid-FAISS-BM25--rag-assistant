Indeed, we search the Bayesian posterior $$p(t|t>t_0) = \frac{p(t,t>t_0)}{p(t>t_0)} = \frac{p(t)1_{t>t_0}}{p(t>t_0)}.$$ Explanation: The density $p(t)$ is multiplied by $1_{t>t_0}$ , to remove the probability for all events $t\leq t_0$ that we know have not happened. The remaining probability density $p(t)1_{t>t_0}$ integrates to $\int p(t)1_{t>t_0} \mathrm{d}t = p(t>t_0)$ since that was the original probability of our observation $t>t_0$ . To turn it into a probability density that integrates to $1$ , it is normalized by dividing it by $p(t>t_0)$ , so that $\int \frac{p(t)1_{t>t_0}}{p(t>t_0)}\mathrm{d}t = \frac{\int p(t)1_{t>t_0}\mathrm{d}t}{p(t>t_0)} = \frac{p(t>t_0)}{p(t>t_0)} = 1$ as required.
