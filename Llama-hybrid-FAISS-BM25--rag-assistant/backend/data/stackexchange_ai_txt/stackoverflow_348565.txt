Well, every time you generate HTML snippets on the client and on the server you may end up with duplicated code. There is no good way around it generally. But you can do two things: Generate everything on the server. Use AHAH when you need to generate HTML snippets dynamically. Basically you ask server to generate an HTML fragment, receive it asynchronously, and plug it in place using innerHTML or any other similar mechanism. Generate everything on the client (AKA the thick client paradigm). In this case even for the initial rendering you pass data instead of pre-rendered HTML, and process the data client-side using JavaScript to make HTML. Depending on the situation you can use the data island technique, or request data asynchronously. Variant: include it as using JSONP so the browser will make a request for you while loading the page. Both approaches are very simple and have different set of pros and cons. Sometimes it is possible to combine both techniques within one web application for different parts of data. Of course you can go for exotic solutions, like using some JavaScript-based server-side framework. In this case you can share the code between the server and the client.
