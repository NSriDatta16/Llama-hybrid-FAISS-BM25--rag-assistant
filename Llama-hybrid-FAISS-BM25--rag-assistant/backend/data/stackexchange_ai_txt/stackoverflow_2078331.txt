You might want to preallocate the vector using .reserve if you have an idea of how large the "average" file is. Efficiency is a tricky game. Don't play tricks early on, and design a good basic algorithm. If it's not fast enough, you start looking at the IO routines, whether you're creating any "extra" objects (explicitly or implicitly, especially if you're passing parameters around). In your example, you might want to do a second call to clock() before printing the summary output -- get a slightly more accurate timing! :)
