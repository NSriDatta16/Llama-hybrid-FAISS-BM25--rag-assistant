Understanding the output of a bootstrap performed in R (tsboot, MannKendall)

I have a question regarding the interpretation of the tsboot call in R. I checked the documentation of both the Kendall and the boot package, but am no smarter than before. When I run a bootstrap using e.g. the example in the Kendall package, where the test statistic is Kendall's tau: library(Kendall) # Annual precipitation entire Great Lakes # The Mann-Kendall trend test confirms the upward trend. data(PrecipGL) MannKendall(PrecipGL) which confirms the upward trend: tau = 0.265, 2-sided pvalue =0.00029206 The example then continues to use a block bootstrap: # #Use block bootstrap library(boot) data(PrecipGL) MKtau I receive the following result: BLOCK BOOTSTRAP FOR TIME SERIES Fixed Block Length of 5 Call: tsboot(tseries = PrecipGL, statistic = MKtau, R = 500, l = 5, sim = "fixed") Bootstrap Statistics : original bias std. error t1* 0.2645801 -0.2670514 0.09270585 If I understand correctly, the "t1* original" is the original MKtau, the "bias" is the mean of the MKtau from the R=500 bootstrapped time series, and the "std. error" is the standard deviation of the MKtaus from the 500 samples. I have trouble understanding what this means - this basically tells me that all 500 MKTaus are lower than the original, and that the original t1* is in the range of 3 sd of the bootstrapped MKtaus. Ergo it is significantly different? Or would I say the MKtau for the data set is 0.26 plus/minus standard error? I'm sorry for the lengthy question, but I am a statistics novice and am learning via self-study, lacking someone to bounce this probably really simple problem back and forth with.
