Lots of choices: All prices stored as varchars Prices stored numerically and extra price_display field that overrides the number if populated Prices stored numberically and extra price_display field for display purposes populated manually or on trigger when numeric price is updated (duplication of data and it could get out of sync - yuk) Store special case negative prices that map to special situations (simply yuk!!) varchar price, prefix key field to a table of available prefixes ('cost +', ...), suffix key field to a table of available suffixes, type field key to a list of types for the value in price ('$', '%', 'description'). Useful if you'd need to write complex queries against prices in the future. I'd probably go for 2 as a pragmatic solution, and an extension of 5 if I needed something very general for a generic pricing system.
