I think you are confusing the ideas of a random variable, $X$ , and a collection of random variables, more properly known as a random process , $(X_{t})_{t \in T}$ . In this notation, $T$ is some index set and $t$ is some value from this index set. A common example of a random process is a random walk in one dimension . I'll give you a verbal description of a concrete example and then translate that into mathematical notation. I will then show that this example can be generalized to the example you gave in your question. We have someone standing at a particular initial point; for every second afterwards the person either moves forward one step with probability $\frac{1}{2}$ or backward with probability $\frac{1}{2}$ . Each step taken is a random variable (here, these specific random variables are called Rademacher or symmetric Bernoulli random variables), and the location of our random walker at any second is the sum of the person's initial location and the forward and backward steps taken up to that moment. But a sum of random variables is itself a random variable, so the walker's position at any second is also a random variable. Translating this into our notation, we have $T = \mathbb{N} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, \dots \}$ . We will denote our walker's initial location by the random variable $Z_{0}$ - this random variable may have some distribution over specific points on the line our walker is on, but the details aren't important for this explanation, so we may just as well treat $Z_{0}$ as a constant. Each step taken at any second $t\geq 1$ will be denoted by the random variable $Z_{t}$ . Now for times $t \geq 1$ , $Z_{t}$ has only two possible values, $-1$ or $+1$ , which correspond to one step forward or one step backward. The probabilities are equal, that is $P(Z_{t} = -1) = P(Z_{t} = +1) = \frac{1}{2}$ . And finally, as mentioned above, our walker's location at any time $t$ , denoted by $X_{t}$ , can be found by taking the sum of the walker's initial location and all steps taken so far: $X_{t} = \sum_{i = 0}^{t}Z_{i}$ . This means that your random walk is an infinite sequence of random variables, $(X_{0}, X_{1}, X_{2}, X_{3}, \dots)$ . An important point to note here is that even though the step $Z_{t}$ taken at any time $t$ is independent of a step $Z_{s}$ taken at any other time $s \leq t$ , the value of the location $X_{t}$ at time $t$ is not independent of the values of $X_{s}$ for other times $s \leq t$ . Now how does this relate to your example of Zinc concentrations? Well, your example is still a random process. Based on your description, we should take our index set to be the plane, i.e. $T = \mathbb{R}^2$ (technically, some compact subset of the plane, but I digress). This type of random process is called a random field . You can think of it like this: you have a map of the region where you will be looking for Zinc deposits. At each point on the map you have a random variable whose distribution somehow captures the probability of finding Zinc at that point . So your entire map is associated with a collection of random variables $(X_{s})_{s \in \mathbb{R}^{2}}$ - that is your random field for this example. Unlike the random walk example earlier, this collection may be much more complicated - the distributions of each $X_{s}$ may be vastly different from each other; for instance, different types of soil or different environments may be associated with different probabilities of encountering a Zinc deposit. And it is likely that there is some complicated covariance structure relating the variables together through conditional relationships. For example, if you found Zinc at some specific point $s_{0}$ , then it may be more likely that you will also find Zinc at nearby points, say some points $s'$ within some distance $\delta$ of $s_{0}$ . So measuring $X_{s_{0}}$ could give you information about all the random variables $X_{s'}$ for $|s_{0} - s'| \leq \delta$ . This is actually similar to the lack of independence of the $X_{t}$ random variables in our earlier random walk example. To try to clarify another point of confusion you seem to have, when you talk about sampling $10$ points on your map, you are actually taking $10$ of these random variables from the entire collection $(X_{s})_{s \in \mathbb{R}^{2}}$ and observing an outcome , i.e. sampling from the $10$ distributions , of those $10$ random variables. Part of the randomness involved may also describe your potential failure to detect a Zinc deposit at some point $s$ even though there actually is a Zinc deposit at that location . The entire collection $(X_{s})_{s \in \mathbb{R}^{2}}$ is an uncountably infinite set of random variables, as mentioned in the spatial data analysis summary notes in your above link . And as mentioned in the comment by Isabella Ghement , all these descriptions of quantities as random variables obviously only apply before you actually go out and make an observation. You probably want to take a Bayesian interpretation here, where the probability refers to your lack of knowledge about the location of Zinc deposits. With this interpretation, the distributions of all the random variables reflect some belief about finding a Zinc deposit at any point on the map. Once you actually actually go out and measure the amount of Zinc at any point, you have removed your uncertainty about whether there is or is not Zinc at that point.
