How should I design the tables to store tags in a database?

"question_id": 58640 "tags": ["polls", "fun", "quotes"] "title": "Great programming quotes" "question_id": 184618 "tags": ["polls", "fun", "comment"] "title": "What is the best comment in source code you have ever encountered?" "question_id": 3734102 "tags": ["c++", "linux", "exit-code"] "title": "Why cant' I return bigger values from main function ?"

To make this query-able, I want to use SQLite to store the data. How should I store the tags column? Since the limit here on SO is five tags, I can use five columns tag1, tag2 ..., but I think there would be something more elegant that can be done. Something that scales to any number of tags being there, and can also handle basic queries like select title from table where tag has "c++" and "boost" but not "c"
