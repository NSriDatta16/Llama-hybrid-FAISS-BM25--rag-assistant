$R^2$ is of limited use in nonlinear regression. We make it available in GraphPad Prism, but suggest it be used in only one way: Look at $R^2$ when you run a series of experiments, and you want to make sure that today's experiment is consistent with other runs of the experiment. For example, if you always get $R^2$ between 0.90 and 0.95 but today you got $R^2$ =0.75, then you should be suspicious and look carefully to see if something went wrong with the methods or reagents used in that particular experiment. And if a new employee brings you results showing $R^2$ of 0.99 using that same system, you should look carefully at how many "outliers" were removed, and whether some data were made up. More .
