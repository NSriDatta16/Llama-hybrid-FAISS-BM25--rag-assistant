I'm in charge of some applications that manage many TB of images. I think this application is similar in that it's storing files relatively large to typical database rows. We've found that storing file paths in the database to be best. There are a couple of issues: database storage is usually more expensive than file system storage. you can accelerate/distribute file system access with standard off the shelf products. things like web servers, etc, need no special coding or processing to access images in the file system.
