Try define a Matroid, which is what we do (logcally and not orally saying a Matroid), and it's still likely something like a C struct. Liskov principle (latest turing medalist) gets too abstract, too categorical, too theoretic, less treating actual data and more pure theoretical class-system, for handson pragmatic problemsolving, briefly glanced it which looked like PROLOG, code about code about code about code...while an algorithm describes sequences and travelsals we understand on paper or blackboard. Depends which goal you have, solving problem with minimal code or most abstract.
