I just got done with a Masters in Business Analytics and was faced with the same problem you are describing. Luckily I am a technical person and was able to teach myself R and Python, but I was stuck teaching the rest of the class how to use R and Python. The classes I had that used R/Python were handicapped by the lack of technical understanding by the students and so too much time was spent covering how to just open R/Python. The classes that went the other route were underwhelming and not very practical. I wanted to do for a class project something that ended up not being able to be done in Excel because of its limitations but the teacher wouldn't accept any other tools. It may not be something you can do right away but I would highly recommend that you try and get the department to require a programming course prior to taking your course. Data Science and Business Analytics IMHO should be cross discipline degree paths that require a good bit of Computer Science, but until the programs mature and the university system gets better it might not happen for a while.
