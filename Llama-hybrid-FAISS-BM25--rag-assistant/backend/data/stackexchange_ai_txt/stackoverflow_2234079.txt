First of all, (n-1)! means (n-1)(n-2)...(2)(1) . This is clearly not what you want here. If you count the actual number of iterations it's 0 + 1 + 2 + ... + (n-2) + (n-1) . Note that there are n terms in the sum, and that we can pair them off in a way such that the average value of each pair is (n-1)/2 . (Pair the highest and lowest, the second highest and second lowest, etc.) If n is odd, you'll have one left over that can't be paired, but conveniently its value is also (n-1)/2 . Thus you have n terms and the average of all terms is (n-1)/2 , so the total sum is n(n-1)/2 . Now, for big O notation it doesn't matter exactly how many iterations we have -- we just want to know the limit when n is very large. Note that our number of iterations can be written as (1/2)n^2 - (1/2)n . For very large n , the n^2 term is way, way bigger than the n term, so we drop the n term. That just leaves us with (1/2)n^2 , but another rule of big O notation is we don't care about the constant factor, so we just write that it's O(n^2).
