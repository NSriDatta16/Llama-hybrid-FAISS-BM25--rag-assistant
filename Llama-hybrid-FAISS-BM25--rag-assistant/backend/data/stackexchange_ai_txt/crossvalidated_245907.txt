Very interesting question. In my view, debugging / diagnosis on none-parametric model is very different from the classical literature in regression setting. People even not run diagnosis too much on these models other than focusing on testing set performance / cross validation. One example would be, in regression setting, we may check many things to make sure the assumptions are met. Such as residuals vs fitted, QQ plot etc. But, in an extreme case of none-parametric model, In neural network, people do not check these assumptions, but only care about the performance on testing set (under-fitting or over-fitting).
