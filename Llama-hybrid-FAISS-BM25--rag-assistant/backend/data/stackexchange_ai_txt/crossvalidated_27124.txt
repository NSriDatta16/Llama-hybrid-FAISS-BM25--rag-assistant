How to do logistic regression when one of the factors has unequal number of levels across the other factor?

I am analyzing an experiment that has the following design: Factor1 Factor2 Level1 Level1 Level2 Level2 Level1.1 Level1.2 Level2 In other words, Factor2 has different number of levels across Factor1. I'd like to use logistic regression, but how should I set it up? Is it legitimate to run two regressions ignoring one of the levels in each (e.g. Level1.1 or Level1.2)?
