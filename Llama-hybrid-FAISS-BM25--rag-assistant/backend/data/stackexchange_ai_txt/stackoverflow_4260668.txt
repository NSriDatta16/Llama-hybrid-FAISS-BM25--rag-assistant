Error while using interface as a type

I'm querying a table with a SQL query (table is decided dynamically). All the tables implement the ITableIsFile interface. Here is the problematic code. string sql = "Select * from " + file + " where userID = '" + currAgentTM.systemuserid.Value + "' and CallStatusID = null"; var records = appelsDataContext.ExecuteQuery (sql); On the last line, I get the following error: The type 'MRS_Admin.ITableIsFile' must declare a default (parameterless) constructer in order to be constructed during mapping. From what I know (and have tested), it is not possible to implement a constructor in an interface. Thank you for any help you can provide, it is much appreciated. Mathieu
