Willingness to pay, WTP, for decision tree

So I have this ice cream x1 and this ice cream x2 , I asked a bunch of people if they would buy ice cream x2 for this price p1 when the price of ice cream x1 is this other price A . If they wouldn't buy x2 for p1 they move to the right and get offered a lower price p3 , but still, the price of x1 is held constant at A , if they would buy this time the go to the left and get a price p6 for x2 where p3 this continue until they reach one end nod of the tree. So I have this buy-or-not data for a lot of people. At first glance I thought I could derive a simple logistic regression to get the willingness to pay, WTP, but this would not be the accurate way to do the analysis because the people would be split into two groups, left of p1 and right of p1 i.e those who would buy x2 for p1 and those who wouldn't buy x2 for p1 and those to the left will never be offered p3, p6, p7, p12, p13, p14, p15. So, what would be the right way to derive some kind of WTP of a decision tree like this? Can the data somehow be normalized so that a logistic regression can be used?
