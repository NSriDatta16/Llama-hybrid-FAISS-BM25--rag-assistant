Magento get a product collection in an arbitrary order

I have developed a custom search engine for our Magento store and I am trying to load the product collection in a very specific order (I have ranked the results according to an algorithm I designed). I can load the product collection correctly, however it is not in the order that I would like it to be in. Here is basically how it is working now: My database query basically comes back with a PHP array of product IDs. For this example lets say it looks like this: $entity_ids = array(140452, 38601 ); Now I can transpose the 140452 and the 38601 and the product collection comes back in the same order each time. I would like the product collection to be in the same order as the ID of the entity ids. The code I am using to create my collection is as follows: $products = Mage::getModel('catalog/product') ->getCollection() ->addAttributeToSelect('*') ->addAttributeToFilter('entity_id', array('in' => $entity_ids)) ->setPageSize($results_per_page) ->setCurPage($current_page) ->load(); Is there a way to set the sort order to be the order of the $entity_ids array?
