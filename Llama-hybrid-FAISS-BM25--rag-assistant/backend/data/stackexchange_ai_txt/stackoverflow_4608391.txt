First, make sure the sub-domain resolves to the same folder as the rest of Magento. So a file, "http://www.example.com/file" will appear exactly the same as "http://static.example.com/file". Then, in Magento's admin, go to System > Configuration > Web > Unsecure and change {{unsecure_base_url}} to your new sub domain (eg. "http://static.example.com/") for the Skin, Media and JavaScript options. Repeat for the "Secure" section too. Edit: I just remembered that for secure sub-domains you either need a wildcard certificate or an additional certificate for the sub-domain installed. It might be simpler to skip the "Secure" section because of this, most pages will not be served as secure so the inconvenience is minimal. Also I've had problems with the image upload for products when using sub-domains, you can get around this with No Flash Uploader .
