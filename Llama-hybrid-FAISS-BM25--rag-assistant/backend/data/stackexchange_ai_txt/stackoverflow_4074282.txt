Import button + File browse field in admin product grid in magento

I want to add an Import button and a file browse button next to the Add Product button in the product grid page in magento admin. When the user choose a file and clicks the Import button I'll upload the file to var/import, open a new tab and run the import profile. How can I add the form (import button + file browse field) to the top of the grid? Thanks
