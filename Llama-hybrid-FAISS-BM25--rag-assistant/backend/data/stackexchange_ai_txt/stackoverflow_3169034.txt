In AS3, object is dragged and when released it exhibits inertia

I'm trying to so the following in AS3. I have an object that I would like to behave as follows: When you click and drag with the mouse, it gets dragged along, constrained to the x axis (left and right only). When the mouse button is the released the object keeps going at that speed and direction, the slows to a stop. If the unpressed mouse is the moved, the object DOES NOT change direction to follow the mouse. The object does not respond to or in any way follow the unpressed mouse; all it does it come to a stop when the mouse is released, as described above. Seems like a simple thing but I've been looking for the answer for days. Some people have made suggestions but the don't behave the way I like. Thanks in advance!
