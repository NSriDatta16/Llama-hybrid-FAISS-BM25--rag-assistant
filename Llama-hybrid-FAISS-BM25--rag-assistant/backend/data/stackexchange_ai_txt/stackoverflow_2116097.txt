SELECT num FROM ( SELECT level AS num FROM dual CONNECT BY level The first subquery is a recursive query over the single-row pseudotable, dual . It selects the records recursively until the value of pseudocolumn level reaches 10 . level increases with each record. This is a common way to generate recordsets of arbitrary length out of nothing in Oracle . The second part just selects only those values of level (aliased as num to avoid usage of a reserved word) that are not already in your table. @Abdullah Dogan provided another method of doing this using MINUS operator. This does the same, but is more legible.
