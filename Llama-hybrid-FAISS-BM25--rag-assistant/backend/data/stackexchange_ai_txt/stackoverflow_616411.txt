(iPhone) How to handle touches on a UITextView?

I'm trying to handle touches on a iPhone's UITextView. I successfully managed to handle taps and other touch events by creating a subclass of UIImageViews for example and implementing the touchesBegan method...however that doesn't work with the UITextView apparently :( The UITextView has user interaction and multi touch enabled, just to be sure...no no joy. Anyone managed to handle this?
