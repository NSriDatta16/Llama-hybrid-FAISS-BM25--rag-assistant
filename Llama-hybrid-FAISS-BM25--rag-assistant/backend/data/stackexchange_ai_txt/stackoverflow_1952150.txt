Optimal method to process form params before DB storage?

I'd like to process the info in my form params before they enter the database, I just want to know what the optimal method is to do this. For example, for my users model, should I add a method to each expected param, for example: def first_name=(name) self.first_name = name.capitalize.strip end Or should I modify the form params in another way?
