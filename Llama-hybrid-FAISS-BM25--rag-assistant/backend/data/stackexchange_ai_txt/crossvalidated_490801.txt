Looking for an advice regarding finding the best time series model

I have weekly time series data, which looks like follows: The data seems to be non-stationary. Then I took the first difference of the data. Now the data seems to be more stationary. After that, I used the auto.arima function to first differenced data to find the best model. It was suggested a seasonal ARIMA model. Best model: ARIMA(0,0,0)(1,0,0)[52] with zero mean However, as you can see based on the time series plot for the first differenced data, there seems to be no seasonal trend in the data. So what should I do now ? Should I follow the results of auto.arima ? Or else, are there any alternative path that I can follow ? To check whether there is any seasonality in the first differenced data, I again took the seasonal difference of the first differenced data(differencing the first differenced data by taking lag=52). Following is the time series plot for the seasonal differenced data of the first differenced data. For me, there is no any significant difference between the time series plot of the first differenced data and the time series plot of the seasonal differenced data of the first differenced data. * Update This is the plot that I obtained using seasonplot function in foreacast package for first differenced data. There seems to be a slight peak around week 24-25. But I am not sure whether it is significant enough to go with a seasonal model. Also, I have updated the question by posting some results based on the original data(non differenced data). The auto.arima model also suggested a seasonal arima model for original data. Best model: ARIMA(0,1,0)(1,0,0)[52] This is the seasonplot plot for the original data. There is some peak around week 12-13. Will this results enough to go with a seasonal arima model? Any advice would be highly appreciated. Thank you.
