Deleting unused string literals won't have any effect on RAM usage because they aren't stored in RAM but in ROM. The same goes for code. What you need to do is cut back on actual variables and possibly the size of your stack/stacks. I'd look for arrays that can be resized and unused varaibles. Also, it's best to avoid dynamic allocation because of the danger of memory fragmentation . Aside from that, you'll want to make sure that constant data such as lookup tables are stored in ROM. This can usually be achieved with the const keyword.
