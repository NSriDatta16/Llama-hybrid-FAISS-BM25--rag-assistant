Looking through all the reflector code, nothing pops up as the "right" way. However, there might be a way if you are willing to do some post-generation processing. Using the RegionDirective, place a special token in the RegionText value. Then, once your code is generated, go back and do a string replace. Since I didn't see anything in the code that enforces matching code regions, you could have a single start code region at the end to enable warnings again. For example. your tokens could be "#PRAGMA1591" and "#ENABLEWARNINGS." Therefore, after the code is generated you would have #region #PRAGMA1591 ... #region #WARNINGRESTORE #endregion You would then do a string replace to yield this: #region Disable Warning 1591 #pragma warning disable 1591 ... #pragma warning restore #endregion Your strings expand like this: PRAGMA1591 -> Ignore Lack of XML Documentation \n #pragma warning disable 1591 region #WARNINGSRESTORE -> #pragma warning restore
