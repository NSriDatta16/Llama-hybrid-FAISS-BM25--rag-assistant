Take a look at RFC 2616, Part of the HTTP/1.1 Protocol: http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.9 You'll see lots of options to play with. Primarily intended for proxies, not Browsers. You can't really force the browser to totally stop Modified-Since-Requests. Especially older proxies might ignore your Cache-Control hints, see the mentioned paragraph on the aforementioned website: Note that HTTP/1.0 caches might not implement Cache-Control and might only implement Pragma: no-cache (see section 14.32). If you are really concerned about such short requests, take a look if HTTP-keepalive feature in your server is enabled (which has sideeffects on it's own, of course).
