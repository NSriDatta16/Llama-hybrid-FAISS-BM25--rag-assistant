There doesn't seem to be a lot of structure to take advantage of here. If you're asking if there is a way to arrange to arrange the table such that you can avoid storage for entries that can't happen (because they have a prime factor larger than N), you can't save much. There is a theory of smooth numbers which states that the density of N-smooth numbers near N^2 is ~2^-2. So, absolute best case, you can reduce the (maximum) storage requirement by at most a factor of 4. I think you're better off taking advantage of symmetry and then using a hash table if you expect most arguments to never occur.
