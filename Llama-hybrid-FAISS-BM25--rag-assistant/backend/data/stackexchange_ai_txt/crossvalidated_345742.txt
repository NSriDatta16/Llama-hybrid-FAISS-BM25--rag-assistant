How to interpret these results from poly() in binary logistic regression with GLM?

I am currently studying the effects of intercontact time in a customer's purchase journey related to his/her purchase probability, as well as the influence of the number of contacts. Based on extensive literature I expected an inverted U-shaped relationship between intercontact time and purchase probability, which is why I developed the following model: mylogit_poly Which results in: [ Now, based on feedback I received from my supervisor, I tried different levels of the polynomial term. When I got to the model below (with poly being 4), I suddely get all significant results. mylogit_poly4 [ My question now is what to make of this? Does this mean that the relationship can be considered fully non-linear? Can I infer something from this? PS: My full model exists of an additional 15 control variables that I left out for the sake of complexity. The output shown above comes from the full model.
