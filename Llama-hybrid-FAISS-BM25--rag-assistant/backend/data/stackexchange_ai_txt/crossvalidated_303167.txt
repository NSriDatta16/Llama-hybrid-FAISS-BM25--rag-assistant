How to calculate p-values for logistic regression coefficients?

First I am not a stat person so I don't know much about core details of p-values. I have the LR coefficient values for the features. I want to know the p values of those features. I know that I can calculate the odds value by simply calculating $e^{coeff}$. However I want to know how to calculate p values with lr coefficients. Also another thing I don't know much about it is the evaluation of p-values. Is it higher the better or vice-versa?
