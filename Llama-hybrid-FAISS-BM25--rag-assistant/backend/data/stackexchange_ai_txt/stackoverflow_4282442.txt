Depends on how complex the conversion process is. If it is easy enough to express in a single SQL statement, you're all set; just create the SELECT statement and then do the CREATE TABLE / INSERT statement. However, if you need to perform some complex transformation or (shudder) split or merge any of the rows to convert them properly, you should use a pipelined table function. It doesn't sound like that is the case, though; try to stick to the single statement as the other Chris suggested above. You definitely do not want to pull the data out of the database to do the transform as the transfer in and out of Oracle will always be slower than keeping it all in the database. A couple more tips: If the table already exists and you are doing an INSERT...SELECT statement, use the /*+ APPEND */ hint on the insert so that you are doing a bulk operation. Note that CREATE TABLE does this by default (as long as it's possible; you cannot perform bulk ops under certain conditions, e.g. if the new table is an index-organized table, has triggers, etc. If you are on 10.2 or later, you should also consider using the LOG ERRORS INTO clause to log rejected records to an error table. That way, you won't lose the whole operation if one record has an error you didn't expect.
