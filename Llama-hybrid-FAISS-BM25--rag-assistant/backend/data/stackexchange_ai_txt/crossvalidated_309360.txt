Applicability of using Back-Propagation Neural Network given continuous class labels

I am given a dataset where the class labels are continuous values between [-1,1] . Based on this, I have few questions: Can I use Back-Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) for this problem? Previously, I had a different dataset where the labels are binary classes but for this dataset I am not sure since it is now a regression problem. In case neural network can work with this dataset, what activation function should I use? Sigmoid , hyperbolic tan function ( tanh ), or rectified linear unit ( relu )? Thank you.
