How to test an interaction effect with a non-parametric test (e.g. a permutation test)?

I have two categorical / nominal variables. Each of them can take only two distinct values (so, I have 4 combinations in total). Each combination of values comes with a set of numerical values. So, I have 4 sets of numbers. To make it more concrete, let us say that I have male / female and young / old as the nominal variables and I have weight as the dependent numerical "output". I know that transition from male to female does change the average weight and these changes are statistically significant. So, I can calculate a gender factor. The same is applicable to the age variable. I do know that transition from young to old does change the average weight and I can calculate the corresponding age factor. Now, what I really want to see if the data proves that transition from young-females to old-males is more that combination of gender- and age-factors. In other words, I want to know if data prove that there are "2D effects" or, in other words, that age- and gender-effects are not independent. For example, it might be that becoming old for males increase the weight by factor 1.3 and for female the corresponding factor is 1.1. Of course I can calculate the two mentioned factors (age factor for males and age factor for females) and they are different. But I want to calculate the statistical significance of this difference. How real is this difference. I would like to do a non-parametric test, if possible. Is it possible to do what I want to do by mixing the four sets, shuffling them, re-splitting and calculating something.
