At first glance, you need to extract features from your time series (x - 12) - x.

But data, extracted from curve shape may be quite useful. I recommend you to look through this article, where authors propose algorithm for time series clustering. Hope, it will be useful. Additionally to such clustering you can add summary statistics to your feature list.
