The question is related to stochastic process and the Markov chains

This is the complete question. Jim is currently living in Scranton. Each year that he lives in Scranton, he has a probability of 1/2 of staying in Scranton the next year. Otherwise, he has an equally likely chance of moving to Chicago, Philadelphia, New York, or Seattle, the next year. On any given year that he lives in Philadelphia, he has a 1/4 probability of moving to Seattle, a probability of 3/8 of moving to Scranton and a probability of 3/8 of moving to Chicago the next year. On any year that he lives in Chicago, he has a probability of 1/2 of moving to New York, a probability of 3/8 of moving to Scranton and a probability of 1/8 of moving to Philadelphia the next year. In answering the questions below, assume Jim will be living in one of the 5 cities forever. Also assume, for parts (a)-(e) that if Jim moves to Seattle or New York, he will stay there and will not relocate again. Is this a valid Markov chain? Create the transition graph and matrix. What is the probability that Jim eventually will leave the non-Coastal cities (i.e., Scranton, Chicago, Philadelphia) permanently? What is the probability that Jim will eventually relocate permanently to New York? What is the expected number of years until Jim leaves Scranton permanently? Jimâ€™s friend Karen also started out like Jim but in Chicago. She also eventually relocated to New York or Seattle. What is the expected number of years she lived in Scranton? for the first five parts i could only be able to obtained the probability transition matrix and i will inculed it here. Also for the part 2 it is asking eventual probabilities which means i have to calculate the limiting probabilities. Is that right? for the part 4 and 5 do we need to consider the matrix as transient? if anyone can help with these questions i will be very thank full.
