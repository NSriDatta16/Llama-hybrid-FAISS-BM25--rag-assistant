Jquery modal dialog on all hyperlink clicks in a page

In my project, I have a page where I need to show a modal dialog on the click of all the hyperlinks. The popup has two buttons Images "Continue" and "GoBack". I wrote some jquery which I found on this Stackoverflow website. But there is a problem with code. Suppose I have 5 hyperlinks in this page. When I click on the first link its opening the dialog and when I click on continue its opening the link properly. But when I click on the second link its opening again the first link and the second link two separate windows, Which is wrong it supposed to open only second link. When I click on the third link again its opening first,second and third links in 3 windows. I guess I am doing a small mistake in my code. If anyone help me fixing this I really appreciate. Thanks for your help in advance. Here is my jquery code: $(document).ready(function() { // $(".leaving-the-site-container").hide(); $(".linkdialog").click(function(e){ e.preventDefault(); var targetUrl = $(this).attr("href"); alert(targetUrl); $(".leaving-the-site-container").dialog({ width:452, // autoOpen:false, // height:225, modal:true, closeOnEscape:false, draggable:false, scrollbars:false, position: ["center", 240] }); $("#btnContinue").click(function(){ window.open(targetUrl); $(".leaving-the-site-container").dialog("close"); }); $("#btnTakeMeBack").click(function(){ $(".leaving-the-site-container").dialog("close"); }); }); });
