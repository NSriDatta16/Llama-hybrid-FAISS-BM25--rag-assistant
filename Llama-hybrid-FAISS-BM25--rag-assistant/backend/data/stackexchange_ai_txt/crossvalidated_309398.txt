Does the unbalance of the pos and neg samples lead to the low variance of the neural network's outputs?

I train a neural network and the batch size is 1000. I check the outputs from my model every time it fed with 1000 sample, and I find that the outputs, which shall be the predictions for the binary classification task. What confused me is that the the outputs in every batch has very low variance, the max prediction score is 0.25 and the min is above 0.1. There are 25% positive samples in my dataset whose labels are 1. So I want to know why the variance is so low. It seems that the model has no ability in the classification task, after several epochs training.
