"Successful projects share the same 5 keys qualities. In each quality our project achieves over average score". What can we conclude about this?

I'm not sure if this is a statistical problem, but I suppose it's a frequent problem involving using statistics, so I ask here anyway. Hope it's on-topic. From the book Smart Pricing: How Google, Priceline, and Leading Businesses Use Pricing Innovation for Profitability : Although music is a very risky business, we found that Radiohead’s In Rainbows campaign shares the same five key qualities as any successful “pay as you wish” pricing program: A product with a low marginal cost A fair-minded customer A product that can be sold credibly at a wide range of prices A strong relationship between buyer and seller A very competitive marketplace In each quality, we assess our project has a higher than average score like this: Quality no. Score (over 10) 1 6 2 7 3 8 4 7 5 7 There is no measurement on each quality. We just reason with what we have and rate our confidence. Basically we just "feel the number". What can we conclude from this? What techniques we can do to confirm or deny any assumption we have? And if we think "our project is more likely to success than fail", do we have any fallacy?
