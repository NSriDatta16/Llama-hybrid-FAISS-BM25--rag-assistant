Does Max break the linearity between the dependent and independent variables needed for logistic regression?

I want to use logistic regression to learn the coefficients of a function looks like that (a - the variables and w - the coefficients): y = max(a1 w1 , a2 w2) + max(max(a3 w3 , a4 w4) , max(a5 b5 , a6 b6)) + max(a7 w7 , a8 w8) + … however I’m not sure if the max function breaks the linearity between the dependent variable and the independent variables needed for logistic regression? If so, what is the alternative to lean the coefficients if my labels (y) are binary or ordinal?
