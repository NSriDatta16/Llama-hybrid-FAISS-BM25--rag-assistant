Looks good so far besides the points Jon mentioned, remember you can always look at the real Tuple implementation using Reflector to gain more insight. You implemented all operators and structural equality, good. I noticed that your factory method: public static My_tuple Create (T1 first, T2 second) { return new My_tuple (first, second); } should be put on a separate, static class (e.g. Tuple) so consumers of the tuple can leverage the C# compilers type inference to create tuples without explicitly specifying the generic type arguments.
