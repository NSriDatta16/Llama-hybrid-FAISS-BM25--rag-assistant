Seasonal adjustment: Transfer of historical model to forecast values

I have a monthly time series provided by an external source, which contains both historical values and forecasts. I'd like to seasonally adjust the time series using X-13ARIMA-SEATS in R (package "seasonal"). The data provider has recommended that I only use historical data as input. My question is: How do I best go about transferring the results of the seasonal adjustment based on historical values to forecast values? Is this only possible if I (contrary to the advice given to me) include the forecast values right from the beginning?
