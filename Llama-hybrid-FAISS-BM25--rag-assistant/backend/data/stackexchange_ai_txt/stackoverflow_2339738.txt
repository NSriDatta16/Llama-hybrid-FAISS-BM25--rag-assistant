It's a simple typo: e1: echo The Program Will Exit When Operations are Completed.... should be: :e1 echo The Program Will Exit When Operations are Completed.... Same for e2: , should be :e2 . Pay attention to the error messages... Edit: About your comment, check: :somewhere set /P d=Include Hidden and System Files?[y/n]? if /I "%d%" EQU "Y" goto :d1 if /I "%d%" EQU "y" goto :d1 if /I "%d%" EQU "Yes" goto :d1 if /I "%d% EQU "yes" goto :d1 The last line is missing a " after "%d . It's very easy to debug things like this. Just change echo off to echo on at the beginning and you'll see which was the last executed line and the error message.
