setting log-uniform priors in Stan

I have been using Stan for a couple months now and I want to adopt a log-uniform prior on some parameter array real theta[N] . I want to do something like a sampling statement, i.e. ... theta ~ log_uniform(0.001,10.); but based on the user manual (Chapter 5 onwards), Stan doesn't seem to support a log-uniform distribution in this manner. I thought about instead setting a uniform prior on log_theta, i.e. ... log_theta ~ uniform(-3.,1.); then somehow doing theta but I'm still a novice regarding the Stan syntax. Is there an (even more) elegant workaround for this?
