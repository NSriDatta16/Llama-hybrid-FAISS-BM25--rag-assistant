I'm not sure about what you call "test sample" but it depends on the kaggle. Either you have only one data sample and you have to separate the sample in 3 ways (if enough data): train sample (to learn your model), validation sample (to tune hyperparameters) and test sample (to achieve final evaluation for metric chosen). Or you have a train sample and a test sample, basically you use your train sample for train+validation split and use the test sample to be the final evaluation. There is always a bit of misunderstood about the difference between validation and test sample. It must be clear that the validation sample(s) are to tune hyperparameters for complex machine learning or chose the best model among different regression (reggresion 1 with x1 and x2, regression 2 with x1 only, etc.) for example. The test sample is not mandatory if data is not enough but always welcome to have for final assessment and ensure yourself that your model is really well generalized.
