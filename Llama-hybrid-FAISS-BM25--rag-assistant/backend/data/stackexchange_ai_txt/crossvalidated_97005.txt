Given the information, what is the probability that the mean number of drinks sold per week is between 700 and 720

The question . I'm kinda a bit confused on how to make use of the information to answer the questions. I think I need to use the Bayesian Method to answer this question but I'm not sure if I'm right. would the prior density of the mean be $\mathcal{N}(738,13.4^2)$? Then what do I do with the $\mathcal{N}(692,42.5^2)$ Given in the second half of the question? I'm really clueless in using the Bayesian method and would like some guidance in understanding this question.
