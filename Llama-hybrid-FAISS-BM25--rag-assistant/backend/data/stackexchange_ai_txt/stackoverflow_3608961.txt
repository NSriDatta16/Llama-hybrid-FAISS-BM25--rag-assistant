AppFabric is Microsoft's brand for its cloud computing products. It is split into two divisions: Azure AppFabric and Windows Server AppFabric. Azure AppFabric Azure AppFabric runs 'in the cloud' - it provides services that are accessed over the Internet, including a Service Bus and an Access Control service. Windows Server AppFabric Windows Server AppFabric runs 'on premise' i.e. inside an organisation's firewall as opposed to on the Internet. Windows Server AppFabric provides services for hosting and managing Workflow Foundation components, and also provides a memcached -like distributed cache. Microsoft support for Windows Server AppFabric ends 2nd April 2016. Microsoft's recommendation is for customers to move to Redis for Windows .
