on iPhone Reviews don't appear immediately and I've never seen any that constitute spam or contain offensive language so I assume they are moderated. Newer reviews are placed at the top, I don't know how the average is calculated. Reviews for the most recent version are shown by default but you can chose to read reviews for all versions.
