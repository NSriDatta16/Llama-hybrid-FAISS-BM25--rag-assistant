Do you want to do this programmatically? If not, then I'd do the following Use regular expression to insert a tab around the number so (8) becomes (\t8\t) Copy this to an Excel sheet. The tab would arrange the numbers in a separate column i.e. excel will look something like this. A B C foostring( 8 ) foostring1( 8 ) foostring2( 8 ) etc. Now change the values in column B. Just type 1 and 2 in the first 2 rows and drag down to fill the rset of rows. Copy back to netbeans editor and remove the tabs inserted in step 1.
