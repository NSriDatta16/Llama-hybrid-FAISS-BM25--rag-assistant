Besides using jQuery you also have to use jQuery UI http://jqueryui.com/demos/ . jQuery UI will provide all of the functionality for what you would need. More specifically you want the Draggable and Resizable plugins (perhaps the Droppable too depending of what you are trying to do). Then you will need to do the following to make it Draggable and Resizable: $(document).ready(function() { $(".elements").draggable().resizable(); });
