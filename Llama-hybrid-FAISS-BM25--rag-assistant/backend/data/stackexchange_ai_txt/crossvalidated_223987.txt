Simple random sampling - No natural strata

I have data from surveys given out to visitors to a branch of my organization. A random sampling of these visitors without regards to any strata was used to determine who gets the survey. Given that surveys were randomly sent without any considering of a natural strata, can I Use ordinary multivariate logistic regression to analyze the data or Should I force a strata on the data using some discriminating condition (there really isn't any strong condition that could be used for stratification) and analyze the data using survey-weighted logistic regression? I ask this question with the assumption that I cannot use methods for survey data analysis if my data used random sampling with no strata.
