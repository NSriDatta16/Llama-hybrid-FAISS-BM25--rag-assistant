Let me be the only one here defending 3rd order methods for SGD convergence, but definitely not in the entire space what would need $\approx dim^3/6$ coefficients, but e.g. in just a single direction, which needs only a single additional coefficient if already having 2nd order model in this direction. Why single direction 3rd order model can be beneficial? For example because close to zero second derivative in this direction basically means two alternative scenarios: plateau or inflection point - only the former requires larger step size, and 3rd derivative allows to distinguish them. I believe we will go toward hybrid multi-order methods: 2nd order method in a low dimensional subspace e.g. from PCA of recent gradients, what still allows for free 1st order simultaneous gradient descent toward part of gradient orthogonal to this subspace ... and additionally I would add e.g. 3rd order model for a single most relevant direction.
