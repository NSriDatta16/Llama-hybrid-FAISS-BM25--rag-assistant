Its always a guess when trying to answer questions like this, as there are a lot of unknowns. That being said, in programming, there are always more than a few ways to solve a problem. Examine your collision detection routine - if you worked with hitTestPoint , and the point that was being tested (mouseX,Y or your main actor) with localToGlobal , you likely wouldn't need to test for the x,y variables of your collision objects. Read up on those two subjects and this question might be rendered moot. At any rate, you could update relative coordinates in your Wall.as instance by leveraging globlaToLocal: public function get curLoc():Point { return globalToLocal(new Point(this.x, this.y)); } and retrieve them from your parent class as a point you can then test against: trace(_wall.curLoc); Hope that helps
