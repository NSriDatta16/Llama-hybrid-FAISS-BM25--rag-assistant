Assessing homogeneity of variances assumption for numeric variables

I'm fitting a model with a 2-level categorical and a numerical predictor. As far as I'm concerned, I cannot use car::LeveneTest() to assess homoscedasticity since I have a numerical predictor, right? What should I use instead to assess homoscedasticity on both numerical and categorical predictors? expected error: car::leveneTest(lmer(SCORE ~ EXAM_GRADE * TASK_TYPE + (1|ID), data = dfModels1, REML = F)) Error in leveneTest.default(lmer(SCORE ~ EXAM_GRADE * TASK_TYPE + (1 | : lmer(SCORE ~ EXAM_GRADE * TASK_TYPE + (1 | ID), data = dfModels1, REML = F) is not a numeric variable head(dfModels1): Each ID has a SCORE on two different TASKs . They also have a score on another Exam Grade . The basic idea is that Exam Grade predicts SCORE independenly of the task type. ID SCORE EXAM_GRADE TASK_TYPE 1 1_101 7.1 100 A 2 1_101 4.92 100 N 1 2_101 7.4 36 A 2 2_101 7 36 N Maybe the Breusch-Pagan test (such as performance::check_heteroscedasticity() does?) Obs: I'm aware that I should prefer visual inspection instead, I'm also doing that, but I'd like to find a way to assess the assumption numerically as well just in case .
