Right now, I'm using Auto Complete for Emacs. As a current Visual Studio and ex-Eclipse user, I can say that it rivals both applications quite well. It's still not as good as Microsoft's IntelliSense for C#, but some would say that C++ is notoriously difficult to parse. It leverages the power of (I believe) the Semantic package from Cedet , and I find it feels nicer to use when compared to Smart Complete . It completes C++ members, local variables, etc. It's pretty good. However, it falls down on not being able to complete overloaded methods (it only shows the function once with no parameters, but thats a limitation of Cedet I believe), and other various things. It may improve in future though! By the way, I could be wrong here, but I think you need an EDE project set up for the class member completion to work (just like you would normally with Semantic). I've only ever used it while having an EDE project, so I assume this is true.
