template static T ( *pfunction ) ( const Object *, const Object *); Template of function pointer is illegal in C++. Be it inside a class, or simply outside a class. You cannot write this (not even outside a class): template void (*PtrToFunction) (X); See this sample : http://www.ideone.com/smh73 The C++ Standard says in $14/1, A template defines a family of classes or functions . Please note that it does NOT say "A template defines a family of classes , functions or function pointers ". So what you're trying to do is, defining "a family of function pointers" using template, which isn't allowed. Generic Functors from Loki library would be an elegant solution to the kind of problem you're having. :-)
