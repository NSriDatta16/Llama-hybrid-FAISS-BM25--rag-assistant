Android 1.6 Mapview doesn't show traffic until user interacts with the map

I have a MapActivity. If it's set to an appropriate location and zoom level to see traffic none is shown after it's first created until you interact with the map (click on it, drag, etc) at which point traffic shows up. Naturally I want traffic to show up without any user interaction after it loads but I've been unable to figure out how to trigger it. Any ideas? From my MapActivity inherited class: private MapView mapView; @Override public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) { super.onCreate(savedInstanceState); setContentView(R.layout.map); mapView = (MapView) findViewById(R.id.mapview); mapView.setBuiltInZoomControls(true); mapView.setTraffic(true); } And here's whats in R.layout.map
