well, you can analyze format string and compose result string.Format call using Expression trees. Just for the test I've made POC implementation it based on Scott Hanselmann's parsing routine (removed custom format capabilities for the simplicity): source code . On my maching results comparing to HenryFormatter were the following: Instance of Student type : Name=John, Email=john@roffle.edu and birthdate=3/20/1 983 12:00:00 AM Instance of Student type : Name=John, Email=john@roffle.edu and birthdate=3/20/1 983 12:00:00 AM HenriFormat: Average run time for 500000 runs = 00:00:00.0000045 StructureToString: Average run time for 500000 runs = 00:00:00.0000003
