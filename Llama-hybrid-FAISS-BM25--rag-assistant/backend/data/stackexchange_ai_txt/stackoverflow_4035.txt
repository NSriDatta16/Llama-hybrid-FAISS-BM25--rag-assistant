I would go with the file system approach. As noted by a few others, most web servers are built to send images from a file path. You'll have much higher performance if you don't have to write or stream out BLOB fields from the database. Having filesystem storage for the images makes it easier to setup static pages when the content isn't changing or you want limit the load on the database.
