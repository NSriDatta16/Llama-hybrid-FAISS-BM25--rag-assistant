Embedding Google Waves in Blogs and Search Engines

After watching the cool Google Wave Developer Preview at Google I/O 2009 I started wondering that it would be cool to integrate Google Wave with my blog . I'd like to replace the built-in Blogger comments with comments based on Google Wave. But my impression is that it's all JavaScript-based. This makes me wonder whether Google bots (or bots from any other search engine) would be able to read any content embedded in a blog this way? If there is no such feature then embedding Google Wave inside a blog/site/portal is a total mix-up. Does anyone knows anything more in this topic? I'll appreciate any comments. :)
