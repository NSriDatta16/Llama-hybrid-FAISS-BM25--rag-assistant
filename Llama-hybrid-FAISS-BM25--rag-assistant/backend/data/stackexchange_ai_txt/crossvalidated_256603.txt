Question about pseudo-replication

I would like to examine the inter-individual variation in foraging duration by a small seabird species (a storm petrel). I sampled small petrels in their burrows on a small island, and using telemetry devices I have quantified the time that birds spent away from the colony on foraging trips. However due to sampling and logistical constraints, I sometimes had to put devices on both individuals of a breeding pair in the same burrow (i.e. both the male and female of a pair were tagged), whereas in other burrows only 1 bird was tagged. However, including both birds from a single burrow in the overall analysis would be pseudo-replication, as the foraging duration of one bird in a burrow could be influenced by that of the other bird. So to avoid this, I was going to exclude the second bird tagged from those burrows with two tagged birds. However, someone suggested that I take an average of foraging duration from the two birds, and that this averaging would avoid pseudo-replication. I have looked to the literature and books to see if this is a valid approach but I could not find a clear answer. Can anyone comment on this? Thank you. RAM
