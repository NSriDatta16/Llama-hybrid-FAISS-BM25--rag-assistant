Time Series Forecasting with Neural Network (mixed data types)

I have a dataset with the following format: TimeStamp | Action | UserId 2015-02-05 | Action1 | XXX 2015-02-06 | Action2 | YYY 2015-02-07 | Action2 | XXX ... I try to forecast future Actions for specific users based on the Users history in the dataset. I started with ntstool in MATLAB, but it can't handle mixed data types or non-numerical values. Now I am looking for other methods to predict future Actions and find periodic patterns in the records. Is it possible to convert the values for Actions to numeric values or is there a possibility to create a neural network with mixed datatypes on the input? Maybe in R?
