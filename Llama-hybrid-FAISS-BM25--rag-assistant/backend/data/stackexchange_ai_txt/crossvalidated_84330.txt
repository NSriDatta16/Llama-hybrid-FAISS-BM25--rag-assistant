Errors in optim when fitting arima model in R

I'm using the arima method of stats package of R with my time series of 17376 elements. My goal is to get the value of the AIC criterion, I 've observed in my first test this: ts ts$coef ar1 ar2 ma1 sar1 sar2 sma1 0.8883730 -0.0906352 -0.9697230 1.2047580 -0.2154847 -0.7744656 > ts$aic [1] NA As you can see, AIC is not defined. About AIC, "Help" in R said that it could only be used with "ML". However, it happens: > ts I don't understand what is happening. Also I would like to know more about the parameter "fitting method".
