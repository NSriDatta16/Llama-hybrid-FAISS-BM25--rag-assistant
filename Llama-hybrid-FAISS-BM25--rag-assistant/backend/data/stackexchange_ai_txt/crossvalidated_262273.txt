The average is a (simple) model, and the purpose of models is to simplify reality such that we can understand it. There is always a trade-off there: if you don't simplify enough you loose the big picture, if you simplify too much you miss important findings. How "safe" a model is, depends on the circumstances: how complex is the phenomenon you are describing, how bad is an error (e.g. is your work being used to run a nuclear power plant...), etc. etc. So no single answer to your question exists.
