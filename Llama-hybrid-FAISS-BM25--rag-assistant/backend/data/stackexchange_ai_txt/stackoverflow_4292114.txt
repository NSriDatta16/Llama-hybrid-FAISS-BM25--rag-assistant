I dont think firefox would be having a C++ aPI to find the open tabs.... If you want to find out open tabs or whenever a new tab is open , you can basically hook the firefox window and get all events happening on that window to your hook procedure. If you open spy++ in VC++ and track firefox window , you can see a new MozillaContentWindowClass gets created every time whenever a new tab is opened. So you can basically iterate through window handles and get information about open tabs. You can use SetWindowLongPtr to set the subclass procedure for that window.
