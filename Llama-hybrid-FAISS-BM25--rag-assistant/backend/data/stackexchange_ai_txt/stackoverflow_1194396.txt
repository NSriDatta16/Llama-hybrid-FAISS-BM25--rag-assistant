Variable cost subscription payment provider UK

I am looking for a payment provider that uses an API and supports variable cost subscriptions that I can integrate into my Rails application. We are currently using the Active Merchant plugin for Rails and PayPal as our provider but their recurring billing procedure is apparently flaky. I'm thinking that there may be a provider of some kind of credit card storage facility (so we don't have to handle that ourselves) that we can call upon and therefore bill on a recurring basis (like monthly). Does anyone have any experience with any UK providers? Update: Mr. Matt asked where we found PayPal to be a bit flaky. Specifically: 1) As we understand it, PayPal can only handle fixed payments of X pounds each month, so we can't bill say £30 on one month, then £35 on another. (Our product has a flat-rate plus commission.) 2) As we understand it, PayPal expects a fixed term of X months. We would like to offer the ability for a customer to come and go with a minimum of 1 month subscription. 3) Also, PayPal does not handle partial refunds. If a customer gets half way through their fifth month with us and chooses to terminate their account, we cannot refund the remainder of the month.
