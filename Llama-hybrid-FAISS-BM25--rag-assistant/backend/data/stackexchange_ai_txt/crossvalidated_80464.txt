I assume that the answer and the example provided by @Flounderer imply this, but I think it worth spelling this out. Principal component analysis (PCA) is label (classification) indifferent. All it does is to transform some high dimensional data to another dimensional space. It might help in classification attempts by, for example, creating data set that is easier separable by a particular method. However, this is only a by-product (or a side effect) of PCA.
