Since answers change between different questions, your problem does not fit 'regular' classification problems. And due to textual nature of your input/output, regression is not the best fit either. This leaves me thinking K-NN is a good way utilizing supervised learning. I don't have any good reference for this but this approach makes sense to me: 1) Embed both questions and answers into same space(using TF/IDF and PCA for example). 2) For a new(unseen) question find near neighboring labeled questions(from the training set), using K-NN. 3) Get neighboring questions answers. 4) Use K-NN(Or other distance based method) to find nearest neighbor in unseen question answer choices.
