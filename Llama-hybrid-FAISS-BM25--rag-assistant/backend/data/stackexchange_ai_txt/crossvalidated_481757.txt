Train and test your model using Cross-Validation. If you overfit your Cross-validation error will be a lot higher than your training error. That is, split your data in say 5 random folds. Fit your model to 4 of the folds and use the last one to test on, by calculating your prediction error. Do this 5 times using each fold as test fold once and average your prediction error. Then test each model (using only x, only x and x^2 and then using all three). If they overfit your prediction error will be higher.
