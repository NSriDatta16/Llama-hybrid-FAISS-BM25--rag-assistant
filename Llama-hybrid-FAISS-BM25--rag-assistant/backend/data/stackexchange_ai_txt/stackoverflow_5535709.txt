I would recommend Wget for this. It is a very powerful, scriptable commandline utility to grab a web page, a whole site, or any other combination. It supports a hosts of features to make sure you're getting the page you want (aka different Agent headers to pretend it's an IE, Firefox, Safari, Android or iPhone browser).
