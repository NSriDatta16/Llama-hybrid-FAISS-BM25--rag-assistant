Why do you need to install Access? Are you only using the Access database file to store data? If so is this in MDB or ACCDB format? If MDB format as created in Access 2003 and earlier then Jet 4.0, DAO 3.6 and ADO have been included as part of the operating system since Windows 2000. If ACCDB format then you will need to install the freely downloable ACE DLLs as per 2007 Office System Driver: Data Connectivity Components Now if you are actually using Access for forms and reports, and it's Access 2007 you can have your users install the Access 2007 runtime as per Access 2007 Download: Access Runtime Ahh, I see from your subject you specifically mention drivers. Ignore this paragraph then.
