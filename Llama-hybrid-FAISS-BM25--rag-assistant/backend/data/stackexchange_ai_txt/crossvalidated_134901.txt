What is the distribution family where one side is with light tail but the other side with heavy tail?

For example the distribution of weights of human. There are not many adults under 40 kg, but a lot more people heavier than 100 kg, although the average of an adult's weight is, let's say, 70 kg. Another example is this human reaction time , sharing the same tail property. I can image a "mixture" of normal distribution and Cauchy distribution, where the normal distribution dominates at the left side and the Cauchy distribution dominates at the right side, but is there already a family of such distributions with good properties, like, that we can easily calculate the mean, variance, entropy, etc?
