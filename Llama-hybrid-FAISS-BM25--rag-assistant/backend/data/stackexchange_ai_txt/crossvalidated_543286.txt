Is it normal to get very high odds ratios and confidence interval?

I am performing a logistic regression with different variables by R. The code used has been this one: glmer.1 However, when I look at the results I get high odds ratios and CI95%: Variable Categories Sample size OR CI95% Pvalue Adjusted OR CI95% Pvalue_adjust Age 40-49 328 REF 50-59 414 2.37 (1.138,4.938) 0.0212 4.134 (1.758,9.721) 0.0011 60-69 309 3.021 (1.422,6.417) 0.004 5.956 (2.314,15.334) =80 52 29.864 (4.517,197.46) As you can see in the variable Age >=80 the OR is 51.403 with a CI between (2.43 - 1087.237). I don't know if this is due to the sample size. I have a total sample size of 764 and a much smaller sample size per category. Is there a sample size limit for each category so that the test has more power?
