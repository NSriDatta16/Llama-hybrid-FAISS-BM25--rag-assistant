Its fine to provide convenience methods, the real problem is if each entry point begins to do behave in subtly different ways. Thats when the api isn't convenient anymore. Its just a pain to remember which way is "right," and documentation starts saying "the recommended way is..." If Date.yearMonthDay() began to validate the date while Date.ymd() didn't, that'd be a problem. The same goes for if each begins supporting different "features" - Date.yearMonthDay() could take non-gregorian dates, and Date.date() could take a non-gregorian dates so long as a 4th object is given that tells the calendar type.
