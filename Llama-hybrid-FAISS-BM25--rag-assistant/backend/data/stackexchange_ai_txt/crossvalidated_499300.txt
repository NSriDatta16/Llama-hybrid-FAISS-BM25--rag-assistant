I hope this question does not get closed as " opinion based " because, even if it is, I think it's quite relevant. There are, in my opinion , several issues to consider. First, the question of statistical " significance ". It is commonly (mis)used as a decision making tool, at least in the field where I work (medicine), although it is completely unsuitable for that purpose. One might hope that the inflation of " significant " results in big data settings would lead researchers to revise their views of the meaning of " significance " and lead them to find better decision making tools, e.g. cost/benefit calculations. On the other hand, big data allows us to test a large number of hypotheses on a same dataset. In "classical" statistics, with "small" data, the necessary corrections of the significance level (Bonferroni etc.) quickly lead to situations where we miss an actually existing effect. In this case, big data could actually support classical statistical methods. Another point worth considering is the importance of probabilistic models. All statistical methods are based on some assumptions regarding the (unobservable!) models underlying the observed data. These models are at least as much guided by our ability to do mathematics, as by our domain knowledge about the data. In fact, in my experience, we mostly choose the model based on our familiarity with it, or availability of the software, and not on deliberations of how data came into being. Big data might allow us to do model-free (or model-poor) data analysis and get practically more useful and perhaps even more accurate results. So, in this regard, I would tend to support your thesis. Altogether, I thinks there are pros and cons for your thesis. Big data and machine learning methods will likely supplement, but not completely replace classical statistics. Computers and their numerical capabilities haven't made analysis obsolete, and photography didn't make painting disappear.
