Android components-based application design: How should I represent this model?

I would like to re-design my application into components, so it is more modular and easier to re-use in the future, but I've never really designed applications, so I don't really know how I should do this. Here is a brief description of the application: The purpose of the Application is to allow the User to create "Events" that are going to be stored locally on the Device and sent over the network. The User can interact with the application through 2 Activities: A "NewEventActivity" that allows him to create the new Events and a "LogbookActivity" that allows him to browse previously created Events. The local storage should be handled by a SQLite Database The Event should be sent in a specific Binary format. Other applications should be able to Use the Sending component to Format and send other type of messages in the same format. This drawing represents how I was thinking of organizing the components. Boxes represent components, and arrows represent interactions without those components. Here are my questions: Does this model look OK? Can you see something that could be improved? Should my SQLiteHelper be a ContentProvider or a ContentResolver? Should I create one BroadcastReceiver class per type of Signal, or should I create one big BroadcastReceiver that handles all the kind of Signals my application can handle? Thank you!
