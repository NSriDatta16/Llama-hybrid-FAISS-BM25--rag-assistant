I have used your data files transfer.sh/xuf6M/HR.csv transfer.sh/kW6lb/Steps.csv and in order to match the different time stamps I took averages over 3 minute intervals. This can be turned into the following graphs: You could say then: No activity: HR of 80 or lower only occur below 5 steps per minute Low activity: HR of 80-100 do not occur much in activities with above 20 steps per minute Medium activity: HR of 100-140 occur in activities with above 20 steps per minute High activity or anomalies: HR above 140 seem to not occur in activities with above 20 steps. These might be other activities than walking that are harder than walking (e.g. running, cycling) So in this way you calibrate heart rates according to stepsizes. And you should not consider the heart rates above > 150 as inactive just because you did not measure steps during that period. Logically you should have $$HR_{\text{no activity}} In your case using confidence intervals seems not right to me. You could mathematically express something like the average heart rate for a certain activity and express something like a confidence interval for it, but the question is whether it makes sense (aside from your question about the proper categorization of activity and it's influence on the confidence intervals). (1) The heart rates do not follow an ordinary distribution for which you can express the confidence intervals of the mean/average (e.g. using a t-distribution for the mean when the data is Gaussian distributed) (2) The average/mean heart rate may not be the relevant parameter. Possibly plots like below may help you as well: Here the points are connected and the lines are a path in time (succeeding points in time are connected). So you can see that the high >140 heart-rates are due to the day 1 and day 2. You can also see that these points are in a loop with some walking or running, so it seems that there has been some mixture of walking and other activities.
