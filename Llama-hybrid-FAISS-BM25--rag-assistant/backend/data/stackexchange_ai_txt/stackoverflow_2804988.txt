MySQL get row closest to NOW()

I have a table with User data such as name, address etc and another table which has a paragraph of text about the user. The reason that they are separate is because we need to record all the old about data. So if the user changes their paragraph - the old one should still be stored. Each bit of about data has a primary key aboutMeID. What I want to do is have a join that pulls their name, address etc and the latest bit of aboutMe data from the other table. I am not sure though how I can order the join to only get the latest about me data. Can someone help?
