When I learned Ruby and Rails I started with Pragmatic Programmers' Agile Web Development with Ruby on Rails (1st edition) and worked my way back into Ruby from there. If I had it to do over I would have picked up Programming Ruby (also from Pragmatic Programmers) at the same time--as it was I picked up bits and pieces of Ruby as I went, and didn't really sit down and learn Ruby for about a year, even though I was creating Rails apps for production. These days I think Michael Hartl's Rails Tutorial site, already mentioned, is the best way to go. In addition, Mr. Neighborly's Humble Little Ruby Book is an overlooked but good introduction to the Ruby language. It's available as a free PDF.
