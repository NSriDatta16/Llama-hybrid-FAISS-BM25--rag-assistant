I think you're out of luck. I ran into the same issue (lots of people have) and the consensus seems to be that you should use DTO's (Data Transfer Objects). AutoMapper makes it a little easier. You might save yourself the hassle of converting from Entities to DTO's if you use NH's result transformers to return your results as DTO's. We ended up creating a couple different DTO's per entity, each one containing different children or collections, e.g. Customer, CustomerWithOrders, etc. The client that needs a DTO has to know what it needs ahead of time so it can request the right kind. Maintaining it hasn't been too bad though, since our entities don't change much.
