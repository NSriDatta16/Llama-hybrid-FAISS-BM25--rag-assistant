How to offer a screenshot of a Google Maps instance?

I would like to implement a map simmilar to this: http://gmaps-utility-library.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/markerclusterer/1.0/examples/advanced_example.html One of the desired features is ability to save a screenshot of the visible fragment of the map , along with the markers. Do you have some ideas how can I implement such a feature? I know that I may use this: http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/staticmaps/#Paths , but it seems that Static Maps API is limited to images up to 640x640
