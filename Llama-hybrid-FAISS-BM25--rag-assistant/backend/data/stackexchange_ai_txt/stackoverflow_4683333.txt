IMO, you should consider other criteria as well such as: Cost of the software Integration with your .NET applications API and Programmatic flexibility (All said and done, there are always the "customizations" and tailoring. For such scenarios , developers eventually fall back on programmatic solutions vs. out of box Now, in my experience (having used both Crystal Reports and SSRS(2005/2008) , though Crystal Reports does come with a friendly set of API, it fails in many basic criteria and developers end fighting the software. This is I say based on my experience with SSRS where developers are far more comfortable with. For starters, it uses XML extensively and the provision to use custom code assemblies does not harm either. --I think you would where I am getting at--- "Consider & Evaluate SSRS*. If you are hesitant at first, then do a Proof of Concept and test your requirements. I have a feeling you will be pleased with what you see especially considering your requirement of using PDF format. Developers, especially , MSFT specialists will thank you Leverage the Programmatic rendering of the reports (though it sounds fancy , trust me , its not more than handling an API call For e.g.: public Byte[] Render ( string Report, string Format , string HistoryID, string DeviceInfo, [Namespace].ParameterValue[] Parameters, [Namespace].DataSourceCredentials[] Credentials, string ShowHideToggle, out string Encoding, out string MimeType, out [Namespace].ParameterValue[] ParametersUsed, out [Namespace].Warning[] Warnings out string[] StreamIds); Member of [Namespace].ReportingService ) --- where Format will be "PDF" Hope you find this relevant
