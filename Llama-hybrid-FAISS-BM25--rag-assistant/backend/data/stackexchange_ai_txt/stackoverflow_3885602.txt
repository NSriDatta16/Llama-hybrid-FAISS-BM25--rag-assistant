(Elaboration for Milo) You've got mutually inclusive or cyclic includes and you need to break these cycles or you will never get the code to compile. I can see from AguiWidgetBase.h that it refers to AguiColor from AguiBaseTypes.h, but both headers try to include Agui.h, and Agui.h itself tries to include both of the others. You should re-organise the headers so that they only #include the ones they want. You should have a hierarchical system so: AguiWidgetBase.h should include: AguiBaseTypes.h AguiBaseTypes.h should include: Agui.h can include anything you like and can be included by your application modules. Also, you should refer to Pragma_once for more information about #pragma once and include guards.
