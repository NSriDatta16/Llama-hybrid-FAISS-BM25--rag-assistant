regression model using random forest when there are some correlations among observations

I am building a model to predict the remaining life of a patient. My data has 20 features and it is in the format of a life table where each observation represents a patient $j$ on time $t$ time until the time he died. So, for each patient, I have a group of observations correlated between them. The random forest model I built is doing a good job on training and also on test set, however, it concerns me a little bit those correlations. It would me concerns a lot if I was modeling by a GLM, however, I am not quite sure if it would be a problem by random forest.
