I personally don't like the UI that IE shows when a Silverlight application throws an unhandled exception. It has a very small window that shows the exception text but the options present certainly aren't user friendly. I guess this is a matter of opinion, but my preference is to catch any exceptions during initialization and try to present the user with a meaningful description of what happened. Typically I store some settings in isolated storage, so one helpful message might describe how to clear the iso store for my app to eliminate some sort of configuration problem. As long as you can provide the user with some meaningful steps to fix the problem, or at least who to contact if they can't, I'd say it's better not to throw exceptions during initialization that would cause the app to fail to load.
