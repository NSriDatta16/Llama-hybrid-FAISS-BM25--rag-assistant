Late answer I know, but incase anyone else comes upon this, I'll post this anyway. You also have the option of storing the points in an array at every touchesBegan and touchesMoved call. As in here: [currentStroke addObject:[NSValue valueWithCGPoint:point]]; And when touchesEnded, you can move this to another mutable array, such as: [allPoints addObject:allCurrentStroke]; Then, you can iterate through allPoints array, passing each subarray to the rendering function. This method has advantages and disadvantages over the method of storing images. First, it saves on hard drive space... however at a cost of memory. Using GL_POINTS, as you are, you will notice it will take time to redraw your image after you hit undo... however you can undo all the way to the first touch easily! So, it depends if you want speed or flexibility... If anyone has a better method to undo, please let me know!
