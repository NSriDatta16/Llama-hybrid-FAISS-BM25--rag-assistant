Okay, you're not going to believe this. I just tried removing the following line: window.location.href = url.toString(); And it reduced the average runtime to two third of a millisecond. I know from profiling the toString call is very fast, so apparently setting the window.location.href is ultra slow (couple of hundred ms!!!). Bah, I hate IE. Note: This is a clean install of Internet Explorer, and I have no crazy toolbars slowing down my browser.
