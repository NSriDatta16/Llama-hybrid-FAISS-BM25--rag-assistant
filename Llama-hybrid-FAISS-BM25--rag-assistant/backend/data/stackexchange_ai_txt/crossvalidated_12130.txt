If I understand your question, you can pass the -b flag with option 1 when building the model like this: ../svm-train -b 1 data_file And then when creating the prediction vector, you do the same: ../svm-precict -b 1 test_file data_file.model output_file Here is an output_file example that has 3 classes: labels 0 -1 1 0 0.635655 0.18753 0.176816
