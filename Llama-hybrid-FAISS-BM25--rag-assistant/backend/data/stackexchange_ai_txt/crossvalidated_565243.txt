Understanding constrained RDA's formula?

So, I am having issues understanding the ordination with constrained RDA. I designed four experiments which should be useful to understand what is happening with RDA but I am missing something here. # load libraries library("phyloseq") library("vegan") library("RColorBrewer") # optional close all open plots # graphics.off() # load data data("GlobalPatterns") globp $SampleType)), "Set1") names(pltt) SampleType) # perform ordination using all the information filtered_rda_one Example one, two and four are providing, in my non-expert opinion, the same results (even though example two's result is weird). To summarise: in example one I am using all the available variables; in example two I am only using SampleType; in example four SampleType was set as NULL; finally, in example three, I blocked for SampleType. In sample three I was expecting to see some differences and that happened, since I am blocking for SampleType. What I am not getting is what is going on with the other examples: if the formulas are different how come the results, at least for examples one and four, are exactly the same? It is possible that SampleType does not explain any variance in the data since having or not having it didn't change the results. But then what happens in example two which, I think, is comparable to one and four? In this case SampleType is somehow influencing the ordination, right?
