Application of spike and slab for sampling from posterior distribution (bernoulli and beta)

I think the gamma N term in the first equation relates to the spike and prior. However, I am unsure what the rhs of the first is used for? Further, I am unsure what the pie term of the second equation refers to and why it is modelled using a Beta distribution? Note, this is using mcmc sampling.
