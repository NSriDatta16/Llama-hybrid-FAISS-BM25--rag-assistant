Data scientist light?

Im a 26 year old guy with an MBA and I work as an ERP system administrator. I have been interested in the field of data science for a while now. I've always liked statistics and various analytical tasks. I would really like to try and work within this field, but it feels a bit overwhelming. People mention that you have to learn Python, R, SQL, Machine Learning, advanced algebra, data modeling, big data (hadoop etc), predictive analytics, various business intelligence tools, VBA, Matlab etc etc. As of today, I have some SQL knowledge and have a general understanding of BI, big data, good excel skills etc. I am willing to learn some of the aforementioned areas, but I don't have the money or time to go back to full time university studies again. So here is my question: is there any recognized "light version" of data scientist on the market? What are they usually called? What skills do they need to master? What should I learn in order to work with big data sets and analytics without having to study full time for another 5 years? I live in Scandinavia so the job market is probably different here, but I thought it would be interesting to hear some answers.
