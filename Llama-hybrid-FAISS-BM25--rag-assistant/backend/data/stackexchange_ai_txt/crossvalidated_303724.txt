They both use Bayes' rule. That's it though. Some differences: a HMM is a time series model, while Naive Baye's isn't a HMM assumes the marginal distributions of the discrete latent variables, while Naive Bayes assumes the conditional distribution of the discrete latent variables. Edit : I have this backwards. Naive Bayes models do assume the marginal distribution for the hidden portion, and the distributions of the data conditional on the hidden rvs. And this is similar to HMMs, so it should be counted as a similarity. Your picture illustrates this well. Naive Bayes has a lot in common with Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), though.
