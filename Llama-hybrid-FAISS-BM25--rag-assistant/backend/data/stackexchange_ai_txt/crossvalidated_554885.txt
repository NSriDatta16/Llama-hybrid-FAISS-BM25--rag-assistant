Using the factors obtained in the MCA as predictors in GLM/GLMM is valid, especially considering your specific case (need for dimension reduction and multicolinearity reduction). The interpretation of the coefficients will be the difficult part. I would try two approaches: Having a good understanding and labelling of each factor, and interpreting the coefficients only in relative terms: "The augmentation of this factor is associated with a decrease (or increase) in my output". Using model predictions and marginal effects. The idea is to have an observation used as a scenario, using the function predict.MCA from factoMineR to get is coordinates on the new factors and then predicting your outcome with the predict function and your GLM/GLMM. You can then do the same thing but with a new observation for which you change only one characteristic (scenario 2). You can then interpret the change between the two predictions. But keep in mind that it is not exactly "everything hold equal" because changing that characteristic will affect the other factors. A last suggestion would be to think about your process (input data --> MCA --> GLMM --> result) as a global model. With a little bit of effort, you could use the functions from DALEX and analyze your whole model with tools used in machine learning.
