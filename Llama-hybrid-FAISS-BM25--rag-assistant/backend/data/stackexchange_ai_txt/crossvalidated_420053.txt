With four treatments (columns) and 30 flowers per treatment, simulated to have different proportions of F, M, H flowers per treatment, I got the following data table: DTA [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [1,] 8 9 12 8 # F [2,] 7 14 14 2 # M [3,] 15 7 4 20 # H Results are not always as expected. For example, Treatment 1 was simulated to select among M, F, and H with equal probabilities, but it happens that half of the flowers there are H's. With relatively small samples, such anomalies are common. So without statistical analysis we cannot say whether there is a clear pattern of differences among theoretical mechanisms. Here is one possible analysis using R: A chi-squared test for homogeneity rejects the null hypothesis that treatment makes no difference in proportions of F:M:H flowers observed. The P-value 0.0002 is much smaller than 5%, so the effect of treatments is highly significant. fmh.out = chisq.test(DTA); fmh.out Pearson's Chi-squared test data: DTA X-squared = 26.27, df = 6, p-value = 0.0001983 The Pearson residuals with large absolute values draw attention to the fact that Treatment 4 has fewer M and more H flowers than would be expected if treatments had no effect. Also Treatment 3 has fewer H flowers than would have been expected. fmh.out$resi [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [1,] -0.4109975 -0.08219949 0.9041944 -0.4109975 [2,] -0.7397954 1.56179038 1.5617904 -2.3837853 [3,] 1.0320937 -1.32697761 -2.2116293 2.5065133 If the null hypothesis were true, one would expect counts in the 12 cells of the table to be approximately as shown below: fmh.out$exp [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [1,] 9.25 9.25 9.25 9.25 [2,] 9.25 9.25 9.25 9.25 [3,] 11.50 11.50 11.50 11.50 In order for the chi-squared statistic to have approximately a chi-squared distribution, these expected counts should be mainly greater than 5 (perhaps with one or two at most as low as 3). Note: Another recent Q&A shows a similar test.
