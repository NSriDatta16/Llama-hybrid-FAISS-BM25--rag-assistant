I have used processing for many interactive installations and found it really useful, because you get real fast results. Programming visual effects is really easy and elegant. Some examples to watch: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ziv8Q5N7mSU http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrT5uJox0J0 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y58wBAp7mac http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZp5HsFKxCs http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4LcfsHQnYw If you are dealing with a lot of data (many bitmaps, videos and sound) you might consider its limitations. I was happy to use it and will continue using it for certain projects. So as a conclusion: processing is no waste of time. It's a really useful language for real world applications (in its own domain of course).
