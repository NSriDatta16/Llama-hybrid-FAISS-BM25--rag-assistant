What error metrics to use for time series model with time-step ahead hyper-parameter?

Background Denote the forecasted value by a Time Series ML Model as \begin{align} \hat{y}_{t+\tau} \, (t, \tau) \end{align} where $t$ is the current time-step, $\tau$ is the time-step ahead. The subscript $t + \tau$ is the corresponding forecast time-step. For time series forecast ML Models, we have a hyper parameter of prediction_length (e.g. DeepAR or Temporal Fusion Transformer ) which is the maximum of $\tau$ Suppose we set prediction_length = 2 as the model hyper-parameter. That means $\tau \in \{1, 2\}$ At time-step $t = 0$ , the model prediction at $t = 2$ is denoted as $\hat{y}_{2}(0, 2)$ . As time pass, now we are at time-step $t = 1$ , we collected the ground-truth $y(t=1)$ . Then the prediction at $t = 2$ would be updated, and it becomes $\hat{y}_{2}(1, 1)$ Question As time pass again, now we are at time-step $t = 2$ , we now collected the ground-truth $y_{2}$ . My question is, how should I evaluate the model performance in predicting the value at $t = 2$ ? Should the residual be $y_{2} - \hat{y}_{2}(0,2)$ or $y_{2} - \hat{y}_{2}(1, 1)$ ? I am not sure in general, what error metrics should I use to evaluate the time series model involving prediction_length hyper-parameters
