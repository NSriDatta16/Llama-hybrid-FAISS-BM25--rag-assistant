Those two books provide nice introduction to decision theory, but with statistical focus, that emphasize Bayesian statistics: James O. Berger. Statistical Decision Theory. Springer. Christian P. Robert. The Bayesian Choice. Springer. Those are nice introductory handbooks on decision theory in general, with less, or no reference to statistics: Martin Peterson. An Introduction to Decision Theory. Cambridge University Press. Herman Chernoff and Lincoln E. Moses. Elementary Decision Theory. Dover. David A. Blackwell and M.A. Girshick. Theory of Games and Statistical Decisions. Dover. The choice depends on how deep you want to go into the subject and if you are looking for a statistics oriented book, or not.
