Difference between SUTSE (Seemingly Unrelated Time Series Equations) and SUR (Seemingly Unrelated Regressions)

I am studying time-series econometrics and in particular Dynamic Linear Models for multivariate time-series. Someone can help me in understanding which is the difference between SUTSE (Seemingly Unrelated Time Series Equations) and SUR (Seemingly Unrelated Regression) Dynamic Linear Models? How can I specify a SUTSE and a SUR model on r ? I think dlmModPoly may be of help but I am a bit stuck
