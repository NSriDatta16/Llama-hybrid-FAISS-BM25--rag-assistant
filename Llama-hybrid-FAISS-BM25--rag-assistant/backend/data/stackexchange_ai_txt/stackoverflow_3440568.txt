Rails: multiple names for a resource

Is there an elegant way of having multiple names for a single resource. We would like to give the user a choice via a setting of what they would like to call their "things". I.e. products, items, services whatever. So far I can only think of using multiple routes to a single controller: resources :products resources :items, :controller => :products resources :services, :controller => :products The only thing I can see is the views will become quite complex having to ask which URL to generate based on the users setting. Any thoughts or ideas would be appreciated!
