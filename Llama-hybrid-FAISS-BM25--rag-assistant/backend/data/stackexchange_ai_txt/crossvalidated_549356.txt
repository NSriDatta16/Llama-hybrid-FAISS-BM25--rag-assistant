calculate correlation of broken time series

Is it statistically correct to calculate correlations between two broken time series? For example, x Is this a valid way to compute correlations? EDIT: For example, let's say I collected heart rate data continuously on day 1 (x) and day 2 (y). blockA are rest periods and blockB are activity periods. By splitting the data into rest/activity blocks, I'm breaking the time series. Can I really assume that blockA1 + blockA2 (the entire rest period for day 1) is equivalent to measuring blockA continuously?
