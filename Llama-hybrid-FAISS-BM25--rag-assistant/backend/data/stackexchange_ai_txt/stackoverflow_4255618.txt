How do i figure out which dependences of a CPAN distribution require a compiler?

I need to install a perl tool on a production server which has no compiler. I can install CPAN distributions fine via local::lib, but the lack of compiler means I have to ask the sysadmins to install further modules. Due to them having an average turnaround time of 1-2 weeks even for the most ridiculously simple tasks, the process of trying to install, asking them to install what's borked, trying to install again, etc. etc. is extremely painful. So how can i figure out quickly which given dependencies of a dist require a c compiler, so i can just give them a list?
