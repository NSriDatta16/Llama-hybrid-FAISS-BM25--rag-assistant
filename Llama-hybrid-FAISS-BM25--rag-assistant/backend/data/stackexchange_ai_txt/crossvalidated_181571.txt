You are in a Bayesian setting: That the weight depends on $x$ (and not $X$) does not matter since $x$ is observed. Simulating from this posterior is thus like simulating from any other mixture. (Not that you really need to simulate.) Hence, once $X$ is observed to take the value $x$, you can simplify the terms $A$ and $B$ into $$A = x+1, \qquad B = 1\,$$ and select the component of the mixture with probabilities $1.2A, 0.4B$, respectively.
