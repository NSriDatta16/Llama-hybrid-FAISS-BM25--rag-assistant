Bayesian Logistic Regression (Informative Priors)

I recently read in a paper comparing the Full Bayesian approach to the Empirical Bayes the following : "the FB method can accom- modate distributions such as the hierarchical Poisson-Gamma distribution and the Poisson-LogNormal distribution" (Persaud et al., 2010) Does this mean that performing Full Bayes with informative priors using logistic regression violates the Full Bayes assumptions? From what I have already seen in the forum and other books there are no extra assumptions compared to the frequentist logistic regression, is there something that I understood wrong? Sorry if my question is not very clear I am really new in Bayesian statistics. P.S. Any recommendations on books/papers regarding the application of Bayesian Logistic Regression with informative priors (potentialy using a "historical" dataset) are more than welcome!
