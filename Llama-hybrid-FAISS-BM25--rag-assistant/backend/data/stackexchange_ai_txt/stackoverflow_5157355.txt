I got it! With help of the following post Serialize a UserControl to xaml, but not its children? [Many thanks to you Will]. I could extract the "default" style. So I obtain the complete style. What I did before, open RibbonControlsLibrary with .NET Reflector and read the XAML with BAML Viewer. Not ideal in my case. Just in case someone has the same wish, obtaining the default style of component (when it isn't published @MSDN): System.Windows.Style style = Application.Current.FindResource(typeof(Microsoft.Windows.Controls.Ribbon.Ribbon)) as System.Windows.Style; var sb = new System.Text.StringBuilder(); var writer = System.Xml.XmlWriter.Create(sb, new System.Xml.XmlWriterSettings { Indent = true, ConformanceLevel = System.Xml.ConformanceLevel.Fragment, OmitXmlDeclaration = true }); var mgr = new System.Windows.Markup.XamlDesignerSerializationManager(writer); mgr.XamlWriterMode = System.Windows.Markup.XamlWriterMode.Expression; System.Windows.Markup.XamlWriter.Save(style, mgr); string styleString = sb.ToString(); Cheers, Patrick
