How secure are Resources in .NET?

How hard would it be to retrieve embedded resources from a .NET application, from outside the application itself? Even if the resources are compressed and trivially encrypted, how difficult is it to retrieve them using a tool? (I am not concerned with the protection of the data per se, just the methods of retrieval of the resource itself) EDIT: I think my question was misunderstood, it was less about the encryption and more about the retrieval, other than reflector, what else can be used?
