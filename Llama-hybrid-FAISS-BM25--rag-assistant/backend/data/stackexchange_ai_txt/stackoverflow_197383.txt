Locating bundles by identifier

I want to create a bundle from an arbitrary bundle identifier e.g. com.apple.iokit.IOStorageFamily It's not an unreasonable thing to do as bundle IDs are supposed to be unique, however the obvious code does not work: NSString* bID = @"com.apple.iokit.IOStorageFamily"; NSBundle* bundle = [NSBundle bundleWithIdentifier:bID]; This code only works for bundles you've already loaded (hello, chicken and egg problem), and in fact, you have to know a little more than you'd like about the the identifier before you can do anything. For the above style of ID I grep out the final component and tranform it into /System/Library/Extensions/IOStorageFamily.kext which I then load by path. Is this the state of the art or is there a more general way?
