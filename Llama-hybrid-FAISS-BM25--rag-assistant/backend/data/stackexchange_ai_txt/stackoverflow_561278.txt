Definitely go relative. I'd call them "index" and "count". Normally I'd use "length", but it doesn't seem to fit for what you're describing. If you want to make it similar to linq, you could call the parameters "skip" and "take". These terms are also more approachable for the Joe Average guy who's going to be looking at the resulting URL.
