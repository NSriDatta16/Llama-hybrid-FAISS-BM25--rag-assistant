Are the client and server machines "the same"? What you are proposing will only work if the the C compilers at each end lay out the structure in memory exactly the same. There are lots of reasons why this may not be the case. For example the client and server macines might have different architectures, then the way they represent numbers in memory (big-endian, little-endian) might differ. Even if the clients machines and server machine have the same architecture two different C compilers may have different policies for how they lay out structs in memory (eg. padding between fields to align ints on word boundaries). Even the same conmpiler with different flags might give different results. Pragmatically, I'm guessing that your client and server are the same kind of machine and so what you are proposing will work, however you need to be aware that as a general rule it won't and that's why standards such as CORBA were invented, or why folks use some general representation such as XML.
