SqlBulkCopy unable to Parse "0", "1" bool values into BIT on database table

I am using my custom CSVDataReader : IDataReader {} to insert Bulk values in a Database table. Every datatype but the Bit (from "1"/"0") is parsed perfectly. I am getting the following error " value of type String from the data source cannot be converted to type bit" while parsing 0 or 1 as bool If I change these values to "true"/"false". It is taken without any problem. I can't alter the CSV file. Currently I replace that specific column from "0"/"1" to "false"/"True" during Iteration. But this is not an elegant solution. Please help ! Thanks Panks
