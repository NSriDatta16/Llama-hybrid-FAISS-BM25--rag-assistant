Jsch or SSHJ or Ganymed SSH-2?

I need to connect to server(username,pasw,host)-- easy enter 3-10 commands -- command="dir;date;cd;dir" is there an easier way ?, without writing 20 lines: while(smtng) { a lot of stuff+ mysterious print to scr:D } download a file-- easy write another downloaded file to the same file (add not owerride) -- any ideas how? So to perform these increadible easy tasks, which might seem impossible if you dare to use Jsch(awsome documentation), there is a choise between Jsch,sshj,Ganymed any suggestions? Mystery: 2) multiple commands entering 4) adding to the existing txt file more txt :D (probably there is a build in command) or not? /* just for download/owerride : sftpChannel.get("downloadfile.txt", "savefile.txt");*/
