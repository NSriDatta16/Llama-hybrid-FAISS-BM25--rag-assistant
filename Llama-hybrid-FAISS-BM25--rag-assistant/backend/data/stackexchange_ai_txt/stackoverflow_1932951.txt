EC2 database server failover strategy

I am planning to deploy my web app to EC2. I have several webserver instances. I have 1 primary database instance. I have 1 failover database instance. I need a strategy to redirect the webservers to the failover database instance IP when the primary database instance fails. I was hoping I could use an Elastic IP in my connection strings. But, the webservers are not able to access/ping the Elastic IP. I have several brute force ideas to solve the problem. However, I am trying to find the most elegant solution possible. I am using all .Net and SQL Server. My connection strings are encrypted. Does anybody have a strategy for failing over a database instance in EC2 using some form of automation or DNS configuration? Please let me know.
