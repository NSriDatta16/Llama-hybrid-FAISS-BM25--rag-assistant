SharePoint is ideally suited for this scenarion. I would suggest using a Business Data Catalog (BDC) to access external data sources. It provides a tremendouse benefit primarily by making your datasource searchable as well as providing OOB web parts to display the data with master child relation ships, filtering and a rich API. I would caution against making workflows too complex and instead break up the process into stages using smaller workflows, InfoPath and user actions to facilitate the entire process. this is where SharePoint really shines as you can interject visibility of the process stages to others in the organization using dashboards (if it makes sense for your scenario) as well as collaboration, approvals ... the list goes on.
