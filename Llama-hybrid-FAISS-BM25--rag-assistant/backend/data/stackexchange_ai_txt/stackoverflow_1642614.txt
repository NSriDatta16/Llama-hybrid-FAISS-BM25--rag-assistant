How to ceil, floor and round bcmath numbers?

I need to mimic the exact functionality of the ceil() , floor() and round() functions on bcmath numbers , I've already found a very similar question but unfortunately the answer provided isn't good enough for me since it lacks support for negative numbers and the precision argument for the round() function is missing . I was wondering if anyone can come up with a rather short and elegant solution to this problem. All input is appreciated, thanks!
