Future promises in Clojure hangs on me

When I run the following code it basically works how I intend it to, except that it hangs after the future is finished. What am I missing - some kind of "close agents/threads" call? How should I do this? (def name-to-greet (promise)) (future (println "Hello," @name-to-greet)) (print "What is your name? ") (flush) (deliver name-to-greet (read-line))
