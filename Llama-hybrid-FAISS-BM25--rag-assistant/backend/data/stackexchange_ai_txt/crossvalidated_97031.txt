In a particular market, $\sigma=42.5$. If we assume normality , then $drinks\sim \mathcal{N}(\mu,42.5^2)$. What about $\mu$? The overall mean is centered around $\mu_0=738$ and its variability is $\sigma_0=13.4$. So, if we assume normality , a prior for $\mu$ is $\mu\sim \mathcal{N}(738,13.4^2)$. As to a new market during the first $n=10$ weeks, you don't know $\mu$ but know the sample mean $\bar{x}=692$ and the variance $\sigma^2=42.5^2$. So you can use a normal-normal model with known variance. The posterior for the mean is normal and its mean and variance are (see here ): $$\hat\mu=\frac{\sigma^2\mu_0+n\sigma^2_0\bar{x}}{\sigma^2+n\sigma^2_0}=\frac{42.5^2\cdot738+10\cdot13.4^2\cdot692}{42.5^2+10\cdot13.4^2}$$ $$\hat\sigma^2=\frac{\sigma^2_0\sigma^2}{\sigma^2+n\sigma^2_0}=\frac{13.4^2\cdot42.5^2}{42.5^2+10\cdot 13.4^2}$$ You can use $X\sim \mathcal{N}(\hat\mu,\hat\sigma^2)$ to compute $P(700 What does that mean? The distributor expect a mean about 738, but observes $\bar{x}=692$ during the first 10 weeks. He doesn't believe that it is a definitive result. So he weighs his observation and his past experience. Indeed $\hat\mu$ depends on both the prior mean (past experience) and the sample mean (what he has observed). His estimate of the average number of drinks sold in the new market will be updated by future observations, i.e. as $n$ grows. You can see that: $$\lim_{n\to\infty}\hat\mu=\bar{x}$$ For now, ten weeks is a short time, so he builds his belief on both $\bar{x}$ and $\mu_0$. This is called shrinkage estimation : the estimation of $\mu$ is shrunken toward the prior mean when $n$ is small.
