I'm not sure, if incorporating uncertainty due to lack of solid business architecture, non-optimal business processes and data quality issues is the best approach to the described situation. While you can certainly use some statistical approaches to improve the situation a little , I think that the right approach to such problems is a top-down one. I would consider the following measures : create or improve business architecture (BA) for the organization; create or improve IT and data architectures , both of which should be aligned with BA and business goals, in general, as well as between each other; optimize business processes , based on the above-mentioned changes (for example, via business rules); for data architecture , pay attention to master data management , data quality , standardizing statistical analyses , reproducible research and establishing data analysis workflows (you can read more on that in my answers on Data Science SE site, linked in this gateway answer ). This is just a high-level overview of the approach that I would recommend. Anything beyond that requires knowing details about the organization and most likely calls for some consulting effort.
