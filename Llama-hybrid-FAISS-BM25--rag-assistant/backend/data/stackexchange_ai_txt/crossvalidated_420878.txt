Looking at entering new data in a regression model

Been puzzling this for a while so hopefully can help. Have a dataset 1 of which I have a regression equation. I want to see how well this model can predict my new data set - let's call data set 2. Can I calculate the ESS and RSS by doing ESS = sum(predicted y from dataset2 - average response of real y from dataset2)^2 & RSS=sum(real y from dataset2 -predicted y from dataset2)^2 and then use these to calculate the Rsq value and compare the difference between r sq of original eq and rsq of this new dataset. Or does the average y used in ESS calculation need to be from the original dataset? Thanks!
