Another two books similar to Nocedal & Wright are Numerical Optimization , by Bonnans et al. Optimization Theory and Methods , by Sun & Yuan But since you're looking for optimization methods applicable in data science and machine learning, keep in mind that the sheer size of models in this field usually requires stochastic versions of algorithms discussed in these books (generally some version of stochastic gradient descent ). This field is still in flux, and new algorithms seem to be developed every other month, so there aren't any comprehensive textbooks available at the moment (at least to my knowledge). The closest thing I could think of would be this review article by Ruder.
