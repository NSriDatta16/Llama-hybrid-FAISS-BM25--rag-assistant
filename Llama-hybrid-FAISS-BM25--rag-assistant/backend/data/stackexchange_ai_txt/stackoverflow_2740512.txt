Can't you avoid this by not having a blank line between your environment and the next line? This is paragraph text. This is paragraph text, too. \begin{example} \item This is the first item in the list. \item This is the second item in the list. \end{example} % (No blank line) This is more paragraph text. I don't want this indented, please.
