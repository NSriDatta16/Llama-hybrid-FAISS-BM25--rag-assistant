Class-based views provide an alternative way to implement views as Python objects instead of functions. They do not replace function-based views, but have certain differences and advantages when compared to function-based views: Organization of code related to specific HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc) can be addressed by separate methods instead of conditional branching. Object oriented techniques such as mixins (multiple inheritance) can be used to factor code into reusable components.
