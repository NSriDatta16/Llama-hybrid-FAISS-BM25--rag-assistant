Good algorithms for feature extraction from images?

I am searching for some algorithms for feature extraction from images which I want to classify using machine learning . I have heard only about [scale-invariant feature transform][1] (SIFT), I have images of buildings and flowers to classify . Other than SIFT what are some good algorithms .
