As Pat said, use liquibase. Especially when you have several developers with their own dev databases making changes that will become part of the production database. If there's only one dev, as on one project I'm on now(ha), I just commit the schema changes as SQL text files into a CVS repo, which I check out in batches on the production server when the code changes go in. But liquibase is better organized than that!
