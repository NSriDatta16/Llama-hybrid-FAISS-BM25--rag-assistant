What's the probability that the next test will exceed the previous maximum?

I take a sample of 10 from a population that I suspect is non-normal (but it is continuous). I need to calculate the probability that the next sample will be larger than the maximum of the previous 10 points (given the previous 10 observations). I'm an engineer with some extra statistical knowledge. I was taught from a frequentist perspective. Am I correct in thinking I can solve this problem with a Bayesian credible interval? Added: I did consider a nonparametric prediction interval, but since that is a frequentist's perspective it doesn't give a probability of the next sample, but that the probability applies to the procedure used to calculate the interval (see this explanation of prediction intervals paragraph 21 ).
