If you want to draw curves, then look at the Windows GDI function PolyBezier() . Create an array of four points: The first and last points should be the endpoints, i.e. the nodes you are connecting two and from. The two middle points should both be the same, and should be the 'point' of the curve, i.e. the position you are dragging with the mouse.
