Decision tree more than 2 output levels

I have a classification problem where my dependent variable has 3 possible values. They are ordered variables. I have been using trees and random forests in R to tackle this problem, but have to convert the problem into a binary one, so i'm predicting if the dependent variable is or isn't 1, then is or isn't 2, then is or isn't 3 in 3 different models. Can I build a random forest or decision tree with an ordinal variable as the dependent variable? Are there any better ways I should be approaching this problem? Thanks
