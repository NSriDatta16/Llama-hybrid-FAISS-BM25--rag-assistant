Help me convert this PHP SOAP code to C#

I am trying to do some C# SOAP calls and can't seem to get any good examples on how to do it. I read an old question of mine about a SOAP call in PHP and thought maybe asking you guys to rewrite it in C# would be a good place to start. Here is the PHP code: $client = new SoapClient('http://www.hotelscombined.com/api/LiveRates.asmx?WSDL'); $client->__soapCall('HotelSearch', array( array('request' => array( 'ApiKey' => 'THE_API_KEY_GOES_HERE', // note that in the actual code I put the API key in... 'UserID' => session_id(), 'UserAgent' => $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'], 'UserIPAddress' => $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'], 'HotelID' => '50563', 'Checkin' => '07/02/2009', 'Checkout' => '07/03/2009', 'Guests' => '2', 'Rooms' => '1', 'LanguageCode' => 'en', 'DisplayCurrency' => 'usd', 'TimeOutInSeconds' => '90' ) ) ) );
