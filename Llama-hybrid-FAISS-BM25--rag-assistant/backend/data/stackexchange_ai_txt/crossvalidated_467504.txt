Can different models have the same accuracy?

I'm doing binary classification on different models, GLM, Random forest and SVM have the same accuracy, recall, specificity, precision and f1 score, however they all have a different AUC-PR curve. There is prevalence in the data 70% from the positive class. I'm using random seeds before every model. Is that possible? If so what is the explanation behind this?
