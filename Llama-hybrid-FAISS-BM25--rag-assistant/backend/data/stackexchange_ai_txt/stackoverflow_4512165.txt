IsolatedStorageFileStream exception is throw when file is opened?

when I attempt to open a file in a WP7 app: IsolatedStorageFile isf = IsolatedStorageFile.GetUserStoreForApplication(); IsolatedStorageFileStream nameXmlFile = new IsolatedStorageFileStream("Names.xml", System.IO.FileMode.Open, isf); I recieve the following error: Operation not permitted on IsolatedStorageFileStream. I'm not sure why it isn't opening because I used the exact code somewhere else in my app and it works fine. Any leads as to why this is happening? EDIT I used the following code to add the file to isolated storage in the App.xaml.cs Application_Launching Event: IsolatedStorageFile isf = IsolatedStorageFile.GetUserStoreForApplication(); IsolatedStorageFileStream feedXmlFile = new IsolatedStorageFileStream("Names.xml",System.IO.FileMode.Create, isf);
