How do I calculate the fitted values of an Arma model

I am studying the ARMA models, and I am breaking my head on something probably straightforward but that I can't see. I generated in R a simple AR(1) model, and used the function ARIMA to estimate its coefficients. I get two coefficients, an AR(1) coefficient and an intercept. Now I am trying to calculate myself the fitted values. On another post on StackExchange I found that I can find the fitted value Y(i) by doing Y(i-1)*model$coef[1] + ((1-model$coef[1])*model$coef[2]) Can somebody please explain why one has to multiply the intercept with 1 minus the AR(1) coefficient? Thanks in advance! Kasper PS This is the other question I was reffering to: Computing the fitted value for the first observation in a time series
