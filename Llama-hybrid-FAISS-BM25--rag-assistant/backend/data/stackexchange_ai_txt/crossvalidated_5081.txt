Java library for Bayesian Networks

As the headline suggest, I am looking for a java library for learning and inference of Bayesian Networks. I have already found some, but I am hoping for a recommendation. Requirements in a quick overview: written in Java (my overlord tells me that this is no point of discussion) configuration is possible via code (and not solely via a GUI). source code available project is still maintained the more powerful, the better Which one do you recommend?
