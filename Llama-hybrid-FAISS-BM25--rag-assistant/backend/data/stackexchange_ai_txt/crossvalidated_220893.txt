For simplicity, first scale your data $X$ so that $median \|X_i - X_j\| \approx 1$: half the neighbors are 1, on average. What $e^{-gamma\ dist^2 }$ does is down-weight, attenuate, more distant neighbors. By how much ? Make a little table: dist: [0 .5 1 2 3] --------------------- exp( - 0.3 * dist^2 ): [100 93 74 30 7] % exp( - 1 * dist^2 ): [100 78 37 2 0] % exp( - 3 * dist^2 ): [100 47 5 0 0] % So $gamma = 3$ down-weights half the points by 5 % .. 0, $gamma = 1$ by 37 % .. 0, $gamma = 0.3$ even less. (The range 0.3 .. 3 is way too big.) A simple rule of thumb: start with $gamma = 3$, for distances scaled to median 1. Could you try $gamma = 2, 3, 4$ for your scaled data ? Also, plotting the sample distributions of $dist = \|X_i - X_j\|$ and $e^{ -gamma\ dist^2 }$ might be useful.
