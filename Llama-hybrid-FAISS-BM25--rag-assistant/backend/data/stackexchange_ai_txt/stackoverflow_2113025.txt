There are two ways to understand the question. At a technical level, can a class implement both interfaces simultaneously? No, because the remove method is incompatible between the two interfaces (one returns Object, the other boolean). At a conceptual level, the Map.EntrySet of the Map is kind of the Collection representation of the Map, so you might be able to leverage it when you need a Collection. If you just want a Collection of the values in the Map, just use Map.values() method.
