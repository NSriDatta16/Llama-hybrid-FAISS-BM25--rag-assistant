You should be careful when using not in boolean expressions that you don't get the AND and OR mixed up. Read about De Morgan's Laws . Often it is easier to read with only one negative. Applying De Morgan's Law to your expression gives this: while (!(ch=='\r' && ch=='\n' && ch==' ')) If you had written it in this form you will hopefully immediate notice that (ch == '\r' && ch == '\n') can never be true. The solution is to change this: while (ch != '\n' || ch != '\t' || ch != ' ') into this: while (!(ch == '\n' || ch == '\t' || ch == ' ')) You can read it as "While we don't have \n or \t or space, do this...". Note that "while not" is similar to "until" in English (and some programming languages), so you can also read it as "Until we have \n or \t or space, do this".
