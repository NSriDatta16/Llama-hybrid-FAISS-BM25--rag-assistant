Integrating wordpress with magento

I am trying to integrate wordpress into a magento install but keep getting the following error when trying to include Fatal error: Cannot redeclare __() I assume this is because both magento and wordpress use this. How can i get around this. I have tried things like: if(!function_exists('__()')) { function __() {} } in both magento and wordpress files but it makes no difference - granted i dont fully understand what its doing. Are there any suggestions on getting around this?
