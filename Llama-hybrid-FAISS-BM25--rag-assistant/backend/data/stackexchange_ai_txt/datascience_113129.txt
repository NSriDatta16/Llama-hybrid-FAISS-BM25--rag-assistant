Linear Regression on Time Series

I have a csv file containing values of X and Y variables. i have been asked to use this to build a linear regression model that can predict the current value of the variable based on its previous historical values (say 4 historical values). and my model should have following form. W = + WX+ + QWXQ + SWXS + YWXY + (+, Q, S, Y, ) are supposedly the parameters that should be found. Now this looks very confusing and i don't know where to begin with it. I have relatively little experience with time series forecasting but i understand all machine learning principles. Can someone guide me in the right direction.
