What is frequency in time series in general and in my examples?

I have 2 years day-wise data of stock price. What frequency should I take in this case for next 1 year day-wise prediction? I have one day minute-wise data. What frequency should I take for next day forecast minute-wise? Actually I want to know what is the frequency w.r.t. time series and prediction? I have given you a scenario : I have 2 years day-wise data of stock price. What frequency should I take in this case for next 1 year day-wise prediction? I.e., I want to convert my raw data of stock price for last two years (daily basis) and I want to convert this into a time series for an ARIMA model. I want to know what value for the frequency argument I should give inside ts() of the R software, and how it is decided. Is it clear now?
