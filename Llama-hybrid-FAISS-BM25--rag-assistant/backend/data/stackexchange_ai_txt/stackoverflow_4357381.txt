I would go against nagging entirely, you don't intentionally piss off your potential customers. Most of the time I would close down nag screens and not care until I reach the last day of the trial and then I would make my decision. I wouldn't cripple either. People are emotional before logical. People would sooner go in search of some other app than pay up. People are entitled, generation of critics and relentlessly demanding. I have a few ideas: Give them X amount of days and then at the end thank them for using your app. If they don't last the trial they're not going to buy it or are really unlikely too. At the end, give them the price with a little extra on that you would donate to charity if they buy your stuff. Advertise that your customers are awesome because now X has a home to live in, or food or Y just beat cancer. Everyone wants to feel like the belong to something as well as accomplished something. Remind your users that people like them cause miracles to happen. You could compartmentalise your app and allow people to buy whatever services suit them personally, sometimes 3 dollars is better than no dollars. People are very, very picky so allowing them to build their own version of the app creates a greater sense of control on the part of the user. They'll remember that over someone who just shoved an app in their face and demanded money or nagged them to the point of psychosis-inducing rage. You could have a small subscription fee e.g. 1 dollar a month. You could have a pay to play sort of thing where 1 dollar buys you 72 hours. It's 4am here in ireland so I'm gonig to bed. Let me know if you want to know more.
