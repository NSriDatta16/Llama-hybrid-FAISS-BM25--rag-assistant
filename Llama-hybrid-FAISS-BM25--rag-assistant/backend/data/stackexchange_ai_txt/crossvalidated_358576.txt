The notion of "more data -> better performance" is normally used in context of number of samples and not the size of each sample. I.e. Deep learning can extract more information from higher number of observations than other methods. In your example you are talking more about giving additional information per sample rather than more samples. Things to check: Scale of the temperature - improperly scaled inputs can completely destroy the stability of training Outliers - if model heavily relies on the temperature to predict the outcome it is possible that outliers in this relationship can create wildly wrong predictions and since MSE is sensitive to outliers you get worse performance.
