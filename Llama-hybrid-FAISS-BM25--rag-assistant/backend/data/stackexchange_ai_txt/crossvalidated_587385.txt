Detecting peaks in noisy quasi-periodic time series

I have the following acceleration data taken from my phone when rowing The negative peak is the point at which the oars go in the water. I would like to be able to identify this peak in real time when rowing. Given the data is roughly periodic - with frequency between 0.1 and 1 times per second - and has a characteristic shape. What would be the best way to detect these peaks in real time? data here for anyone interested: acceleration data
