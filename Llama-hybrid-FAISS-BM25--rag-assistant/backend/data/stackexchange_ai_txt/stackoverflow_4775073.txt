Javascript Slideshow with changing page background

I'd like to know if it's possible to achieve something like this slider automatically with javascript/jquery: http://www.elegantthemes.com/preview/TheSource/ Notice how the slider background changes according to the edge of the slider image. This can be seen easily on higher resolutions. My objective would be to: Add a fixed resolution image to the slider and then the background of that image would be "calculated" automatically with JS and create a smooth gradient. I'm not sure if i made my point clear, so if you have any question please ask. Thanks in advance!
