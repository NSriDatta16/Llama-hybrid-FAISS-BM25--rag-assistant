Different p-values for normal regression and interaction terms

while performing a logistic regression for two variables I also wanted to perform an interaction analysis. Particularly, I was looking to the use of a diagnostic test over time (before and after a certain period, a binary variable) and deepending on age (elderly >75 y.o. ore younger individuals, still a binary variable). However, the p-values given in the interaction analysis for the single components are different than the original given by the single analysis, so I would like to understand what are the actual p-values reported in the interaction analysis. Here the codes and results: summary(glm(DB $Test~ DB$ Time,family = binomial(link="logit")) p-Value 1.52e-06 summary(glm(DB $Test~ DB$ Age, family = binomial(link="logit")) p-Value 5.4e-09 summary(glm(DB $Test~ DB$ Time* DB$Age,family = binomial(link="logit")) p-Values: Time= 7.67e-06 Age= 0.0491 Time:Age= 0.6922 So, where does this 0.049 come from? what is it testing? Thanks in advance for the answers.
