I would say different MovieClips for different state will be better as you might want need some other states also(Disabled, Hovered, Clicked etc...). Different MovieClip on different state would also help you your code organized and will be much easier to modify individual MovieClip of states rather than inserting and deleting multiple frames in timeline. So, My suggestion is -Make standard or Custom Button -Put different MovieClips for Different states(either you swap them on event listener or If default Button, put on timeline) -Add animation in those separate State MovieClips. You would also reuse same animation for multiple button effectively by this way.
