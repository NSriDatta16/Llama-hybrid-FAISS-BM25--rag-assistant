I'm new to XCode development and ran into the same problem that you did. There are several ways to add a framework to a project: dragging and dropping into the frameworks folder; adding to the linked libraries in the target's info page; etc. I found that the easiest way to add a framework to a project is the right click on the Frameworks folder in the "Groups and Files" Tab and choose "Add>Existing Frameworks" When you select a framework it will be added relative to the SDK - If you open the frameworks' "info" window (ctrl-click> Get Info) after adding it, the path-type will be set to "Relative to current SDK")
