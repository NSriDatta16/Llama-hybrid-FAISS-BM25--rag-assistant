Another drawback of CV (in addition to those in Frans Rodenburg's excellent answer ) is when there is a dependency between samples, such as in a time series. In that case you can split into train/valid such that no training data has a dependency on any validation data. (E.g. in the case of time series, your validation data has the later timestamps.)
