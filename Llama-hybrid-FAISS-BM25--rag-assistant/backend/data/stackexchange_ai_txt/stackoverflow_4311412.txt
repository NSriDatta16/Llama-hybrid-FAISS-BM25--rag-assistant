Issues while Upgrading Jsf1.0 to Jsf2.0

While upgrading application to Jsf2.0 created in Spring3 and Jsf1.0 (myfaces), i am facing some issues mentioned below. I have done following steps to upgrade the application. From IntelliJ IDEA: * Open project settings/Monitor/Dependencies * Removed facelet*jar, el*.jars, myfaces* jars from project * Added jsf2.0.x ri mojarra jars and tomahawk1.1.9.jar * Open project settings/monitor/web settings * Under "modules and libs to package": remove el-.jars,facelet-jar and myfaces jars * Added jsf2.0.x ri mojarra jars and tomahawk1.1.9.jar * Removed erroneous class usages from our classes Lists.java and RegExValidator.java. In Lists.java, replace import with org.apache.commons.lang.LocaleUtils. In RegExValidator, replace import with "org.apache.myfaces.shared_tomahawk.util.MessageUtils". Edit Web.xml: * facelets.VIEW_MAPPINGS -> javax.faces.FACELETS_VIEW_MAPPINGS * facelets.LIBRARIES -> javax.faces.FACELETS_LIBRARIES * Change Faces Servlet to javax.faces.webapp.FacesServlet * Change header to: Edit faces-config.xml: * Add header: xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee/web-facesconfig_2_0.xsd" version="2.0"> * Remove line " com.sun.facelets.FaceletViewHandler " After doing all the steps mentioned above getting the following error: A literal value was specified for attribute actionListener that is defined as a deferred method with a return type of void. JSP.2.3.4 does not permit literal values in this case Actually Jsf2.0 el expressions #{myBean.property} are not getting resolved thats why its showing the above error. Can anybody guide me, what is missing, so that i can successfully migrate application to Jsf2.0 Thanks in Advance, Dhillon
