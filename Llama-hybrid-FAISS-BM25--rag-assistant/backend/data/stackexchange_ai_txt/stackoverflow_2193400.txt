With a little playing around in ANTLRWorks I was able to get this to work: commands : command+ EOF; command : (CMD first=path second=path '\n') {System.out.println("Command found, first path:" + $first.text + ", and second path:" + $second.text + "\n");}; path : FILE {System.out.println("file is:" + $FILE.text);}; fragment ID: ('A'..'Z'|'a'..'z')('A'..'Z'|'a'..'z'|'0'..'9')+; CMD : ID; FILE : ('/' ID)+; WS: (' '|'\t'|'\r'|'\n') {$channel = HIDDEN;}; Please notice that I had to create a few more lexer rules and then start putting different parser rules to test. I used a java target and will let you use what ever target you want. Oh yeah, each command has to be on a separate line because of the '\n' in the command rule.
