Install Office on ASP.NET IIS Servers: Pros / Cons?

First off, the little voice inside my head is screaming that this is a bad idea and it shouldn't be done, but my pragmatic side is asking "How bad could it be?" The stark fact is most of my company's day to day "business" happens in one MS Office tool or another. Data is exported out of our custom tools as *.tab, *.csv, manipulated in Excel and imported back in with variying degrees of success. Most of these custom tools are ASP.NET MVC web applications whose usability could be enhanced by more interoperability with Office. I've fought the good fight for many years saying Office on a web server is a terrible idea. Lately I've been thinking that the enhanced usability outweighs the potential risks. Am I going crazy?
