Data science is a multidisciplinary blend of data inference, algorithm development, and technology in order to solve analytically complex problems. But due to dearth of Data Scientists, a career in data science can really create numerous opportunities. However, organizations are looking for certified professionals from SAS, Data Science Council of America (DASCA), Hortonworks etc. Hope this is a good information!
