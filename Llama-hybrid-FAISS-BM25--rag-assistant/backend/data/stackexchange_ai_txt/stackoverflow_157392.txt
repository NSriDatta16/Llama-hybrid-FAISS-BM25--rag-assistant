How do I find out if a SQLite index is unique? (With SQL)

I want to find out, with an SQL query, whether an index is UNIQUE or not. I'm using SQLite 3. I have tried two approaches: SELECT * FROM sqlite_master WHERE name = 'sqlite_autoindex_user_1' This returns information about the index ("type", "name", "tbl_name", "rootpage" and "sql"). Note that the sql column is empty when the index is automatically created by SQLite. PRAGMA index_info(sqlite_autoindex_user_1); This returns the columns in the index ("seqno", "cid" and "name"). Any other suggestions? Edit: The above example is for an auto-generated index, but my question is about indexes in general. For example, I can create an index with "CREATE UNIQUE INDEX index1 ON visit (user, date)". It seems no SQL command will show if my new index is UNIQUE or not.
