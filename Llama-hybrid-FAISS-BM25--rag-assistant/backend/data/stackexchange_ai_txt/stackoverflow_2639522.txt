Well I groped around a bit, and then tried the following: I compiled the program using the -O0 option (no optimization) and got a speedup of 2 almost for almost all the XYZ Values. I could also see that 2 threads are utilized on my dual core (previously, it was using only one). But now, when I remove the OpenMP pragmas, I could see no speedup, this bothers me, because SSE should be able to speed things up considerably. So this speedup could be entirely be attributed to OpenMP, have to find out why SSE is failing. Somebody had told me that if operations are trivial (perhaps the weight that this word puts forth is debatable since it differs from person to person), using SSE garners no speedup. But I wrote a small program, that calculates sqrt(i)/i for i_max_size = 64000.....and the SSE version gave a speedup of 3.5 ~ 4.0. I would post more once I find the root cause.
