I've not had the issue with my own services (we also use Sophos in our organisation) but I have seen it when installing certain programs such as Folding@Home. It does seem to relate to changes made to the registry since Folding@Home stores certain data in the registry, yet my own Windows services change the registry and don't have this issue. I'd go with Douglas's suggestion of submitting it to Sophos and see what they say.
