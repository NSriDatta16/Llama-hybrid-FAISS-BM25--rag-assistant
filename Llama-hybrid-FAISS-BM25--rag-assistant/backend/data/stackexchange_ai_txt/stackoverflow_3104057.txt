Moving a site that is in motion is always a bit trickier than doing so for a site that is just starting development. First, take a copy of the most current version of the site (don't use the live version). Delete any cache/session files from the copy and check it into the database. You should now have a complete copy in the database. Next, you'll need to move a bunch of files and directories over to being ignored. If you're on Windows, I'm told that Tortoise has a good facility to do this. Otherwise, you'll need to actually delete the repo copies of the files, add them to the ignore list, then copy them back into the working copy of the site. See Magento & Subversion (SVN) - Getting a Development Environment Started? for some suggestions on what to start ignoring. Finally, getting it to the live site may be a little harder. If you have full control over the server, check out the version of the site you want into a separate directory, restore files that are ignored for dev purposes ( local.xml ), and test thoroughly . Now, go do it again, you missed something. Finally, switch Apache over to that directory to serve your requests and you should be running. Special side note: Make sure to back up the database in the repo and use only development database instances for making changes. Never change live code, never develop on live databases, and you should be pretty insulated from catastrophes. Hope that helps! Thanks, Joe As I type this, I another side note. You may want to have a copy of the clean Magento install for your version handy, to see if the Core has been modified. If it has, shame on the former developer, and you need to look into moving those changes out of the core.
