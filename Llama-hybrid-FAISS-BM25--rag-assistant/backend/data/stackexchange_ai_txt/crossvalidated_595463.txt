You're right, they are transformed, hand-crafted features, obtained from the original ones, $X_1,X_2$ , according to the figure. They could have used only the original features and let the neural network decide which ones to invent. Though this is a tougher process, this is usually what's being done in current deep learning literature. We don't usually have input pixels being squared etc. Or, if you think the hand-crafted features are important by domain knowledge, you can include them to not reinvent the wheel. The transformed values depend on the transformation. For example, if you use $\sin(X_1)$ the value range will be $[-1, 1]$ irrespective of $X_1$ 's range.
