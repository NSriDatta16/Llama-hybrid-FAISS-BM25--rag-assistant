Why should "users agent" modify this parameter? What are the reason for a web browser not to set this parameter? The HTTP referrer can be used to profile a user’s behavior because you can see the page that referred to the current page. It can also unveil sensitive data such as a session ID in the URL to third party sites. This is why many web sites use dereferrer as a single exit page for all external links. That are the main reasons why some user agents don’t send a HTTP referrer at all. In opposite to that, HTTP referrers are only send when you actually follow a link or submit a form on a page. Any request that was triggered otherwise (HTTP redirect, direct request via location bar/bookmark) is not a referrer. Is this way the best? Are there any way to improve it? Doing it that way won’t work if you have opened a website in multiple tabs/windows. You would need an identifier for each page request so that you can identify the page that actually referred this one: Current requested page: /index.html Request ID of current requested page: 12345 Each link will then contain the request ID to identify the request that referred to the next page: By doing this also on forms and by additionally using an unpredictible value for the page request ID you can also make CSRF attacks more difficult.
