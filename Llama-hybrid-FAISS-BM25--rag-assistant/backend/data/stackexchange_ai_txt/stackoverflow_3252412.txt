Can Shoes.rb Create Self-Contained Applications?

It's encouraging that Shoes (the Ruby GUI framework) has excellent packaging functionality, but I'm concerned that it doesn't actually 'wrap' itself around created applications. Packaging for OSX outputs a shoes installer and a shoes file in a .app system. Is there any way that shoes could create a .app that contains shoes - that doesn't make you install shoes to run it? I'm working on creating a tiny application - just a start button and a stop button for a subprocess, etc.
