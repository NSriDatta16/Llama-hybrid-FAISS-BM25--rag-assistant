organising classes and modules in python

I'm getting a bit of a headache trying to figure out how to organise modules and classes together. Coming from C++, I'm used to classes encapsulating all the data and methods required to process that data. In python there are modules however and from code I have looked at, some people have a lot of loose functions stored in modules, whereas others almost always bind their functions to classes as methods. For example say I have a data structure and would like to write it to disk. One way would be to implement a save method for that object so that I could just type MyObject.save(filename) or something like that. Another method I have seen in equal proportion is to have something like from myutils import readwrite readwrite.save(MyObject,filename) This is a small example, and I'm not sure how python specific this problem is at all, but my general question is what is the best pythonic practice in terms of functions vs methods organisation?
