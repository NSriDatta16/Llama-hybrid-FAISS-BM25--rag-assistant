Can't change header logo in Magento?

I have created my own theme for magento, and I am trying to edit the logo and am having difficulty. I have created my own local/Mage/Page/etc/config.xml file, and specified within the config the following: images/Race-Ramps-logo-streaked-gradient.gif I created a custom layout in the file as well. I can see the custom layout file in the CMS, but my changes to the logo do absolutely nothing. I have even tried changing the original core config.xml, it still stays the same. On multiple websites, I have been told to go to System > Configuration > Design > Header, but I do not have the header option? Help please!
