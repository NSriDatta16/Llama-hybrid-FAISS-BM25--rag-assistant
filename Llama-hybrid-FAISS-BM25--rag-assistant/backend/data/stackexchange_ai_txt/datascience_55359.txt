How label smoothing and label flipping increases the performance of a machine learning model

I have seen posts and research papers mentioning these techniques for improving the performance of a machine learning model. These techniques certainly make some sense in the case when we are not sure about how correct is the labelling our dataset. However, I am wondering if these two techniques are proven to be beneficial for a ML model in the case when the labelling is correct?
