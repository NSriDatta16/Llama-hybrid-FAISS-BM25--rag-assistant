XHTML is an attempt to encourage the development of "well-formed" HTML. HTML has evolved over more than 10 years. Its implementation, and the implementation of the browsers that parse and render it, are not exactly consistent. This is why cross-browser compatibility is a major headache. HTML is based on SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language.) XML is also derived from SGML, so they are cousins of a sort. XHTML marries the two, providing (in theory) the benefits of XML to HTML. This includes a well-defined schema that can be reliably validated, queried, and transformed.
