XML Schema to restrict one field based on another

I have the following schema, which I use to ensure that a person's PhoneNumber and PhoneNumberType (Home, Work, etc.) is not longer than 10 characters. However, I want to improve this schema so that PhoneNumberType is not required if a PhoneNumber is not provided, but is required if the PhoneNumber is provided. Is there a way to do this in XML Schema 1.0? I am aware this could be accomplished in XML Schema 1.1 using , but unfortunately I am stuck with XML Schema 1.0.
