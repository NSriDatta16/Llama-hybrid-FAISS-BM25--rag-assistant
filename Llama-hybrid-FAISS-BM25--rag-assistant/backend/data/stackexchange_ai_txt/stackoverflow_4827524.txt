Using originate does not direct to a ring group

We're using Action:originate to start a call from our crm app. The operator clicks on a link and then asterisk calls the operator extension, and, when he picks up, start calling the outside number. this is working like a charm. But on our website, we want to be able to get a phone number from the visitor and call him. This has to work not on a specific extension, but on a ring group, so that any available agent will pickup the call. 119 is an agent extension, 120 is a ring group. This works: Action: originate Channel: SIP/119 #(agent extension) Context: from-internal Exten: 0xxxxxxxx #(number to be called) Priority: 1 WaitTime: 5 CallerId: CRM Timeout: 30000 Async: true This does not work, it doesn't ring any of the extensions in the ring group: Action: originate Channel: SIP/120 #(ring group to all agent extensions) Context: from-internal Exten: 0xxxxxxxx #(number to be called) Priority: 1 WaitTime: 5 CallerId: CRM Timeout: 30000 Async: true Do we have to call the ring group in another format? like ring/120?? also, the CallerId: CRM line works correctly if we connect to asterisk via telnet, but it does not work if sent by php sockets. Do we have to make any encode (like utf8_encode or utf8_decode) to match the same format as via telnet?
