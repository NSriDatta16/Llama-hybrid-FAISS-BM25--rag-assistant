My guess is this: Most populations (distributions) tend to congregate around the mean. The farther a value is from the mean, the rarer it is. In order to adequately express how "out of line" a value is, it is necessary to take into account both its distance from the mean and its (normally speaking) rareness of occurrence. Squaring the difference from the mean does this, as compared to values which have smaller deviations. Once all the variances are averaged, then it is OK to take the square root, which returns the units to their original dimensions.
