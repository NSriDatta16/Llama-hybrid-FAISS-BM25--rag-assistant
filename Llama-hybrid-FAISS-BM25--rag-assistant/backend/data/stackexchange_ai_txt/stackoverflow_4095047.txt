Creating an admin url for Magento that is admin.magentostore.com (not /admin)

I'm using some load balanced servers and have a requirement wherein all of my admin tasks are relegated to one server. We have determined that the best way to do this is a DNS entry for admin. to point to our primary server. The problem I am seeing is that all of the custom admin urls are all still magentostore.com/admin whereas I need admin.magentostore.com. Any ideas or has anyone done something similar? Thanks!
