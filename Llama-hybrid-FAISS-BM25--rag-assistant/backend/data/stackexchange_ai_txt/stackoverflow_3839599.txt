Open a local file from local html+js page

Is it possible to show a dialog box to let the user select a file on the local drive and then read its content from a local html page using js? Is it possible to save a file to a user chosen path? I'm planning to write a simple script to open file and encode its content inside images (not steganography, just the file's raw bytes). Thank you very much.
