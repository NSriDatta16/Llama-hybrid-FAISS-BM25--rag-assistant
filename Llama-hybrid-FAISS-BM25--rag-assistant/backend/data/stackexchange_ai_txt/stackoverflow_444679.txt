It can be more elegant, if the object that you throw, can hold the context information that tells you something about the nature of the error. Derive a throwable object from an istream, and you can use >> to stream information into it. teach the object how to display itself When you detect an error condition, in the level below, or N levels below. Fill up your object with good context information, and throw it. When you catch the object, tell it to display its context information to the log file, and/or the screen and/or whereever you want it to.
