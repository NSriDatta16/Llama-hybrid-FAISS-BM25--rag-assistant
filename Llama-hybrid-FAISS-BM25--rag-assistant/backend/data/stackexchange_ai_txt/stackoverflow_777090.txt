fastest way to store comment data python

Hi I have a small comment shoutbox type cgi process running on a server and currently when someone leaves a comment I simply format that comment into html i.e $title $comment and store in a flat file. Would it be faster and acceptably low in LOC to reimplement the storage in xml or json, in a simple spec of my own or stick with the simple html route?. I don't want to use relational database for this.
