Estimating $\mu$ from "completing the square"

I'm reading "Pattern recognition a machine learning" by Bishop ( link ). I need some mathematical help understanding ecuation 2.71. How do we obtain $\mu$ from "completing the square" on the exponent of a gaussian distribution (see the paragraph following equation 2.71). Thank & Regards
