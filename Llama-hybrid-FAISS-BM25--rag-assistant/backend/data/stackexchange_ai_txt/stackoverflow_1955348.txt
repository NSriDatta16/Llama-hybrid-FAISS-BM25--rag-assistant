Do not use CSS expressions. The reason: CSS expressions can be evaluated many hundreds of times per second. Especially considering that IE is not the fastest horse in the race, don't do that to the poor old browser. The average IE CSS expression is evaluated over one thousand times in the time the person views the page. What's more, it is just Javascript - it doesn't work if JS is off, creates the same garbage global variables, et al. So the gain is nill, the loss is high. Do not include JQuery just for this. But if it (or Mootools etc.) is included, use them by all means. Creating your function without JQ is simple and straightforward. Just have it run on page load and resize ( http://www.devarticles.com/c/a/JavaScript/OnReset-OnResize-and-Other-JavaScript-Events/1/ ) and that should do the trick. Use IE conditional comments and you are even valid. var dumbIE = function (){ //your stuff } onload=onresize=dumbIE;
