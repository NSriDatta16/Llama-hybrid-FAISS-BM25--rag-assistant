I have figured out a workaround, but am open to a more elegant solution. I edited the FilterUserControl.ascx.cs by inserting the following line in the Page_Init after PopulateListControl(DropDownList1); DropDownList1.SelectedIndex = DropDownList1.Items.IndexOf(DropDownList1.Items.FindByText("Bob")); // Username is hardcoded just for test This seems to work but I would prefer using the custom Partial Entity Class with metadata to solve this if possible.
