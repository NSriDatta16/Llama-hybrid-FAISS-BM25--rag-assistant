Your summary of the problem is basically correct. I've implemented several systems that do this, and the odds of success are good. The way you tackle this will depend on the number of remote units you expect a single user to interact with. If each user will handle only one or two devices, it's plausible to implement the web server on the remote device. If each user handles many devices, consider centralising as much administration as possible. I've implemented this using Zenoss for data logging, and a custom control server. If the web server sits on the remote device, you can either buy a SIM with a static IP, or use a proxy server. I recommend setting up a proxy server unless the number of devices is very small. There are three options for SIMs: Static IP with an address on the public Internet will be expensive, and negotiating the deal with each provider in each country will be irksome. No proxy server is required. Private APN SIMs will give you the option of a static address, but in a private address range. Negotiation with the mobile network is still required, and you will require a proxy server to sit between the public Internet and the private address range, Standard data SIMs will connect to the Internet through NAT. You can use these to host your service by opening a VPN connection (we used openvpn) to your server. You can now reach the devices directly by connecting to the same VPN, or through a proxy server. If you use openvpn, here are some more tips: Give each unit a public serial number, and a private key. Store these in the firmware of the unit, and in a central database. Put the public serial number on the outside of the unit. You can use an openvpn login script to ensure that a particular unit always appears at the correct IP address, which keeps the proxy configuration static. You can control openvpn's bandwidth usage by adjusting its keepalive behaviour, and how often it renegotiates. Measure and tune this before a large deployment. The NAT timeouts in the mobile networks are generally between 5 and 15 minutes. The device must send a packet to the server often enough to keep NAT alive. Cheap SIM deals may be web only with limited ports. Other tips: GPRS modem firmware can (rarely) crash internally. If your hardware supports it, provide software with the ability to power cycle the modem. Test your box in areas with poor coverage in your own country before you send out international shipments.
