Machine learning is mostly(if not all about) function approximations and besides what you've already sad in order to do that you have to understand fields like inferential statistics, information theory(look for Kullbackâ€“Leibler divergence, mutual information), which in turn require knowledge in probability distributions(gaussian distribution) and bayesian probability(conditional probability). Also, when thinking about techniques of dimensionality reduction and clusterization, most of them are all about linear algebra(decomposition methods like eigendecomposition and singular value decomposition).
