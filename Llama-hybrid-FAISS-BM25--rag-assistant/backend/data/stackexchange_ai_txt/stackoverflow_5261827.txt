I suggest to use a GUI when learning how to use a VCS, since they make it visual understandable what is going on under the hood. About the centralized versus distributed part: SVN is OK as long as you as you can place a reachable server somewhere (or use a public SVN hosting service). Also SVN is a must when you have unmergable files, when the lock-edit-commit workflow is needed (which non DVCS support). On the other hand DVCS have advantages: very fast information retrieval (log and annotate do not require a remote server) network connection only needed for clone, push and pull no central server needed (but possible when wanted), the repos can be connected ad-hoc
