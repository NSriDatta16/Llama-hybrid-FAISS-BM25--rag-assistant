I can't say why Safari is treating your images as attachments/downloads. I actually tested it in the latest Safari 4 on SL and it works OK. You could try sniffing the HTTP conversation and make sure no extra headers (e.g. content-disposition) are creeping in. Also it may pay to check over Safari config settings, maybe something subtle is different there to your other browsers? On the topic of performance: First I would try to eliminate the PHP altogether. See if you can leverage your webserver's modules/configuration to achieve your goal. If you can't do without the PHP, then you could try letting the webserver handle the actual delivery. You can do this in nginx with X-Accel-Redirect and in lighttpd and apache with X-Sendfile.
