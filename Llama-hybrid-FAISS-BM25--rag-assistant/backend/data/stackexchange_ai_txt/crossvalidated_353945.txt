why is the MSE error higher than MASE and MAPE?

I have a product price time series when I apply two models on them, I calculate all of MSE (Mean Squared Error), MASE (Mean Absolute Scaled Error), and MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error). I noticed that for method 1, the MASE and MAPE are larger than MASE and MAPE for method 2. However, the MSE is smaller than MASE for method 1. Why is the MSE higher than MASE and MAPE? Any suggestions? or recommendations? What is the best metric for evaluating the forecast?
