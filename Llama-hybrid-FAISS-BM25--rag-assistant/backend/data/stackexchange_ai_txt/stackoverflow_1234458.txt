Well if the code fragment you give above is literally what you are writing, then you are setting id to the text "myId". When you try to parse this as a Long it throws an exception because the string is not a valid number -- it doesn't contain any digits. I presume what you want to say is something more like frm.action="second.jsp?id="+myId Assuming that myId has been defined somewhere and is a number.
