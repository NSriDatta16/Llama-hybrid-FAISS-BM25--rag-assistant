Don't use a threshold at all. A logistic regression already outputs a probabilistic prediction - work directly with that. Assess whether it is good using proper scoring rules. Here is something I wrote about thresholds earlier. Whether your dataset is unbalanced or not won't matter. (Except that you will need a larger sample size than for balanced data.) That your recall is zero and no better than a dummy classifier's may simply mean that there is very little structure to your problem. Simple models are often surprisingly hard to beat.
