The standard way to handle this is to use the averages at each site as data, but to use weighted regression with weights equal to the sample size at each site. It doesn't look like you're going to find much of a trend, though. Regarding your concerns about independence, it isn't an issue unless you think there is dependence between individual trees at different sites. Otherwise, the sites are independent of one another, and so are their averages.
