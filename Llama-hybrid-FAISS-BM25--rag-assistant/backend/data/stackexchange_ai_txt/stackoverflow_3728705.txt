How do I include external JARs in my own Project JAR

I have a Java application and created a JAR file and deployed it. The App uses external JARs such as the Log4J JAR. When creating my JAR file, how do I include all external dependent JARs into my archive? In order to get my App working, I'm having to copy the Log4J JAR into the same directory as my own JAR which kinda defeats the purpose of the jar. Wouldn't it be more elegant to have 1 single JAR file to deploy?
