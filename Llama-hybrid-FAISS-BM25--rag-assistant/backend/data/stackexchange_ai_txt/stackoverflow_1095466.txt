Yes I think you could change this. It would require a bit of a work around to get it working. You would need to manually manage all requests. By making your own data requests. In this data request you can add a HTTPheader for User-Agent which will override the default headers. NSMutableURLRequest* urlRequest = [[[NSMutableURLRequest alloc] initWithURL:requestURL] autorelease]; [urlRequest setHTTPMethod: @"POST"]; [urlRequest setHTTPBody: [nvpString dataUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding]]; [urlRequest addValue:@"Your+User+Agent+String" forHTTPHeaderField:@"User-Agent"]; receivedData = [[NSMutableData alloc] retain]; [receivedData setLength:0]; [NSURLConnection connectionWithRequest: urlRequest delegate: self]; If you embed the Safari Web Browser in your app you can subscribe to its delegate methods. One of them will notify your application that safari would like to load a URL, this is where you catch this load and get the data your self. - (BOOL)webView:(UIWebView *)webView shouldStartLoadWithRequest:(NSURLRequest *)request navigationType:(UIWebViewNavigationType)navigationType{ now you put your code in here to do the data load. Once the data has loaded. Give it the data string back to the webView. I have set "baseURL:nil" but you might have to correctly set this to maybe the correct domain for this app. [webView loadHTMLString:newString baseURL:nil]
