I would suggest couple of things to look at to try to diagnose the issue: First thing to do is to monitor the state of connection pool during this lengthy lookups. This will allow you to find out whether problem is in actual retrieval of connections. Regardless of whether you properly close connections or not timing is also important. For example you could open a connection per user session and don't close it until it expires. Check your DB settings in order to find out if they are in par with your settings for connection pool. Check if you have locking on a level of database. This was the reason which bogged down pretty tuned application I worked with before. The issue was with audit record where user accessing the application was logged. Transactions timed out all the time as each of them accessed this record for update
