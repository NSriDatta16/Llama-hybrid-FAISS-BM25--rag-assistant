The best feature of VHDL â€” that it is used to design and implement hardware. :) The ability to have several different implementations (architectures) of a single interface, and exchange them easily. The same with OOP in C++: you can define one interface and many implementations. It is very useful in VHDL to create simulation and synthesis models for the same device. The low-overhead parallelism inherent to the language model. It sort of reminds me of dataflow languages. Actually, there is SystemC library to C++ which implements parallel execution semantics. You can easily download and try this: http://www.systemc.org . I'm working on C++-to-RTL synthesis. So I hope in 4-5 years all hardware development will be done using SystemC and C++.
