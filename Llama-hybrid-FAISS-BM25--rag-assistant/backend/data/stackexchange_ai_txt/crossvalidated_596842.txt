While the answer by Stephan gives a good overview of the bigger picture, I think the answer in the narrow sense is IMHO that No, zero-inflated logistic regression does not make much sense Why? Assume the true data-generating process is indeed a mixture of a Bernoulli distribution and a constant zero, specifically: $$ \begin{align} y_i &= \begin{cases} 0 & z_i = 0 \\ \bar{y}_i & z_i = 1 \end{cases}\\ \bar{y}_i &\sim \text{Bernoulli}(p_i)\\ z_i &\sim \text{Bernoulli}(\theta_i) \end{align} $$ Where both $p_i$ and $\theta_i$ are some function of some predictors (usually a logit-transformed linear predictor term). We can quickly see that the outcome is 1 if and only if both $z_i$ and $\bar{y}_i$ are 1, so $P(y_i = 1) = \theta_i p_i$ and thus simply $y_i \sim \text{Bernoulli}(\theta_i p_i)$ . This means $y_i$ can only give you information about the product $\theta_i p_i$ and cannot disentangle the individual contributions of the "logistic regression" and "zero inflation" components. unless you make strong restricting assumptions about the possible forms of predictors for $\theta_i$ and $p_i$ . (In theory, there is a very tiny difference as this "zero-inflated" formulation implies a slightly different link function and thus different behavior of continuous predictor terms than the logistic regression, but I think this is highly unlikely to be relevant to any practical analysis task). A similar line of reasoning applies to hurdle logistic regression. So standard logistic regression model is likely sensible, but it is known that maximum likelihood estimators can be biased when there is little information in the data (small sample size and/or rare events) and bias corrected methods such as Firth's correction (e.g. via logistf ) are thus likely to be preferred to R's glm or similar. The case would be different if you had zero inflation to a binomial response with more than one trial - then you could in fact at least in some cases learn something about the zero-inflation/hurdle component separately from the success probability.
