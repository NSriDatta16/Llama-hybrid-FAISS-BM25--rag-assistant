First off, your understanding of period/cycle length is correct. For hourly web traffic, I would expect the strongest seasonalities for cycles of length 24h (daily seasonality) and 168h (weekly seasonality - typically weekdays and weekends differ strongly). For instance, here is traffic to CV . You have already found our multiple-seasonalities tag. Its tag wiki contains pointers to literature and commonly used algorithms to model this. My impression is that most such specialized models are implemented in R, rather than Python, but I may be wrong about this. STL and ARIMA can only deal with a single seasonal period. Depending on your data, you may learn a little something from applying these models separately with the two seasonalities. (E.g., a very simple forecast would be to fit separate ARIMA models for the two seasonalities, then average the forecasts.)
