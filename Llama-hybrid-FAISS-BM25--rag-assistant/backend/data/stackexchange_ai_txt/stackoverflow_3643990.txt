In Grails how do I capture multiple selected items in g:select?

I have a Contact Domain class that can be associated with multiple Organizations, which are also domain classes. I want to use a multiple selection box to allow the user to select the organizations that are associated with the current contact. The selection box is populated with the available organizations. How do I assign the selected items to the organizations list in my Contact class? The above is what I am currently trying, and while it does populate the selection with organizations it doesn't seem to put the selected items in my organizations field. Thanks for any advice. Edit: Incorporated comments from krsjunk and omarello. Here's an abbreviated version of the domain classes. class Contact{ static searchable = true static mapping = { sort "lastName" } String firstName String lastName . . . static belongsTo = [organizations:Organization, projects:Project] } class Organization { static searchable = true static mapping = { sort "name" } String name static hasMany = [contacts:Contact] }
