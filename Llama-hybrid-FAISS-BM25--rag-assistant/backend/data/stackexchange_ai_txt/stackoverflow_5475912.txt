The OData endpoint exposed by WCF RIA Services does not support query operations and returns data as-is. That means no benefit from IQueryable, sorting, parameters, etc. It will simply expose your methods; end of story. There is rumor that this will change in the next release however. However, what RIA Services provides from the standpoint of IQueryable on service calls, automatic propagation of business rules from the middle tier to the UI, and INotifyDataErrorInfo for flowing validation errors to the Silverlight client is outstanding should you choose to leverage them.
