Evolution strategies in libsvm

I'm working on a protein multi-classification problem, using libsvm and the edit distance kernel. This kernel depends on a parameter $\gamma$. I'm able to get the best parameters ($\gamma$ and $C$) through grid search. But if I use a kernel that depends from 3 or more parameters, the grid search is computationally heavy, so I'm thinking about approaching the problem with an evolution strategy (for instance CMA-ES). Is there a way to do this in libsvm?
