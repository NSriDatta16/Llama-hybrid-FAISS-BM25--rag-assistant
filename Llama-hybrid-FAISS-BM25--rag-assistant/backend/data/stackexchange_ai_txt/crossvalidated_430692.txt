Sample selection bias is a common form of bias that arises, generally, through two means. Self-Selection Bias -- For instance, when assessing the average salary of recent college graduates, those with higher salaries are more likely to report. Analyst Selection Bias -- For instance, specifying spouses must remain married throughout the duration of a study to determine the efficacy of fertility treatments. The problem with sample selection bias is that fitted regression functions will confound the parameters of interest with the parameters of the function causing the selection bias (Heckman 1979) . The broad solution to this problem is to explicitly include the parameters of sample selection bias as regressors for the parameters of interest. Heckman introduced a framework for doing so, known as the Heckman Correction . The Heckman Correction, however, assumes a jointly normal distribution of the error terms between the model of interest and the model of selection bias. Logistic regression has no error terms , so the assumption of jointly normal error terms does not hold. Instead of correcting your samples for selection bias explicitly as attempted above, other options exist. Sampling -- If you know the true distribution of observations, then you can randomly sample from your observed distribution to match the true distribution. Upsampling underrepresented class using SMOTE Creating a less biased dataset -- If your selection bias arises from analyst selection bias, recreate the dataset while imposing minimal restraints on the form of the data.
