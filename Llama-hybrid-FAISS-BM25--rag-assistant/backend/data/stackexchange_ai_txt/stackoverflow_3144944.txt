This one was tough. The video player really did stick to the mouse and eat those mouse up events. However, here's my workaround: I check the internal Y coordinate of the mouse position during mouse over (adjustable value) and if it's outside of the range, I disable the drag-n-drop feature. I saw that the mousemove() event continued to fire when it was sticky, so that looked like an ideal access point for the logic: $(function () { $('.thumb') .draggable() .mousemove(function (e) { var yAxis = e.pageY - this.offsetTop; $(this).draggable("option", "disabled", (yAxis > 150) ? true : false); }); });
