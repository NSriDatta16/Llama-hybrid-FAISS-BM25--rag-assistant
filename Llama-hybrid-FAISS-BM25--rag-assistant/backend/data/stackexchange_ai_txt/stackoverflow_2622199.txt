The main need for a 64 bit processor is to address more memory - and that is the driving force to switch to 64 bit. On 32 bit systems, you can really only address 4Gb of RAM, at least per process. 4Gb is not much. 64 bits give you an address space of several petabytes.(though, a lot of current 64 bit hardware can address "only" 48 bits - thats still enough to support 256 terrabytes of ram though). Upping the natural integer sizes for a processor does not automatically make it "better" though. There are tradeoffs. With 128bit you'd need twice as much storage(registers/ram/caches/etc.) compared to 64 bit for common data types - with all the drawback that might have - more ram needed to store data, more data to transmit = slower, wider buses might requires more physical space/perhaps more power, etc.
