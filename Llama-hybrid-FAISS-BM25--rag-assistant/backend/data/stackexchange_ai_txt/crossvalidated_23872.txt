Most regularised linear models can be kernelised to give a non-linear equivalent. I made a MATLAB toolbox (sorry no manual yet) implementing the Generalised Kernel Machine, which is just a kernelisation of the generalised linear model. I rather like kernel logistic regression (implemented in the toolbox) as an alternative to the SVM as for many problems, you do actually want a probabilistic output. None of this is wildly novel, but I have found it useful, it has code for optimising the kernel and regularization parameters via approximate leave-one-out cross-validation). For details, see G. C. Cawley, G. J. Janacek and N. L. C. Talbot, Generalised kernel machines, in Proceedings of the IEEE/INNS International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN-2007), pages 1732-1737, Orlando, Florida, USA, August 12-17, 2007.
