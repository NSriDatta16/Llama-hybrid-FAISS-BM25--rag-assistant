Problem with paired t-test t value

I sucessfully find the standard error of difference, but can't get the t value right. According to this calculator , I am supposed to get a sd of 0.092, which I do. But for some reason, when I do $t = \bar{d} / (sd / \sqrt{11} $ I get 11 instead of 3.xxx Here is the answer, but I can't figure what I've done wrong about the t calculation. Answer: Let μ = μ1 − μ2 = μwithout − μwith = the difference between the average completion times of the puzzle. Hypotheses are: H0 :μ = 0 vs Ha: μ Using paired t-procedure, t =-3.49 and p-value
