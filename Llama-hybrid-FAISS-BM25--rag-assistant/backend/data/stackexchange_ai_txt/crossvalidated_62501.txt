My interpretation is as follows and someone please correct me if my explanation is not useful. Factor analysis is a good tool to reduce dimensions when you are also interested in latent variables assessed by those factors. For example, perhaps I could reduce the number of items in a measure that assesses depression (a latent construct). Principal component analysis is useful when you want to do dimension reduction and you are less interested in latent factors. For example, perhaps you want to merely use two or three factors out of eight that best "captures" what the eight factors measure. In this case you are less interested in how these factors do or do not measure a latent construct. There are many resources explaining the mathematical differences between these methods, but hopefully this can be useful. Tabachnick & Fidell wrote the following: If you are interested in a theoretical solution uncontaminated by unique and error variability and have designed your study on the basis of underlying constructs that are expected to produce scores on your observed variables, FA is your choice. If, on the other hand, you simply want an empirical summary of the data set, PCA is the better choice. Tabachnick, B. G. & Fidell, L. S. (2007). Using multivariate statistics (5th ed.).
