Try this in a source file, with a gcc enough recent it should avoid developers using these both functions. #pragma GCC poison gmtime #pragma GCC poison strtok The downside of it is that it is only valid for one compilation unit. If you use precompiled headers (which you surely do if your project is big), you could put them there. At least this solution does not involve decorating function declarations in system headers and works at compile time. Poison is maybe a bit hard as it produces errors and not warnings. Does anyone know how to weaken it? At least it is a nice way to enforce a DO NOT USE FUNCTION xxx policy.
