There is an inferential issue here because of the related proportions. If you set up the data as a $137 \times 5$ matrix of ones and zeroes then the natural way to compare columns is the McNemar test. Since this only uses the discordant pairs and ignores those which are 1 in both columns or 0 in both columns it is quite likely that the comparison of any given pair of columns will be based on a different subset of the data. Whether this matters is a matter for discussion with the client. An overall model using GEE or a mixed effects logistic regression could be followed by tests between the coefficients for pairs of columns although the subset issue is still there.
