If I have a time series forecast density that is bi-modal, does that mean that my data is heteroscedastic?

The title pretty much explains it already: If I have enough data points that I can plot my entire forecast density and it ends up looking like this, does it mean that it is heteroscedastic and I should be using GARCH and volatility modeling and not just straight up ARIMA or Holt-Winters?
