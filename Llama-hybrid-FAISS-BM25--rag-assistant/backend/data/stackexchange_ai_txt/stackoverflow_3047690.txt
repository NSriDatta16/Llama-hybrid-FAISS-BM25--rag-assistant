503 server response for Googlebot

I put an .htaccess file in my webroot with the following contents RewriteBase / RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} ^.*(Googlebot|Googlebot|Mediapartners|Adsbot|Feedfetcher)-?(Google|Image)? [NC] RewriteRule .* /var/www/503.html This website is in maintenance mode, and I don't want anything indexed yet. I tested the code with a firefox User-Agent switcher plugin, and looking at the access log it shows this at the end of each log entry, but watching in TamperData or Firebug, it still returns a 200 server response instead of a 503. What am I doing wrong? "Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Googlebot/2.1; +http://www.google.com/bot.html)" contents of /var/www/503.html 503 - Service temporary unavailable 503 - Service temporary unavailable Sorry, this website is currently down for maintainance please retry later :::EDIT::: Added small snippet from the rewrite.log Here is a small sample, I went thru the entire log, and everything is referring to a javascript or image file: 172.16.173.26 - - [15/Jun/2010:15:03:31 --0500] [qa-test.com/sid#2b6c1c8ba938][rid#2b6c24cfdd18/initial] (4) [perdir /var/www/qa-test.com/web/] RewriteCond: input='' pattern='^.*(Googlebot|Googlebot|Mediapartners|Adsbot|Feedfetcher)-?(Google|Image)?' [NC] => not-matched
