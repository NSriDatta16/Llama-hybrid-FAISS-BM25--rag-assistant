No, the color is just an aesthetic aspect of the spectrograms. A grayscale spectrogram contains all of the relevant information in its pixel intensities. You can tell because in most application you can select the colormap yourself (i.e. if you want the intensities to take shades of red, greed, blue, purple, etc.). I can personally confirm this as I've successfully trained CNNs on grayscale spectrograms!
