Ok, I think you want a model that has two sets of non-nested levels: you want a random physician effect and a random hospital effect. Whether it's a hierarchical model or not depends on your definition (and, I suppose, software), but it's a reasonably straightforward mixed model. For example, in R's lme4 you could have a model specified by y~x1+x+x3+x4+(1|physician)+(1|hospital) where x1 - x4 are predictors that could be at the patient or physician or hospital level and physician and hospital distinguish the physicians and hospitals You could also describe the same model as a Bayesian linear or generalised linear model with a shrinkage prior on the doctor and physician factors and flat or weakly informative priors on the coefficients of $x_1\dots x_4$ ; you could fit it with Stan or JAGS, and probably with one of the more user-friendly interfaces like rstanarm or brms I don't know if any of the software that describes mixed models hierarchically and uses maximum likelihood will fit these non-nested models (eg HLM ) will fit these models, but someone else might comment.
