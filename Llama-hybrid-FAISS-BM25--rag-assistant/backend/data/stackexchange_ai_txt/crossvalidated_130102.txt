VC dimension of a rectangle

The book "Introduction to Machine learning" by Ethem AlpaydÄ±n states that the VC dimension of an axis-aligned rectangle is 4. But how can a rectangle shatter a set of four collinear points with alternate positive and negative points?? Can someone explain and prove the VC dimension of a rectangle?
