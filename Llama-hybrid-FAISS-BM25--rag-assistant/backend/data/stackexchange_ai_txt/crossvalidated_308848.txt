Transfer learning on faster rcnn and tensorflow

I am trying to do transfer learning to reuse a pretrained neural net. I got the tensorflow faster rcnn official example to work, and now i would like to reuse it to detect my own classes. This is the repo im using https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection I have a dataset of ~2k images with 2 different classes. Just .JPG images in two different folders. I could successfully do some transfer learning with this dataset on a CNN, using the official example of tensorflow. https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflow-for-poets/#1 I am trying to understand how to do the same with this faster rcnn. Has anyone done it? I am a bit lost, can anyone give me a hint? Thanks!
