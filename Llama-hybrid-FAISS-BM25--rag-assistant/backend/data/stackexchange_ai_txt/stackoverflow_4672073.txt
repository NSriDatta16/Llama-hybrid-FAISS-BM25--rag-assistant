Export to Excel doesnt work on IE under SSL (https)

I've been trying to fix something on a secure website (https) which is an Export to Excel button that generates a CSV file. It works on Firefox, Chrome , etc... but not in Internet Explorer. I have changed the headers eliminating the no-cache and also edited the IIS http header configuration setting an expiration date of 1 day. I have no idea of what can be going on and how to solve it. Do you guys have any idea of how to fix this stuff ? I've read so many posts and they're all saying the same thing... caching. Thanks, UPDATE 1 : regarding the error I receive, I receive an IE Alert saying "Internet explorer cannot download filename.aspx from web.address.com Internet Explorer was not able to open this Internet site. The requested site is either unavailable or cannot be found. Please try again later. As I said, it all works out of SSL (https), but the export to excel button, breaks in https. UPDATE 2: I'm using these headers: Response.ClearContent(); Response.Clear(); Response.Buffer = true; Response.AddHeader("content-disposition", "attachment; filename=" + name.Trim() + ".csv"); Response.AddHeader("Cache-Control", "no-cache"); Response.AddHeader("Pragma", "public"); Response.AddHeader("Content-Transfer-Encoding", "binary"); Response.AddHeader("Content-Length", "2026"); Response.Charset = ""; //Response.ContentType = "application/vnd.ms-excel"; Response.ContentType = "text/csv";
