JPA get id of entity object

Does anyone know how I can do the equivalent of this in hibernate: session.getIdentifier(instance); with JPA? EntityManager has a contains method but that's pretty much it! I'm writing some code that acts as a transformer between entities and data stored in a session (so rather than a serialized object being stored just the class name and the id is stored).
