If you want those sort of rich controls, then some kind of JSF framework is the way to go. The standard JSF framework is rather poorly designed and inelegant, though. You should have a look at JBoss Seam as an alternative. It's a top-to-bottom web framework that uses EJB3 and JSF, and it's pretty well integrated, making JSF a lot easier than it would otherwise be. It's not Spring-based, though, so if your heart is set on Spring, then you need to look at other JSF implementations such as RichFaces . Spring WebFlow probably isn't necessary for you at all, so I;d ignore that unless you have a good reason.
