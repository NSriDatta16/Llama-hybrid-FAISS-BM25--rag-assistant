What is the stop criteria of generative adversarial nets?

I have used the GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) with a binary cross-entropy loss function (in both generator and discriminator). Throughout the training step, the variation of generator loss and discriminator loss for 400 epochs as following: Does this variation look like correct? What is the stop criteria of gans if we use the loss function values? Can I use early stopping?
