Accessing a bean with a dot(.) in its ID

In a flow definition, I am trying to access a bean that has a dot in its ID (example: However, it does not work. SWF tries to find a bean "bus" instead. Initially, I got over it by using a helper bean to load the required bean, but the solution is inelegant and uncomfortable. The use of alias'es is also out of the question since the beans are part of a large system and I cannot tamper with them. In a nutshell, none of the solution allowed me to refernce the bean directly by using its original name. Is that even possible in the current SWF release?
