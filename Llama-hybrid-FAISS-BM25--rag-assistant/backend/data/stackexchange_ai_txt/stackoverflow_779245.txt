Repetition of group patterns in a regex pattern

So, folks, I have this self crafted pattern that works. After some hours (I am no regex guru) this puppy evolved to parse curl PUT output for me: ^\s*([^ ]+)\s+([^ ]+)\s+([^ ]+)\s+([^ ]+)\s+([^ ]+)\s+([^ ]+) \s+([^ ]+)\s+([^ ]+)\s+([^ ]+)\s+([^ ]+)\s+([^ ]+)\s+([^ ]+) (CR in text only for formatting) It gives me 'groups' that I access--it works! Yet the coder in me sees the repetition of a pattern, and it bugs the frack out of me. I've seen perl how-small-is-your-pattern contests over the years that makes me think this could be much smaller. But my attempts to slap a * in it have failed miserably. So, The Question Is : how do write this pattern in a more concise way so that I can still pull out my target groups? It probably doesn't matter, but here are the groups I am after: $1: percent finished $2: size uploaded so far $6: size to upload $8: average upload rate Update: Further background can by found on a blog post of mine ( How to configure OnMyCommand to generate a progress bar for curl ) that will explain what I am doing and why I am after only a regex pattern. I'm not actually coding in a language, per se ...but configuring a tool to use a regex.
