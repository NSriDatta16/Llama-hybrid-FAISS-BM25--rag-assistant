Variational autoencoders optimize only a lower bound on the likelihood, since the likelihood itself is intractable, so there is no easy way to calculate the likelihood. However, Appendix D of the original paper, Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes by Diederik P Kingma and Max Welling, suggests how one might approximately estimate $p(x)$ when the latent space is low dimensional.
