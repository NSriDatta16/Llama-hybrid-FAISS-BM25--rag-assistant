Covariance of ARMA(2,1) series

Consider the ARMA(2,1) time series $$ x_t−0.1x_{t−1}−0.06x_{t−2}=w_t−0.5w_{t−1} , $$ where $w_t$ is white noise with mean zero and variance $\sigma^2_w$. Find the expectation of $$ (x_t−0.1x_{t−1}−0.06x_{t−2})x_{t−h}, \quad h=0,1,... $$ and $$ (w_t−0.5w_{t−1})x_{t−h}, \quad h=0,1,... $$ and show how this can be used to formulate a difference equation to determine the covariance $γ(h)=E[x_{t+h}x_t]$. I'm using the book 'Time Series Analysis and Its Applications' Third Edition by Shumway and Stoffer. But can't find the relevant examples to draw on.
