Is the expected value of a RV same as the mean of the corresponding pdf?

As we know the expectation of a RV $X$ or a function, say $g(X)$ , of $X$ , both with pdf $p_{X}(x)$ is $$ \begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {X \sim {p_X}(x):}&{E[X] = \int {x.{p_X}(x)dx} }\\ {g(X) \sim {p_X}(x):}&{E[X] = \int {g(x).{p_X}(x)dx} } \end{array} $$ So my question is, can we say that When $X$ is just an argument the mean of pdf $p(x)$ is the same as the expected value of $X$ , i.e. $E[X]$ ; but for a function of this RV ,say $g(X)$ , it is not true. Also as mentioned in this topic : "The expectation is the average value or mean of a random variable not a probability distribution." So in general: The expected value of a RV is not always the same as the mean of the corresponding pdf. Is my interpretation correct?
