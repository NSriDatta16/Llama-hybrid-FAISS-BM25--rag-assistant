Word2vec only creates vector representations of words, full stop. It is not a classifier. If you want to classify the text documents, you'll need to choose a way to represent your sequence of word2vec word vectors to a classification algorithm. One option is to compute summary vectors (element-wise mean, max, min, etc.) from the word2vec vectors. These summaries are useful because they create a fixed-length representation of the documents that can be used in a standard classifier (SVM, random forest, etc). More ornate methods include using recurrent neural networks or transformer networks applied to the sequence of word vectors within each document.
