Compare grid predictions

I am interested in methods to compare "predictions" of an inhomogeneous Poisson process, against "sparse" data. The model I have is that of inhomogeneous Poisson process , say on the unit square $[0,1]^2$, with intensity function $I(x,y)$. We can factor $I$ as $I(x,y) = \mu f(x,y)$ where $\mu$ is the overall rate of the process (which I am not so interested in) and $f$ is a probability density. I have various methods which produce a finite probability distribution in the form of a grid / matrix of size $N\times M$ say. The value in cell $(i,j)$ is meant to be an estimate of the integral of $f$ over that cell. I then wish to "score" these predictions against a realisation of the process, say points $(x_i, y_i)_{i=1}^n$. Typically $n$ is small, much smaller than $NM$. I don't really know how to go about this: Should I bin points, assigning $(x_i, y_i)$ to the cell it occurs in? That would seem to lose information for an event which occurs near the boundary of a cell. I could take a Bayesian approach, perhaps, and compute Bayes Factors. This is the same as computing likelihoods in this case. This doesn't seem to take much account of the geometry of the problem.
