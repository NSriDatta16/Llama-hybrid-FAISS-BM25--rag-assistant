If the objective is to read the data from a url You can do it from the server side itself. You can do the same using the WebClient class. WebClient client = new WebClient (); client.Headers.Add ("user-agent", "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.2)"); Stream data = client.OpenRead ("http://yoururl.com"); StreamReader reader = new StreamReader (data); string s = reader.ReadToEnd (); If the objective is to fetch some data from the client side and save it in the server Then you might need to write some javascript at client side to fetch the html, and send it to the server over an ajax/normal postback and then store it from there You might need some javascript to acheive this. If you want to fetch the IFrame content, do something like var range = myiFrameName.document.selection.createRange(); var str = range.text; //Code to postback Also, have a look at this http://www.webreference.com/js/column12/final.html Trust this helps
