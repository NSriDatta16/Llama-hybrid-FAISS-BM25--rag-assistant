If those images are your content, you should not combine them like this : yes, having 10 separate images can take some time to load, but, if that's your content : those images will most likely be big anyway your users will want the possiblity to right click on them, and select "save as", and things like that. those images are important ; which means they must have an alt text those images should not be set as background, and should use an img tag depending on how your website is organized, maybe you could put some kind of pre-fetching solution in place ? For instance, if you are displaying a galery of photos (With "previous" and "next" buttons) , when a user is watching image 2, there are high chances he'll then click on "next" to see image 3 -- which means you could pre-fetch that one while he's watching image 2, so image 3 seems to be displayed faster when he clicks "next" If those images are not your content, and are just buttons icons and stuff like that : you don't have to care much about the alt text, I would say they are probably used as background for a link or such ? If so, the "right" solution, I suppose, would be to put your "alt" text as text for the links. As a sidenote, you might gain a few bytes (depending on your images) with ideas such as : encoding them as 8 bits PNG instead of 24 bits PNG that's often enough for screenshots, for instance, depending on the colors you are using in your images it can divide the image size by more than 2 ! But if your original image has rich colors, it will break it ; which means you have to decide on a per-image basis There are tools that can re-encode PNG and/or strip not-useful data (see pngcrush or optipng , for instance) You can probably find equivalents for jpg and/or gif, I suppose
