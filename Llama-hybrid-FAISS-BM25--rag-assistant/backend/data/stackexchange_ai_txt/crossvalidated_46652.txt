Ranking players over multiple categories

I am currently in the process of trying to work out a ranking system for players using a dataset of players within the English Premier League. I have a number of statistics to work with but have decided that the following are the ones I want to use: Minutes Pass % Goals Shots on Target Attempts Created Net Tackles Clean Sheets Save % Fouls Won Discipline Of course within the game of Football there are different types of players which I am defining as: Goalkeepers Defenders Midfielders Forwards I am not a stats buff by any means and have spent most of the last few days in Excel with these data trying to work out a means of ranking all of the players. I have tried looking into a number of methods of ranking the players but none seem to give a good enough result; I think during my investigations I have in fact been rewarding the most average players (i.e. the players which can score a good average score in most categories but excel in none). I have also looked at weighting the categories as, for example, Goalkeepers only score in a few of the categories but are still valuable players. What I am trying to get to is to produce a ranking system that would allow me to create a team based on a 4-4-2 formation which would be unbeatable in the categories defined above with any other combination of players from the dataset. I am not sure if this is possible. It would be helpful if someone could help point me in the right direction of papers of formulas that might work for what I am looking at.
