Before you get carried away hacking the dialog, consider a simple solution first that leverages the FileOk event. Create a form named, say, frmPreview. Give it a constructor that takes a string. You'll need a Cancel and an OK button and code to play the file. Display that form like this: var dlg = new OpenFileDialog(); // Set other dlg properties... dlg.FileOk += (s, cancel) => { using (var prev = new frmPreview(dlg.FileName)) { if (prev.ShowDialog() != DialogResult.OK) cancel.Cancel = true; } }; if (dlg.ShowDialog(this) == DialogResult.OK) { // use the file //... } Now, whenever the user clicks Open, your preview form shows up. The user can click Cancel and pick another file from the dialog.
