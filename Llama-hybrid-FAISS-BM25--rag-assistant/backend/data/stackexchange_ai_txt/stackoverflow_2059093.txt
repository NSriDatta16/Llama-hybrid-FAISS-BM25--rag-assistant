I know I am late here, and you must already have what you are looking for, but I wanted to provide my inputs as well for anyone visiting this topic. I generally never use OR, unless I encounter an environment where Descriptive Programming is a no-go. Just recently, I worked with a Mainframe Front-End GUI application that has absolutely no naming convention for objects. If you choose to use Descriptive Programming with such an application, the only way to work with its objects would be through Index or Location Ordinal Identifiers, which is not the best course of action considering 100's of objects in each pane. So, the answer to your question really depending upon the environment and your experience with OR and DP. Most people I have worked with at my job, and on online communities prefer to work with Descriptive Programming whenever its feasible. However, I have also seen people work wonders with OR. I have a few code samples, but, unfortunately, they are deal with Descriptive Programming. For instance, the following article talks about creating modular VBScript classes to divide application's functionality into small manageable components: http://relevantcodes.com/qtp-using-classes-as-test-modules-i/ Similarly, this article shows how Descriptive Programming can be used to verify multiple properties of target objects through a single block of code: http://relevantcodes.com/qtp-verify-multiple-object-properties-an-elegant-approach/ Also, a demo framework is also available for you to view here: http://relevantcodes.com/relevantcodes1one-qtp-automation-framework/ The framework is built completely on the principles of Descriptive Programming, but in the next release, some functionality will be added that will enable users to work with ORs as well.
