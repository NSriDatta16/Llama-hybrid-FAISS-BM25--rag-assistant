My thoughts so far: We can work with the standard normal; the general case will follow immediately from that. (Please note that my original argument here was wrong; I neglected some terms that I failed to recognize were functions of $n$ ) I think the median and the midrange should be asymptotically uncorrelated as should the midhinge and the midrange, but at small sample sizes are clearly dependent. The midhinge and the median will still be substantively correlated asymptotically. I think the asymptotic correlation matrix of the three quartiles $Q = (Q_1,Q_2,Q_3)^\top$ should be $$C= \left[ \begin{array}{ccc} 1 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} & \frac13 \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} & 1 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \\ \frac13 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} & 1 \end{array} \right]$$ By symmetry, at a fixed sample size we should be looking at a function of the median, the midhinge and the midrange $-$ here I am ignoring, as Wikipedia does in its article on the midhinge, distinction between hinges and sample quartiles. Asymptotically the median and midhinge will combine linearly (due to their joint normality)^[1]. I'll denote these by $M$ (rather than the $Q_2$ used above), $\bar{H}=\frac{Q_1+Q_3}{2}$ and $\bar{R}=\frac{X_{(1)}+X_{(n)}}{2}$ respectively. $\bar{R}$ will not be normally distributed, but will be symmetric. (Indeed, asymptotically, for samples from normal populations, the midrange should converge to a logistic with mean $\mu$ , but it does seem to come in fairly slowly. Simulations suggest that around $n=2001$ the approximation looks fairly reasonable and by $n=10001$ it seems to be an excellent approximation - the ecdf is extremely close to a logistic - though a logistic Q-Q plot does still have a small degree of wiggle even then, though that's not surprising) The asymptotic variance of $(1-q)M+q\bar{H}=u^\top Q$ (where $u=(\frac{q}{2}, (1-q), \frac{q}{2})^\top$ ) should be $u^\top Vu$ , where $V$ is the variance-covariance matrix of $Q$ . Hence we should be able to write down the $q$ that will minimize that asymptotic variance. As sample size increases the contribution of the midrange should decrease, since the variance of the midrange decreases more slowly as a function of n than the other order statistics. Indeed, from the data in Tippett (1925)[2], and via simulation, the expected value of both the sample maximum and the range at large sample sizes seems to be progressing close to linearly in $\log(n)$ , and similarly with the precision of the maximum (and by symmetry, the minimum); asymptotically the variance of the midrange should be proportional to the variance of the maximum. Even though it likely won't be quite optimal I'll focus on considering linear combinations of all three statistics, since the contribution of the midrange will be less less and less critical in large samples. In short, the estimator $(1-q-r)M+q\bar{H}+r\bar{R}$ for suitably chosen $q$ and $r$ (each is constant for a fixed $n$ , but each changes as a function of $n$ ) should be quite close to optimal at all but perhaps quite small $n$ ; this simple linear functional of the statistics should perform quite well in general. At $n=5$ , the contribution of all five order statistics should be the same -- it's just the average of the five observations. So $q=r=0.4$ there. As $n$ increases, we should expect that $q$ asymptotes to a constant, but given the variance behavior of the midrange, we should expect that $r$ asymptotes down to $0$ . We could compute asymptotic weights on $M$ and $\bar{H}$ using the asymptotic variance-covariance matrix of the corresponding order statistics. This should provide a useful reasonableness check on any estimate for $q(n)$ as $n$ grows large. One approach to getting the coefficients for this not-quite-efficient estimator would be to use simulation to choose approximate $q$ and $r$ at a range of finite $n$ above $n=5$ $-$ given the estimator will be unbiased, we're presumably just trying to minimize variance, so we're looking for reasonably a smooth additive functions $q(n)$ and $r(n)$ that minimize variance. We know that $q$ should increase from $0.4$ to the asymptotic value and $r$ should (slowly) decrease from $0.4$ downward toward $0$ . However, simulation shouldn't be required; since we're minimizing the variance, and the estimator is linear in a set of order statistics, we should be able to proceed to get coefficients that minimize variance directly from the variance-covariance matrix of the relevant order statistics. edit: It should be noted that the functions of $n$ will not be smooth unless one focuses separately on the $n$ being $0,1,2,3$ $\mod 4$ . I'll have to come back to this, so I'll post what I have for now but I believe this is a good outline of a reasonable way to proceed. I'll be surprised if someone hasn't already performed this exercise or one very close to it, to be honest. I'll see what I can turn up. [Edit: Jacob mentions Luo's paper in a comment under kjetil's answer, which suggests an estimator of exactly the form suggested here -- a linear-weighted average of median, midhinge and midrange, where the weights are functions of $n$ . As Henry points out in comments, that paper is for estimating a sample mean rather than the population mean, but it's interesting to see the same form of estimator come up.] [1]: To clarify; at a given $n$ , the $q$ is purely a constant. We can write down its form explicitly; if $u=(q/2,1-q,q/2)^\top$ then we seek to minimize $\operatorname{var}(u'V)=u'Vu$ where $V=\operatorname{var}(Q)$ , the covariance matrix of the "quartiles" (or we can write it directly in terms of $(q,1-q)$ and the covariance matrix of $(M,\bar{H})$ ; it makes one step easier and another step harder). Either way, it's a quadratic in $q$ bounded to $[0,1]$ (the more general case is a simple quadratic programming problem with linear constraints). We can work out the elements of $V$ at the given $n$ and find the $q$ to minimize the quadratic, and then check it's between the endpoints (checking the variance at the $q=0$ and $q=1$ values themselves is simple, since we already compute those along the way). The elements of $V$ can be found from the joint distribution of the involved order statistics. Asymptotically in the normal case, when the quartiles are all individual order statistics this involves products of terms like $\phi(\Phi^{-1}(p))$ for specific $p$ with $0 . In small samples there's integrals to compute (or tables, or approximations might be used). If you want to write $q$ as a function of $n$ , the exact form will be complicated, but suitable approximations should be possible. [2]: L. H. C. Tippett (1925).
