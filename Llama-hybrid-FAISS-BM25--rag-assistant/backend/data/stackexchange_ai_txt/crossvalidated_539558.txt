individuals of average size ( EX=0 ) and 'average' Sex ( Sex=0 ) have a fitted/predicted Ratio of -0.014 (unless you are dealing with some system where there are lots of intersex individuals, the intercept is a bit hard to interpret) for individuals of average size ( EX=0 ), a 1-unit increase in Sex (e.g. a change from female to male or vice versa?) is associated with a 0.027-unit decrease in Ratio (main effect of Sex = -0.027) for 'average' Sex individuals (Sex=0), individuals decrease in Ratio by 0.034 for every increase of 1 unit in EX (main effect of EX = -0.034) EX has a different effect on individuals with a greater value of Sex; an increase of 1 unit in sex (e.g. male â†’ female or vice versa?) causes an increase in slope with respect to EX of 0.125 units Alternatively, the interaction can be interpreted as "an increase of 1 unit in EX causes an increase of 0.125 in the effect of Sex" The emmeans package can help you make sense of this stuff. Drawing pictures (e.g. with sjPlot::plot_model ) also helps.
