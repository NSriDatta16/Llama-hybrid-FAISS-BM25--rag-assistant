First of all: yes: standardization is a must unless you have a strong argument why it is not necessary. Probably try z scores first. Discrete data is a larger issue. K-means is meant for continuous data. The mean will not be discrete, so the cluster centers will likely be anomalous. You have a high chance that the clustering algorithms ends up discovering the discreteness of your data, instead of a sensible structure. Categorical variables are worse. K-means can't handle them at all; a popular hack is to turn them into multiple binary variables (male, female). This will however expose above problems just at an even worse scale, because now it's multiple highly correlated binary variables. Since you apparently are dealing with survey data, consider using hierarchical clustering. With an appropriate distance function, it can deal with all above issues. You just need to spend some effort on finding a good measure of similarity. Cluster 3.0 - I have never even seen it. I figure it is an okay choice for non data science people. Probably similar to other tools such as Matlab. It will be missing all the modern algorithms, but it probably has an easy to use user interface.
