Input layer in Neural Network with different vocabulary size

I want to build a Neural Network where each neuron in the input layer will have different size. For instance, x1 = [0 1 0], x2 = [13 4 5 1 9 0], x3 = 7... Would it be possible to train this model? What should I change from a normal size neural network? Would it be better fill with zeros to the maximum size?
