P values and t statistics?

I performed an experiment using two different methods on same object, the results of the experiments were Method 1 70,72,70,75 and 77% Method 2 80,81,67,75 and 82% On basis on average I claimed that method 2 performs well. But I am asked to provide p values or t-statistics to confirm the results , how can I do that ?
