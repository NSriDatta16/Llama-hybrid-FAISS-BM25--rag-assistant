The key is that we don't have any information that will help us with the next event (gambler's fallacy), because the next event isn't dependent on the previous event. We can make a reasonable guess about how a series of trials will go. This reasonable guess is the average aka our expected mean result. So when we watch a deviation in the mean trend back toward the mean, over time/trials, then we witnessing a regression to the mean. As you can see regression to the mean is an observed series of actions , it isn't a predictor. As more trials are conducted things will more closely approximate a normal/Gaussian distribution. This means that I'm not making any assumptions or guess on what the next result will be. Using the law of large numbers I can theorize that even though things might be trending one way currently, over time things will balance themselves out. When they do balance themselves out the result set has regressed to the mean. It is important to note here that we aren't saying that future trials are dependent on past results. I'm merely observing a change in the balance of the data. The gambler's fallacy as I understand it is more immediate in it's goals and focuses on prediction of future events. This tracks with what a gambler desires. Typically games of chance are tilted against the gambler over the long term, so a gambler wants to know what the next trial will be because they want to capitalize on this knowledge. This leads the gambler to falsely assume that the next trial is dependent on the previous trial. This can lead to neutral choices like: The last five times the roulette wheel landed on black, so therefore next time I'm betting big on red. Or the choice can be self-serving: I've gotten a full house the last 5 hands, so I'm going to bet big because I'm on a winning streak and can't lose. So as you can see there are few key differences: Regression to the mean doesn't assume that independent trials are dependent like the gambler's fallacy. Regression to the mean is applied over a large amount of data/trials, where the gambler's fallacy is concerned with the next trial. Regression to the mean describes what has already taken place. Gambler's fallacy attempts to predict the future based on an expected average, and past results.
