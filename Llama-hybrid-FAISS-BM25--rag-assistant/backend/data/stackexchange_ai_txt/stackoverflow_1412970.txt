How can I get the average and standard deviations grouped by key?

I've need to find the average and standard deviation of a large amount of data in this format. I tried using Excel but there doesn't appear to be an easy way to transpose the columns. What am I missing in Excel or should I just use Perl? Input file format is: 0 123 0 234 0 456 1 657 1 234 1 543 Want result to group the averages and standard deviations by the values in the first column: 0 AvgOfAllZeros StdDevOfALlZeros 1 AvgOfAllOnes StdDevOfAllOnes
