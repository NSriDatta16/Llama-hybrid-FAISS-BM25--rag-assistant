Examples for One class SVM in R

I am trying to do one-class SVM in R. I have been trying to use e1071/ksvm kernlab package. But I am not sure if I am doing it correctly. Is there any working example for one-class SVM in R? Also, I am giving a big matrix of predictors as X. Since its supposed to be one-class, is the assumption that all training data I gave forms 'positive' class? If so, we don't have to give the labels 'Y'? The predicted labels given as output are True/False. So I am assuming, True is 'positive' class. Edit: Attaching sample code. Here I sampled 60% of 'TRUE' class and I tested on the full data set. library(e1071) library(caret) data(iris) iris$SpeciesClass[iris$Species=="versicolor"]
