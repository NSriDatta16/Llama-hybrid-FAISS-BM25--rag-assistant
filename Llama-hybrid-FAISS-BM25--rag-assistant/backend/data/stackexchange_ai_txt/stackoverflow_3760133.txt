It's just a convention, for example: jquery.lightbox.js prototype.lightbox.js If you just had this and were using both, well, you see where confusion sets in: lightbox.js Also, you might be using just vanilla JavaScript function files, and not want those to have a prefix, e.g. editor.js , denoting it has no reliance on jQuery at all...it's all around organization and maintainability.
