Development software - How common is it for developers to buy it for personal use

Edit: The answer is yes, pretty common. The Microsoft TechNet is one of best deals (except it does not have Visual Studio). So MSDN generally is a better choice. Thank you Hello All, I was recently looking at prices of Microsoft Visual Studio, SQL server and MSDN subscription. I never considered it necessary to buy it for personal use, until this year. For some reason it is not possible to get any new hardware, operating systems or development tools at my work. Everything I can use for self-training of pet projects is on average 5-10 years old. So I am seriously thinking of buying my personal software. The company I work for is one of the largest in USA, but for last few years R&D is non-existent. And I have spent all possible trial periods for Microsoft Visual Studio, SQL Server and similar things. I never mind to spend hundreds of dollars for broadband, personal computers, technical books. But Development Software ? So I need to hear from you. How many of you, being full-time employed by software shops decided to spend cash on things, your employer will never buy for you: things like Visual Studio, laptops, Windows 7 etc.
