[ Update : As the answer just above describes, this feature has been implemented (in this pull request )]. As of 05 April 2022, this is not available in scikit-learn. The good news is: The feature (or a like of it) is being developed: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20110 There seems to be a way of making ColumnTransformer return a dataframe by overwriting (or overriding) _hstack method, as mentioned in https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/20035 Hopefully, scikit-learn will make working with pandas dataframes more convenient soon.
