Try the examples under dendrogram. You can make it as interactive as you want. require(graphics); require(utils) hc Edit 1 ==================================== The interactivity depends on what you want to do. It all comes down to the structure of the data that goes to plot . To make it easier to see what's going on, I'll only use the first 3 lines of data from the above example: #Use only the first 3 lines from USArrests (df The next segment is the output of the above dput statement. This structure tells plot how to draw the tree. structure(list(merge = structure(c(-1L, -3L, -2L, 1L), .Dim = c(2L, 2L)), height = c(37.1770090243957, 54.8004107236398), order = c(3L, 1L, 2L), labels = c("Alabama", "Alaska", "Arizona"), method = "average", call = hclust(d = dist(df), method = "ave"), dist.method = "euclidean"), .Names = c("merge", "height", "order", "labels", "method", "call", "dist.method"), class = "hclust") You can easily change the data and see what plot does. Just copy/paste the structure statement from your screen and assign it to a new variable, make your changes, and plot it. newvar As far as making the clustering more interactive, you'll have to explore the different methods and determine what you want to do. http://cran.cnr.berkeley.edu/web/views/Cluster.html http://wiki.math.yorku.ca/index.php/R:_Cluster_analysis http://www.statmethods.net/advstats/cluster.html http://www.statmethods.net/advstats/cart.html
