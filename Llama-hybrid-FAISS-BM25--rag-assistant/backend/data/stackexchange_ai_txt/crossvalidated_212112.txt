$c(n)$ is trend, $r(n)$ is fluctuation. Should $\text{cov}[c(n),r(n)]/\text{var}[r(n)]$ be close to zero?

Suppose $y(n)$ is a random time series given as function of the discrete-time variable $n$. Suppose we can decompose it into $y(n) = c(n) + r(n)$, where $r(n)$ is a strict stationary residual representing fluctuations and $c(n)$ is a component exhibiting a slowly-varying first-order nonstationary behavior (i.e. a trend). Given what was defined, can we say that $\text{cov}[c(n),r(n)]/\text{var}[r(n)]$ (*) should be approximately zero? Why? (**) If no, what can we expect from that ratio? (*) = $\text{cov}[\cdot]$ and $\text{var}[\cdot]$ stand for the stochastic covariance and variance operators (**) = I'm asking such a question because, in the application I've been working on, in nearly all cases such a fraction is close to zero.
