Dynamic MC's path with localToGlobal Problems

I'm adding several instances of an MC (bread_mc) into a container MC (wall_mc). wall_mc has been added to a shop class and that is where i'm called the rest of my functions from. Also the wall_mc is scrolled left and right with mouseX & mouseY values. I've set up a function to add the bread_mc to the wall at different x/y positions. Function call: fillShelves(bread_mc,Bread,600,200); Function: function fillShelves(productMc:MovieClip,className:Class,productX:Number, productY:Number) { newProduct = new className(); newProduct.x=productX; newProduct.y=productY; shelf_mc.addChildAt(newProduct,1); newProduct.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_DOWN, dragProduct, false, 0, true); } I've added a drag/drop where the bread_mc will snap back to it's shelf x/y position. However i'd like that when user MOUSE_DOWN on bread_mc it is added to the highest depth so, while dragged, it stays infront of other mc's (a person with a shopping cart for example). My problem is, whenever I call the function dragProduct(); function dragProduct(e:MouseEvent):void { currMC = (e.target as MovieClip); this.addChild(currMC); stage.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_UP, dropProduct); } The damn bread_mc I click on moves to the right by the same amount that I've scrolled the wall_mc. I have tried forcing the currMC to stick with the mouseX/Y but that would need an ENTER_FRAME function and that seems so convoluted. I researched and found localToGlobal. Methods simliar to this: point = new Point(currMC.x, currMC.y); currMC.localToGlobal(point); trace(point.x); I really don't even know if i'm using it right, But I think my problem lies in the fact that I need the currMC path to travel up the display list tree and get the global stage X/Y position. I'm not too sure how to implement a dynamic path with the localToGlobal method. Any help would be appreciated. Even if it's go here>read this. Thanks
