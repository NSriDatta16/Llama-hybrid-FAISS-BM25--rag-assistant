What elisp or macro magic can make this text transformation?

I have a set of SQL statements formatted like so: INSERT INTO reports.workload (workload_id,event_time,event_type_id,agent_id) VALUES (-42000,'2010-02-23 07:30:38.941436',1,NULL); Right now, the VALUES tuple is aligned at the start with the column name tuple. However, what I want is to have the tuple's elements aligned as well, like so: INSERT INTO reports.workload (workload_id,event_time, event_type_id,agent_id) VALUES (-42000, '2010-02-23 07:30:38.941436',1 ,NULL); My elisp-fu and regexp-fu are moderate, but not sufficient to this task. How can I do this?
