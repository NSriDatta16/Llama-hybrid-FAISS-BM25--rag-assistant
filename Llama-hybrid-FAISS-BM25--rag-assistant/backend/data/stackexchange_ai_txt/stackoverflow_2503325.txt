I would do as you suggested and use 2 containers. They'd both be set to overflow:scroll and have a set width, but the top one would simply contain a div that you can set to be the same width as your table. You can then bind to the "scroll" event in jquery, and set the scroll position of the divs to match each other in that event. Honestly I haven't tried this so I don't know how reliably that event fires, but in theory it should work. Alternatively, you could do without the standard browser scrollbar and write your own scrollbar that uses javascript to set the position of your table in the overflow:scroll div. If you want draggable behavior (not just left/right arrows), it could be somewhat difficult, but wouldn't be impossible.
