Is this test answer good enough to show Granger Causality?

I used an inbuilt Matlab function to check for Granger Causality between two time series P and T that have a correlation coefficient of 0.6. The function is : https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/25467-granger-causality-test/content/granger_cause.m On running it, I got the following answer: >> [fs,cv] = granger_cause(P, T,0.05,2) fs = 1.0281e+003 cv = 2.9966 where FS is the F-Statistic and cv is the critical value from the F-Distribution. Does this show causality? Actually... what does it show?
