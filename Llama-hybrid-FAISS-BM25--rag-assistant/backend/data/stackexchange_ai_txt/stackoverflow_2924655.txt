How do I make an expanding textbox?

I want to make a textbook where it starts out as a given width/height. Then if users type more then the given amount of space, the textbox expands downward. How do I go about doing this? Do I use CSS? The basic textbox just displays a scroll bar when users pass the number of rows allow. How do I make it so the textbox expands the rows by say 5 more? How do I use the example that Robert Harvey mentioned? I never used JavaScript before..
