What's the data you're storing? It sounds like another storage type (e.g. a separate table) might be more suitable. Ahh, 2034 was a typo. What I don't understand from your question is that you say you need the exact match. If CHARINDEX returns non-zero for '20354' you know that it's matched '20354'. If you don't know what @providerId is, return that in your query along with the result of CHARINDEX. Similarly, if you want external_prv_id , include that, e.g.: SELECT external_prv_id, CHARINDEX(@providerId, external_prv_id) WHERE CHARINDEX(@providerId, external_prv_id) > 0 (Note that CHARINDEX returning 0 means it was not found.) If you actually mean that '20354' could include wildcards, you need PATINDEX.
