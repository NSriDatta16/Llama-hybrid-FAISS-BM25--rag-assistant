The performance will depend heavily on several factors: How many threads will be running at once? What will they be doing? How long will they run? (Minimum execution time, maximum, average) What happens if one of the threads abends? Ten times per second is a fairly high rate of activity. Depending on the duration of the execution, it might make more sense to use a separate process, like a service. The activity must obviously be thread-safe, meaning (in part) there is no resource contention. If two threads might need to update the same resource (file, memory location) you'll need to use locking. This can impede efficiency if not handled well.
