SQL Server Object Organisation

I'm not sure if this is valid, however I have a bug bear with SQL Server, and that is that I cannot organise objects in to a group of objects. Imagine I'm working on a new section of work in a large database and I perhaps have 15 objects that I will be regularly using. What I want to do is sort of "Favourite" them in to a folder so that I don't have to trawl through all objects in my databases. I know I could organise objects by schema, however these objects aren't necessarily schema specific, they cross boundaries. Has anyone come across a method for organising objects in to a favourites group? I know SQL Server Projects organise scripts, but I can't see that they can organises tables? Thanks
