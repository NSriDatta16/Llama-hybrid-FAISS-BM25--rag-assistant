The Fstats() function relies on fitting linear regression models (via least squares), internally. Thus, fitting models with moving average terms is not straightforward. I would recommend to fit a low-order autoregressive model as an approximation to your intended ARMA(1,1) model. The strucchange package contains several worked examples, e.g., a seasonal autoregressive model for the UKDriverDeaths time series, showing how to best accomplish this.
