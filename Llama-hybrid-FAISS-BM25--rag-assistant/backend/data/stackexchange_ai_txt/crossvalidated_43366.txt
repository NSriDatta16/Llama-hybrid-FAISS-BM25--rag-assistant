Extending logistic regression for outcomes in the range between 0 and 1

I have a regression problem where the outcomes are not strictly 0, 1 but rather in the range of all real numbers from 0 to 1 included $Y = [ 0, 0.12, 0.31, ..., 1 ]$. This problem has already been discussed in this thread , although my question is slightly different. I can't use linear regression for the same reasons that logistic regression is normally used. In linear regression A) very large IVs values will skew the predicted outcome to 1 and B) the outcome of linear regression is not bounded to the 0,1 limits. Looking at this logistic cost function from my textbook $$\text{Cost} = -y \log(h(x)) - (1 - y) \log(1-h(x))$$ I gather that the equation is designed to calculate a cost greater than 0 only when $y$ and $x$ do not have the same value 0 or 1. Would it be possible to use logistic regression by modifying the cost function to measure all hypothesis errors?
