To elaborate on @Tony-Frame 's answer, you have to decide on what to put on the "right-hand side of the equation". Do you have any individual explanatory variables, like socio-economic data on the customers? In case you don't, can you characterize and categorize these 40 events somehow (in terms of "general popularity", intensity of marketing, things like that? These could be also included in the specification in the right-hand side, as common regressors to all equations. If no potential regressors are available, then you can create an autoregressive model as presented in my answer to this post : logistic regression model for process with memory This would mean, predicting each customer "separately" without exploiting any possible interdependence on how customers decide... ("he goes -so I'll go"). Trying to taking into account this interdependence, would lead you into a system of equations and panel-data logistic regression.
