A few guesses. You are using PerformanceCounterType.AverageTimer32 . That's taking an average of the time. It is also possible that you are not reseting the Stopwatch on each method call so the values you are storing in the list are the total running time so far of every call to that method. You said milliseconds for the list, but ticks for the performance counter. A tick is 100 nanoseconds which is 0.0001 milliseconds. I would have expected the sizes you got to be reversed such as perfmon getting 14230.614 and the list getting 15.546 but that would still be off by an order of magnitude. Not much of an answer, but it didn't fit in a comment.
