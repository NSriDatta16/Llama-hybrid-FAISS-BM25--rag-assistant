What machine learning algorithm should I use for specific user configuration?

I have a data-set that contains thousands of employee data, including their role, department (Applications Developer, IT Support, Network Management etc.), and using one-hot encoding all of the hardware or software they have been given. I want to use this data so that when I input a new user with the data - role, department etc. their account will be compared to the model accounts and a prediction of what software or hardware they will need will be output. What machine learning algorithm should I use for this? I was thinking an unsupervised approach would be appropriate but I am new to machine learning and data science so I could be going about this completely the wrong way. Thanks for your help :)
