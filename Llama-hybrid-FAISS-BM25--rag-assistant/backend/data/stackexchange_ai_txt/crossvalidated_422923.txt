Assuming equal changes in terms of percentage points for two populations. Very easy question, but a reference needed

How to explain to non-statisticians that if we have e.g. obesity rate equal to 40% in men and 12% in women, the target values in men and women in 2030 should NOT be equal to 38% in men and 10% in women? Do you know any paper/guide that would explain it to policy-makers that one should take into account the baseline level, when assuming the target values? Actually, I would like to show that time series of social indicators are more likely to show exponential trends instead of linear trends. Any help will be appreciated.
