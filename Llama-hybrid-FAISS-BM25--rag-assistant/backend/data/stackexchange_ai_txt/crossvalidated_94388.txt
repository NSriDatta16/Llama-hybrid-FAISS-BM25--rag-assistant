What criteria are used to compare feature-based classification techniques?

When comparing feature-based classification techniques, what characteristics about the different processes should be considered? I'm comparing different classification techniques to try to figure out what should be considered when selecting a classification technique. In particular, I'm comparing the following: Linear classifiers K nearest neighbors Gaussian mixture models Bayesian networks Rule induction / decision trees Edit When I am considering which classifier I should use, I think about the following: Training time Classification time Classification accuracy Generates a probability vs. giving a class What other things should be considered?
