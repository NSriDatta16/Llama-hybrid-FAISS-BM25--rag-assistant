Or combined: Console.WriteLine("The date is {0}", DateTime.Now); Extra info (in response to BrandonZeider ): Yep, it is kind-a important for people to realize that string conversion is automatically done. Manually adding ToString is broken, e.g.: string value = null; Console.WriteLine("The value is '{0}'", value); // OK Console.WriteLine("The value is '{0}'", value.ToString()); // FAILURE Also, this becomes a lot less trivial once you realize that the stringification is not equivalent to using .ToString() . You can have format specifiers, and even custom format format providers... It is interesting enough to teach people to leverage String.Format instead of doing it manually.
