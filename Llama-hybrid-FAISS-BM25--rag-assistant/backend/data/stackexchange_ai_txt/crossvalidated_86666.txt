You have two sources of uncertainty: the uncertainty in the historical data, and the uncertainty in producing the forecasts given the historical data. The simulation distribution of point forecasts is capturing the uncertainty in the historical data only. To capture the joint uncertainty, I suggest you simulate a future value from the forecast distribution for each of the synthetic time series. That is, for each synthetic time series compute the point forecast and the forecast variance, and then simulate a value from this distribution. These simulated future values then include the uncertainty in both the forecast distribution and in the historical data. You could compute a prediction interval from the percentiles of the future values and compare its width with the size of the prediction interval produced for each synthetic series.
