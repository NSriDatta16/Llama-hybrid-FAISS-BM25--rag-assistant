Why does matching with replacement result in lower efficiency?

In the following paper, https://users.nber.org/~rdehejia/papers/matching.pdf , it says: Matching with replacement involves a tradeoff between bias and variance. With replacement, the average quality of matching increases; thus, the bias decreases but the variance increases. Why is it that the variance increases? Is there a simple and intuitive way to understand this? I understand the reuse of control units results in less information being used, but is there a mathematical or intuitive way to understand the link from this to the higher variance? Thanks.
