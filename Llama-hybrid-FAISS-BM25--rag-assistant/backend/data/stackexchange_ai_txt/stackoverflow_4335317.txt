See SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER in Books Online. When it's set to ON then double quotes are interpreted as marking an identifier ; when it's OFF then double quotes mark a literal value. ODBC and OLE DB set it ON by default, but different libraries can do what they like and you can set it explicitly yourself if you need to. The bigger picture is that you shouldn't be embedding literal values in your SQL anyway. Instead, you should be using parameterized queries (however they work in your particular client library) because it avoids issues with SQL injection, quoting and data type conversion.
