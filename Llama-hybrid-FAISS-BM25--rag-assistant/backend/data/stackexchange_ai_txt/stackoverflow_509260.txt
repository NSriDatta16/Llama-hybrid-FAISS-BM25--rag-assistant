The biggest challenge is not the technical issues associated with getting the environment up and running but the domain knowledge required to effectively develop software in a small shop. For me, I work on a lot of different projects from a variety of sources in a mostly isolated development environment. This means that I need to come up to speed on the domain of the project pretty quickly in order to be effective in developing a solution. In the past I've worked on print accounting solutions, active directory management, research survey databases, and currently a quasi-CRM solution for a charitable organization. I wish I only had to know the nuts and bolts of setting up my development and build environment.
