I found the reason, and some workaround. On Glassfish 3.1, which ships with Mojarra 2.1, classpath scanning is delegated to Glassfish. Now, Glassfish seems to give all classes of ear file instead of war. I opened http://java.net/jira/browse/JAVASERVERFACES-1995 for that (but it really seems to be a Glassfish bug, not JSF/Mojarra). While waiting for a fix, I patched Mojarra like this : in com.sun.faces.config.ConfigManager.java, around line 834, I commented out some lines: // if (provider instanceof DelegatingAnnotationProvider && // null != annotationScanner) { // // This InjectionProvider is capable of annotation scanning *and* // // injection. // ((DelegatingAnnotationProvider)provider).setAnnotationScanner(annotationScanner, // metadataGetter.getJarNames()); // scanUris = Collections.emptySet(); // } else { // This InjectionProvider is capable of annotation scanning only scanUris = metadataGetter.getAnnotationScanURIs(); // } The logs are now much less verbose. It seems Glassfish is still scanning every classes, so I still get warnings like this: [#|2011-03-18T13:47:05.019+0100|WARNING|oracle-glassfish3.1|javax.enterprise.system.container.web.org.glassfish.web.loader|_ThreadID=57;_ThreadName=Thread-1;|WEB9052: Unable to load class org.apache.myfaces.custom.inputTextHelp.HtmlTextHelpRenderer, reason: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.apache.myfaces.custom.inputTextHelp.HtmlTextHelpRenderer|#] But no stacktrace from Mojarra, which is already quite less verbose.
