Do semantics matter in Latex? If not, why not?

When I ask questions about achieving some particular layout LaTeX, I get answers that suggest I should use constructs that don't make sense for their semantics. For example, I wanted to intent a single paragraph, and I was told to make it a list with no bullets. It works, but that isn't the semantic meaning of a list, so why is it acceptable to abuse it like that. We stopped doing it in HTML over a decade ago. Why are we still doing the equivalent of table layout in supposedly the best typesetting system there is? Am I not getting it, but isn't this a little inelegant? Everyone says LaTeX is elegant and that you don't need to worry about layout, but then I find myself contorting tables, lists and other semantic markup to put stuff where I want it. Does the emperor have no clothes, or am I not getting it?
