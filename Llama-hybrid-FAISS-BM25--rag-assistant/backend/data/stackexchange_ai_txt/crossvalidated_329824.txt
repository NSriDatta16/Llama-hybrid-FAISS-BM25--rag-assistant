Although the approach is parametric, try looking at Bayesian Changepoint Detection, especially papers by Adams, R. P. & MacKay (see https://arxiv.org/abs/0710.3742 ), and Fearnhead, P. & Liu (see http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9868.2007.00601.x/abstract ). For point processes in particular, have a look at: http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/pub/pdf/SaaTurRas10.pdf . The approach is that you partition your data into disjoint segments (that are ordered in time). According to the product partition model (See Barry and Hartigan,1992) each segment is independently modelled by a given probability distribution (i.e. model). As you are going to see in these papers you maintain a run-length distribution (distribution of possible segment lengths). Conditioning on that distribution you can try to model the data generating process by assigning a model/distribution to your data (say the multivariate normal) and a prior to the parameters of that model. As you get more and more data, you update your prior beliefs into posterior ones and predict whether a CP has occurred. Hope that will get you going...
