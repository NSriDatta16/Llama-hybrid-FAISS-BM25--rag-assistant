Tkinter: Mouse drag a window without borders, eg. overridedirect(1)

Any suggestions on how one might create event bindings that would allow a user to mouse drag a window without borders, eg. a window created with overridedirect(1) ? Use case: We would like to create a floating toolbar/palette window (without borders) that our users can drag around on their desktop. Here's where I'm at in my thinking (pseudo code): window.bind( ' ', onMouseDown ) to capture the initial position of the mouse. window.bind( ' ', onMouseMove ) to track position of mouse once it starts to move. Calculate how much mouse has moved and calculate newX , newY positions. Use window.geometry( '+%d+%d' % ( newX, newY ) ) to move window. Does Tkinter expose enough functionality to allow me to implement the task at hand? Or are there easier/higher-level ways to achieve what I want to do?
