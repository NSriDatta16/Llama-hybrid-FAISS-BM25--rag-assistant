True or false: A reference is the same thing as an alias to the value at an address. False: It has nothing to do with address (that's an implementation detail). True or false: If you delete a pointer to the same address as a referenced value resides, (as I do above), then no undefined behavior will occur, and no one will ever overwrite that address as long as the reference exists. False. It is undefined behavior to use a reference to a variable that is no longer alive. Different types of variable die at different times. automatic storage duration variables die at the end of scope. static storage duration variables die in reverse order of creation after main exits dynamic storage duration variables die when delete is called on the memory they reside within.
