It seems the problem was in the URL. Apparently, jQuery always needs a callback parameter and it usually appends "callback=?". However, since Flickr is using "jsonpCallback" as the name for the parameter, I had to change the URL to this: http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne?format=json&tags=home&jsoncallback= ? And presto, it suddenly works like a charm!
