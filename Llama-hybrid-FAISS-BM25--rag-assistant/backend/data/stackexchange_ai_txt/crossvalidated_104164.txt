There is no standardized formula. One approach to derive an $R^2$ like score is to transform the test statistics in a likelihood ratio test, like how Negalkerke's $R^2$ is constructed in GLM models. In your case, there may be a simpler approach. I guess the model you use is: $$ y = e^{\beta' x + c} $$ If that is the case, you can simply apply the log transform: $z = \log(y)$, and your model becomes linear: $$ z = \beta' x + c $$ You can compute the $R^2$ as in the classical linear models. BTW, I guess your model is really "nonlinear regression" rather than "nonlinear time series". Usually "nonlinear time series" means models like GARCH, FARMA, and I guess those are not your case.
