Embedding ASP.Net code in external javascript files

I have a code like var mySession = " "; alert ( mySession ); and when I place this code in my aspx page inside a script tag, it works fine. But it doesn't work in an external js file. I am not able to figure out the problem. Is there anything wrong in my code, or is it like this by default?
