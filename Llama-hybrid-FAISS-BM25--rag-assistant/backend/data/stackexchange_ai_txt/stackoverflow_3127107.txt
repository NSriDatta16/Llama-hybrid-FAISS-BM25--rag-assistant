Math Logic For Font Resizing

i have a blue container that is the canvas for my text. what i'm trying to do is resize the font so that the entire text fills as much of the blue container as it can. i have access to the height of the text content, which is both paragraphs and the line in between them. also, i have the height of the blue container, the height of each line, the number of lines and the number of words. i tried using the height of the line, based on a default font size, with the amount of lines to determine how much i need to increase the font so it would fill the blue container. however, doing so also changes the amount of lines, ruining my chances for success while making my head swim. what formula should i use so the font size fills the blue container? here are my numbers: Content height: 342.46 Content/Container Width: 400 Font Size: 11 Line Height: 11 * 1.2 //120% of the font size gives the line height Number of Lines: 24 Number of Words: 2055 also, it's possible for the text content to be long and to extend well past the container, so ideally a formula (or suggestions) for both an increase or reduction of the font size is what i'm trying to achieve. alt text http://www.freeimagehosting.net/uploads/c1a4f77c5f.jpg
