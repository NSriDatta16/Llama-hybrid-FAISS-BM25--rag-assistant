Salesforce OAuth 2.0 API: get refresh_token with authorization URL launched in a normal browser

In this page, it is mentioned refresh_token is returned only for callback URLs that do not start with HTTPS or point back to salesforce. https://na5.salesforce.com/help/doc/en/remoteaccess_oauth_user_agent_flow.htm However, in the SF->setup->develop->remote application creation page it takes only URL starting with HTTPS or an arbitrary string like abcd'. Are there any tricks to get the refresh_token when the authorization URL ( i.e., OAuth authorization) is launched in a browser? We want to use refresh_token to revalidate access_token ( when it expires) without having to prompt the login window.
