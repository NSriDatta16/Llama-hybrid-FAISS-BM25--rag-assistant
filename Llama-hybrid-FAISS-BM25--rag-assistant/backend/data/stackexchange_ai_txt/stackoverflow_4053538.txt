Microsoft has announced that mainstream support for SQL Server 2005 will end 4/12/2001. http://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle I would use the newer version as it has a longer life span and also has some cool features like the compressed storage format and compressed backups. If you are thinking of using the free Express version 2008 R2 allows databases of up to 10GB, while the older version limits you to 4GB.
