How to select a bunch of optimized data from a larger data set?

How to select a bunch of optimized data from a larger data set? I have a data set containing the products to be sold to the customers. And the products were sold before, it has some information, like the review, ratings, how many were sold per product from the customers. Now, I want to select a bunch of optimized data from a larger data set based on the number of units sold, ratings, review etc all the information. The purpose is to increase the number of units to be sold in the future. How to do this? What kind of model, method, algorithms should be used here? If it is related to machine learning, what kind of machine learning tools should I use here? Thank you so much.
