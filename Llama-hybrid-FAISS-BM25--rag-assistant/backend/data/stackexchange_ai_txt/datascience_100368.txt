I've seen this behavior when using a CNN model trained on less than 50 epochs. Assuming training time is not the issue, try predicting several days out (as a vector of sequential future prices). This exercise alone will reveal any bugs in your script, as it will become apparent the output is completely wrong. Looking at your code, in your training forward() function, I'm suspicious of h0 = torch.zeros() - basically you are feeding the network zeros as input, no wonder it outputs values that are smaller and smaller. Layer zeroing usually happens once outside of the forward() function, not every iteration.
