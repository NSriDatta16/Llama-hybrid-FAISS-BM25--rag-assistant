The answer referring to Andrew Moore's tutorials is a good one . I'd like to augment it, however, by suggesting some reading on the need which drives the creation of many classification systems in the first place: identification of causal relationships. This is relevant to many modeling problems involving statistical inference. The best current resource I know of for learning about causality and classifier systems (especially Bayesian classifiers) is Judea Pearl's book "Causality: models, reasoning, and inference" .
