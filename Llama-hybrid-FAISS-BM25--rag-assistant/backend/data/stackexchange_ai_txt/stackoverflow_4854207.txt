Get a specific bit from byte

I have a byte, specifically one byte from a byte array which came in via UDP sent from another device. This byte stores the on/off state of 8 relays in the device. How do I get the value of a specific bit in said byte? Ideally an extension method would look the most elegant and returning a bool would make the most sense to me. public static bool GetBit(this byte b, int bitNumber) { //black magic goes here }
