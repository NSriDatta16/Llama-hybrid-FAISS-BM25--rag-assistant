These are outlets that are set to the object in question. For example, if you select an object that is a window's delegate, the window's delegate outlet will show as one of the object's referencing outlets. If it isn't the window's delegate, you can make it so by dragging from the “New Referencing Outlet” circle to the window, then clicking on the window's delegate outlet. It's not a new kind of outlet; it's just viewing the same outlets from the perspective of the objects in the outlets instead of that of the objects owning the outlets.
