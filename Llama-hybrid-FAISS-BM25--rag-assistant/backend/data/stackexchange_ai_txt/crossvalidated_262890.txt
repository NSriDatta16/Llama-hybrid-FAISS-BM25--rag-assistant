ISLR book - "Of course one would need to investigate more carefully"?

I'm following the Introduction to the "Statistical Learning" book, but I do the exercises in Python. In the lab 4 where we work on stock data, after the end results are known and the model is created with corresponding metrics calculated, authors say: The confusion matrix shows that on days when logistic regression predicts an increase in the market, it has a 58% accuracy rate. This suggests a possible trading strategy of buying on days when the model predicts an increasing market, and avoiding trades on days when a decrease is predicted. Of course one would need to investigate more carefully whether this small improvement was real or just due to random chance My question is what do they mean by 'investigate more carefully', where should I begin the investigation, what else should I check if the results are real or a random chance? Thanks Below is my Python code: smarket = pd.read_csv('http://www.science.smith.edu/~jcrouser/SDS293/labs/lab4/Smarket.csv', usecols=range(1,10), index_col=0, parse_dates=True) smarket.head() X_train2004 = smarket[:'2004'][['Lag1', 'Lag2']] y_train2004 = smarket[:'2004']['Direction'] #, 'Lag3', 'Lag4', 'Lag5', 'Volume' X_test2005 = smarket['2005 ':][['Lag1', 'Lag2']] y_test2005 = smarket['2005':]['Direction'] reg_smarket = skl_lm.LogisticRegression() reg_smarket.fit(X_train2004, y_train2004) print(reg_smarket.score(X_train2004, y_train2004), reg_smarket.score(X_test2005, y_test2005)) print('Confusion Matrix:\n',pd.crosstab(y_test2005, reg_smarket.predict(X_test2005),\ rownames=['True'], colnames=['Predicted'], margins=True)) print(confusion_matrix(y_test2005, reg_smarket.predict(X_test2005))) print(classification_report(y_test2005, reg_smarket.predict(X_test2005))) Result Training Score: 0.517034068136 Test Score: 0.559523809524 Confusion Matrix: Predicted Down Up All True Down 35 76 111 Up 35 106 141 All 70 182 252 precision recall f1-score support Down 0.50 0.32 0.39 111 Up 0.58 0.75 0.66 141 avg / total 0.55 0.56 0.54 252
