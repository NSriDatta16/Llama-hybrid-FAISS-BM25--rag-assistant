Mutable boolean field in Java

I need a mutable boolean field in Java (I will return this field via get* method later and it should be possible to modify this field). Boolean doesn't work because there are no set* methods in the Boolean class (I would say that Boolean is immutable, you can only change the reference, but you can't change the object itself). I guess I can use Boolean array of size 1. But probably there are more elegant solutions? Why doesn't Java have such a simple thing?
