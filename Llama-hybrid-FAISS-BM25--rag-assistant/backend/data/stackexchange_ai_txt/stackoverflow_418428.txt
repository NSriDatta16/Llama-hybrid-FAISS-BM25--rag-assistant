What's wrong with my MySQL query?

I'm not getting any errors as such just a minor performance issue. EXPLAIN SELECT a.nid, a.title, a.uid, b.parent, b.weight, c.name, d.value FROM table1 AS a INNER JOIN table2 AS b ON a.vid = b.vid AND a.status = 1 INNER JOIN table3 AS c ON c.uid = a.uid INNER JOIN table4 AS d ON d.content_id = a.nid AND d.value_type = 'percent' AND d.function = 'average' When I look at which tables are being referenced, everything is fine, but from table4 where it should only be selecting the "value" field, I'm getting an ALL being called... id select_type table type possible_keys key key_len ref rows Extra 1 SIMPLE a ref PRIMARY,vid,status,uid,node_status_type,nid status 4 const 1 1 SIMPLE b eq_ref PRIMARY PRIMARY 4 databasename.a.vid 1 1 SIMPLE c eq_ref PRIMARY PRIMARY 4 databasename.a.uid 1 Using where 1 SIMPLE d ALL NULL NULL NULL NULL 2 Using where As you can see, it's selecting * from the final table (d). Why is it doing this when I only need ONE field selected from it? Can anyone help me out?
