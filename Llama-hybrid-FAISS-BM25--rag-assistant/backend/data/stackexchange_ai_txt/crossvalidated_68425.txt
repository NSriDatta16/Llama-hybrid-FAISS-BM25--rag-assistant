How to determine correlation between stationary and non-stationary time series

I have three time series of economic data based on quarterly observations; A, B and C, and I would like to ascertain the correlation (or not) between A and C as well as the correlation between B and S. The 1st order differenced time series of B passes the ADF and KPSS tests for stationarity. Series A & C fail the stationarity tests even after trying detrending (based on linear regression and centred moving averages of order 4) as well as 1st and 2nd order differencing. What is the best way to ascertain the extent of correlation between A & C and between B & C under these circumstances? Below are the time series data (tab delimited): A 13,603 15,062 (22,984) 14,704 14,285 15,585 (17,460) 21,145 20,926 28,117 (6,524) 31,190 25,610 34,311 (21,376) 14,140 3,416 26,526 (21,159) 30,874 51,579 50,426 (19,874) 52,980 30,338 B (92,345) 19,415 13,045 104,693 214,196 (39,180) (29,979) 112,499 5,914 60,787 92,253 124,716 23,638 362,566 (66,896) 209,127 103,986 (13,418) 389,962 (161,400) 177,945 (36,645) 148,722 189,477 C 819,019 716,641 767,830 1,177,339 1,254,122 1,254,122 985,382 716,641 614,264 806,222 819,019 844,613 1,018,655 1,108,235 1,261,801 1,474,234 1,412,807 1,678,988 1,638,037 1,228,528 1,023,773 1,279,717 1,279,717 1,023,773
