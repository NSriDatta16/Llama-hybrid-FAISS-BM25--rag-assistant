Thus it could be desirable to have a data structure that has O(1) random access, yet doesn't rely on continuous storage. Is there such a thing? No, there is not. Sketch of proof: If you have a limit on your continuous block size, then obviously you'll have to use indirection to get to your data items. Fixed depth of indirection with a limited block size gets you only a fixed-sized graph (although its size grows exponentially with the depth), so as your data set grows, the indirection depth will grow (only logarithmically, but not O(1)).
