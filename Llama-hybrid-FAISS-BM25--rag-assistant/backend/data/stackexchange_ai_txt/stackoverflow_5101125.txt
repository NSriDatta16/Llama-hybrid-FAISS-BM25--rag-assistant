Aside from MySQL's query cache, you should be using APC (Alternative PHP Cache) as well, and possibly some of Magento's built-in full-page caching mechanisms. This could mitigate some of your round-trips to MySQL and back, lessening your need for a primed MySQL cache. You can 'prime' the cache of your Magento DB manually, but that's hiding the real issue here, and that's to avoid going to MySQL at all - especially within Magento. And for what it's worth - you're the first person I've ever come across that compared Magento's speed with that of Google and Yahoo. :)
