Is it possible to have a peer to peer communication using nothing but PHP

Is it possible to implement a p2p using just PHP? Without Flash or Java and obviously without installing some sort of agent/client on one's computer. so even though it might not be "true" p2p, but it'd use server to establish connection of some sort, but rest of communication must be done using p2p i apologize for little miscommunication, by "php" i meant not a php binary, but a php script that hosted on web server remote from both peers, so each peer have nothing but a browser.
