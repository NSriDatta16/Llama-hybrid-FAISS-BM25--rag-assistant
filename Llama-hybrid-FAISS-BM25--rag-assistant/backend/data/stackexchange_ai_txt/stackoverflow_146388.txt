What is a good search engine for embedding in a web site

I am thinking of changing my web site's homegrown search engine. Before I break out Visual Studio, I wondered if anyone can suggest an alternative that gives me what I need. This being: Works with an ASP.NET site (is a .NET project) Creates a file-based index Fast search across hundreds or thousands of pages Performs word-stemming to find variations upon words Gives full control over the output styles Is cheap (or better still, free!)
