accessing draggable items in jquery ui

i have built an interface for dragging images into a "save area" and i dont know how to access the actual html markup- such as the img src tag? i have this $(function(){ $('.draggable').draggable(); $('#droparea').droppable({ drop: function(ev,ui) { //do magic }, out: function(event, ui){ removeone(); } }); }); what do i use to access the image src? i have a few hundred images.. what should i do so that when they are dropped i can get access to the src?
