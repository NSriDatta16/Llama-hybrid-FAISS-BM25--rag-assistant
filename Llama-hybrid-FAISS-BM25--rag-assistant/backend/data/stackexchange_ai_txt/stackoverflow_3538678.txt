As Jefromi writes, Mercurial is also using a custom format to achive high compression and fast access to any revision. This is the revlog format which is an append-only data structure that takes advantage of the immutability of changesets in Mercurial. However, it is of course possible to replace this storage format with another if you like. Google did this when they put Mercurial on Bigtable for code.google.com. One funny consequence of them using their own backend format is that you don't see any revision numbers in their web interface. In normal Mercurial, the revision numbers (the local-only integer you can use instead of the full changeset hash) are the index of the changesets in the revlog. When changesets are not stored in revlogs, there is no natural index and therefore Google shows you no revision numbers.
