I believe it is almost always a serialized identy integer, but some will disagree. It does depend on the situation. The reasons for identity is efficiency and simplicity. It's smaller. More easily indexed. It makes a great clustered index. Less fragmentation as new records are kept in order. Great for indexes on joins. Easier when eyeballing records in a db. There is definately a place for Guids in certain circumstances. When merging disparate data, or when records have to be created in certain places. Guids should be in your bag of tricks but usually will not be your first choice.
