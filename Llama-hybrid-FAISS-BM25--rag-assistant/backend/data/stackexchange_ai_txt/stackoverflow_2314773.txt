Machine.Specifications.MVC ShouldBeAView() always fails even on valid ViewResults

Has anyone run into this while using Machine.Specifications.Mvc? I setup a spec to test the results of a controller action. In this case: [Subject("User views the dashboard")] public class When_a_user_views_the_vendors_page : ManagementContext { static ActionResult result; Because of = () => result = manageController.Vendors(); It should_contain_a_list_of_vendors = () => { result.ShouldBeAView().And().ShouldHaveModelOfType >(); }; } The error I get every time is: Machine.Specifications.SpecificationException: Should be of type System.Web.Mvc.ViewResult but is of type System.Web.Mvc.ViewResult at Machine.Specifications.ShouldExtensionMethods.ShouldBeOfType(Object actual, Type expected) in d:\BuildAgent-01\work\340c36596c29db8\Source\Machine.Specifications\ExtensionMethods.cs:line 206 Has anyone seen this? Is there an easy way to resolve it? It seems to be happening in the Machine.Specifications library. I even ran it in a debug mode to check the values and they are indeed both ViewResult objects and with the correct model data even. Thanks in advance
