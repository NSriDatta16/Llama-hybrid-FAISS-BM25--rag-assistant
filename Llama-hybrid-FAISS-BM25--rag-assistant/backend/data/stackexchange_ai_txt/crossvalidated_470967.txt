What is the relationship between Boltzmann / Gibbs sampling and the softmax function?

I'm looking at sampling functions in the context of reinforcement learning; specifically the explore/exploit problem. A method I've seen pretty often is to derive the action by assigning a score to them and then transforming that score into a probability. One way to do that is by applying the softmax function to the set of scored actions. Then one can sample from those actions with the assigned probabilities. Meaning an action with a high score has a high probability. What is the relationship between this and Gibbs sampling / Blotzmann sampling? In this paper it is called "Boltzmann exploration", ubc.ca ai book and this suggests that they are pretty similar.
