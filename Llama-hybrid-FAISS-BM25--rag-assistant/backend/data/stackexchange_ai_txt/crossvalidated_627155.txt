How could Lilliefors use Monte Carlo if the estimand is not distribution-free?

Lilliefors test is a well-known statistical test for normality. Its idea is based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, except the CDF is replaced by the CDF of the normal distribution with $\mu, \sigma^2$ chosen as the estimated ones from the data. In other words given data $\{X_1, \ldots, X_n\}$ we form its empirical CDF $F_n$ , and consider the estimand $$E := \sup_x \left|F_n(x) - \text{cdf}_{N(\hat{\mu}, \hat{\sigma^2})}(x)\right|.$$ The idea is that if the data does come from a normal distribution, then $E$ must be small . In [1], Lilliefors claimed to use Monto Carlo method to compute numbers that defines the small ness. Question Since $E$ is not distribution-free, shouldn't have Lilliefors done a Monto Carlo numerical estimate for all kinds of $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ ? Why would a single table be enough?
