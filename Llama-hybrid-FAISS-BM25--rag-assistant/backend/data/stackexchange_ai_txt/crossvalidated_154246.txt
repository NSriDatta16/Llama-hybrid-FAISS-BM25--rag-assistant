How do I calculate clustering of symptoms?

I am trying to assess whether a risk factor (A) has an impact on clustering of 3 types of symptoms (B, C, D). I know that A has a significant association with B, C, and D. So first I did a multinomial logistic regression, with outcomes 0 (no B, C, or D), 1 (either B or C or D), 2 (any combination of 2 or 3 symptoms). This gave me significant results, so exposure to A gives you an increased chance of having any combination of B, C, and D. But here's my problem: Let's say the chances of someone developing symptoms (B, C, or D), without exposure to A, is 0.1 That means that purely on chance level, the chances of developing 2 symptoms is 0.1*0.1=0.01 Now lets say that the chances of developing symptoms with exposure to A is 0.2. Therefore getting 2 symptoms would be 0.2*0.2=0.04. The problem now is that with my multinomial regression, I think that the fact that the outcome is significant, is merely based on the fact that 0.04 is bigger than 0.01 - because there are significant associations between A, and BCD, you will always get a significant association with combinations of B, C, and D. But what I want to know is whether the chance of clustering of symptoms is actually higher after exposure to A, compared with the chance of clustering that can happen naturally, independent of exposure to A. Does anyone have experience with such an analysis, or have any idea how to go about this?
