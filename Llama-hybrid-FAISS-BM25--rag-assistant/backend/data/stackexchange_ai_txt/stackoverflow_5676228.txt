It's working just fine - it's doing exactly what you told it to - it gives you back all rows that are between today and a year back (e.g. between Apr 15, 2011 and Apr 15, 2010) What you probably want to achieve is something like this: SELECT EffectiveDate AS [Month], COUNT(MemberID) AS Agents, SUM(ActualPremium) AS Premium FROM dbo.vwMemberPolicyInfo WHERE YEAR(EffectiveDate) = 2011 GROUP BY EffectiveDate This will return only rows from the year 2011.
