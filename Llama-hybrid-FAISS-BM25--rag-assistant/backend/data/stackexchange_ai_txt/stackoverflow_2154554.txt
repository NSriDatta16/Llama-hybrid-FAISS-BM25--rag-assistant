I suppose You have an error in the problem description, as the a tag always contains text in the example. As far as I know there is no standard selector allowing to check if there is a direct content, but You could try this: $('p').each(function(){ var p = $(this).clone(); p.children().remove(); if(p.text().length){ $(this).addClass('gotcha'); } }); Should work if You wish to check only the paragraph insides.
