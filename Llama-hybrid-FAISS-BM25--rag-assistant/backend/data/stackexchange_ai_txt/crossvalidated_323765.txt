Odd ratio for cumulative effect of risk variants

I'm trying to calculate odds ratios to summarize associations between some risk factors and the number of risk variants in a subject. Number of risk variants is ordinal. I did a multinomial logistic regression that summarizes separate odds ratios for observing 1, 2, 3, or 4 risk variants versus 0 with different medication steps. This is my code: test The matter is when I execute this what I'm getting is the Odd ratio for each risk category instead instead of odd ratios for increase of one in the number of risk variants. This is my output Intercept) medication_stepsstep_2 medication_stepsstep_3 medication_stepsstep_4 age 1 11.87786 0.7764290 0.2199499 0.3999115 1.019621 2 57.41383 0.4681173 0.1603767 0.1310747 1.102033 3 133.42880 0.5098369 0.1559243 0.2070830 1.089148 4 14.71933 0.6190965 0.2108455 0.2834067 1.108850 However, I do not know how to summarize these results. Furthermore, I do not know if it is the right model for my question. Can someone provide an example of interpreting this output or suggest a different model to fit in this scenario?
