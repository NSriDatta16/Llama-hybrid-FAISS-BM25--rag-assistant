Got it! I think the source of the problem was not giving Free TDS the attention it needs. Free TDS is apparently the driver behind pymssql and provides for connectivity to other databases - SQL Server being one of them. The freetds.conf file is located in /usr/local/etc on my system (Mac Book Pro). This file contains the defaults from the install. However, I had previously added a definition so that I could connect but forgot about it and unfortunately did not take notes on it. Anyway, here is an example of what I appended to freetds.conf: [SomeDB] host = 192.168.1.102 port = 1219 tds version = 7.0 However, what is puzzling is that I set the port to 1219. I had it set manually to 1433 in SQL Studio. Also, I am using TDS version 0.82 so I don't know how 7.0 fits in. Next, I tested connectivity using 'tsql' as follows: tsql -S SomeDB -U www I enter the password and get a command-line which allows for SQL queries. Next, I tested connecting using pymssql as follows: db = pymssql.connect(host='SomeDB',user='www',password='cylon',database='TestDB') As you can see, I needed to use the host name from the freetds.conf file and NOT the IP directly. I then tested a simple query with additional python code to insure I could read from the database. I hope this helps someone else in the future.
