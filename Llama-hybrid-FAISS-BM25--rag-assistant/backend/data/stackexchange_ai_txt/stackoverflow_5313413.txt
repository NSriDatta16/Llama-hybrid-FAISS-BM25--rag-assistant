Issues when processing an image using OpenGL ES 2.0

I made a simple app that takes an input image and outputs a processed one using a fragment shader. When using a 2^n image it's OK. But if I use a rectangular not-power-of-2 image I get a black stitch running from top to bottom. This is the original: This is after being processed: Here's my fragment shader: precision mediump float; uniform vec2 uSize; uniform sampler2D sTexture; void main() { gl_FragColor = texture2D(sTexture, vec2(gl_FragCoord) / uSize) } Where, uSize is a vec2 having the size of the image Generally I can work with a power-of-2 textures, but as OGLES2 supports rectangular textures I was thinking of sparing myself some work. Thanks! UPDATE Here go my vertices: static GLfloat vVertices[] = { -1.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f, -1.0f, -1.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f, -1.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f, -1.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f, -1.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f, }; And here is the vertex shader: attribute vec4 vPosition; void main() { gl_Position = vPosition; } UPDATE Now, that's strange. Here are the two triangles rendered separately (first using the first 3 vertices, and then using the next (last) three). Here go for the square image (as expected): And here are how the same triangles look for the rectangle image/texture. They look bizarre : They don't look like triangles at all. Does anyone know what's happening?
