First of all, CPython's library is written in C, and is highly optimized so it is not surprising that a program which leverages the library runs faster than unoptimized Objective C. The result would be different if you translated the Objective C program line by line into Python. I suspect that much of the result comes from the fact that the counter is not incremented very often and that it is very efficient for Python to decide that an object is NOT in the set. After all, if you take every second letter of a word, it seems rather unlikely that you will end up with a valid English word, let alone one in the same source text.
