My rewording of 6.4.5/5 in the Standard ... string literals are implemented as arrays of static storage duration with 'char' type ... So, the objects are allocated as any other static variable static int arr[100] = {0}; if (strcmp(foo, "bar")) exit(0); int *ptr = malloc(100 * sizeof *ptr); The array arr and the string literal "bar" are allocated in the same way; different than the way ptr is allocated.
