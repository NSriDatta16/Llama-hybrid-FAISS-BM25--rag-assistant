ANOVA/ANCOVA(sig. tests of regression coefficients) does not require that IVs are normally distributed. The only assumption of normality is for the residuals. In terms of the benefits of ensuring your IV is not skewed, the only justifiable reason I can think of for this would be if you had reason to believe that your sample was not representative of the target population. To make up an example... suppose you collected data on college studying behavior (in hours/week; PO) as it predicts GPA. When you collected your sample, however, you surveyed mostly first-year college students and undersampled more acclimated students. As a result (perhaps) you have a lot of people with very little studying hours/week, and only a handful with a lot of hours. However, this sampling issues is going to apply to ALL of your variables, not just your PO IV. If you resample for one of your variables, you should resample for all. In the end what you want from your sample is for it to be representative of your target population. Without getting too into the weeds here, one way to do so, without adding bias at least, is to take a truly random sample of the population. You may end up with a weird sample, but on the average your samples will equal the target population, and you won't have added a systematic bias to them. However, many times we can't really do a truly random sample, so we end up doing the best we can. Stratified sampling might work for you. Returning to our college example, maybe you want to ensure that your sample contains 25% 1st year students, 25% 2nd year students, etc. (simplified example in which there are only 4 years possible).
