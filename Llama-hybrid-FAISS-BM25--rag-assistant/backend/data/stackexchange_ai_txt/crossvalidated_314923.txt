The WAIC, as the AIC, is scaled to the likelihood/posterior, so there should be no need to adjust it to the scales of y1 or y2. Moreover, as the AIC is defined point-wise, it shouldn't matter in which order you sum it up, so you can calculate WAIC(y1, y2), or also WAIC(y1) + WAIC(y2). Side note: blavaan is doing Bayesian SEMS based on the lavaan syntax and can calculate the WAIC.
