Using Nested Enum as Parameter in Seperate Package

New to java and have a question related to packages. I like to keep objects organized in namespaces and ran into a problem with enums that I cannot figure out. Say I have a nested enum like this: package Project; public class Foo { public enum Bar { One, Two, Three }; } I want to do something like this package Project.Attributes; public class Foo { public setBar( Project.Foo.Bar bar ) {} } But I am getting name conflicts and unknown package 'Foo' errors. How can I achieve this?
