You can just use Windows Explorer. Open Windows Explorer and go into the assembly folder inside your Windows folder. You should then see all the assemblies that are registered, if you want to add yours in, just drag and drop it in there. Or if you prefer, you can locate the gacutil.exe and use that to do it (but it's not installed with the framework nowdays, only with the SDK I think).
