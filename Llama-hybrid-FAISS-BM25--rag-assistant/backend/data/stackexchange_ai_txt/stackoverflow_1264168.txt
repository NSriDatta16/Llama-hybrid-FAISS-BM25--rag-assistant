1i64 I believe should be a signed, 64-bit integer. I can't proclaim any expertise in Microsoft's implementation, but in GCC, the solution for supporting 64-bit integers on 32-bit CPUs was to make long longs double-words using structs and various black magic macros. Therefore, i64 should be compatible. As to the last bit of voodoo -- the only point in specifying 1u it is because it's possible that if k is large enough, the result of the shift would meet / exceed 32-bits of storage, in which case the outcome will be different if the LH operand is treated as a signed or an unsigned integer.
