I want to conduct some test on a large correlation matrix in r

The data I have is essentially the number of times two students were seen together. So student 1 and 3 were seen the most amount of times together, then 2 and 3, then 1 and 2. The correlation matrix looks like this: 1 [2] [3] 1 0 0.4 0.7 [2] 0.4 0 0.5 [3] 0.7 0.5 0 After reading a bit, I know you cannot average correlation coefficients, but I would like to conduct a test to have an 'average' or some value that best shows the data. Any suggestions on how I can do this in r?
