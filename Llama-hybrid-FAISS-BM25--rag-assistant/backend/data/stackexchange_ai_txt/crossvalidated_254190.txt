Neural net for predicting pseudo periodic signal

I'm currently working on a neural net to predict a pseudo periodic signal like described in [1] . I don't work on ECG signals, but they are a pretty good source for testing. Because I'm rather new in this field, I started with something simpler - predicting a sine. So I've created a NN with 3 sigmoid neurons in layer one and one linear neuron in layer 2 - but the result isn't what I expected. I'm using online training and RPROP btw. Now, my questions are: 1) Should I switch to batch training for this purpose? 2) What NN size do I need to predict something like a simple sine? PS: Predicting simple constant values is working fine, so I expect my code to be working. best Julz [1]: Babusiak, B., & Mohylova, J. (2011). The EEG signal prediction by using neural network.
