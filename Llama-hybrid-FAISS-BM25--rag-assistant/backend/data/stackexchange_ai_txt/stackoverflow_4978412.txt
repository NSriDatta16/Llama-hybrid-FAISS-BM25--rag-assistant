Time series modeling in f#-- seq vs array vs vector vs list vs generic list

If I want to make a time series type in F# to hold stock prices, which basic type should I use? We need Select a subset based on time index, Calculate basic statistics for a subset like mean, STD or for several subsets like correlations, Append item for new data and fast update statistics or technical indicators, Do linear regression between time series, etc I have read that array has a better performance, seq has a smaller memory footnote, list is better for adding items and F# vector is easier for certain math calculation. To balance all the trade offs, how would you model a stock price time series in f#? Thanks.
