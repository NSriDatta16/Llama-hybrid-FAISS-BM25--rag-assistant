$P(A\cap B)=P(A)P(B)$ is true if and only if $A$ and $B$ are independent. So, $P(A|B)\neq P(A)$ in general. In your example, it holds because the events are fortunately independent. You already informally found it in your reasoning paragraph, by thinking about the sample space. For a simple counter example, consider the case where $A=B$ . $P(A|B)=1$ clearly, because if you know that $B=A$ happened, the probability of $A$ happening is $1$ .
