For what I've seen in the description, your problem is one of classification rather than regression. A logistic model is often appropriate unless there is some reason to suspect otherwise. The main reason to reject a logistic model is having a variable whose relationship with the output is not monotonous (probability of "success" increases up to a point and then decreases), but I cannot find any of those in your data description. Anyway, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees and Random Forest classification are also sound alternatives
