I love WSS (Windows Sharepoint Services). It's free and installs on W2K3 or W2K8 Server. Very easy to use out of the box. And easily customizable. With Intelligantt you can publish your MS Project files there as well. Then by plugging in Microsoft Office Sharepoint Designer you can built some custom workflows. And of course the favorite integration with Microsoft Office Outlook is always a plus. You can export your calendars and task lists.
