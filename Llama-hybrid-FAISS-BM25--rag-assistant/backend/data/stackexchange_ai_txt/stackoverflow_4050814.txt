Here's something I came to think of: hypothetically speaking; for an arbitrary number of entries in the DB, and an arbitrary length of text (read: many paragraphs, perhaps even pages), matching could be done by building a that holds phrases in the DB and searching on the tree structure. for example assume that database hold the following phrases: Network protocol net protocol apples and pears Network awesomeness Net is teh shit ... your tree would then have Network , net , apples on the top level with Network and net holding subnodes protocol , awesomeness and protocol , is ... respectively. I am not sure if this is what you are looking for though, wrote this only because you mentioned that it was a theoretical question at an interview :)
