This is a very good question! Although a much less common situation than likelihood underflow . If the likelihood at a given proposed value $\theta'$ is exactly $+\infty$, then the chain should move there and not move except to other values of $\theta$ with infinite likelihood. I do not know of such cases. If the likelihood at a given proposed value $\theta'_0$ is much larger than the likelihood at the current value $\theta$ so that $$\dfrac{\pi(\theta') \ell_n(\theta'_0|x)}{\pi(\theta) \ell_n(\theta|x)}\gg 1$$ to the point that it creates an overflow in a computer code, the likelihood can be renormalised by $$\tilde\ell_n(\theta)=\exp\{\log(\ell_n(\theta))-\log(\ell_n(\theta'_0))\}$$ which means that $\tilde\ell_n(\theta'_0)=1$ while $$\dfrac{\pi(\theta'_0) \ell_n(\theta'_0|x)}{\pi(\theta) \ell_n(\theta|x)}=\dfrac{\pi(\theta_0') \tilde\ell_n(\theta'_0|x)}{\pi(\theta) \tilde\ell_n(\theta|x)}$$ This renormalisation somehow turns overflow issues into underflow issues, which are easier to handle because such values of $\theta$ are not of interest for the Markov chain. Note also that a related problem may also happen because of the proposal density $q(\theta'|\theta)$: when the Metropolis-Hastings ratio $$\alpha(\theta,\theta')=\dfrac{\pi(\theta'|x)}{\pi(\theta|x)}\dfrac{q(\theta|\theta')}{q(\theta'|\theta)}\wedge 1$$ is computed, if $q(\theta|\theta')$ is very small, while $q(\theta'|\theta)=\text{O}(1)$ and $\pi(\theta'|x)\approx\pi(\theta|x)$, the chain may get stuck forever at $\theta$. This happens for instance when $\pi(\cdot)$ is almost constant over a large compact and $q(\theta|\theta')$ is the density of a normal $\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2)$ with a small $\sigma$.
