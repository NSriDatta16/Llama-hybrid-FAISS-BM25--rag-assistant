Difference between saving to an xml file and serialization in wp7?

I need to store basic objects (with a maximum of 5 properites in each object) when my application is closed or deactivated. Now I understand the event handlers we have available to us but I'm not so sure about how to go about saving the objects so that they can be called later. My original thought was to store the objects to an xml file in isolated storage and just simply read the xml file when the app was open again and reload all objects as needed. But I keep hearing about serialization when it comes to tombstoning. Now this raises some questions: 1.) Is serialization better to use than saving to an xml file in this scenario? 2.) What are the differences between doing one over the other if both store data to be called at a later time? 3.) Why is serialization even an option? Is it because its faster or uses less resources? 4.) If serialization is the way to go in this situation, what resources are available to get started? Thanks in advance.
