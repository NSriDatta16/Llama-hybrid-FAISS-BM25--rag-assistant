What kind of analysis can I make in order to understand which variable impact the most my result?

Here's the thing, I have data from my products in a dataset just like this: id product city sold A00 pd_1 Chicago 1 A01 pd_3 Miami 1 A02 pd_2 Seattle 0 A03 pd_7 Boston 1 A04 pd_8 Boston 0 A05 pd_2 Nashville 0 A05 pd_7 Nashville 0 The last variable is a dummy which tells you if the product was sold (1) or not (0). IDs are unique, product and city no. I want to know where is my problem, in the type of product or in the city. Since I may be selling things in a small city with less people to buy (or the product may not be suitable to people there), city may be impacting my sales. However, the product may also not be interesting. So, how can I analyse that? Any thoughts and recommendations? At first, I thought a logistic regression could help me here. But there are too many cities and products. Transforming them in dummy variables would not work. So, what can I do here? I know it's kind of a vague issue, but since I've been thinking about this a lot and I have no clue at all, I would really appreciate any idea.
