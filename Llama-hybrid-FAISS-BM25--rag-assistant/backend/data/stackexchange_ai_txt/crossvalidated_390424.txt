Theorem of total probability with basketball players

Suppose you have a player from team A and a player from team B. You know that one of them has a 60% chance to make a shot and other has 40% chance to make a shot, but you are not sure which is which. Suppose you choose 1 of the 2 players to shoot, how would you go about calculating his probability of missing. My train of thought was that I could calculate it using law of total probability, but I got stuck along the way. let $G$ = event that player is the better of the two My equation was $$ P(miss) = P(miss | G) * P(G) + (miss | \overline G) * P (\overline G) $$ , but I was unsure of how to find $P(G)$ Alternatively, I thought maybe you could just average out the two chances and it would end up being 50/50, but that seemed off the mark. Is there a better way of going about solving this or did I just miss something along the way? Thanks
