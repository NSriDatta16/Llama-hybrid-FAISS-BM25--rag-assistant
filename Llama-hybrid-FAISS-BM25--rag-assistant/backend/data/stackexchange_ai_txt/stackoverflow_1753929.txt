__LP64__ is a gcc preprocessor macro that is nonzero whenever you are building the 64bit data model regardless of the OS X version you are building on. Another macro that will be nonzero is __x86_64__ when building for 64bit Intel processors. You can find more information about these and other macros at developer.apple.com . You can specify a deployment target for your XCode project, which will specify the minimum permissible OS version on which your application can run. You can leverage this setting in your code to conditionally enable/disable parts of it; see this mailing list post for more info.
