Using more functions can be helpful, and it can be hurtful. In theory it moves you more towards modular design, meaning you can use a function over and over in multiple apps without having to re-write it. I would honestly encourage you to more toward larger conventions, like the MVC Frameworks out there. Kohana is a great one. It uses things like Helpers for additional outside functionality, Models to query the database, and Controllers to perform all of your logic - and the end-result is passed on to the View to be formatted with HTML/CSS and spiced up with Javascript.
