How do I output more than 255 characters in an Excel cell using Spreadsheet_Excel_Writer() in php?

I am trying to output a few paragraphs of text in an Excel spreadsheet, but right now the text is truncated to display only 255 characters. The code is pretty straightforward: $xls =& new Spreadsheet_Excel_Writer(); $sheet =& $xls->addWorksheet($name); foreach ($rec as $field) { $rec = ($rec['data'] ? $rec['data'] : $rec); $sheet->write($row, $col++, $field); } Is there anything I can do to get all of the text, not just the 255 chars?
