Is there a way to enforce factor importance in random forest/xgboost

Suppose I have 3 predictors to predict stock returns. 1 of the 3 is known for ages and is still doing well. The rest 2 are newly found ones. So in a crude portfolio construction fashion, I'd do $s = 0.8s_1 + 0.1s_2 + 0.1s_3$ and then take position proportional to $s$ , to reflect that I'm more confident in the first factor than the other two. Now I have say 50 factors and 5 of them are more traditional and hence more trustworthy (by my subjective opinion). When I try fitting a random forest or xgboost using all the factors, is there a way to tell the model that I trust some factors more than the others? What I want is to control the resulting prediction to be at least $x\%$ correlated with the traditional factors. And of course, I'm happy to sacrifice some predictive power for that.
