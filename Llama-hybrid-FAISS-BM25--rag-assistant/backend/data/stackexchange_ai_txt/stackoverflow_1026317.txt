Creating "complex forms" in FileMaker - is it even possible?

I have been asked to look into FileMaker for creating a pretty simple database app. The application will handle contact information, some information about events hosted by the organization and - and this is where I'm currently struggling - RSVP information that link the contacts and events, as well as stores some data about payment. What I would like to use is some kind of form where the user gets to search for a contact (any combo of first/last name) and an event (any combo of name/date), select each from two respective lists (where all other information is displayed as well, to distinguish the results), add some extra information and hit submit. The closest I've gotten so far is a form where the user can enter a ContactId and EventId manually, which means that he/she first has to go to another view, search for the records, and copy/paste the id numbers. Is there really no way to get closer to my vision using FileMaker? Would a better option be to build a new, custom app using for example C# and MsSQL? If so, how do I sell this to my contractor? As this would in that case be my first commercial application, there is obviously a "safety factor" that speaks in favor of an established product. And then we haven't even mentioned that the cost would probably increase, as developing a new app from scratch would take much longer time. Note: I have no previous experience with FileMaker. I've tried to read the documentation, but I haven't been able to find any tutorials that take me closer to my specific needs. I'm fairly experienced in MsSQL, so I do know this and that about database management in general - just not in FileMaker.
