Do I need to run PCA over all predictors in a regression model? Can I run it only over the continuous ones?

I'm looking at the Lending Club data from Kaggle and I'm just building a pretty simple model to predict defaults. The data has a large amount of both continuous and categorical variables (I have converted them to binary variables) in it, and now I want to look at doing some dimensionality reduction on it. Whether it will add any value I'm unsure, but the sheer number of continuous variables makes me feel like an approach like this could be useful. Background: I'm familiar with the PCA approach but not any other approaches that deal with categorical data. So in terms of sticking with my strengths, could I use the PCA approach to reduce the dimensionality of the continuous data , combine the dimensionality reduced data with the dummy data and then run my model over the top? I know we might be getting into some scaling issues (as the PCA will require scaling but the dummy variables won't), but are there any theoretical issues you can see cropping up?
