Because you're using eval, the Javascript interpreter is getting invoked twice - so you need quadruple backslashes, not double: var s = "document.getElementById('mainTabs').innerHTML='\\\\\\\\C\\\\ganye\\\\file.doc'"; This results in s getting set to: document.getElementById('mainTabs').innerHTML='\\\\C\\ganye\\file.doc' so the innerHTML gets set to: \\C\ganye\file.doc which is what you wanted. (I'm not sure I understand your reasons for needing eval(), but this is how to work around the problem if you do :-)
