In general there is no law what prior to select or how to select it. It remains a difficult question. There are three strategies: non-informative , conjugate and expert priors. Non-Informative : If you have no prior knowledge the safest choice is literally the non-informative prior, e.g. the uniform distribution. The choice of a non-informational prior is well justified by the desire to reduce the subjective element as much as possible. Jeffrey's prior might be a valid choice as well. Conjugate : Conjugate priors have the nice property that the resulting distribution of the posterior is from the same probability family as the prior. This has computational advantages since we can find analytic formulas and there is no need for computational costly methods to calculate the posterior. See Conjugate prior for some conjugate priors. Expert : The last prior is one defined the one or several experts. Note : The prior distribution should be defined before looking at the data. So in your case taking the distribution over the entire data set kinda defeats the Bayesian approach.
