using excel function on group of numbers with steady jumps

i have a column A with about 10,000 random numbers. I want to perform a function ( =MAX() for instance) on group of 100 numbers every time, i.e. i want to do =MAX(A1:A101) then =MAX(A102:A202) =MAX(A203:A303) etc... notice there's no overlapping in the groups. normal Dragging doesn't work, it will perform jumps of 1 for each side of the values how do i do it so i can drag and it will continue from the last value, and to another group of 100 ? Thanks
