How do repeated examples in the bootstrap sample affect building of a random forest?

Random forest algorithm builds many decision trees using bootstrap samples from the original dataset. (Individual trees use only a subset of the features but my question is not related to that). Each the tree gets a dataset with repeated examples. My question is this: do we need to use these repeated examples in building individual trees? In other words, what happens if we just use the unique examples in the bootstrapped sample? When I think of the decision tree algorithm, two different trees will be produced if we give one of the the bootstrapped sample and the other only the unique examples in it. Repeated examples will create a kind of weight on those examples. So, it makes a difference, I think, to use repeated examples, however, the main idea behind random forests is variance reduction, I do not understand how using repeated examples help reducing variance. So, from this perspective, the performance of a random forest will not be affected if repeated examples are not used. I appreciate any clarification on these issues. Thanks.
