How do I use stackshot to debug my application?

I've recently been told about a useful debugging tool on Mac OS X called stackshot , however I don't know how to invoke it. My understanding from the documentation is that it runs as a daemon, but the man page also reads as if it can be invoked from the command line. How would I go about leveraging stackshot for my currently-running application?
