org.w3c.dom.Document to String without javax.xml.transform

I've spent a while looking around on Google for a way to convert a org.w3c.dom.Document to a string representation of the whole DOM tree, so I can save the object to file system. However all the solutions I've found use javax.xml.transform.Transformer which isn't supported as part of the Android 2.1 API. How can I do this without using this class/containing package?
