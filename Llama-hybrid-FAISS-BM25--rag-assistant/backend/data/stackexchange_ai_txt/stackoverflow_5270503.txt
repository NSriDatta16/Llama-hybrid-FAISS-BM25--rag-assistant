Resolve my confusion about SVN "projects" on a remote repository

I've been getting up to speed on SVN and have an idea of the basics. However, there's one point of confusion for me that I'd like help understanding. I've done a bunch of reading through this great guide I found linked elsewhere on StackOverflow: http://svnbook.red-bean.com/nightly/en/svn.tour.importing.html#svn.tour.importing.layout In particular, I'm taking their recommendation to arrange my repository with my 3 projects as follows: \repository\projectA\trunk \repository\projectA\branches \repository\projectA\tags \repository\projectB\trunk \repository\projectB\branches \repository\projectB\tags However, my question isn't about the arrangement above as there are a hundred questions on SO concerning that already. Instead, my question is about how remote repositories work wrt to the organization I want and how TortoiseSVN works with it. I'm using xp-dev in particular but this question applies to the other remote SVN repositories I saw (like codesion). I didn't see a way to create a repository, only a "project". So I'm confused between the terminology of "project" compared to the term "remote repository' as it appears as far as I"m concerned there are only "remote projects". So given I want to arrange my repository like I described above, should I be creating 2 project on xp-dev ("projectA" and "projectB") or a single project (say "foo") with 2 sub-folders in it?
