You can approximate a time series with a polynomial of degree n_degree by using ridge regression. You can try different degree numbers (e.g. [2,3,4,5,6] ) and choose the best one. Keep in mind that higher degree models, always get lower error values. So you should somehow penalize higher degrees. from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline for count, degree in enumerate([2, 3, 4, 5, 6]): model = make_pipeline(PolynomialFeatures(degree), Ridge()) model.fit(Time, y) More details here .
