"Elegant" way to get list of list of property values from List of objects?

Say I have a Customer class with the usual properties: CustomerID , Name , etc. As a result of a query, I get a generic list of Customer objects: List Is there an elegant way to get an array/list of CustomerID or Name property values from this generic list? (i.e. string[] customerIDs = ???? ) I know I could do a foreach and fill an array during the loop, but was just wondering if there were a more elegant way through LINQ extensions and/or lambda expressions to do this. Thanks.
