The way I would attack the problem, in general, is to leverage statistical analysis like Principal Component Analysis or Ordinary Least Squares to help determine what attributes within these protein sequences are best suited to classify proteins as Neuropeptide hormone precursors. In order to do that, you'll have to convert the protein sequences into numeric data, but I believe some work has already been done in that regard using formulas leveraged in Amino Acid PCA. See these two links: Principal components analysis of protein sequence clusters Amino Acid Principal Component Analysis (AAPCA) and its applications in protein structural class prediction Once that work has been done, I would attempt to classify using the entire dataset and a reinforcement learning algorithm, like Naive Bayes while slimming down the data into that which PCA has identified as important. The reason I would try to use Bayes is that it has proven to be one of the best methods for determining spam vs. regular email, which has a similarly skewed dataset. Having said all of that... Slimming down the number or type of negative classifications might skew your results a few points one way or the other, but I don't think you'll see the long term effectiveness change substantially until you do the leg work of determining how to best remove the fuzziness from your training data. That will either require a field expert or statistical analysis. I could be completely off base. I am interested in seeing some other answers, but that is my 2 cents.
