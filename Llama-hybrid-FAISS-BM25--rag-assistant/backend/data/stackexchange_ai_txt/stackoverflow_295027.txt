Array of zero length

I am working on refactoring some old code and have found few structs containing zero length arrays (below). Warnings depressed by pragma, of course, but I've failed to create by "new" structures containing such structures (error 2233). Array 'byData' used as pointer, but why not to use pointer instead? or array of length 1? And of course, no comments were added to make me enjoy the process... Any causes to use such thing? Any advice in refactoring those? struct someData { int nData; BYTE byData[0]; } NB It's C++, Windows XP, VS 2003
