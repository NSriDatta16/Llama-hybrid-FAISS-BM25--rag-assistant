Simulating from the normal $\mathcal{N}(\mu,\sigma^2)$ distribution until the outcome falls within an interval $(a,b)$ is fine when the probability $$ \varrho = \int_a^b \varphi_{\mu,\sigma^2}(x)\,\text{d} x $$ is large enough. If it is too small, this procedure is too costly since the average number of draws for one acceptance is $1/\varrho$. As described in Monte Carlo Statistical Methods (Chapter 2, Example 2.2), as well as in my arXiv paper , a more efficient way to simulate this truncated normal is to use an accept-reject method based on an exponential $\mathcal{E}(\alpha)$ distribution. Consider, without loss of generality, the case $\mu = 0$ and $\sigma = 1$. When $b=+\infty$, a potential instrumental distribution is the translated exponential distribution, $\mathcal{E} (\alpha,{ a})$, with density $$ g_{\alpha}(z) = \alpha e^{- \alpha(z - {a})} \; \mathbb{I}_{z \geq {a }} \;. $$ The ratio $$ p_{a,\infty}(z)/g_{\alpha}(z) \propto e^{- \alpha(z - a )}e^{-z^{2}/2} $$ is then bounded by $\exp(\alpha^{2}/2 - \alpha{a })$ if $\alpha > a$ and by $\exp(- a^{2}/2)$ otherwise. The corresponding (upper) bound is $$ \begin{cases} 1/\alpha \; \exp (\alpha^{2}/2 - \alpha{a }) & \hbox{if } \alpha > a , \cr 1/\alpha \; \exp (- a^{2}/2) & \hbox{otherwise.} \cr \end{cases} $$ The first expression is minimized by \begin{equation} \alpha^{*} = \frac{1}{2}a + \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{a^2 + 4}\;,\qquad (1) \end{equation} whereas $\tilde\alpha = a $ minimizes the second bound. The optimal choice of $\alpha$ is therefore (1).
