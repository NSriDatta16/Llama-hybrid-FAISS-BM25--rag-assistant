You can use ColdBox Viewlets, which basically makes the views self sufficient when rendered. This means that you basically render the widget "renderView("widgets/myWidget")" Then inside of your widget, you will broadcast an event for data retrieval. Basically, calling the view's controller layer. Then your widget will be ready for use and be bound only to its announced event.
