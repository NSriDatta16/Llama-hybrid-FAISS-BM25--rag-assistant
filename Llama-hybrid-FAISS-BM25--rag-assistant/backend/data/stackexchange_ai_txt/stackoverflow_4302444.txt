there are some mistakes in your code - the first: you havn't closed you p -tag: Search next: p stands for 'paragraph' and is a block-element (so it's causing a line-break). what you wanted to use there is a span , wich is just an inline-element for formatting: Search but if you just want to add a style to your link, why don't you set the style for that link directly: Search in the end, this would at least be correct html, but still not exactly what you want, because text-align:center centers the text in that element , so you would have to set that for the element that contains this links (this piece of html isn't posted, so i can't correct you, but i hope you understand) - to show this, i'll use a simple div : Search EDIT: some more additions to your question: p is not a 'function', but you're right, this is causing the problem (because it's a block-element) what you're trying to use is css - it's just inline instead of being placed in a seperate file, but you aren't doing 'just HTML' here
