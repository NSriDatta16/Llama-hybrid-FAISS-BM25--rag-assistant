jQuery droppable and scrollable divs

I have a little problem with jQuery UI 's droppable component, but I'm not quite sure whether I have that problem because of my code or because of a bug in the component. I have a div with a fixed width and height. The overflow-x for that div is set to hidden, overflow-y is set to auto. Within that div I have some more div's. So many of them that the outer div starts scrolling. Each of the inner divs is a droppable, accepting a draggable which is outside the wrapper div. If I drag & drop the draggable item somewhere within the wrapper, everything works fine. The problem is that the drop event gets even triggered if I drop the element shortly below the wrapper div. I'm not really good at explaining the problem; therefore here is some code which reproduces the problem: http://jsfiddle.net/2p56Y/ Simply drag and drop the "Drag Me!" container below the div with the scrollbar. Unexpectedly you will see the alert "dropped". Now something interesting: If you scroll down to item "Test28" and now you drag and drop the draggable below the wrapper, the drop event won't be triggered. It looks like the hidden elements are still accessible when you drop something on them. So, is this a bug or do I need to write my code differently to make it work? (or both? :-) )
