You could do this with Linked Server or an SSIS job running on SQL Agent which may well have been easier but... to tackle your question itself: You mention trying different accounts to run the service - have you granted any of those accounts the appropriate rights on your target database to allow the service to update the data. Do they also have rights on your source (Access) database to read it. Have you checked the Event Logs on the server and the SQL Server logs to look for reported errors, failed logins etc? You could hook up the debugger to your running service to try and identify the problem whilst it's running or alternatively you need to write in some kind logging statements so that you can identify where your code is getting up to before it fails and log out the error message(s) so give you something to work with.
