In my application the model layer is XML based, I use LINQ To XML (supported by SL) pretty good stuff (if you are handling XML that are bellow some Mb, it's like DOM builds up the tree in memory). On the other hand to store the XML in the isolated storage, or in the server I just convert the XML into an string, quite standard param :), only take care when using services to configure the params tu support more than 64 K's string parametrs (if you are in that case).
