Had a quick look at the code as it is now. NullPointerException at line 169 of DragableSpace, due to no child view - fix this by adding a child view in the MainActivity: TextView child = new TextView(this); child.setText("This is a Test"); space.addView(child); So now the code runs and logs the touch events to LogCat but nothing appears to happen (I'm guessing you want 3 spaces which can be dragged and repositioned on the screen) - some initial problems, I think, the SNAP_VELOCITY value of 1000 seems a bit high to me for some dragging gestures, none of the layout xml files appear to be used, and if the current 'screen' is the full width and height of the device, where does it get dragged to? Updated: Add the previous post's xml layout as the main.xml: Now, in the MainActivity, set the content as: setContentView(R.layout.main); Also, to make it easier to see what's happening, I set the background colours to different colours - add the following colours to the strings.xml file: #21d081 #00A0FF #EA6700 And edit the screen xml files to add a colour e.g. in the left_screen.xml file, add the following attribute: android:background="@color/blue" And use a different colour for the initial_screen.xml and the right_screen.xml and when you run the project, you can drag across the screen and reveal a new area.
