Logistic regression is actually quite inflexible, since it is linear in the logit, a fact that is somewhat obscured by the fact that the plot on the original scale is nonlinear. In the present case, it tries to fit both in the middle and at the extremes of the predictor, and it's at the extremes that it is visible it's not doing a good job. You rather obviously have a lot of data, at least in this (toy?) example, so you could address the nonlinearity by using a spline transform of the predictor. However, judging from the blue dots in your graph, you actually simulated data that is not well described by the logit in the first place, since the probabilities are discontinuous. If you have reason to suspect discontinuities, you could certainly model them (but discontinuities rarely happen in nature). With less data, you can easily overfit using splines, so I would recommend that you do cross-validation to select the number of spline knots, and then are very careful about any inferential statistics you might want to do, but that is already dubious because of your large amount of data.
