I'd break it down like this, into a weighted average. A 68% chance of it being in the file; under these circumstances an average of 50 comparisons will be needed from your result in part I. A 32% chance of the record NOT being in the file; under these circumstances you will need to look through every record, i.e 100 comparisons. 0.68*50 + 0.32*100 = 66 comparisons on average. But it has been a while since I took a course on probability...
