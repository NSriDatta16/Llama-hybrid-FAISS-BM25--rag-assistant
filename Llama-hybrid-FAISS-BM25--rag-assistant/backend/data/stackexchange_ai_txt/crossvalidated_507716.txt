Performing Bagging with the Lasso

I asked this question at StackOverflow but I think it might be better suited for here because I'm hoping to understand the general idea of bagging. I'm trying to implement bagging in R but am having a hard time performing this task with my own function. From my understanding, bagging is essentially taking the average result from B bootstrap estimates. I know caret has a method for performing bagging, mostly with CART methods, but it seems unclear how to implement a function personally developed such as the example below. library(glmnet) library(boot) boot_fn From my understanding of bagging, I believe it would be possible to perform the bootstrap using the boot package and averaging the results from the bootstrap estimate dataframe. set.seed(1) matrix In general, I'm trying to understand if this is an accurate technique for bagging? Am I correct in taking the average from all bootstrap estimates to determine my prediction model? Alternatively, is there a better method for implementing a personal function to perform bagging? I've tried using caret but it's not clear to me how to input my function and feels cumbersome. Thanks in advance.
