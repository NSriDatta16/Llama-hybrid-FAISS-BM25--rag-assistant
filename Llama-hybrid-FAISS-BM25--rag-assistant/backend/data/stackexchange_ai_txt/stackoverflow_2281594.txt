One trick I've used within SQL is to DELETE TOP 1000 (or 100 or 10000, depending on the average number of rows in a page), like so: DELETE top 1000 WHERE timestamp Call this repeatedly until no rows are deleted (check with @@rowcount) or you run out of time. Can this technique be implemented in JPA?
