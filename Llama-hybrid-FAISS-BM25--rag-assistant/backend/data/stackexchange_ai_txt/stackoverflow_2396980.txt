Attaching JQuery delegate for more than one event to a handler

I read that the new delegate method can attach more than one event to a handler however I have not see this in practice. Would anyone type a code for this please. I tried: $("body").delegate("input", "mouseup", "mouseover", function() { $(this).after(" Another paragraph! "); }); and it appended the paragraph only on mouseup. I am confused.
