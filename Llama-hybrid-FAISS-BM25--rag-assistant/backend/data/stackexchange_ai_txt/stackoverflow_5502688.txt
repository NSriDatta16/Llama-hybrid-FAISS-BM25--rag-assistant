Using Markov chains (or something similar) to produce an IRC-bot

I tried google and found little that I could understand. I understand Markov chains to a very basic level: It's a mathematical model that only depends on previous input to change states..so sort of a FSM with weighted random chances instead of different criteria? I've heard that you can use them to generate semi-intelligent nonsense, given sentences of existing words to use as a dictionary of kinds. I can't think of search terms to find this, so can anyone link me or explain how I could produce something that gives a semi-intelligent answer? (if you asked it about pie, it would not start going on about the vietnam war it had heard about) I plan on: Having this bot idle in IRC channels for a bit Strip any usernames out of the string and store as sentences or whatever Over time, use this as the basis for the above.
