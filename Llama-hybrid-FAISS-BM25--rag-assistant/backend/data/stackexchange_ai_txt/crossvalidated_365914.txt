Ways of analyzing frequency of visits

Suppose that there is a store with sections and we need to draw conclusions from a sample on the frequency of visits to the sections. Do not worry about how the sample was collected. Also, we are not interested in generalizing to population. The data that we have is laid out in the following way: $$ \begin{array}{cccccc} & \text{Section } 1 & \text{Section } 2 & \text{Section } 3 & \cdots & \text{Section } n \\ \text{Customer } 1 & a_{1,1} & a_{1,2} & a_{1,3} & & a_{1,n} \\ \text{Customer } 2 & a_{2,1} & a_{2,2} & a_{2,3} & & a_{2,n} \\ \text{Customer } 3 & a_{3,1} & a_{3,2} & a_{3,3} & & a_{3,n} \\ \vdots & & & & & \\ \text{Customer } m & a_{m,1} & a_{m,2} & a_{m,3} & & a_{m,n} \end{array} $$ where $a_{i,j}$ is the number of times that the customer $i$ visited the section $j$. Every customer was asked to provide how many times he visited the sections within the same period of time. To give an example, here is how a store with 3 sections and 3 customers was visited. $$ \begin{array}{cccc} & \text{Section } 1 & \text{Section } 2 & \text{Section } 3 \\ \text{Customer } 1 & 1 & 3 & 2 \\ \text{Customer } 2 & 2 & 2 & 4 \\ \text{Customer } 3 & 0 & 1 & 1 \end{array} $$ Given that data I would be tempted to say that section 3 is the most visited section, followed by section 2, and finally section 1. We can say that section 1 had 1 + 2 + 0 = 3 visits, section 2 had 3 + 2 + 1 = 6 visits, and section 3 had 2 + 4 + 1 = 7 visits. 16 visits were done in total. So in this case, section 1 was visited 3 / 16 = 0.1875 times, section 2 was visited 6 / 16 = 0.375 times, and section 3 was visited 7 / 16 = 0.4375 times. However, if a customer goes a lot to the store but visits each section with the same frequency, the previous reasoning would lead to erroneous conclusions: $$ \begin{array}{cccc} & \text{Section 1} & \text{Section 2} & \text{Section 3} \\ \text{Customer 1} & 10 & 30 & 20 \\ \text{Customer 2} & 2 & 2 & 4 \\ \text{Customer 3} & 0 & 1 & 1 \end{array} $$ Section 1 had 12 visits, section 2 had 33 visits, and section 3 had 25 visits. 70 visits total. Now section 2 is the most visited, followed by section 3, and finally by section 1. The analysis should have shown that section 3 is the most visited section, followed by section 2, and finally section 1. This means that the above approach is fragile. I suspect that the reason is that we have an outlier and the mean is sensitive to outliers. Does it make sense to lay out the data in this way? Can we say that the columns (Section 1, Section 2, Section 3, ..., Section n) are the variables (they could be renamed to "Visits to section"), and that the rows are the observations? What is a good approach to tackle this problem?
