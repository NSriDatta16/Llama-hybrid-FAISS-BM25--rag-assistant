Note that I haven't tried this myself, but looking at the source code, the below mentioned steps should work: Make sure that the ASTParser is created using setResolveBindings(true) Get all of the VariableDeclarationFragments by calling VariableDeclarationStatement.fragments() . For each fragment you are interested in, call resolveBinding() . For each binding, you should be able to call getJavaElement() .
