jQueryUI: selectable - cancel option when dragging the lasso over an element

the cancel option on selectable does the following: Prevents selecting if you start on elements matching the selector. Is there a build-in way to make it ignore elements even if you drag over them? Cause with cancel it only works if you start from the element but if you start from a selectable element and drag the lasso over one of the canceled elements it will still select them. If there isn't a build-in way I guess I have to add it myself with the selecting event.
