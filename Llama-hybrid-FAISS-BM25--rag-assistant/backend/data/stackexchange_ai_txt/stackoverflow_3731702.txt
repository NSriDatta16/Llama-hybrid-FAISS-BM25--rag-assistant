Qt4: Write a function that creates a dialog and returns the choice of the user

Not sure if this has a straightforward solution, but I want to write a function that shows a dialog (defined elsewhere in a class that inherits QDialog ) and returns the user input when the user has finished interacting with the dialog. In other words, something similar to the QFileDialog::getOpenFileName static method, where a single line can open the dialog and return the user's input, instead of employing the cumbersome (in this case) signal/slot mechanism. Intended use: /* Shows the dialog, waits until user presses OK or Cancel, then returns the user's choice. */ result = createDialogAndReturnUserChoice() I am currently working in PyQt but I'm fine with answers in the traditional Qt4 C++ framework. EDIT// Here's how to do it: dialog = CustomDialog() # creates the custom dialog we have defined in a class inheriting QDialog if dialog.exec_(): # on exec_(), the whole program freezes until the user is done with the dialog; it returns the response of the user # success else: # failure
