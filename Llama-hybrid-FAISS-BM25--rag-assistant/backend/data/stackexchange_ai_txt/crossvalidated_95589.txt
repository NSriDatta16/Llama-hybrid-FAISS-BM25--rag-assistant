I would consider a fractional logit model, which can be implemented as a GLM with binomial family, a logit link, and heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors. This can accommodate 0s and 1s if those occur through the same process as the intermediate proportions. Showing us a kernel density of your outcome may help in deciding whether this is an appropriate route: a big mass point at zero and/or one would call that into question. A zero and/or one inflated beta is something to think about if you want to relax the same DGP assumption. In econometrics, the standard fractional logit reference is Papke, L.E. and J.W. Wooldridge (1996) " Econometric Methods for Fractional Response Variables With an Application to 401 (K) Plan Participation Rates ," Journal of Applied Econometrics. Vol 11, No. 6, pp. 619-632, though this idea was independently rediscovered by them. Here's an example with Stata where I get the marginal effects. We will model the fraction of students that receive a free lunch (range [0,1]) and how that's related to a test score, having a year-round program at the test school, and average parental education: . use http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/stata/faq/proportion, clear . glm meals i.yr_rnd parented api99 , link(logit) family(binomial) vce(robust) nolog note: meals has noninteger values Generalized linear models No. of obs = 4257 Optimization : ML Residual df = 4253 Scale parameter = 1 Deviance = 395.8141242 (1/df) Deviance = .093067 Pearson = 374.7025759 (1/df) Pearson = .0881031 Variance function: V(u) = u*(1-u/1) [Binomial] Link function : g(u) = ln(u/(1-u)) [Logit] AIC = .7220973 Log pseudolikelihood = -1532.984106 BIC = -35143.61 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | Robust meals | Coef.

In this case, there's substantial mass point near 1, but a one-inflated beta gets -11 and robust OLS yields -13. When in doubt, report all estimates. Hopefully the choice of model won't matter too much, and the curmudgeons can have their preferred specifications. You can also look at the covariate-adjusted fraction for various levels of parented: . margins, at(parented ==(1(1)5)) noatlegend Predictive margins Number of obs = 3678 Model VCE : Robust Expression : Predicted mean meals, predict() ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | Delta-method | Margin Std.

For readers unfamiliar with the US education system, we have a government-subsidized program where children from families with incomes at or below 130 percent of the poverty level are eligible for free or discounted meals in public and nonprofit private schools.
