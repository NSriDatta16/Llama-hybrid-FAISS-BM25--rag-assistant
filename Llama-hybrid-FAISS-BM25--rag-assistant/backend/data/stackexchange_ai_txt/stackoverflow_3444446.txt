log4j.properties being ignored

I have a Java EE 6 Wicket application deployed with maven using IntelliJ IDEA 9.0.3 on glassfish v3.0.1. I use slf4j-log4j12-1.5.6 with slf4j-api-1.5.8 and log4j-1.2.16 for logging. It was previously working fine when I deployed through netbeans or eclipse, however when I deploy with IntelliJ IDEA my log4j.properties file is ignored and glassfish's logging handles my log messages. I do not think IDEA has anything to do with it, something else must have changed I just can't figure out what. I have verified that my log4j.properties file is in my WEB-INF/classes directory and the slf4j/log4j jars are in the WEB-INF/lib directory of my war. Is there some sort of configuration I am missing to make this work? thanks. edit: Updated with more info, posted pom dependencies. Here is the relevant section from my pom.xml: com.google.guava guava r05 junit junit 4.7 test org.glassfish.extras glassfish-embedded-all 3.0 test org.glassfish bean-validator 3.0-JBoss-4.0.0.Beta3 provided javax javaee-api 6.0 provided org.apache.wicket wicket 1.4.9 org.apache.wicket wicket-auth-roles 1.4.9 org.jboss.weld weld-wicket 1.0.1-Final org.hibernate hibernate-core 3.5.1-Final org.hibernate hibernate-annotations 3.5.1-Final org.hibernate hibernate-commons-annotations 3.2.0.Final org.hibernate hibernate-entitymanager 3.5.1-Final org.hibernate hibernate-c3p0 3.5.1-Final postgresql postgresql 8.4-701.jdbc4 org.slf4j slf4j-log4j12 1.5.6 log4j log4j 1.2.16
