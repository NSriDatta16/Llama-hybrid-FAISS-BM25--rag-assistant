XML selectNodes using Classic ASP

XML problem that's got me stumped, but is probably very simple... The XML is like: 16 Sep 2009 Jez text text number 1 High St UK text number text House 2 1 text long-text 80 sq. mt No Of Bedrooms : 2 Condition : Habitable Land Size (M2): 2,000 URL URL URL URL text url text url And the code I would like to use is: Set NodeList = objXML.documentElement.selectNodes("agents/agent/properties/property") For Each Node In NodeList 'I want to be able to extract distinct fields here... response.write Node.selectSingleNode("address/street") & " " response.write Node.selectSingleNode("description/briefDescription") & " " Next But, I don't know how. ALso, this could be a problem with, for example, the and tags. Suggestions please?
