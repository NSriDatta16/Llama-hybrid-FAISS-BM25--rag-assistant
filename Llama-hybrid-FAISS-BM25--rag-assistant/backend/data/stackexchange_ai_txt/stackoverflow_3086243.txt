Varchar is the most common, but it is only used for ASCII text. NVarchar is the default for storing strings, because it works with Unicode. Char is fixed-length char. It is pretty rare. Almost nobody uses it any more. NChar is fixed-length unicode char. I've never seen it used. Text and NText are unlimited binary storage for huge strings. They cannot be indexed, so you might want to avoid them.
