Using SED to append a string to an existing line of text?

I'm trying to use the linux sed command to append a path element to the RewriteBase in a .htaccess file. I have tried it with this arguments: #current RewriteBase is "RewriteBase /mypath" sed -ie 's/RewriteBase\(.*\)/RewriteBase \1\/add/g' .htaccess with this result: addriteBase /mypath So sed overwrites the the beginning of the replacement string with the last string. Why is that? Another question would be how to prevent to have 2 slashes when the RewriteBase is just "/". RewriteBase / will become RewriteBase //add but should be RewriteBase /add Is there any way to prevent this? If not I can run a second sed command replacing all double slashes with a single one. But maybe there is a more elegant way to do this. I would appreciate any help.
