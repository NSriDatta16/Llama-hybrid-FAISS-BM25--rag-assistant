How to run meta-analysis for simple linear regression coefficient

I have run several independent studies to look at the relationship between a continuous predictor variable X (ranging from 0 to 100) and a continuous outcome variable Y (ranging from 0 to 10). (essentially, several different Y = bX + e linear regressions) Some of the studies found significant effects and some didn't I am now trying to figure out what the average effect size (size and significance) is regarding the relationship between X and Y, but am having trouble figuring out how to do this I have experience doing something similar using a categorical predictor variable and a continuous outcome variable using the Metafor package in R, but the current setup is something new to me (as you might be able to tell I'm not well versed in meta-analyses) I've looked at the following posts: Link 1 Link 2 but I still wasn't sure how to do this I'm not even sure what the effect size I'm trying to calculate is (f^2?).. Any tutorial websites or instruction websites that give example codes would also be greatly appreciated!
