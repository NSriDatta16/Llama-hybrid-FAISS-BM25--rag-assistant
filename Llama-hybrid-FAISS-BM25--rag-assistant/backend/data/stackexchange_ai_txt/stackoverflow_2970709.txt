The best resource, although outdated in several aspects (it only covers PHP until version 5.1) is Extending and Embedding PHP by Sara Golemon. Even more outdated is the PHP documentation . On the other hand, the content on the PHP wiki is very up-to-date, but also quite incomplete and not very oriented for beginners. See also these articles , part V of Advanced PHP Programming by George Schlossnagle, chapter 14 of Programming PHP by Rasmus Lerdorf and Kevin Tatroe and, specially, these slides . Finally, the most authoritative source you'll find is the source code of the extensions bundled with PHP.
