Why Linq to Sql have used this line while creating a property

I was reading Linq to Sql. Here I created a dbml file where I found that an autogenerated property has been created [Column(Storage="_RecursionLevel", DbType="Int")] public System.Nullable RecursionLevel { get { return this._RecursionLevel; } set { if ((this._RecursionLevel != value)) { this._RecursionLevel = value; } } } Here why if ((this._RecursionLevel != value)) line is written. What is the purpose. Why not directly assigned the value. What benefit they got
