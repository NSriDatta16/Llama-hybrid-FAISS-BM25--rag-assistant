Here's a way: Provided that each document has an id, and that duplicate documents have the same id: mark the indexes by I1..Im. for i in 1..m, let Ci = all the indexes but Ii for all the documents Dj in Ii, let cur_term = "id: " for Ik in Ci Ik.deleteDocuments(cur_term) merge all indexes The gist is: delete all documents having the same id as the current document from the other indexes. After having done this for all indexes, merge them. I know this is not elegant, but I do not know a better algorithm.
