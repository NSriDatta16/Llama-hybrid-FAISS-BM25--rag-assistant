Letting $Z_t=Y_t/\tau$ where $\tau^2=\sigma^2/(1-\rho^2)$ and $d_i=\Phi^{-1}(\frac i{10})$ , $i=1,2,\dots,9$ denote the corresponding deciles, we have, from the definition of conditional probability, $$ \begin{align} P_{ij}&=\Pr(d_{j-1} where $\Phi_2$ is the cdf of the bivariate standard normal distribution with correlation $\rho$ (available as the function mvtnorm::pmvnorm in R). It does not follow that the process is a first order Markov chain with the $P_{ij}$ 's as the transition probabilities. This is demonstrated numerically below by computing higher order transisition probabilities based on the joint multivariate normal distribution of $Z_t,Z_{t-1},\dots,Z_{t-n}$ using a straightforward generalisation of the above expression. Indeed, the resulting Markov chain does not appear to be of any finite order, analogous to how an for example an AR(1) process plus white noise becomes a non-Markovian ARMA(1,1) process with partial autocorrelation function only tailing off. library(mvtnorm) # Compute the probability of transitioning from state i to j # If i is a vector, the probabability of transitioning to state j # given that the previous states are i[1], i[2], ..., i[n] is # computed. p [1] 0.3240152 # Probability of remaining in state 1 given that the processes # has been in state 1 for up to five previous time points p(c(1, 1), 1, .5) #> [1] 0.3476454 p(c(1, 1, 1), 1, .5) #> [1] 0.3520791 p(c(1, 1, 1, 1), 1, .5) #> [1] 0.3533796 p(c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1), 1, .5) #> [1] 0.353544 Created on 2023-12-30 with reprex v2.0.2
