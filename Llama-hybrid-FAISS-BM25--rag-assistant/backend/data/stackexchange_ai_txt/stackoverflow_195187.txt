This is actual code I once had to support. After struggling to comprehend the logic in AstaSaysGooGoo and AstaSaysGaaGaa (where many more astaTempVars were declared and used ) I was ready to give up. I finally looked up and saw the "@author" comment and the whole thing began to makes sense. /* * @author Andrew Asta */ public class AstaClass{ private String astaVar1; private String astaVar2; private String astaVar3; private String astaVar4; private String astaVar5; private String astaVar6; private String astaVar7; private String astaVar8; private String astaVar9; private String astaVar10; public void AstaSaysGetData(){ //JDBC statement to populate astavars 1 through 10 //... String astaSqlStatment = "Select astaCol1, astaCol2, astaCol3... From AstaTable Where..."; //.. //... } //Perform data manipulation on astavars... public void AstaSaysGaaGaa(){ [removed for sake of brevity] } //Perform more data manipulation on astavars... public void AstaSaysGooGoO(){ [removed for sake of brevity] } public void AstaSaysPersist(){ //JDBC statement to save astavars to DB String astaSqlStatment = "Update AstaTable set astaCol1 = @astaVar1 , set astaCol2 = @astaVar2 , set astaCol3 = astaCol3... Where..."; } } PS I changed the actual authors real name so as to avoid me getting in any disputes etc...
