Closing the loop on this for archiving purposes.... A friend explained this to me offline. The answer is YES. Just as the mean of multiple random samples converges on the true population mean (even if the data are highly non-normal), model parameters fit to multiple random subsets will converge on the true model parameters for the population. In fact, bootstrapping in machine learning takes advantage of this phenomenon. That's what my intuition was, but it's always good to check your intuition.
