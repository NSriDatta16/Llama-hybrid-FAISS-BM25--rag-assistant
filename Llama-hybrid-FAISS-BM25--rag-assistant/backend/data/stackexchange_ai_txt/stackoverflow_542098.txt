javaEE application layout

I've been tasked with writing a new webapp in javaEE, which will be a first for me. I'm familar with the java language, but all of my previous projects have been in .net. So I've downloaded netbeans and I'll probably be using Hibernate, and started digging in. My question is, what's the best way to lay out a javaEE app? Should all data access go through netbeans? I was told to use webservices as much as possible so it's easy to pull data in and out of the system, and I've read through tutorials that create webservices in a seperate web application, as compared to the javaEE enterprise application. Is that really the way it's supposed to work? Just trying to wrap my head around this as compared to what I'm used to in .net. Thanks!
