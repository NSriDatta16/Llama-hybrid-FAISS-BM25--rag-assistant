Together with jQuery.jgrid.defaults defines standard options of jqGrid there are jQuery.jgrid.edit , jQuery.jgrid.view , jQuery.jgrid.del , jQuery.jgrid.nav which you can use. The settings of jQuery.jgrid.edit are common for Add and Edit dialog. For example, jQuery.extend(jQuery.jgrid.edit, { recreateForm: true, jqModal: false, closeAfterAdd: true, closeAfterEdit: true, closeOnEscape:true, savekey: [true, 13]); You can set in the same way some standard event handler which you plan use in all your grids. You wrote in your question that you want set mtype: "POST" , drag: true , resize: true and some other values which are already default (see here ). I recommend you to verify which values are already default. Moreover I strictly recommend you to use recreateForm: true and not default recreateForm: false if you use any customizations or event binding of the dialogs.
