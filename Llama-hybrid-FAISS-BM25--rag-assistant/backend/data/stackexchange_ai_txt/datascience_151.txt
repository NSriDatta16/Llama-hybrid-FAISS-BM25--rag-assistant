Indexing is the almost most important part of data to get an efficient, properly storing and retrieval data from mediums In different Programming Languages, there are different indexing algorithms and structures can be found. As an Example, in Java Language the Apache Foundation's Lucene is very popular. In years there are very efficient, fast, scalable Indexing Algorithms projectioned to the computer-world such as MurMurHashing Algorithm (using by some NoSQL Databases), B+Tree Algorithm (using by versions of Windows OS itself), or Lucene (very popular in web technologies) and its variations. Also there can be found problem-specific Indexing within Chemicals or Medical Data Representations in Digital World
