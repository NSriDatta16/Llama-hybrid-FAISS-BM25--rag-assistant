non-metric multi-dimensional scaling in R: help with plotting and understanding Stress for isoMDS vs. metaMDS

I have a dataframe with 900 observations. There are 11 columns: 9 measured variables and 1 representing region. POINTID Region X1 X2 X3 X4 X5 X6 X7 X8 X9 X10 1 A 21.42 0.54 -0.20 23.91 0.67 4.54 0.72 33.77 0.12 5.99 2 A 7.33 0.61 -0.23 6.21 0.56 3.96 0.73 10.00 0.69 6.62 3 B 8.01 0.58 -0.29 7.31 0.43 4.40 0.53 10.69 0.69 3.93 4 C 11.52 0.38 -0.22 2.49 0.96 3.92 0.64 1.40 0.76 6.96 ... I want to create a plot that shows how the observations fall out in multidimensional space, i.e., to show how separable the different regions are. I've been advised that non-metric multi-dimensional scaling would be appropriate. First, I have to create a distance matrix. So, I use the function dist() in R. d Then I use this distance matrix in the isoMDS() function in the MASS library in R. fit Then I plot the data. plot(fit$points, type="n") #Label them with Region rather than POINTID text(fit$points, labels = mydata$Region, cex=.7) Question1: How do I make a plot that shows the results of the MDS plotted with respect to the original 9 measured variables? I'd like to see along which variables in particular are they most separable. Question2: When I use isoMDS() from the MASS library, I get a very high Stress value (0.2). I also tried using the metaMDS() function from the vegan library. In this case I get much lower stress values (approx 0.01). Can someone explain why this might be?
