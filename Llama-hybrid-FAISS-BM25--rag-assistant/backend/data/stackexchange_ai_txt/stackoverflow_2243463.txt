Anyone who has access to your secret key has complete control over your application. This page shows all the admin settings they can change with the admin.setAppProperties API call . This could include putting the application into developer mode (so nobody else could use it), changing the callback URL (which would break it) or all kinds of other mischief. I'm not sure I entirely understand what you're trying to do, but I think if you look at the documentation for session secrets then you may find a solution that doesn't involve embedding the app's secret key but still lets the user interact with the API. Session secrets are used by Facebook Connect and allow API calls to be made without an application secret. The API calls that can be made with a session secret tend to be restricted to the user interacting with their own data only. Updating status and granting permissions is definitely something you can do with a combination of session secrets, Connect and XFBML . And as Paul has already answered: sharing your application secret is against Facebook's terms of service.
