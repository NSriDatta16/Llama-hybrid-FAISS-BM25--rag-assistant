When is first differences for time series trend removal appropriate to use?

I was just wondering when it is appropriate to use particular time series trend removal methods, specifically first differences and link relatives methods. I have two time series as given here: I then took the cumulative sum of each series, which now yields two new time series as follows: It is clear that these two time series look very similar, so I now wish to find just how closely related they are - as such, I would like to try and find the correlation between the two of them. Now, according to Avoiding Common Mistakes with Time Series I should try and remove the trend first before finding correlation. The two (nonparametric) methods that the link above suggests are first differences method and link relatives method. Now, since the two plots appear to be autocorrelated, first differences does not appear suitable (at least I do not think it is, I'd like to include the images but I'm restricted to only two unfortunately). Does this mean that I should instead change to link relatives method? Or alternatively, should I instead use the original time series rather than the cumulative sum time series and then try using first differences?
