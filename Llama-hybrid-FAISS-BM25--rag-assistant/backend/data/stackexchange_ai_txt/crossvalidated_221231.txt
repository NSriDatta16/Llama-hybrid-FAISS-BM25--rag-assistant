check multicollinearity before regression in R

I want to check multicollinearity to avoid any redundancy in my database before doing the multinomial logistic regression with categorical dependent variable using R, knowing that the majority of my variables expressed as dichotomous and ordinal. Not the VIF method! Is there any other method that I can use before the regression?
