Depends on the experience of the team involved. With C++ you have access to a richer set of library functions (but be careful of their footprint when embedding them). Well-designed C++ code will be easier to maintain than C code, as it allows for some syntactic sugar (constructors, destructors, RAII). The cost of documentation is about the same.
