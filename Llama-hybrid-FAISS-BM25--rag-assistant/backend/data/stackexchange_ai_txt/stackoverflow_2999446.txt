Loading an XML file with todays date in the filename... need to fallback to old file if one with todays date doesnt exist

So here is my question. Using javascript/jQuery I am currently loading in an XML file that has a file name such as carousel_large_2010-06-08.xml.. the way I am doing it is checked for todays date then grabbing a file that has that date in the filename... the issue is sometimes they wont be uploading a new file for a given day so it needs to fallback to a older date that exists.. Wondering how to do it? Here is my code: // set date for xml file var currentTime = new Date(), month = currentTime.getMonth() + 1, day = currentTime.getDate(), year = currentTime.getFullYear(); if(month.toString().length == 1){ month = '0'+month.toString(); } if(day.toString().length == 1){ day = '0'+day.toString(); } var dateObject = year+"-"+month+"-"+day; // start magic $jq.ajax({ type: "GET", url: "_xml/carousel/home/carousel_large_"+dateObject+".xml", dataType: "xml", success: HPCarousels.heroCarousel.parseXML, error: function(){ alert('Error Loading XML Content'); } });
