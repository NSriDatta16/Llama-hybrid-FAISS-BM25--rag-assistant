There is tutorial for simple/small php/MySQL cart that keeps cart status in sessions, there is even downloadable demo code and online demo. http://v3.thewatchmakerproject.com/journal/276/building-a-simple-php-shopping-cart I used it when full blown online shoping programs were just that "over blown". Same as you there was no need to take cc data, user registration, etc... just siple place to send selected items to payment gateway's purchase proces and after that to forget about it. That is what client wanted, and that is what he got on the end (my first choice was magento but it was too complicated for clients 3 products). Of course you need to extend it to fit your need but it's good starting point for something simple.
