Is there a certain (iPhone-specific?) reason that you need to have different SQLite databases for both versions of your app? If not, you could implement a licensing mechanism with exchangeable keys that allowed you to compile your single codebases with just one file changed. At runtime, your app would check that file and either allow reduced or unlimited storage. Added benefit (if iPhone-store supports such things) would be that it should be very simple to unlock the full version without losing data. Of course, such a solution could harm your business if your customers are tech-savvy and malign and your code is easy to decompile.
