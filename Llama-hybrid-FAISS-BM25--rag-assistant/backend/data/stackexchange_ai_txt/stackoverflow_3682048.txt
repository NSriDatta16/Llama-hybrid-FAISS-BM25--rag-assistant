In this day and age 950k is a tiny amount of storage space. If you go with a simple grandfather, father, son backup rotation you're looking at about 22Mb for a year's worth of backups. Or five or six MP3 files as comparison. Even if you are on dialup (or GPRS/1xRTT in a pinch) this is still a manageable amount of data to transfer.
