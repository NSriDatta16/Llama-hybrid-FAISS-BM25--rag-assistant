I work in both environments. Personally I lean towards PHP. I find that development time is a lot faster because the community (Open Source) is so much bigger. I never have to recreate the wheel. MS has a very cool IDE with a lot of drag and drop functionality but to be honest those controls have limitations and again I'm personally moving more towards a jQuery solution. Obviously, maintenance and support is a huge issue. This would depend on the project. There are experts out there that you could hire to help if you needed. Some very big sites run on PHP and mySql. As others have mentioned above, your team might be the final answer to your question. If you only have PHP programmers then I would use PHP. If you have .Net programmers then I would lean towards .Net... If you are hiring out of the box, PHP programmers are usually cheaper (unfortunately). Just my 2 cents.
