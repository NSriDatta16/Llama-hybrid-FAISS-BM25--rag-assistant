Finding the Expected Average Distance from the Maximum given a distribution

For a given sample set $S$ with $N$ individual samples $x_i$, I can easily find the average distance from the maximum by doing something like this: $\sigma_{max_N}:=\sqrt{\frac{1}{N}\sum\limits_{i=1}^N {\left(x_i - \max{\left(S\right)}\right)}^2}$ Trying to do so for larger and larger sample sizes, I (unsurprisingly) end up with different limit values given different distributions. For instance, for a uniform distribution on a unit interval, I get a value around 0.577 with digits after that varying wildly. A normal distribution with the same mean $\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)$ and variance $\left(\frac{1}{12}\right)$ gives me something around 1.5, though the exact value shifts around a lot more. For an exponential distribution with parameter $\lambda=2\sqrt{3}$, I end up at around 4.5. Is there a way to get an expected value of $\sigma_{max_N} \to \sigma_{max}$ for a given distribution as the sample size $N \to \infty$? It doesn't necessarily have to be analytic.
