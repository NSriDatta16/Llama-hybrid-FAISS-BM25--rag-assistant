Well, actually the main difference between the 2 fragments of code is that in the FirePHP code you're turning on output buffering (with the obstart(); call) and in the Zend Framework code fragment you don't. The easiest way to get it to work with Zend is probably to set the output_buffering flag in php.ini to On (you can do that in your virtual host definition or htaccess when using apache if you don't want to set it globally). I just use this in my Bootstrap : protected function _initLogger() { $writer = new Zend_Log_Writer_Firebug(); $logger = new Zend_Log($writer); Zend_Registry::set('logger', $logger); } And then use Zend_Registry::get('logger')->log(...); and it works with output_buffering set to on (FF 3.6.15, Firebug 1.6.2, FirePHP 0.5.0).
