I really don't think a regex is going to help you here, the problem with English (or any language for that matter) text is context. Without it you can be sure if what's between the word boundaries is text, a number, a random collection of characters, etc. For an NLP I think you are going to be selecting a subset of the language and looking for specific words rather than trying to extract all 'Words' from a string.
