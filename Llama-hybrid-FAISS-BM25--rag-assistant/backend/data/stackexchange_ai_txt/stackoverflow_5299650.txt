Please do not take this as an offense, but I think you should read some book or at least a decent article on .NET debugging. This one looks like an easy to spot with just a bit of basic debugging. See this one for example, and pay special attention on stepping through code, setting breakpoints and watches What you should do: set a breakpoint in the code in the problematic code line when debugger breaks code execution there, see which object are you changing the property for. Does this property change the text box text value? Are you using a correct form instance? does the For..Next loop set it to zero on its final pass?
