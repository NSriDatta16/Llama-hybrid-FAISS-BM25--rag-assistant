You have to specify which type of rounding you do want. Think about it in these terms: take a floating point variable round it appropriately cast to integer will get the integer part of the floating point value - it truncates the value You might look at floor() and ceil() for round-down and round-up respectively. You have to pay particular attention to what you want to happen around 0 and negative numbers. GLIBC has lots of rounding functions available. Here's a round-towards-infinity function: int round_towards_infinity(double value) { if(value > 0) return ceil(value); return floor(value); }
