Heteroscedasticity refers to the property of a random process that has non-constant variance along some continuum. This most commonly presents in regression where the error variance increases as a function of one or more predictors, but also commonly refers to a time series whose variance changes over time. The Greek skedasis means "dispersion". Random data showing heteroscedasticity : . . . . . and heteroscedastic vs. homoscedastic residuals : by Q9 . . . . . . . . . . by Protonk . Heteroscedasticity may be intrinsically interesting , as in this example from Wikipedia : A classic example of heteroscedasticity is that of income versus expenditure on meals...A poorer person will spend a rather constant amount by always eating inexpensive food; a wealthier person may occasionally buy inexpensive food and at other times eat expensive meals. Those with higher incomes display a greater variability of food consumption. [Emphasis added.] Heteroscedasticity may complicate predictive/explanatory modeling , as in the other example: Imagine you are watching a rocket take off nearby and measuring the distance it has traveled once each second. In the first couple of seconds your measurements may be accurate to the nearest centimeter , say. However, 5 minutes later as the rocket recedes into space, the accuracy of your measurements may only be good to 100 m , because of the increased distance, atmospheric distortion and a variety of other factors. The data you collect would exhibit heteroscedasticity. [Emphasis added.] Questions that should use this tag: Questions about variables for which the variance depends on another variable Questions involving analyses of datasets with problematic heteroscedasticity E.g., ols estimation of general-linear-model s assumes sphericity , which entails homo- scedasticity and non autocorrelation . Heteroscedasticity can bias standard-error s in: anova , particularly with repeated-measures linear-regression , particularly of time-series See Wikipedia also for: Further definition of heteroscedasticity, including the multivariate case Consequences of heteroscedasticity Detection methods, including levenes-test Fixes , including robust methods like WLS estimation, HCSEs , and ARCH modeling References and further reading
