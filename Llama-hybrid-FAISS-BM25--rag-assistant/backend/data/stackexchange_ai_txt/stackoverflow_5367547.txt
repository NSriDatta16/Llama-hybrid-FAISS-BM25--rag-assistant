I suspect you aren't really seeing what you think you're seeing. I very much doubt that the constructor call was removed. If you could provide a short but complete program which demonstrates the problem, that would help - but I suspect you'll find that it was some other change - possibly to how you observe the side-effect - that happened. I would strongly encourage you to make this a static method which describes the side-effects you're expecting though - a constructor call which doesn't actually use the result is odd, and I wouldn't be surprised to see a maintainer remove the call expecting it to be a no-op. The purpose of a constructor ought to be to construct an object, not for side-effects. EDIT: If your code is actually like that, then the first thing I'd do is change these empty exception blocks: catch (UnsupportedEncodingException e) { } catch (AddressException e) { } catch (MessagingException e) { } At the very least these should log what's gone wrong. For investigative purposes I'd also add logging before and after the constructor call, and within the constructor. That should help show how the execution is actually flowing.
