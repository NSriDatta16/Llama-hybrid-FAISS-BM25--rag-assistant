Try this: lp = LexicalizedParser.new You need to call new like you did with ArrrayList. Also, you shouldn't need to list the fully qualified class name after you call include_class . I am not familiar with the Stanford NLP Parser, so I am assuming this will work. It might be necessary to pass additional parameters to the constructor.
