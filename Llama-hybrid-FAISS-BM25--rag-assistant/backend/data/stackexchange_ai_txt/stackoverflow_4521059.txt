As always, after posting the question I found this and this which has pointed me towards using projection (solution below), but I was hoping to avoid that, so I'm going to leave the question open to see if there is a more elegant solution. var Employee = caseObjectQuery.Select(x => new{ Employee = x is CaseB ? (x as CaseB).Employee : null } ).FirstOrDefault(); Just by selecting the Object into memory, EF magically maps the related entities.
