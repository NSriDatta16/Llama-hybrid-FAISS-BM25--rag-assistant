Given the extensive genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity among cells within tumors, I am increasingly skeptical of any reports that rely on a single determination from a tumor sample, absent evidence that a single determination is adequate. So multiple samples are best, and I would argue necessary when developing new markers. See this paper for discussion of why multiple measurements on a single tumor are part of best practice for developing biomarkers. That said, there is no reason that the multiple regions analyzed have to be small. One could argue that you should analyze as much of the sample as possible so that you do not throw away useful information. One solution here would to take the entire region of interest and break it into 3 or more sub-regions that cover the entire region of interest. Thoroughly analyze each of the sub-regions. Then you both have your measure of intra-tumor variability and complete coverage of your region of interest.
