I find @ucfagls's idea most appropriate here, since you have very few observations and a lot of variables. Ridge regression should do its job for prediction purpose. Another way to analyse the data would be to rely on PLS regression (in this case, PLS1), which bears some idea with regression on PCA scores but seems more interesting in your case. As multicollinearity might be an issue there, you can look at sparse solution (see e.g., the spls or the mixOmics R packages).
