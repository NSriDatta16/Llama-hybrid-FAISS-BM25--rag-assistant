I've written some sample code to do something like this. See my Tiles blog entry, or just download the code: Tiles-v1.0.zip . My code creates the icons as Core Animation layers, not as UIViews, but does demonstrate how to detect taps and allow reorganization of the icons. It doesn't handle orientation changes.
