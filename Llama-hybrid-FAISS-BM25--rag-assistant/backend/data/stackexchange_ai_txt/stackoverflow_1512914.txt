Uae strtok() to split your string into tokens, using all non-letter characters as delimiters, and find the longest token. To find the longest token you will need to organise some storage for tokens - I'd use linked list. As simple as this. EDIT Ok, if strlen() is the only function allowed, you can first find the length of your source string, then loop through it and replace all non-letter characters with NULL - basically that's what strtok() does. Then you need to go through your modified source string second time, advancing one token at a time, and find the longest one, using strlen() .
