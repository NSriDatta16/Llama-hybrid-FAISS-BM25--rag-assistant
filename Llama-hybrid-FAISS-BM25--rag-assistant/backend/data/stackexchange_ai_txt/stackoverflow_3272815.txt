iPod App runs slower on 32GB model than on 8GB model

I have a big performance problem on 32GB iPod touch model 3rd generation. The App is a port of an DS 3D game. The rendering is done with OpenGL ES 1.1. It uses OpenAL for Audio and the MPMoviePlayerController for videos. The performance on a 8GB iPod touch is fine, it runs constantly with more than 30 fps. Then I tested it on a 32GB model of the 3rd generation and was shocked how slowly it is. The first problem I noticed was the Intro cutscene. The video was fragmented and stucks, frames has been skipped. In the 3D level the performance was about 15 fps. The scene has about 10000 vertices in a static vertex buffer and 7000 vertices in a dynamic vertex buffer. The dynamic vertices are updated each frame, not all of them, but that part that changed last frame for skeleton animation. I played with the build settings, Thumb on/off, optimized for armv7 and so on, with no effort. On the 8GB model it keeps running very fast and on the 32GB model it sucks. Then I tried an other 3D Game from App store (N.O.V.A) on the 32GB model. It runs with a good performance, the video too. Now I am at an end with my ideas. Can someone please give me a hint what the problem could be. Thanks for that and best regards gentle
