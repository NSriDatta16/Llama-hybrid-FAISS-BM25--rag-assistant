Robert, First off, I assume that you have followed instructions in http://gembundler.com/rails23.html . If not, make sure you do. Second, make sure you are running bundle with JRuby: jruby -S bundle exec glassfish Third, -P requires daemonization, so make sure you have that option turned on (either with -d flag, or in glassfish.yml ).
