jQuery - Append multiple elements one after the other

I'm looking to create a nice effect when appending multiple paragraphs to a div. When I append I want to fadeIn the paragraphs one at a time so one shows after the other. At the moment they all fade in at the same time. example html; paragraph 1 paragraph 2 paragraph 3 Here is the code used to append to the div $(results).prependTo(".wrapper").hide().fadeIn('slow'); (Results) is simply the multiple paragraphs. Thanks in advance for your help and advice.
