Generalized LM or LM in ecological dataset

I have previously posted a question for the same dataset but now I had somme issues with the models and I wanted to re-phrase my question. My dataset contains 50 morphometric characters (which we reduced with factor analysis or pca to few common components) measured on the roe deer skull. I want a model for predicting skull dimensions from the absolute areas of the forest and plowland in habitats they live in. My first idea was to enter absolute areas as predictors but I was advised to use them as proportions and to add population abundance as a predictor in the model. I know that GLM (with binomial error structure) is great for proportion data but I am unsure how to specify such a model in R. In fact I am also unsure how to enter proportions (I can calculate percentages, but am wondering if they must total to 1, 100%). Any ideas?

These areas are in expressed in Ha. Factor1 are factor axis scores and abundance is the total number although we have density (individual per area) also.
