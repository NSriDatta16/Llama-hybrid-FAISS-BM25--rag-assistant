You seem to have probability distribution functions (PDFs) confused with time series. A PDF has integral 1, so it can't have arbitrarily high bumps arbitrarily far along the real line. A time series is typically modeled not as a single random variable (and hence a single distribution) but as a function mapping from time to random variables; that is, a random process .
