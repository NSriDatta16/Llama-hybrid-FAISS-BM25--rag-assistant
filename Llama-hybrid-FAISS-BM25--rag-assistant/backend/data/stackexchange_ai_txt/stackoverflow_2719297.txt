Use Json, all the mobile platforms have Json parsers. For Android, this may not be the most efficient solution, but it's probably the most pragmatic. Android natively supports XML, but not Json. In other words, what I'm trying to say is that Android phones are equipped with an Hardware Accelerated XML Parser (their own dedicated little piece of silicon basically), but where it comes to Json parsing, Android phones don't have that, so they must use their CPU to do that work. In theory, this will mean that Android will use more CPU cycles, more energy, and therefore more battery, to parse Json, than to parse XML. That being said, don't fall into the trap of premature optimization, chances are, whatever difference there is will probably be insignificant to your use case scenario (and don't take my word for it, just use your profiler once your app is finished).
