Embedding Mono Confusion

I'm trying to use the following instructions to embed the Mono runtime in a C++ program. http://www.mono-project.com/Embedding_Mono To initialize the runtime, you have to call mono_jit_init with an input parameter called file_name. They say that file_name is the name of the main assembly file. - What do they mean by "main assembly file?" Is this the name of a C# app that I want to have running? A little farther down, they describe opening the assembly and executing it via the call mono_domain_assembly_open. This function takes a file name as an input parameter as well and I'm confused as to what this file should be as well. Should it be the same as the previous one? Any help is appreciated. Thanks, mj
