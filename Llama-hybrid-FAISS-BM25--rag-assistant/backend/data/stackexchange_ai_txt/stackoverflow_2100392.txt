Whilst there is no portable #define or something to rely upon, platforms do provide standard functions for converting to and from your 'host' endian. Generally, you do storage - to disk, or network - using 'network endian', which is BIG endian, and local computation using host endian (which on x86 is LITTLE endian). You use htons() and ntohs() and friends to convert between the two.
