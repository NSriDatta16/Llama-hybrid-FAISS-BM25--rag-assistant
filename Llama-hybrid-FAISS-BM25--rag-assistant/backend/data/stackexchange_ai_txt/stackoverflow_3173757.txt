take a look at the "Swapable" jQuery plugin: http://plugins.jquery.com/project/Swapable It similar to "Sortable", but only two elements of the selected group are affected: dragged element and dropped one which are swapped. All other elements stay at their current positions. This plugin is built based on existing "Sortable" jQuery plugin and inherits all sortable options.
