"This depends on your paranoia level. Of course double-checks are better than single-checks, but the checking on the client side has the benefit or parallelization. Client side checks are performed by many, possibly thousands of computers that your clients use, while server-side checks are performed by the single server." While none of this is untrue per se, this answer seems to unproportionally stress the importance of those 25 seconds, and thus seems rather biased toward "rely on clients". That is unwise, period. Especially if the cost for a total of a million inserts is as negligible as 25 seconds. You never know for certain whether ALL clients will correctly implement all needed checks, and even if you DO know that for the clients that CURRENTLY EXIST, even then you don't know about any future other clients. What you must consider is the repairing cost you will incur when your data gets "corrupted" as a consequence of some constraint that wasn't enforced by the database system. For example, ponder if the "poor guy" who had to solve the following problem ( Find GUID in database ), would be done in 25 seconds. If the sum-total of time needed to do ALL the constraint checking makes your transactions noticeably slower, even then it is probably more advisable to try and convince your organization of investing in more or faster hardware. Data that is guaranteed to satisfy integrity rules is the most important asset in most businesses today, and should be cherished as such.
