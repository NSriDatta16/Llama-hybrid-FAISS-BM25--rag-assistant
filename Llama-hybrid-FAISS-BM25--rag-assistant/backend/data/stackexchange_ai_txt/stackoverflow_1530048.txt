You could do it without any plugins, but the tricky part that you will probably want to avoid is the modularity. If you want the dialog box to move when they click and drag, you have to set the position of that div based on the mouse position, which can get pretty jerky quick. hence the jqueryui options. I agree, the CSS is enough to make you want to choke sometimes. Oh, and just so it's been said, you can get a perfect grey box with one button that will morph to fit any browser's UI: alert()
