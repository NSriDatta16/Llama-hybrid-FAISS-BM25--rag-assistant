Is it possible to use Linq-SQL without drag-and-drop?

If i want to use Linq-SQL i also have to drag the DB Table unto the designer surface to create the entity classes. I always like full control in my application and do not like the classes created by dotnet. Is it possible to provide this connection between Linq and the DB using my own Data Access Layer Entity classes? How can i get it done?
