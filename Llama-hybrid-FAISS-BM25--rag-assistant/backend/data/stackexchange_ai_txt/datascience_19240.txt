Using Orange3 to predict image class

I used logistic regression to classify 3 classes of images: cars, dogs, cows. The accuracy is 100%, perfectly separated in clusters (scatter plots). When I try to use the learner to predict 3 images (1 dog, 1 car, 1 cow), the predictor simply assign the probability of 1/3 to each image. How can I fix it?
