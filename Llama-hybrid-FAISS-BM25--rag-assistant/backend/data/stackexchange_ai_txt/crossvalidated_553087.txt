Can I conclude that the classifier is always good when Precision-Recall Curve above the baseline?

I used logistic regression for highly imbalaned data (1=0.6% , 0=99.4%) Since PR curves are sensitive to imbalance, so i used it, but I don't know how to interpret graph appropriately. This is PR-curve for my dataset. basline AUC-PR is 0.006 and PR-AUC of my model is 0.05 I know that there is no magic cutoff value for AUC-PR. I searched many tutorials of PR curves, but many said only "compare auc with baseline" In my dataset, the AUC-PR is only 0.05 , I think it's too small to claim that the model is good. However, it is 10 times bigger than basline auc, then can I conclude that the model is good? Are there any reference that can help?
