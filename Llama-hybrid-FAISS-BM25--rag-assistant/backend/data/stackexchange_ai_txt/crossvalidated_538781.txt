What you need is a competing-risks survival model with the possibility of repeated events. Here are problems posed by some of your choices thus far: I chose a minimum of 2 years follow-up. I thus removed all patients with less than 2 years follow-up that had no event (i.e. I kept those with That introduces a bias toward worse-outcome individuals. You are throwing away all the better-outcome cases with less than 2 years follow-up. I removed from consideration any patients that had history of a CV events (as this could predispose to another CV event or death). It would seem that a history of CV events would be a critical baseline predictor for a model. Logistic binary regression (LR) : taking into account all patients With different lengths of follow-up, you can't tell whether the lack of an observed event is due to favorable baseline characteristics or short follow-up. For simplification, I considered them as either 0 (no incident or previous CV event) or 1 (any number of incident CV events). For the time-to-event metric, I considered the date of the first event. That throws away information about individual propensity to having multiple events. A competing-risks, multiple-event survival model overcomes these limitations: You use information about all event-free individuals throughout the time that they are observed during your study, so you don't just throw them away. You can include prior CV-event history easily as a baseline covariate, along with any other predictors you choose. The survival analysis directly takes the duration of observation into account in a way that a logistic regression over all patients cannot. You can model CV events and death together in the same model, while allowing for multiple CV events (and, if you wish, to allow CV events that occur during the study to affect the risk of further CV events in that individual). In summary, a proper survival model would allow you to use all the information available from all individuals in the study. These methods are implemented, for example, in the R survival package . Cox survival models for "Multiple event types and multiple events per subject" are explained in a section of the main survival vignette . A vignette on multi-state models goes into more detail, and introduces other R packages for such modeling, like the mstate package that might be suitable for your type of data.
