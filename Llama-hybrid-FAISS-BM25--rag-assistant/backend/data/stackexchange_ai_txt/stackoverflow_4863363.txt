Any way to determine if an element is wrapped?

Basically, I have a certain HTML element (in this case, a div) that is wrapping to a new line in the case of a below average screen resolution, due to a floating element. I want to control this behavior, placing and/or styling the element differently if indeed it is currently wrapped or will be wrapped upon resize/onload. Is this possible?
