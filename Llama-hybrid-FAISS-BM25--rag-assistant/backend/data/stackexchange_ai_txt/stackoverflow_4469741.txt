First of all you will need some sort of gateway. It must handle TCP connections from devices(use async sockets!=)), parse their data and send to storage. Next big thing is storage itself. If you want to support different devices, I would suggest to use something like Apache Cassandra with keys, based on date(only date, not time)and device UID. Third part of puzzle is how you going to present data to users. This is pretty simple. Id suggest REST services. This is my own experience. On my last job I was an Architect/Lead on quite the same project. It is now live and successful handling 30k+ devices online on 1 server for apps(IIS), 2 for data and 2 for TCP gateways. If you want more specific info, feel free to ask=)
