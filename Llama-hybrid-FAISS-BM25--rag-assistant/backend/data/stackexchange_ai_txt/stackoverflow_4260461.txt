How can I play a video file from a Resource?

I am trying to get a video to pop up and play. I can get it to work when I use the first URI (that is commented out in the below code), but when I try to use the second URI (from the resource), I get the following error: ERROR/AndroidRuntime(1052): android.content.ActivityNotFoundException: No Activity found to handle Intent { dat=android.resource://com.slamdunksoftware.presentation/2130968576 typ=video/* } From researching the error, it looks like I might have to declare an activity in the manifest but I'm not sure if that applies here. Can someone point me in the right direction? Intent in = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW); //Uri uri = Uri.parse(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory().toString() + "/page4a.m4v"); Uri uri = Uri.parse("android.resource://com.slamdunksoftware.presentation/" + R.raw.page4a); in.setDataAndType(uri, "video/*"); startActivity(in);
