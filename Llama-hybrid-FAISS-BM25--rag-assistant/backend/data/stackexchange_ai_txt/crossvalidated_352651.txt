How to create a plot of acoustically tagged individuals to show presence of individuals per day

I am trying to create a plot like the one below. The plot represents a timeline of the daily detections of different acoustically tagged individuals (represented by Transmitter ID). The black dots represent the days when the individual was detected on a receiver, grey bars represent total time at liberty. I am trying to find out what this type of plot is called, what package I can use and if there is any specific code to make it.
