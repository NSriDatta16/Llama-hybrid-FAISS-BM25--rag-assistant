From my understanding of your problem, the data seems skewed and univariate and the aim explanatory. The first step is plot skewness adjusted box-plots. I know of a $\verb+R+$ implementation in package $\verb+robustbase+$ (look for a function called $\verb+adjbox()+$. The associated white paper is very readable too. Source: M. Hubert& E. Vandervieren An adjusted boxplot for skewed distributions, Computational Statistics & Data Analysis Volume 52, Issue 12, 15 August 2008, Pages 5186-5201. Ungated version: ftp://ftp.win.ua.ac.be/pub/preprints/04/AdjBox04.pdf EDIT In principle, these adjusted boxplots assume that the data is continuous. If that's not the case, then this particular algorithm will spot too many outliers. But this problem is an algorithmic, not a statistical one: you can solve it by simply jittering your data a bit to remove ties (i.e. adding noise with small variance to every observations).
