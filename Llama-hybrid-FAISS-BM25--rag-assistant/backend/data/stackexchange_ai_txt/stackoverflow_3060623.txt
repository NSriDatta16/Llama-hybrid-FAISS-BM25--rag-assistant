SugarCRM SOAP set_relationship between Contacts and Prospect lists bug

I am trying to create a relationship between a Prospect List (target list) and a Contact. I create a new contact and get the id of a prospect list all using classes I created which are just wrappers for the soap api calls sugar provides. But the code boils down to this soap call: $this->_sugarsoap->client->__soapCall('set_relationship', array($this->getSessionid(),$relationship)); $this->getSessionid() Is the session Id and $relationship is an array which holds this: array 0 => string 'ProspectLists' (length=13) 1 => string '180ab1f5-cf7e-d386-50f8-4c18a790e016' (length=36) 2 => string 'Contacts' (length=8) 3 => string '76323942-8cbb-3224-f18a-4c19efa80a1b' (length=36) After I try this I always get this error: (I do a var_dump of the returned values of the soap call) object(stdClass)[5] public 'number' => string '20' (length=2) public 'name' => string 'Module Does Not Exist' (length=21) public 'description' => string 'This module is not available on this server' (length=43) This seems like a sugarcrm bug because I do have the contacts module and also the prospect lists module. I know this for a fact because I add a contact via the soap call and also retrieve the id of a prospect list via the soap call. I found this thread in the sugar forums and I did try the code given there but I still got the same error. Anyone have a solution for this? I really need to associate a contact to a prospect list (target list) via a soap call. I am using SugarCRM 5.5.0 (I also tried with sugarcrm 5.5.2 and got the same error) on ubuntu server using mysql. Thanks! EDIT: Ok I got this working with the fix from the thread and a little correction on my part. In the array I pass to the set_relantionships function I really have to use the format: 'module1' => 'modnameA', 'module1_id' => 'modidA', 'module2' => 'modnameB', 'module2_id' => 'modidB Hope this helps someone :)
