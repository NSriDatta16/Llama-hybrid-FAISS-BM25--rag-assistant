The Ruby way: Video.all.select {|v| v.campaigns.empty?} I think this is more elegant if you use it standalone in a method. However, I would recommend to write a named scope for that. Then again, Geoffs version is the right one: named_scope :campaign_less, :include => :campaigns, :conditions => ["campaigns.id IS ?", nil] Besides, Geoffs solution is probably more efficient as it is more lowlevel.
