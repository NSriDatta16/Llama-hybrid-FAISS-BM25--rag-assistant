OO techniques can be applied to C code, they just require more discipline. Use opaque handles to operate on objects. One good example of how this is done is the stdio library -- everything is organised around the opaque FILE* handle. Many successful libraries are organised around this principle (e.g. zlib , apr ) Because all members of struct s are implicitly public in C, you need a convention + programmer discipline to enforce the useful technique of information hiding . Pick a simple, automatically checkable convention such as "private members end with '_'". Interfaces can be implemented using arrays of pointers to functions. Certainly this requires more work than in languages like C++ that provide in-language support, but it can nevertheless be done in C.
