From the job ads I have seen, the answer depends: There are jobs which are more technical in nature (designing big data projects, doing some analysis) or the exact opposite (doing analysis, storage etc. is someone elses job). So I would say that SOME software design skills are extremely useful , but you don't need the abillity to build a huge program in C# / Java or whatever. Why I like some SW skills is simply that your code probably looks way better than code from someone who never programmed for the sake of programming. Most of the time, the latter code is very hard do understand / debug for outsiders. Also, sometimes your analysis needs to be integrated in a bigger program,an understand of the needs of the programms certainly helps.
