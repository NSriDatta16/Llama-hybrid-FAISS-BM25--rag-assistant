Looking for "Data gathering is hard and expensive"

I've finished some data mining and machine learning courses and in most of them at the very beginning has been said: "Collecting and pre-processing data is the most expensive and hardest part of the Data-Mining (DM) or Machine-Learning(ML)." I remember something about at least 70 percent of costs for data collecting and cleaning. I am finishing my thesis and one part is presenting DM results. However, I was not able to collect as much data I wanted (for objective reasons, that's not the problem). I am looking for some trusted authority (book, paper) to state (cite) "data gathering is hard". I have several books on DM or ML, but all of them start with data pre-processing and this is the phase when you have all data you need.
