Software-Reuse is the most important way to optimize software-development Somehow, software-reuse seamed to be in vogue for some time, but has lost it's charm, when many companies found out that just writing powerpoint presentations with reuse slogans doesn't actually help. They reasoned that software-reuse is just not "good enough" and can't live up to their dreams. So it seams that it is not in vogue any more -- it was replaced by plenty of project management newcomers (Agile for example). The fact is, that any really good developer by himself performs some kind of software-reuse. I would say Any developer, not doing software-reuse is a bad developer! I have experienced myself, how much software-reuse can produce performance and stability in development. But of course, a set of PowerPoints and half-hearted confessions of management does not suffice to get its full potential in a company. I have linked a very old article of mine about software-reuse (see title). It was originally written in German and translated thereafter -- so excuse please, when it is not that good writing.
