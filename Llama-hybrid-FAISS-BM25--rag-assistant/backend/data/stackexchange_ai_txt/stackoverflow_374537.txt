There is a book and framework called DEMOS (Discrete Event Modelling on Simula) that describes a co-routine based framework (the eponymous DEMOS). Despite being 30 years or so old DEMOS is actually quite a nice system, and Graham Birtwistle is a really nice guy. If you implement co-routines on C++ (think setjump/longjump) you should take a look at this book for a description of a really, really elegant discrete event modelling framework. Although it's 30 years old it's a bit of a timeless classic and still has a fan base.
