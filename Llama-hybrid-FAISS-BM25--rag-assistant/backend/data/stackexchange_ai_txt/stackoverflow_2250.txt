Datatable vs Dataset

I currently use a DataTable to get results from a database which I can use in my code. However, many example on the web show using a DataSet instead and accessing the table(s) through the collections method. Is there any advantage, performance wise or otherwise, of using DataSets or DataTables as a storage method for SQL results?
