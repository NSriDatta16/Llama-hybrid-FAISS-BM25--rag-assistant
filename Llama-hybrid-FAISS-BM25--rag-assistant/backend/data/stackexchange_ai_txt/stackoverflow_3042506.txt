You've hit upon one of the problems with taxonomies (far from the only one, or even the worst one, in fact). Multiple Inheritance as a conceptual tool avoids many of the problems with taxonomies -- another way of putting it is, a taxonomy defines a tree, a MI-based classification scheme defines a more general directed acyclic graph, and therefore affords extra degrees of freedom in your modeling. A relational database approach would be different (not thinking of hierarchy or inheritance specifically) but come to much the same conceptual results as "multiple inheritance": the "class" (in the Linnaeus sense of phylum/class/order/family/genus/species) is one field of the record, the diet (carnivore, herbivore, omnivore) a distinct one -- they don't constrain each other, neither in conceptualization nor in searches / retrieval. If you're forced to model with tools that restrict you to taxonomies (AKA trees, single inheritance, &c), there are some tricks to ameliorate the pain they cause (to a modest degree), but they depend on each tool's specific restrictions, so it's hard to generalize.
