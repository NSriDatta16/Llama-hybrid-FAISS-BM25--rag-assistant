I would say it depends on the situation/application. For instance I would use json and templating for a flight/hotel etc result screen. Why return 50k's worth of the same markup when a 4k json object will do and will allow for rapid clientside sort/filter. If you dont need quick clientside filtering/sorting then responding with dom fragments is ok. Horses for courses.
