I'll be interested to see if you get any good solutions to this problem. My own solution, which is far from elegant, is to do this: book = models.Book(title='Foo') chapter = models.Chapter(parent=book, title='dummy') form = forms.ChapterForm(request.POST, request.FILES, instance=chapter) Basically, I first create a dummy object ( chapter in this case) with the correct parent relationship and then pass that as the instance argument to the form's constructor. The form will overwrite the throwaway data I used to create the dummy object with the data given in the request. At the end, to get the real child object, I do something like this: if form.is_valid(): chapter = form.save() # Now chapter.parent() == book
