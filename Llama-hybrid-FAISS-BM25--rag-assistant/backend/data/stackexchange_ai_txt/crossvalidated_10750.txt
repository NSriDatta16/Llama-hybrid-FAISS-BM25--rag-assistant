ARMA modeling in R

I have a time series. I want to model it using ARMA, which will be used for forcasting. In R I am using arima() function to get the coefficients. But arima() requires order(p,d,q) as input. What is the simplest way in R to arrive at a good value for p and q (with d = 0) so that I don't overfit?
