Deseasonalize data - strange plot

I want to deseasonalize my daily data, and I chose to verify yearly seasonality as I have prices of wheat that usually increase around the same time of the year. I have used the function ts on R, using this code : Returns However, I get this plot, and I do not understand if it is normal. Note that I chose a 250 frequency since there are on average 250 trading days per year. Thanks a lot in advance
