Just my two cents about DOS vs. Windows. Years ago (something like 1998?), I had the same assumption. I have some program written in QBasic (this was before I discovered C), which did intense calculations (neural network back-propagation). And it took time. A friend offered to rewrite the thing in Visual Basic. I objected, because, you know , all those gizmos, widgets and fancy windows, you know , would slow down the execution of, you know , the important code. The Visual Basic version so much outperformed the QBasic one that it became the default application (I won't mention the "hey, even in Excel's VBA, you are outperformed" because of my wounded pride, but...) . The point here, is the "you know" part. You don't know. The OS here is not important. As others explained in their answers, choose your hardware, and choose your language. And write your code in a clear way because now, compilers are better at optimizing code developers, unless you're John Carmack ( premature optimization is the root of all evil ). Then, if you're not happy with the result, use a profiler to test your code. Consider multithreading (which will help you if you have multiple cores... TBB comes to mind).
