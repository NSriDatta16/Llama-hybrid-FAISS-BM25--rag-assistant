I would be more focused on extracting/scraping the div locations (that the user's dragged) and passing them off to the server so it can be processed. The processing would include creating a Bitmap , placing the ESRI Map as the background (with any applicable off-sets), then overlaying the "movable/dragged" DIVs [more specifically, the images that are associated to them] on top of that base, then exporting the whole entry as a "Screenshot". You should be looking more at reproducing the outcome instead of capturing it (at least if this is planned for a web-client implementation).
