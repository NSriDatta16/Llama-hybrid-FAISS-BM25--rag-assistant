I think that there might be a conceptual problem with this approach. If your piece of paper is not flat it is possible that a "kink" in the paper at a point with no ink dot might be higher than surrounding areas with ink dots. The proposed algorithm might inadvertently average away the very points of interest. Also "I then noticed that repeating this process many times" might introduce spuriousness due to the Slutsky Yule Effect. Might I suggest that you use more specialised approaches e.g. consider your data to be an image and use the relevant tools from a package such as this ?
