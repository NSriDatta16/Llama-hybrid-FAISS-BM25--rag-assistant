Need Help with Database Table Design

CREATE TABLE MemberProfile ( memberID, memberTypeID, aboutMeID, memberRegID, memberProfileSettingsID, lastLogin datetime, PRIMARY KEY(memberID) ) memberTypeID represents Basic Member, Gold Member, Silver Member, etc aboutMeID represents a post/thread that would tell people about this user. Every user would have About Me page. Attributes are: title, body, etc. memberRegID represents username, password, email, receive notification, isActive, etc memberProfileSettingsID represents options such as hide favorite list, hide age, etc Is this a good design? I didn't want to put all fields in one table "MemberProfile".
