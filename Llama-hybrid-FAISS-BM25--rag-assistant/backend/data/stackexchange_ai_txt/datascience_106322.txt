It depends on the structure of the target values. Are they nominal or ordinal? If the target values are nominal, multi-class classification would be used to predict a single group out of many possible different groups. One option is to make a simplifying assumption by ignoring the order of observations. That is similar to the bag-of-words model in natural language processing (NLP). Then any multi-class classification algorithm can be used, such as Naive Bayes or Random Forest. Also, time series modeling can be tried. For example, Hidden Markov Model (HMM) could be used to predict the target day given the sequence of previous values. If those models do not yield useful predictions, more advanced modeling, such as Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), can be tried.
