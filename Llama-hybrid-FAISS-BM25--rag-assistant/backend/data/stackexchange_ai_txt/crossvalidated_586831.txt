Are all difference stationary time series trend stationary?

My understanding of this article and this article is that: If a time series needs to be differenced to become stationary (i.e. is difference-stationary), then it has at least one unit root Trend-stationary time series do not necessarily require differencing to become stationary (and do not necessarily have a unit root) - they require only the removal of the underlying trend. My question is as follows: while it is not necessary to difference a trend-stationary series to make it stationary, is it sufficient? I.e. will differencing (of some order) always suffice to make a trend-stationary series stationary? EDIT: is this anything to do with deterministic vs stochastic trends? And a follow-up question - how is the 'trend' defined in 'trend-stationary'? In seasonal_decompose in statsmodels , the trend is just the moving average, but surely this isn't always an accurate reflection of the actual trend - e.g. what if it should be an exponentially-weighted average?
