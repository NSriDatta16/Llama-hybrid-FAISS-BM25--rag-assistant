when you have your abc object, this will be the fact that you insert into the Working Memory. For example: KnowledgeBuilder kbuilder = KnowledgeBuilderFactory.newKnowledgeBuilder(); kbuilder.add( ResourceFactory.newFileSystemResource( fileName ), ResourceType.DRL ); if (kbuilder.hasErrors() ) { System.out.println( kbuilder.getErrors() ); } else { KnowledgeBase kbase = KnowledgeBaseFactory.newKnowledgeBase(); kbase.addKnowledgePackages( kbuilder.getKnowledgePackages() ); StatelessKnowledgeSession ksession = kbase.newStatelessKnowledgeSession(); ksession.execute( abc ); } Then you will have your modified abc object when the execute finishes. Take a look at here You probably dont't want the rules being build everytime (this is really time consumer), so you can use or KnowledgeAgent or have an static KnowledgeBase and recreate it whenever your rules files change.
