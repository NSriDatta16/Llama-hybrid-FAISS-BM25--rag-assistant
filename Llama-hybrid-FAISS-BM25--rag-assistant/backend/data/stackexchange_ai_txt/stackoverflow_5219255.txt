BlackBerry Lists best practise

I'm developing BlackBerry 5.0 application with list organized data. I'm using ObjectListField and manual drawing in overriden drawListRow. I'm afraid this is wrong, because all positionig inside row si done manualy, and now I have serious problem how to handle click on small icon inside row. There must be some better way, maybe using other control or simple HorizontalFieldManager in VerticalFieldManager instead of ListField, what is recommended and best practise?
