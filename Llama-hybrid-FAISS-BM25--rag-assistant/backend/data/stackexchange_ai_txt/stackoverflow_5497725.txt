Using Google Annotated Time Line Chart Without Flash

I want a similar behavior Chart as Google Annotated Time Line Chart to display my Time Series Data from DataBase In our environment we are restricted using Flash . But i see that Google Annotated Time Line Chart works only with Flash . I want a similar behavior as of Google Annotated Time Line Chart showing two charts , where the below Chart helps us to select a Range and the Upper Chart displays the Zoomed Area . I wanted to develop this by taking two divs , but i am struck up as how to maintain synchronization between these two divs (Chart Div and Slider Div) If anybody developed has developed Google Annotated Time Line Chart Without Flash , please give some inputs as how to develop this . Thank you very much for reading .
