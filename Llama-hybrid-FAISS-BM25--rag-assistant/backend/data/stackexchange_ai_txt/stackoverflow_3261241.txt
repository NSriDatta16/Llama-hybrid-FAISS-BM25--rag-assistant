Encrypting streaming content onto persistent storage and decrypting it to the stream on iPhone

My app "streams" content (fixed sized files, hence quotation marks) from an HTTP server into a local file. Then there is another component of the app that opens that same file and displays it (plays it). This is done for caching purposes, so that when the same file is requested next time, it will no longer need to be downloaded from the server. App's spec requires that all local content is encrypted (even with the most light weight encryption) Question: has there been done any work, allowing one to simply redirect the stream to a library which will then save the stream encrypted into a file? And then, when I request the stream from the local file, the library returns an on the fly decrypted stream? I've been searching for a solution with no results so far Thanks
