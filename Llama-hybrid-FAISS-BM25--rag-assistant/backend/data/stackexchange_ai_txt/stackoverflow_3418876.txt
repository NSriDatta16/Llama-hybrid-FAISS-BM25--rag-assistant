I might get flogged for saying this, but at least in Visual Studio, it's probably not as important an issue as it used to be. Most of my files only have one class each, but for things like trivial enums and simple storage classes used only by one other class, I just put them in the same file as the primary class. Otherwise if I want to use the same class somewhere else, I'd be moving multiple files and trying to guess which ones I need. You can right click an identifier and click Go To Definition to navigate to it, you can hit ctrl+comma to search, or you can use the Class View. I do group related .cs files into folders -- that sort of bigger-picture thing seems a bit more important. I also make sure the folder names always match the namespace, i.e. I keep the default namespaces that Visual Studio gives when you create a new class file in a folder.
