Choosing the number of clusters when only the distance matrix is available

I am performing a hierarchical clustering and a DBSCAN clustering on a distance matrix (A self-organizing map is something that I want to do as well). I am trying to find a method to choose the number of clusters based on some criteria (like an elbow plot with some criteria for its slope or a BIG criteria orâ€¦), but I am not sure what are the efficient and reliable methods of doing so when only the distance matrix exist. Any suggestion is appreciated.
