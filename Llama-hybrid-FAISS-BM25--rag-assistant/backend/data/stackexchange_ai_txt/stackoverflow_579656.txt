How can I make my Firefox extension toolbar button appear automatically?

I've created a firefox extension that consists of a toolbar button. How can I set it up so that when my extension is installed, the button automatically appears in the main toolbar. I don't want my users to have to go to the customize toolbar menu and drag my button over.
