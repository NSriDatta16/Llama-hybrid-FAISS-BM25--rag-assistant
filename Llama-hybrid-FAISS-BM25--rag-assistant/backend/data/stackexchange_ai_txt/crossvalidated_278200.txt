Your problem description is not too specific, so for exploratory analysis I can only give some general suggestions. ( This may also be relevant.) First, you should definitely visualize the weather stations on a map. Climate patterns will definitely vary depending on the scale of your problem as well as the geographic location (e.g. latitude, proximity to mountains/water bodies). This is also true of spatiotemporal precipitation patterns (e.g. see here ). Second, I would advise you to then check out some movies of satellite / doppler for the relevant area to "prime the intuition" about possible teleconnections . Because of advection , correlations between stations are likely to display time lags and anisotropy (e.g. downwind vs. cross-wind, relative to average wind direction/front migration). A third step you might consider for exploratory data analysis would be to compute a correlation matrix between stations. To allow for time lags, you might consider cross correlation between time series at different stations. So you could compute a matrix of maximum cross-correlations between pairs of stations, along with a matrix of lag times . To assess distance-dependence (possibly anisotropic), for each station you could visualize a map scatterplot of its correlation to the other stations (e.g. using color and/or size of points to indicate the degree of correlation).
