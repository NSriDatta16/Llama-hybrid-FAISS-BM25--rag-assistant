Issue with Advance Featured Products Extension in Magento 1.4.2

I have issue in installing & using Advanced Featured Products Extension(http://www.mage-world.com/advance-featured-products-magento-extension ). I followed the readme.txt (copied the files and created attribute for featured items) in the module. But when I got to Goto admin->system->configuration , I am supposed find “Featured Products” option. But I could not see that in system -> configuration menu. I tried clearing the cache & log in again, but still the Admin menu for Featured products is not appearing. Has anybody faced similar issue. Any solution for this. Thanks.
