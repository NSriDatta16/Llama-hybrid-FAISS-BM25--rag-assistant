Catch and compute overflow during multiplication of two large integers

I am looking for an efficient (optionally standard, elegant and easy to implement) solution to multiply relatively large numbers, and store the result into one or several integers : Let say I have two 64 bits integers declared like this : uint64_t a = xxx, b = yyy; When I do a * b , how can I detect if the operation results in an overflow and in this case store the carry somewhere? Please note that I don't want to use any large-number library since I have constraints on the way I store the numbers.
