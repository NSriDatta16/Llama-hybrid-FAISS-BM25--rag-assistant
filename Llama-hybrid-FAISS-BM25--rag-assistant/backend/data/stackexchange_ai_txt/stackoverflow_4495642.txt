Here's a tutorial describing how to connect to Twitter in an iPhone app using an existing third party library: http://mobile.tutsplus.com/tutorials/iphone/twitter-api-iphone/ I found this with a quick Google search, so you may have already come across it. I've used the library referenced in this tutorial, and it's worked fine in the past. I agree with Robert. Your question doesn't offer many details. I suggest googling around, trying this tutorial and other ones you come across, and then coming back to SO with more specific questions. Good luck!
