This is one reason why I dislike percentages: it’s often not clear whether a “percent difference” is a difference in percentage points between treatment $t$ and control $c$ ( $100*(p_t - p_c)$ , where $p$ is a probability) or a percentage difference from the control success rate ( $100*(p_t-p_c)/ p_c$ ). As I read the original NEJM paper, the authors (in consultation with the FDA) apparently adjusted the design for a noninferiority margin of 12.5 percentage points , which is not how the quote in the second paragraph of your question interpreted it. That’s a big difference in interpretation when the overall response rate to the control drug is only about 60%, as in the NEJM report. Supporting my interpretation, the FDA guidance notes on page 9 that “an absolute difference in effect” is typically the choice of margin for antibiotic trials like that reported in the NEJM paper. For learning about issues in noninferiority trials, that FDA guidance isn’t a bad place to start. With respect to different types of “percent differences,” for example, there’s a simple explanation starting on page 24. Figure 3 nicely illustrates the interpretation of results from noninferiority trials. Much of the document focuses on the difficulties in choosing a noninferiority margin for study design.
