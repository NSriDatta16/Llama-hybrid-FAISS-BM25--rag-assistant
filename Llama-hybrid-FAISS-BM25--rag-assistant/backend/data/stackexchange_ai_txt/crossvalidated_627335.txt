Bayesian and frequentist connections regarding the central limit theorem

I have been wondering how the central limit theorem may be useful in Bayesian statistics with potentially misspecified model distribution. Suppose $x$ is a random variable that follows an unknown (and possibly non-normal) population distribution $P_x$ . $P_x$ depends on two parameters, the mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$ . We have observed i.i.d. samples $x_{1:n}=(x_1,...,x_i,...,x_n)$ from $P_x$ . I am interested in the unknown parameter $\mu$ . Now consider the case that $\sigma^2$ is known. (1) A common frequentistsâ€™ point estimate would be the sample mean $\hat{\mu}=\bar{x}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i$ . According to the central limit theorem (CLT), $\bar{x}\sim N(\mu,\sigma^2/n)$ as $n\to\infty$ . (2) But from an objective Bayesian perspective (using a flat prior on $\mu$ ), how can we obtain the posterior distribution $\mu\mid(x_{1:n},\sigma^2)$ when $n\to\infty$ without making any distributional assumptions? May be applying the Bernstein-von Mises theorem?
