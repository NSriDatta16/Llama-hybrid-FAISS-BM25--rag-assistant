Programmers of all stripes underestimate how much language choices are cultural . Web developers like Node.js. Scientists like Python. As a polyglot software engineer who can handle Javascript's fluidity and Java's rigidity all the same, I've realized there is not any intrinsic reason these languages are bad at each other's jobs -- just the enormous amount of packages, documentation, communities, books, etc. surrounding them. (For intrinsic reasons one random language is better than some other language, see the forthcoming comments to this answer.) My personal prediction is that Python is the way of the future because it can do everything R can - or rather, enough of what R can that dedicated programmers are working to fill in the gaps - and is a far better software engineering language. Software engineering is a discipline that deals with: trusting your code's reliability enough to put it in production (so any machine learning model that serves users in real time) ensuring your code can continue working as it undergoes modification and reuse (unit testing frameworks, for instance) a focus on readability, for the benefit of others, and of yourself in as little as 6 months a deep emphasis on code organization, for ease of versioning, backouts to previous working versions, and concurrent development by multiple parties preferring tools and technologies with better documentation, and ideally with the property that they won't work at all unless you use them right (this was my biggest gripe with Matlab -- I google a question and I have to read through their rather terrible forums searching for an answer) Plus frankly Python is easier to learn. Scientists and statisticians will realize they are stakeholders to good software engineering practice, not an independent and unbothered profession. Just my opinion, but papers proving the brittleness of academic code will support this. This answer is all my opinion - but you asked a very opinionated question, and since it's well-received so far I felt you deserved an unpretentious, reasonably informed (I hope!) opinion in response. There's a serious argument for Python over R across the board and I would be remiss to try to post nonpartisan answer when reality may itself be partisan.
