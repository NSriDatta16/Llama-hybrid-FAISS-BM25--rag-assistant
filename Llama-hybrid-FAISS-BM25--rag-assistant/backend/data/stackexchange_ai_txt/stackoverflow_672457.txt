How about you have three sliders, each from 0% to 100%. Increasing any one slider by X% decreases the other two by X/2%. You could have a radio button for each slider as well, of which only zero or one can be selected at a time. If the radio button for a given slider is selected, that slider is locked and increasing one of the other sliders by X% reduces the remaining slider by X%. Kinda clumsy. You could also have a pie chart with three slices and you can just drag the divider lines around.
