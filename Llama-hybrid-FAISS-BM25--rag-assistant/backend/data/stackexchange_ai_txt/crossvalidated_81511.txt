In your case, I would very much like to try a method like The group lasso for logistic regression : collate your 100 data sets into one big data set X of size $20 000 \times p$, where $p$ is the total number of variables. Then apply the group lasso logistic regression on $(X,y)$, $y$ being the vector of classes (0s and 1s), and the groups being the 100 groups of variables. A posteriori, you could sort the groups according to their importance in the model by considering the $\ell_2$-norm of their coefficients (normalized if the groups have very different sizes).
