Sort Visual Studio build log in "Build Order" style

There is a "Show output from" dropdown list in Visual Studio 2008 "Output" window, which allows viewing build events ordered by thread ( Build Order ). This is very useful when building big solutions on multi-core machines, as the log entries from those come unsynchronized. Our organization has the automated build process, where solution(s) are compiled in a batch mode, using something like: devenv Solution.sln /USEENV /build Release /out buildlog.txt This will load Solution.sln , buld it in Release configuration and output build log into buildlog.txt . Problem is: buildlog.txt is an output resembling "Build" output, not "Build Order", and therefore, it is pretty hard to read. Is there a command-line filter or something, which would convert output to "Build Order" format?
