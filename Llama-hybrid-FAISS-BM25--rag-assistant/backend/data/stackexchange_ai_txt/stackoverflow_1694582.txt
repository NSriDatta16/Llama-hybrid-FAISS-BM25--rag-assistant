Is there a way to make a custom NSWindow work with Spaces

I'm writing an app that has a custom, transparent NSWindow created using a NSWindow subclass with the following: - (id)initWithContentRect:(NSRect)contentRect styleMask:(NSUInteger)aStyle backing:(NSBackingStoreType)bufferingType defer:(BOOL)flag { self = [super initWithContentRect:contentRect styleMask:NSBorderlessWindowMask backing:bufferingType defer:flag]; if (self) { [self setOpaque:NO]; [self setBackgroundColor:[NSColor clearColor]]; } return self; } - (BOOL)canBecomeKeyWindow { return YES; } - (BOOL)canBecomeMainWindow { return YES; } I have everything working perfectly, including dragging and resizing, except the window doesn't work with Spaces. I cannot move the window to another space by either holding the window while switching spaces via keyboard shortcut, or by dragging to the bottom/top/left/right of the window. Is there anyway to have a custom window behave exactly like a normal window with regards to Spaces?
