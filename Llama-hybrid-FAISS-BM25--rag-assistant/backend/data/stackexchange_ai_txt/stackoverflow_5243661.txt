Auto-categorize Authors' articles in Wordpress

A WP user with the role "Author" can post articles. On the blog in question I have the requirement, that these users' articles have to be live immediately but not publicly visible (i.e., for anonymous visitors or Subscribers). We use WP 3.0.5. We already have a plugin running, that allows to hide categories from anonymous and Subscribers. So the most straight-forward method I came up with so far is: New blog posts by Authors should be automatically put in a category. Then I hide that category from anonymous users. Does anyone know: a) how to automatically put an article by "Author" users in a certain category, or b) how the requirement "live but not public" could be achieved more elegantly for those posts? (Plugin suggestions are welcome, too.)
