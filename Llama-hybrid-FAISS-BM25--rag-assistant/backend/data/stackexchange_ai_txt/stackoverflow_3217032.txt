Obviously I don't know your code base, but I really wonder whether calling a function by faking UI interaction would be "a lot cleaner". It might be less code, but it sounds very fragile to me. What happens when the UI is redesigned? Or another developer modifies the live() event handler without realizing that your code is implicitly using it as well? Moving the code into a separate function makes it both more legible and more robust (and probably not significantly longer).
