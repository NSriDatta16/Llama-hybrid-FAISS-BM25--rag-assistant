Graph Distances For words I'd guess you're looking for a distance measure defined over a tree/graph, e.g. geodesic distance and related constructions, but which covers phrases. I wonder if you could treat the phrases as subtrees/subgraphs within the larger graph structure and use a tree similarity measure, e.g. tree edit distance to get a similarity measure? Distributional Distances But for a return to the geometrical (rather than graph structure) approach for answering your previous tweet-related question I suggest googling 'semantic space'. It was big in the late 90's and seems to be having a big data revival. You'll get a lot of Latent Semantic Analysis / Indexing but the intuitions about semantic distance in a semantic space are the same whether it's about words or phrases and whether or not there is a dimensionality reduction first. These intuitions are basically: meaning is distributional similarity a.k.a. substitutability in context. semantic similarity is usually the (cosine of the) angle between two word vectors. A more or less random collection of links include e.g. this intro and this thesis , work by H. Sch√ºtze, T. Pederson, S. Finch and N. Chater, S. Evert, but there is a lot more out there. In the general framework phrases can be turned into single vectors by adding (or otherwise combining) their word vectors together before angles are computed. Some software for constructing these semantic spaces is here or more recently here .
