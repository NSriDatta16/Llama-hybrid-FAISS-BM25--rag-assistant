If, by Bayesian network, you mean a Bayesian network generated from an directed acyclic graph (DAG), then this is straight forward. Since you are asking about a correlation matrix, you are assuming linearity and normality. A DAG, converted to linear links between nodes and normally distributed variables, is equivalent to a series of structural equations, i.e. SEM. The basic rules of path tracing of SEM will generate the predicted covariance (thus correlation) matrix given this network.
