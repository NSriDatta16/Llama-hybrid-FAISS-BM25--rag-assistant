Excel - Best way to graph the change of a cell as a function of the change of another cell

I have a huge excel workbook that I've been developing to do some cost analysis of an engineering project. Right now, I have a cell where I enter the size of a storage tank, which updates another cell which contains the total savings. The process of calculating the savings is quite complex. There are 20 sheets in my workbook, one for each year of operation, and each of them references the tank size. Normally I'd try to make two columns and drag the formula for the savings down to get my x and y values, but I don't think I can do this as the savings cell depends on 20 other sheets. What I want to know is this: What's the best way to graph the relation between size of tank and savings. Ideally I'd like to say "OK, vary the value in this cell between zero and 2 million in increments of 1000, then record the value of the savings cell for each of these increments, then plot," but I can't seem to figure out how to make that happen.
