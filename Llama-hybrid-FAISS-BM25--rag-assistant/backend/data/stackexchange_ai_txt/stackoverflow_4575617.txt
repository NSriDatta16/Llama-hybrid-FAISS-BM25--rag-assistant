Neural-network (with Jeff Heaton's Encog) to mimic computer memory

I want to mimic computer memory with jeff heaton's encog neural network library. I just don't know what approach to use. My requirement is to, have a memory location and a collection of bytes for the values. location [0000]:byte-data[0101010] location [0001]:byte-data[0101010] Those are the values I pass to the neural network system. I was trying to avoid retraining the neural network every time the memory data changes. But maybe that is what I need to do. What neural network techniques would you use to accomplish what I am trying to do?
