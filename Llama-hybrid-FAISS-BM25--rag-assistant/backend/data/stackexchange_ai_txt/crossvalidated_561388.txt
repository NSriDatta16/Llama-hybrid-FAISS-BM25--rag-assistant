Introduce a new variable to GLM

I have this one interview question regarding GLM model and would love some insights into method/product sense/common sense input. -Consider this car insurance pricing model: y (car price) = B1 * Credit Score + B2 * Age Group Credit Score is a discrete variable Age Group is a categorical variable (1,2,3,4) Group 1 No Drunk Driving History is categorical variable where 1 signifies yes and 0 signifies no. My question is if I never have any data regarding drunk driving history to do a GLM Fit, how do I determine/estimate the coefficient for this? I mean B3 term, statistically and in common sense. Is there any suggestion? I was thinking Maybe research the difference in average claim cost for drunk driver and non-drunk driver using other resources and judgmentally select it? if I want to do an interaction term B4 between Age Group and No Drunk Driving variable, how do I determine the coefficents B4? I was thinking of doing a correlation analysis. But I'm open to suggestion.
