This question is not only theoretical but also very practical! The theory does not exclude at all unbalanced problems such as the one you propose. Indeed the logistic regression model is based on the response following the probability model of a Bernouili trial and the probability of response can be in the range from $0$ to $1$ . The points to be careful of should be: first to be sure to have enough data to perform the inference, especially if you have multiple dimensions as you mention. Be sure to cross-validate your learning, second, to use the proper accuracy score such as an balanced accuracy score Hope this helps!
