A quantity $x$ is measured in three different ways, where $x$ is constant and independent of the measurement. Experiments are subject to 2 sources of errors and the measurements record instead $$X_i = x + \epsilon_i + \mu_i.$$ The experimenters only know about $\epsilon$ and can come up with a corresponding error estimate $\sigma_i$. Obviously, unless you know/assume more about $\mu$, you cannot say anything further. But assume all $\mu_i$ are realizations of the same RV $\mu$ with mean 0, variance $s^2$ and $\mu \perp \epsilon$. A simple estimator for $x$ is simply an average over $X_i$: $$\hat x = \frac{1}{n} \sum_i X_i.$$ (you can come up with variance minimizing estimators as well.) You can easily see that the value you are looking for, $var\ \hat x$ is $$var\ \hat x = \frac{1}{n^2}\left( \sum_i \sigma_i + n s^2 \right).$$ For unknown $s^2$ you can use the relationship $$var\ X = \sum_i \sigma_i^2 + ns^2.$$ If you think it makes sense, I can think further but it will take some time. Think if you are happy with the assumptions. Try it with Monte-Carlo simulations. I am afraid 3 measurements is way too little to provide anything useful.
