Why are p-values often higher in a Cox proportional hazard model than in logistic regression?

I've been learning about the Cox proportional hazard model. I have a lot of experience fitting logistic regression models, and so to build intuition I've been comparing models fit using coxph from the R "survival" with logistic regression models fit using glm with family="binomial" . If I run the code: library(survival) s = Surv(time=lung$time, event=lung$status - 1) summary(coxph(s ~ age, data=lung)) summary(glm(status-1 ~ age, data=lung, family="binomial")) I get p-values for age of 0.0419 and 0.0254 respectively. Similarly if I use sex as a predictor, with or without age. I find this puzzling because I would think that taking amount of time elapsed into account when fitting the model would give more statistical power than just treating death as a binary outcome, whereas the p values would seem consistent with one having less statistical power. What is going on here?
