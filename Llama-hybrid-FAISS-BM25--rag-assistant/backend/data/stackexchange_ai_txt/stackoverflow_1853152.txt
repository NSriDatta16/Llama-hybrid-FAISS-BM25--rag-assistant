Because tree data structures are often used to organize ordered elements, e.g: a > b > c. If your items that are inserted in the trees are ordered, all you need are two branches at each node to divide elements that are larger into the left sub-tree, and elements that are smaller into the right sub-tree. This is why binary trees are so much more prevalent that m-ary trees. It has nothing to do with the ease of making a yes/no decision versus a m-ary decision!
