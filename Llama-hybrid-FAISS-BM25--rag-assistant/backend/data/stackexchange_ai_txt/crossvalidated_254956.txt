That AML uses logistic regression for all cases, if true, is somewhat surprising to me, since logistic regression is not generally the most powerful classification tool. Perhaps AML uses it because training the logistic regression model would require much less of Amazon's resources than, say, training a boosted decision tree -- though as a customer, processing power is what I'd think I was paying Amazon for. If they are indeed using only logistic regression, they are possibly using augmented versions for increased performance. For instance, they could conceivably be training a GAM with the logistic loss function, to account for nonlinear relationships via smoothing splines, or modeling interactions through some automated procedure.
