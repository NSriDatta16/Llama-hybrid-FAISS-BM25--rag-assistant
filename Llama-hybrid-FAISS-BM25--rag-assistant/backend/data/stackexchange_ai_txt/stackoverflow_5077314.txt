Marshal.QueryInterface shouldn't be necessary - if you take a COM object and cast it to a COM interface type, .NET does the QueryInterface call for you. That is, you can write: IPersistStorage persist = (IPersistStorage) obj; However it's not clear to me which object in the code implements IPersistStorage , IPersistStreamInit etc.
