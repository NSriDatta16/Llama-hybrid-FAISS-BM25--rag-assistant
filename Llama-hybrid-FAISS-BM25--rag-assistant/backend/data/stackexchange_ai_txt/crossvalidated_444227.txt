Is it normal to get more variance in k folds cross-validation of an algorithm than in k repetitions?

Is it normal to get a lot more variance in k folds cross-validation of an algorithm than in k repetitions of the same algorithm (neural network) on the same dataset? k = k_folds = 10 , same random seeds Cross Validation Accuracy with k folds : 89.78% (+/-13.29%) Mean Test Accuracy on k independent runs: 84.08% (+/-2.76%) Thanks in advance
