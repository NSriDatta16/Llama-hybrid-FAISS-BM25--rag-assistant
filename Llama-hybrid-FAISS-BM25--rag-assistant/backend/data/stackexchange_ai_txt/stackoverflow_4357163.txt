#pragma pack won't compile?

I'm trying to compile some downloaded source which contains lots of: 142 #ifdef __cplusplus 143 #pragma pack(1) 144 #endif but I get the following error and it won't compile: src/globals.h:143:16: error: expected declaration before end of line mingw32-make: *** [obj/main.o] Error 1 I'm using a makefile downloaded with the rest of the source to compile it. what do I need to do to get this to compile? EDIT : The source code is the code for KeeperFX available from google code .
