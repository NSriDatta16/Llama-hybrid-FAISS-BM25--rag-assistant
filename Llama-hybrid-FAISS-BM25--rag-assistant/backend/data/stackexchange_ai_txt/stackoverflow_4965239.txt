I've addressed this exact thing a couple times in recent projects. Even better than putting this in the controller would be to create an Authentication service that wraps your FormsAuthentication-specific code, then inject that service via IoC where ever you may need it. Pretty much any IoC container should be able to also specify that your Authentication service could be cached per-http request, so you can take advantage of that to help conserve resources / enhance performance. Now if you need to display this user info in lots of places, I would encourage you to create a separate UserController and do a RenderAction call to it wherever the User info is needed in your views, instead of making your user view model a part of a bunch of other view models (unless it's actually needed by the other models/views to satisfy some business conditions, etc.). This way you can have a standard, "canonical" view of the user info, as a component, and you'll get lots of reuse out of it.
