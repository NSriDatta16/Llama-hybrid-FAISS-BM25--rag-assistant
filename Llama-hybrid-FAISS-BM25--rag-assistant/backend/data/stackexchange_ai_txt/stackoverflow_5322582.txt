However this is not a good idea; better is to use the above technique to build an environment variable other than $CLASSPATH and pass that as the argument to the java -cp command line option: cp="" for j in $(find /path/to/jigsaw/lib -name \*.jar) do if [ ! -z "$cp" ]; then cp="$cp:"; fi cp="$cp$j" done java -cp $cp ...
