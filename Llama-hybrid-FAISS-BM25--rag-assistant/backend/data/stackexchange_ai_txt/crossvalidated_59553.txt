The likelihood ratio test is considered the gold standard as it measures the difference in likelihood between the null value and the ML estimate. It also only requires you to calculate the value of the likelihood (or log-likelihood), though you will often calculate or estimate the 1st and/or second derivatives to find the ML estimate. The Wald statistic only requires you to calculate the likelihood at the ML value, you do not need to calculate it at the null hypothesis value, though you need to calculate/estimate the 2nd derivative at the ML value. The Wald statistic works well when the likelihood function is symmetric about the ML estimate, but can be misleading if the likelihood is very non-symmetric. The score test only requires you to calculate the slope at the null hypothesis value, you do not need to find the ML estimate or calculate the likelihood at the ML estimate. Both the Wald and Score methods have problems if there is a section of the likelihood that flattens out. One of the more common cases of this is the Hoek Donner effect in logistic regression where a very significant coefficient shows up as non-significant due to the flattening. For your 2nd question, test statistics based on resampling (permutation and bootstrap) tests focus more on the way the data was collected and pretty much ignore the likelihood of the distribution of the data.
