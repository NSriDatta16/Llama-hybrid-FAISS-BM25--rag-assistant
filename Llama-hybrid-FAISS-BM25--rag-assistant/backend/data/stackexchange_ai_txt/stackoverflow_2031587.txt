You say commercial/open source doesn't matter. Does it matter if it's a hosted service? If hosted is OK, you could try StackExchange , which runs the same software that Stack Overflow runs on. It's more of a Q&A site than a FAQ site, but you could probably add links to the most common questions in the sidebar, and use search for finding anything else. Prefer a non-wiki solution ✓ Windows/.NET solution would be ideal but not required ✓ Doesn't matter if solution is commercial/open source ✓ Ability to sort questions by category/topic/tags ✓ Support for embedding images within text ✓ Option to rate answers ✓ RSS Feed, if possible ✓ Ability to assign related questions ✗
