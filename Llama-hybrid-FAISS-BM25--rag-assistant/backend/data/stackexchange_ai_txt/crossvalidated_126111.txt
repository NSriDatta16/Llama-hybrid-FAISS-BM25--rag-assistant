Linear mixed effects model methodology suggestions

4 beehives were equipped with sensors that collected temp, humidity, pressure, decibels inside the hive. these are the response variables. the treatment was wifi exposure, the experimental groups were exposed to wifi from day 1 to day 20, then again from day 35-45, and data was collected until day day 54. n of hives = 4, n of data collected by sensors in each hive = ~million. "wifi" is a dichotomous variable (1=on 0=off) that corresponds to the time of exposure, and treatment hive is another dichotomous variable for the hives exposed to wifi (1=exposure, 0=control). The goal is to determine if the wifi treatments had an effect on the response variables. The effect does necessary correspond to the time of wifi exposure. names(Hives) [1] "time" "dht22_t" "dht11_t" "dht22_h" [5] "dht11_h" "db" "pa" "treatment_hive" [9] "wifi Data was also collected on area of honey storage in cm^2 on day 6 and 28. for each day, each hive has 20 data points (=10 frames, double sided). I am not too sure how to incorporate this as it only occurred twice. I have run a linear mixed effects model > model2 summary(model2) Linear mixed-effects model fit by REML Data: Hives AIC BIC logLik 51750.65 51793.24 -25868.33 Random effects: Formula: ~1 | treatment_hive (Intercept) StdDev: 16.39396 Formula: ~1 | time %in% treatment_hive (Intercept) Residual StdDev: 660.3532 247.6325 Fixed effects: pa ~ wifi * treatment_hive Value Std.Error DF t-value p-value (Intercept) 100555.88 32.49260 3241 3094.7323 0.0000 wifi 126.14 43.75924 3241 2.8826 0.0040 treatment_hive 452.52 41.40820 0 10.9282 NaN wifi:treatment_hive 79.92 53.47412 3241 1.4945 0.1351 Correlation: (Intr) wifi trtmn_ wifi -0.554 treatment_hive -0.785 0.434 wifi:treatment_hive 0.453 -0.818 -0.532 Standardized Within-Group Residuals: Min Q1 Med Q3 Max -0.87249020 -0.26487688 0.05674425 0.28952796 0.69706926 Number of Observations: 3245 Number of Groups: treatment_hive time %in% treatment_hive 2 3245 I intend to run this model for each response variable, but am not sure if there are more suitable ways to model this data.
