Getting useful emails from Hudson instead of tail of ant log

A team member of mine recently setup some Hudson continuous-integration builds for a number of our development code bases. It uses the built in ant integration configured in simple way. While, it is very helpful and I recommend it strongly, I was wondering how to get more more concise/informative/useful emails instead of just the tail of the ant build log. E.G., Don't want this: > [...truncated 36530 lines...] > [junit] Tests run: 32, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Time elapsed: 0.002 sec ... (hundred of lines omitted) ... > [junit] Tests run: 10, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Time elapsed: 0.001 sec > [junit] Tests FAILED > > BUILD FAILED I assume, that I could skip the build-in ant support and send the build log through a grep script, but I was hoping there was a more integrated or elegant option.
