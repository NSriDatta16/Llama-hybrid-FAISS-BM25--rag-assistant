WordPress PHP - How do I sort category/archive results by a specific "meta_key" value?

I previously made a post here: How do I sort by a custom field without manually creating a new page? However, I believe I asked the wrong question (and I may still be asking the wrong question). Actually think I may need a complex query that will display posts ordered by a meta value. The site is using a theme called "AgentPress". I believe passing params via the URL bar may be too simplistic for what I need. Honestly I like the way the current category pages display (formatting, etc.), I simply need to "short-circuit" the process so that any category/archive page is sorted by the meta_key for the "property price" as opposed to the date of entry. If there is a simple, more "WordPress-y" mechanism for doing this, I'm all ears. Please be explicit about where to place the code, etc. FYI, at this point it's clear that passing "order=ASC" and "order=DESC" in the URL works. However, it seems that nothing I do with "meta_key" or anything related has any effect. Thanks in advance.
