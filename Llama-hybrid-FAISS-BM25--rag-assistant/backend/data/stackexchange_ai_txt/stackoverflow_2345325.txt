The issue with RMS is that the data often (but not always) does not persist across application upgrades. So if you use RMS, users may have to reconfigure your application every time they upgrade to a new build/version. This may or may not be a concern. IMHO, the best way is Persistent Store (if you don't mind code signing), otherwise its RMS. One thing to keep in mind is that while PS seems much simpler, making your persistent data robust against application changes makes it complicated again. This is why I keep my configuration data classes separate from the classes that actually get persisted. Now if you want file-style mass storage for something a bit more substantial than a cache or configuration object, you may want to look into the FileConnection API. That gives you a lot more potential storage space to work with.
