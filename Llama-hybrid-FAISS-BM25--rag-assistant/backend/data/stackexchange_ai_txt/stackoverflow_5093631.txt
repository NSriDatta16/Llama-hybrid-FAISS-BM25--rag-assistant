Charging System or Billing System? Talking with a number of folks building businesses in the Ruby community, I thinks it's important to note that simply collecting customer payments and scalable billing are two rather unique animals. Today's SaaS companies are not always aware of the difference. Hitting credit cards for $39.95 on a monthly basis is something most of the "payment tools" mentioned here do well. Yet, when one needs to incorporate a complex billing algorithm (charge model), client contracts, promotional codes, freemium, tiered, rollover or metered usage, or integration with other internal systems, They need more than a payment machine. They really need a "smarter" billing system that leverages a payment gateway, but does far more than simply hitting cards on a monthly basis. Also, if one has a significant number of clients or volume a system that scales is key. For research check out more mid-tier billing systems like http://www.metanga.com or http://www.zuora.com .
