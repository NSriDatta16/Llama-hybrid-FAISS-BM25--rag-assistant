For Firefox: Firebug is awesome for investigation and development. Web Developer Toolbar is good also. Really helps with CSS and page layout stuff as well as much more. I also use Live HTTP Headers (I think it is called, but it is on my work machine, so can't find the link now). Which has helped us out with caching issues and the like. I do a lot of mobile phone development, so I also use UserAgent Switcher . Very helpful for pretending to be different mobile phones. I tend to only use Firefox for development, and just test in other browsers as most do not have the extensive range of plugins to aid development that Firefox does.
