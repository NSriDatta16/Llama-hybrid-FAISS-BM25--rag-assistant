Why is Cacti showing an empty graph, even though the rrd file is created?

I have developed my own SNMP service, and i want to plot a graph of an OID provided. So, i have created a graph in Cacti. -) It is showing device up. -) It is creating rrd file. (RRDTool says OK). -) Showing the graph, but it's empty. But when I check it, say rrdtool fetch AVERAGE it shows me nan for all the values. The monitored OID has value 47 and i have set min=0 and max=100. I am using Cacti appliance by rpath: http://www.rpath.org/ui/#/appliances?id=http://www.rpath.org/api/products/cacti-appliance Still, I can't show value on graph.. Where is the problem? Can anyone please tell me?
