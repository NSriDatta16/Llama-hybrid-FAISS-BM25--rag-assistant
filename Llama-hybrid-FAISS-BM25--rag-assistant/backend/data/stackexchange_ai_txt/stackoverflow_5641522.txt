Had the exact same issue today. In my case, it was that I thought the table name was tblname , when in fact, it was "tblname" (with quotes). I also work with SQL Developer, and the Schema Browser showed that the table name was tblname , which fooled me. Only when I used the drag-and-drop utility to create a select command from this table, did I see the table name actually contained quotes.
