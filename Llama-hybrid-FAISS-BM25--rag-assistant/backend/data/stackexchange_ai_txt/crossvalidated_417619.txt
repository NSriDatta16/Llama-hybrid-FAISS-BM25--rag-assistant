Adding to the first comment, I would recommend you to have it as channels. i.e. whole data becomes 3 dimensional, which can be still processed by deep learning models. Let me put it clear, Dimension 1 - rows Dimension 2 - Sensors Dimension 3 - Location so your data will look something like this [[[38, 38, 35, 33, 32], [18, 18, 12, 11, 09]], [[33, 32, 35, 36, 32], [13, 12, 15, 16, 12]]] This way it will make more sense to the model as well.
