How do you visualize your sprint backlog?

Most Scrum teams have some sort of whiteboard or other board upon which the stories/tasks for the current sprint are visualized. I'm curious as to how people organize this board? Do you use post-it notes? Are they color-coded? How do you group tasks? How do you distinguish the state of tasks? Etc...
