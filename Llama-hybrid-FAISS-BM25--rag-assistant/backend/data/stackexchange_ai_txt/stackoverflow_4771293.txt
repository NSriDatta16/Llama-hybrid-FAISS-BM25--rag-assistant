Can an author's unique "literary style" be used to identify him/her as the author of a text?

Let's imagine, I have two English language texts written by the same person. Is it possible to apply some Markov chain algorithm to analyse each: create some kind of fingerprint based on statistical data, and compare fingerprints gotten from different texts? Let's say, we have a library with 100 texts. Some person wrote text number 1 and some other as well, and we need to guess which one by analyzing his/her writing style. Is there any known algorithm doing it? Can be Markov chains applied here?
