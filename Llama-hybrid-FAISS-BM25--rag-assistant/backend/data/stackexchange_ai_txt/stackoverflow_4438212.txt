Magento - Populate a dropdown from 'X' Store categories

I am in the process of customising our search filters on our Multi-Domain Magento install and was wondering how I can populate a dropdown with the category titles from a store depending on what store/domain you are on. Probably a simple query but have so much going on at the moment I can't think where to start! Thanks
