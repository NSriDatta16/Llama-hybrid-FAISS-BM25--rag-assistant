Code coverage for aspx, aspx.cs, ascx and ascx.cs files

my application is built using aspx, aspx.cs, ascx and ascx.cs files. i want to do code coverage for all of these files. I don't have Unit tests existing. please let me know if I can do code coverage without any unit tests directly?? if yes, how? Thanks in advance, Shweta
