What you want is the tag. This is a special HTML tag that tells the browser that it is acceptable to break a word here if a wrap is necessary. I would not inject the into the text for persistent storage because then you are coupling your data with where/how you will display that data. However, it is perfectly acceptable to inject the tags server side in code that is view-centric (like with a JSP tag or possibly in the controller). That's how I would do it. Just use some regular expression to find words that are longer than X characters and inject this tag every X characters into such words. Update: I was doing some looking around and it looks like wbr is not supported on all browsers. Most notably, IE8. I haven't tested this myself though. Perhaps you could use overflow:hidden as a backup or something like that.
