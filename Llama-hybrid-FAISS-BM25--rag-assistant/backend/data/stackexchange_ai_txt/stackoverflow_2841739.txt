You can set some linker options by using #pragma comment in one of your source files. For example, to link against a 'detours.lib' library only if COMPILE_WITH_DETOURS is defined, you can use: #ifdef COMPILE_WITH_DETOURS # pragma comment(lib, "detours.lib") #endif (this is specific to Microsoft Visual C++ and is not portable)
