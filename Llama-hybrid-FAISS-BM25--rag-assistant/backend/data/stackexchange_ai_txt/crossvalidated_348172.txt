How do I interpret the posterior in a GLM of the lognormal family?

How do I interpret the posterior in a GLM of the lognormal family? I collected some data that is bound at zero and skewed to the left. I therefore assumed Y to be lognormal distributed and run a model via the brms package with a GLM of the lognormal family and identity link. As far as I understood it, I am now not estimating the mean and variance of a normal distribution, but two scale parameters for the lognormal distribution. How do I interpret the output from brms now? Using the summary() function on the brms object, I get an Estimate for each parameter and an estimated error. Is this now the estimated value of the first scale parameter? Do I need to transform the estimated error to derive the second parameter of the lognormal distribution? If I sample from the posterior and cut of the lower and upper 2.5%, do I get the credibility interval for the mean effect of the parameter on Y, or do I get the credibility interval for plausible ranges of the first scale parameter? I am fairly new to bayesian analysis and only have done some "cookbook" GLM stuff like logistic regression. Could anybody clarify how I can make sense of the output? I coded an example in R to illustrate my problem: library(brms) a
