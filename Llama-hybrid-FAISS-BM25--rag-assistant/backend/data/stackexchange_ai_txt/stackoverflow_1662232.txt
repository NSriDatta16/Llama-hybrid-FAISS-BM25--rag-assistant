Magento error: SQLSTATE[HY000]: General error: 1

I hope this question is ok for Stack Overflow – If it’s not appropriate then let me know and I’ll remove if that’s the case. Magento has been recently giving me the following error when I visit the shop on a windows machine: SQLSTATE[HY000]: General error: 1 Can’t create/write to file ‘C:\WINDOWS\TEMP#sql_ac0_0.MYI’ (Errcode: 17) I have ensured I am using a database user with all permissions. The thing that baffles me about the error is its reference to C:\WINDOWS\TEMP … as that’s a local file on the windows machine. May I add that the issue only ever appears when I’m testing on windows machines, and not on my Mac. The machines I test on all have cookies enabled. What function of Magento requires to write to the user’s PC apart from leaving a cookie? (and even if it is just a cookie, why should it break the site?)
