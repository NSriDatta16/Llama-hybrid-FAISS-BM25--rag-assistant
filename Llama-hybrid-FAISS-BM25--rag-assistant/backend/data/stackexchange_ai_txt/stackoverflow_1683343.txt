When I encountered this problem a year ago with SQL Server 2008 on Windows Server 2003 64-bit the issue was caused by incorrect drivers. What is the version of the Oracle database to which you are connecting? If you are connecting to a 8g or 9i Oracle server, then you need to use the 9i Oracle drivers. If you are connecting to a 10g or better server, then you can use the 11i drivers. Have you tried running the SSIS package while logged into the server as the SQL Server Agent service account or have you only tested this on your workstation? If it works on your workstation and doesn't work while logged into the server as the service account, then this screams driver issue to me.
