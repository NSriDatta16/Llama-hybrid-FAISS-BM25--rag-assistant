How call a behavior of variable that is explained by other variable?

I have one dependent variable (it is a binary response variable that I want to predict, let's say "t1"), and also two independent variables ("v1" and "v2"). They are both found statistically significant in univariate analysis as contributors to t1 response odds. Additionally, we preliminary know that v1 is a drug that used to elevate v2. When I create multivariate analysis using logistic regression only with v1+v2 as independent variables and t1 as dependent variable, v1 (the drug) is losing significance as I expected. What do I call this behavior? Is v1 called mediator variable , and if so, how do I call v2?
