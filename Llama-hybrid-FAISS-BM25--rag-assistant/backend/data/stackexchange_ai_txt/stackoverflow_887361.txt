Here's what Robert C. Martin has to say about it: Singleton vs. Monostate (pdf) SINGLETON is best used when you have an existing class that you want to constrain through derivation, and you donâ€™t mind that everyone will have to call the instance() method to gain access. Monostate is best used when you want the singular nature of the class to be transparent to the users, or when you want to employ polymorphic derivatives of the single object.
