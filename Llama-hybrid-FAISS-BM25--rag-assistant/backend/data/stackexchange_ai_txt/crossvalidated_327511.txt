Consistent with @kjetil-b-halvorsen's comment, the rapid adoption of machine learning has confused researchers about prediction vs. classification. As I described in more detail here , classification is only appropriate in a minority of cases. When the outcome is rare (or too common), probabilities are everything because in that case one can only reasonably speak about tendencies , not about predicting individual occurrences. In statistics, we learned a while back that any method that requires one to exclude some of the data is highly suspect. So the goal of balancing outcomes is misplaced. Prediction of tendencies (probabilities) does not require it. And once you estimate a probability you can make an optimal decision by applying the utility/cost/loss function to the predicted risk.
