Exponentially Weighted Covariance Matrix with Ledoit Wolf Shrinkage

The Ledoit Wolf paper "Honey, I Shrunk the Sample Covariance Matrix" presents the formulation for the shrinkage intensity parameter estimate in Appendix B. The formula for a weighted covariance matrix is shown in the answer to this question , and an exponentially weighted covariance matrix would use weights with an exponential decay. I am trying to calculate a exponentially weighted covariance matrix with shrinkage. I understand that the shrinkage formula will be modified so the "constant correlation model" will use the average of all pairwise weighted correlations rather than unweighted correlations, and the sample covariance matrix will now be weighted. However, I am uncertain of how the shrinkage intensity parameter estimate would be modified. Question: How would the Ledoit Wolf shrinkage intensity parameter estimate formulation be modified for an exponentially weighted covariance matrix?
