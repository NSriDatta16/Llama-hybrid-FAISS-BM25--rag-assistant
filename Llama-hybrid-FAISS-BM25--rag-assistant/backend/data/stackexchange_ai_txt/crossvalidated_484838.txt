Regarding the use of non informative priors

I am a beginner to Bayesian analysis and I am trying to fit a logistic regression model using Bayesian approach. For the prior distribution of the $\beta$ regression coefficients , I used a non informative prior which is normally distributed with a very high variance. $\beta \sim N(0,10000)$ . For the analysis ,MCMC method was employed in JAGS package in R. I have seen in several books and articles that , when we use non informative priors, the results would be similar to classical method. But in my case when I compare the results of my Bayesian logistic regression model with the classical logistic regression model , it is not similar. What may be the reason for this ? My main intention of this question is to learn the theoretical reasoning behind my problem and what kind of steps that I should follow when there is a problem this. Thank you.
