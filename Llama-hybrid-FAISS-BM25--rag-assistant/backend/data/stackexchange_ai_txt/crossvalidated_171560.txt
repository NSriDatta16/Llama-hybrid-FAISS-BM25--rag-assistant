The problem is that the causality might go both ways, and if you just study the association between var_day and var_night, you won't be able to say anything about the causality. I don't think that this can be addressed in a regression analysis such as logistic regression or multiple regression. Perhaps it would be possible using structural equations, but I don't know enough about those models to be certain. Another member gave you a hint about a model for comparing time series in this way, but I can't recall the name of that analysis model. Anyway, I think you have far too few observations per individual to do that kind of analysis. But if you're satisfied with identifying an association between var_day and var_night, you can use a regression model. If the dependent variable (var_day?) is approximately normally distributed, it makes sense to use a linear mixed model, so that you can take the repeated measures into account. The "mixed" indicates that there is a random effect, which is the subject in this case to account for the correlation between the different var_day measurements within each subject. The equation, using R notation, might then be: library(lme4) lmer (Var_day ~ Var_night + Age + Sex + BMI + factor(Group) + (1|Subject_id)) You might also consider an effect of time on the dependent variable: perhaps the subjects may get more tired for each day they participate in the study? Then you might add Day as another random effect: lmer (Var_day ~ Var_night + Age + Sex + BMI + factor(Group) + (1|Subject_id) + (1|Day)) Of course, you would need to check to see if the assumption of a linear effect of Age, BMI and Var_night is reasonable. But as I said, this will say nothing about the direction of the causality. If that's what you're after, you'll have to try something else.
