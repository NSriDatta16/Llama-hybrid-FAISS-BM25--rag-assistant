All those "" literals are the same object. Why make all that extra complexity? It's just longer to type and less clear (the cost to the compiler is minimal). Since Java's strings are immutable objects, there's never any need at all to distinguish between them except possibly as an efficiency thing, but with the empty string literal that's not a big deal. If you really want an EmptyString constant, make it yourself. But all it will do is encourage even more verbose code; there will never be any benefit to doing so.
