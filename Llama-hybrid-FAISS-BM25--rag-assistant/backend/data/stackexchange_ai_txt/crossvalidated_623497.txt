Working with subsets of values from single category in XGBoost

Since version 1.5, XGBoost supports categorical data out of the box, which is a convenient way to skip the one-hot pre-processing step and allow for if X in values splits. For example, given a category animal with values: dog, cat, lizard, snake , XGBoost can now split based on e.g. if animal in {dog, cat} , i.e. treating animal as a single feature, rather than using 4 "sub-features" from the one-hot encoding of animal and doing if X splits. This works for datasets like: row, animal 0, dog 1, cat 2, lizard However, would it be possible to extend this to features with multiple values in the same category? That is, for datasets where the feature of a training instance is a subset of potential categories (multi-hot encoding)? e.g.: row, animal 0, {dog} 1, {dog, cat} 2, {cat, snake, lizard} My intuition says no, because essentially each subset becomes a new "value", and the category now is the powerset, which becomes impractical for large cardinality. But I was wondering if there are additional tricks here.
