Alternatively, per another answer in that thread , you could fit ARIMA models to each series separately (maybe removing the shorter series first). Either let auto.arima() select a model, and then use the model picked for the majority of your time series. Or fit a range of different models to each series and compare their AICs, finally choosing a model with low average AIC (taking a bit of care since AICs are not comparable between series with different orders of integration or seasonal integration). Or per the linked answer, assess models on holdout samples using some comparable metric like MASE, and choosing the model that performs best. If you want to forecast, you could also use an ensemble of multiple series, e.g., using the $n$ best-performing ARIMA models per one of the approaches above. You could even try estimating weights for the combination, but that often does not improve matters.
