Don't you have to use 3dsmaxcmd.exe for this? To view a list of sample command lines with descriptions of what they do: The 3dsmaxcmd.exe file also has an extensive list of sample text strings that describe many of the most common scenarios you'd use command-line rendering to accomplish. 1. Open a command prompt window. 2. Enter the following: “c:\program files\autodesk\3dsmaxXXX\3dsmaxcmd” -x and press Enter. All control characters map to the Windows Regional settings standards. Date format control chars: d Day of month as digits with no leading zero for single-digit days. dd Day of month as digits with leading zero for single-digit days. ddd Day of week as a three-letter abbreviation. The function uses the LOCALE_SABBREVDAYNAME value associated with the specified locale. dddd Day of week as its full name. The function uses the LOCALE_SDAYNAME value associated with the specified locale. M Month as digits with no leading zero for single-digit months. MM Month as digits with leading zero for single-digit months. MMM Month as a three-letter abbreviation. The function uses the LOCALE_SABBREVMONTHNAME value associated with the specified locale. MMMM Month as its full name. The function uses the LOCALE_SMONTHNAME value associated with the specified locale. y Year as last two digits, but with no leading zero for years less than 10. yy Year as last two digits, but with leading zero for years less than 10. yyyy Year represented by full four digits. Time format control chars: h Hours with no leading zero for single-digit hours; 12-hour clock. hh Hours with leading zero for single-digit hours; 12-hour clock. H Hours with no leading zero for single-digit hours; 24-hour clock. HH Hours with leading zero for single-digit hours; 24-hour clock. m Minutes with no leading zero for single-digit minutes. mm Minutes with leading zero for single-digit minutes. s Seconds with no leading zero for single-digit seconds. ss Seconds with leading zero for single-digit seconds. t One character time-marker string, such as A or P. tt Multicharacter time-marker string, such as AM or PM. -BACKBURNER JOB SUBMISSION- you want to submit a job to backburner, you can optionally give a manager me, otherwise it will perform a default search for the manager. You can tionally specify the manager's port number and, for searches, a netmask. suming the manager's network name is mgr_machine: 3dsmaxcmd scene.max -submit 3dsmaxcmd scene.max -submit -netmask:255.255.0.0 3dsmaxcmd scene.max -submit:mgr_machine 3dsmaxcmd scene.max -submit:mgr_machine -port:1234 you want to change the job name and submit it to the network queue initially suspended: 3dsmaxcmd scene.max -submit -jobName:"My Job" -suspended default, a 32-bit 3dsmaxcmd.exe will submit jobs to 32-bit servers, and 64-bit 3dsmaxcmd.exe will submit jobs to 64-bit servers. You can optionally bmit a job to a platform other than the default. To submit a job to 64-bit rvers from a 32-bit 3dsmaxcmd.exe: 3dsmaxcmd scene.max -submit -platform:64 bmit a strip render job to the network. Job uses 4 strips, and an overlap 10 pixels between each strip: 3dsmaxcmd scene.max -submit -split:4,10 nder a single strip locally. Render strip number 2 of 4, using an overlap 10 pixels between each strip: 3dsmaxcmd scene.max -strip:4,10,2 itch together a set of strips rendered locally. Stitch a frame rendered ing 4 strips and an overlap of 10 pixels between each strip: 3dsmaxcmd scene.max -stitch:4,10 default, timeout values for waiting for max to load, render, and unload e the same as those found in the Advanced settings of the Network Job signment dialog in max. To specify timeout values (minutes) when submitting job: 3dsmaxcmd scene.max -submit -waitLoad:20 -waitRender:300 -waitUnload:10 you want to generate a job description xml file so you can edit it: ny command line options specified will be included in the job file) 3dsmaxcmd scene.max -writeJobFile ad a pre-existing job description file and render it: 3dsmaxcmd scene.max -readJobFile:scene.xml A smaxcmd [options] scene_file -BASIC OPTIONS- -? -
