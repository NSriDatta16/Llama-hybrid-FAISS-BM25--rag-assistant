One important side note: This seems to suggest that any application of the Monte Carlo method can be concluded within several hundred/thousand of simulations as well. But I feel this cannot be true, as it would appear to defeat the purpose of the plethora of “more efficient alternatives” to Monte Carlo (such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo). Markov Chain Monte Carlo is almost always not more efficient than a Monte Carlo approach with independent samples, but rather much, much less efficient. With most MCMC algorithms, each sample is positively correlated with the previous sample. The impact of this correlation can be quite extreme: it's not too uncommon to see every one thousand samples being equal to one new sample (i.e. takes one thousand samples to forget the previous state in the MCMC algorithm). In these scenarios, if we you were content with the inference learned from 100 independent samples, you would need 100,000 samples from an MCMC algorithm with the heavy correlation mentioned above. MCMC is generally used when you cannot take independent draws from the target distribution.
