It's hard to tell without having any monitoring metrics from your VM, but it's not impossible that a gc run can cause connections to be refused, at least indirectly. What may happen, is that the gc run causes each request's process time to be increased or the requests to be temporarily interrupted, hence increasing the number of simultaneously required connections if the clients' request pattern stays the same. For example, if you have 10 requests/second and each request takes 1 second to process, your server will at least on average cope with support for 10 concurrent connections. If the client(s) keep placing 10 requests/second to your server, but for some reason each request takes 2 seconds to process instead of 1, the server will have to support 20 concurrent connections or start refusing connection attempts if only a smaller number is allowed.
