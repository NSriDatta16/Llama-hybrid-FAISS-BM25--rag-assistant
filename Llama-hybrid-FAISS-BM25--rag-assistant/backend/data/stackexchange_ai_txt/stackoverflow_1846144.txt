Pattern name for create in constructor, delete in destructor (C++)

Traditionally, in C++, you would create any dependencies in the constructor and delete them in the destructor. class A { public: A() { m_b = new B(); } ~A() { delete m_b; } private: B* m_b; }; This technique/pattern of resource acquisition, does it have a common name? I'm quite sure I've read it somewhere but can't find it now. Edit: As many has pointed out, this class is incomplete and should really implement a copy constructor and assignment operator. Originally, I intentionally left it out since it wasn't relevant to the actual question: the name of the pattern. However, for completeness and to encourage good practices, the accepted answer is what it is.
