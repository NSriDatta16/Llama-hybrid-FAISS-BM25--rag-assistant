Java Translucent Selection Box

For custom rendering, I've created a class that extends JPanel and overrides the paintComponent method. In the custom paintComponent I rendering multiple shape objects held in a array. What I would like to add is the ability to drag and select 1 or more of the shapes. While dragging I would like to show a translucent rectangle defining the selection region akin to what is seen in Windows Explorer. Can any provide a starting point for accomplishing this? Thanks.
