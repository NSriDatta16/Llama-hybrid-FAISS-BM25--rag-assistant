Time series are tricky to handle, because there are different parameters to estimate: initial values for AR and MA terms on the one hand and the actual AR and MA parameters on the other hand. Often software takes a hybrid approach. For instance, the help page to arima() in R tells you: " The default (unless there are missing values) is to use conditional-sum-of-squares to find starting values, then maximum likelihood." Which of course is something different than full ML. I don't know FitARMA() , but its help page refers to an article with the title "Faster ARMA maximum likelihood estimation", which also sounds like something that may give different results than other implementations. And even if you do use full ML, the likelihood is not necessarily well-behaved, and the estimation may end up with different maxima for different starting values. Bottom line: different software may give different results for time series, and this will probably never change. Sad but true.
