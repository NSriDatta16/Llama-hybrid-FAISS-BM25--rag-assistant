Once you've set up your RESTful routes, you should be able to use Webrat to visit the different routes. You can then test that each route returns XML which meets your expectations. Here's a blog post that describes how to test XML output in RSpec: Testing XML output Webrat is a headless browser, which simply means that you can simulate a browser without having to open a real browser like FireFox on your development machine. This means that you can simply type something like "visit 'users/'" into your defined steps and simulate a user accessing your application. Finally the Pragmatic book on RSpec (still in beta), is a great resource on how to use Cucumber, Webrat and RSpec together and drive your application development with BDD.
