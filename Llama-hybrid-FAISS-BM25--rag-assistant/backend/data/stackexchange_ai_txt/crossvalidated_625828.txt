It is the signed difference and that does not make it the same as the unpaired test. Taking the absolute values is rarely going to be sensible (I can think of some cases, but not many). You are testing whether the difference is 0. You are interested in whether one is less than the other, on average, so you should not take the absolute value. As a toy example consider paired data (say, on the right and left side of the body): R: 10 20 20 10 L: 20 10 10 20 Clearly, R and L have the same mean. The usual paired t-test will show this, with t = 0 and p = 1.00. If you take abs. value, then you will get that the difference is 10. But it's not the same as the unpaired test, because the denominators are different and that makes the paired test more powerful. Also, using the unpaired test when the data are paired violates the assumption of independence.
