best way to externalize HTML in GWT apps?

What's the best way to externalize large quantities of HTML in a GWT app? We have a rather complicated GWT app of about 30 "pages"; each page has a sort of guide at the bottom that is several paragraphs of HTML markup. I'd like to externalize the HTML so that it can remain as "unescaped" as possible. I know and understand how to use property files in GWT; that's certainly better than embedding the content in Java classes, but still kind of ugly for HTML (you need to backslashify everything, as well as escape quotes, etc.) Normally this is the kind of thing you would put in a JSP , but I don't see any equivalent to that in GWT. I'm considering just writing a widget that will simply fetch the content from html files on the server and then add the text to an HTML widget. But it seems there ought to be a simpler way.
