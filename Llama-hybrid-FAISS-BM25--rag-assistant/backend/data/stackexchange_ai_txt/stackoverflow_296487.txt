Tar is not only a file format, but it is a tape format. Tapes store data bit-by-bit. Each storage implementation was custom. Tar was the method by which you could take data off a disk, and store it onto tape in a way that other people could retrieve it without your custom program. Later, the compression programs came, and *nix still only had one method of creating a single file that contained multiple files. I believe it's just inertia that has continued with the tar.gz trend. Pkzip started with both compression and archival in one fell swoop, but then DOS systems didn't typically have tape drives attached! From wikipedia for Tar_ (file_format) In computing, tar (derived from tape archive) is both a file format (in the form of a type of archive bitstream) and the name of the program used to handle such files. The format was standardized by POSIX.1-1988 and later POSIX.1-2001. Initially developed as a raw format, used for tape backup and other sequential access devices for backup purposes, it is now commonly used to collate collections of files into one larger file, for distribution or archiving, while preserving file system information such as user and group permissions, dates, and directory structures.
