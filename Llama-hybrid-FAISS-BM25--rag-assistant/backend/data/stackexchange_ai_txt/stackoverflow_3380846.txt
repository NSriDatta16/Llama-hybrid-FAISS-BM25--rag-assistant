How make Eclipse instrument classes at build time?

Sometimes I have to perform some custom bytecode transformation. I have used mainly asm and javaassit. Inside eclipse usually I run my code with the -javaagent jvm parameter. Outside eclipse I use maven, ant, or the command prompt to invoke the weavers before running the application code. But the point is that: I would like to perform instrumentation at build time inside eclipse. What is the best way to do it? Is there an already made plugin that I can connect to by implementing some api? May I script this with eclipse monkey? May I use an ant builder and invoke my weaver with it? Should I look at the AspectJ plugin (must be huge) and try to figure out how to make my own plugin? Should I look at the some other plugin to get inspiration? Thanks.
