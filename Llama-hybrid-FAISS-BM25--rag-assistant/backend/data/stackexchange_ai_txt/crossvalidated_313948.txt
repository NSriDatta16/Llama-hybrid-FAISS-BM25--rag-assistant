In general, it should not make a difference. For many methods (Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Regression) this is not a factor. For SVM, it may depend on the type of SVM and the method used to solve it - if the algorithm used is approximate, or not run to convergence, or involves randomness that may lead to somewhat different results.
