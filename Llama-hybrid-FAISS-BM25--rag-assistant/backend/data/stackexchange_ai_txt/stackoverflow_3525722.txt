Found out what it was via this post that it was the Shoutcast server... You should be able to connect to 8000 with your web browser and get the DNAS status page. If, on the other hand, you connect to that port with a media player, it'll return the direct MP3 stream. ( Unfortunately, in an incredibly boneheaded piece of design, the way SHOUTcast decides which to respond with is by sniffing your User-Agent header for something beginning with Mozilla , so if you're using an alternative browser or blocking your UA you'll not be able to get the status, and if the stream's down you might just get nothing.) Drove me crazy.. But it's an easy fix. I just added. .header("User-Agent", "UserAgent: Mozilla/5.0")
