tail dependence calculation

If I have the tail dependence value calculated using Joe (1997) in fact $R$ gives the result for any family copula. Using Caillault and Guegan method called "naive" what are the main differences? Why it will be better to use this method? And more importantly how can I calculate this in $R$? Many thanks
