Knowing the source of data would be very helpful, and also the information if the values of my.ts could get negative or not. However, taking a quick look on the plot, rather than seeing a constant linear trend , I rather suggest that the time series is not stationary, hence integrated . As an example, stock prices are also integrated, but stock returns not anymore (they fluctuate near 0). This hypothesis can also be tested using the Augmented Dickey Fuller Test: require(tseries) adf.test(my.ts) Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test Dickey-Fuller = -2.9557, Lag order = 2, p-value = 0.7727 alternative hypothesis: stationary Given the p-value is not lower 0.05, there is no evidence that the process is stationary. To get the data stationary, you have to difference it: diff.ts Now the data shows no trend anymore, and the only thing you will find is an autoregressive term of order 2 (using acf(diff.ts) ).
