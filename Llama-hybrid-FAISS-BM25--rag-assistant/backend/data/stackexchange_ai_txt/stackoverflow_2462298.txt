Oracle horizontal scability feature is called RAC (Real Application Clusters) . It allows a cluster of servers to act as a single database. It is a share-everything architecture: all servers have access to the full database that resides on shared disks. In other words, you wouldn't "fragment" a table accross multiple servers in Oracle. You can look into partitioning , which allows you to partition a table accross several tablespaces. Partitioning is an Entreprise Edition feature, RAC is an option of the Entreprise Edition.
