Loopy Belief Propagation code example

Does anybody know of a working code example of the sum-product algorithm for (loopy) belief for Bayesian Networks? I have scoured the earth for a couple days but haven't had much luck. I'm indifferent to which language it is in. All the documents I have found on the topic are full of arcane and absurdly ambiguous mathspeak. It doesn't seem like a difficult algorithm, but I can't be sure because some of the tricky bits are glossed over so much. Alternately, an example that uses real numbers (rather than variable names) would probably do the trick as well.
