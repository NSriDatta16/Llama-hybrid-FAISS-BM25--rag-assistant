Note: The accepted answer, while it does work for both older and newer versions of Python, is discouraged in newer versions of Python. Since str.format() is quite new, a lot of Python code still uses the % operator. However, because this old style of formatting will eventually be removed from the language, str.format() should generally be used. For this reason if you're using Python 2.6 or newer you should use str.format instead of the old % operator: >>> commands = { ... 'py': 'python {0}', ... 'md': 'markdown "{0}" > "{0}.html"; gnome-open "{0}.html"', ... } >>> commands['md'].format('file.md') 'markdown "file.md" > "file.md.html"; gnome-open "file.md.html"'
