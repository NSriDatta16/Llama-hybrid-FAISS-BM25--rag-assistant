It is because you use averages for each condition. R thinks each unique combination of month, site and code has N=1 so it has not clue about the variance or the N. So, you should go back to the values that you had before you averaged and give those to R. for example: ID MONTH SITE CODE X1 X2 1 OCT BPT C+ 5.526667 5.440000 2 OCT BPT C+ 1.526667 6.440000 3 OCT BPT C+ 2.526667 2.440000 4 NOV BPT C+ 6.526667 3.440000 5 NOV BPT C+ 4.526667 2.440000 6 NOV BPT C+ 0.526667 3.440000 ...etc. Looks like it will be a very long table :)
