You shouldn't be embedding your JS into your code like this. While I advise using a library like jQuery (which will make your life easier), I'll explain without it. Don't embed your JS into your code. If you really really need to, have it call a function like this: Then in your head section between script tags you'll run your javascript: function bulletClicked() { this.src='img/bulletwhite.png'; document.images['bullet2'].src='img/bullet.png'; document.images['bullet3'].src='img/bullet.png'; document.images['bullet4'].src='img/bullet.png'; } From what it looks like, you're going about this the wrong way, you're probably putting that onclikc code into every bullet image, slightly modified for each one. Instead, if you just used events you would simplify so much. If you did something like this... (and specified your height, width, and other CSS in a style section, where they belong, don't do what you did, ever again). Then your javascript could be... function bulletClicked(e) { document.images['bullet1'].src='img/bullet.png'; document.images['bullet2'].src='img/bullet.png'; document.images['bullet3'].src='img/bullet.png'; document.images['bullet4'].src='img/bullet.png'; e.src='img/bulletwhite.png'; } There are much better ways to deal with this sort of problem, and I would highly reccomend you pick up jQuery and do some work with separating your HTML, JavaScript and CSS components of your pages.
