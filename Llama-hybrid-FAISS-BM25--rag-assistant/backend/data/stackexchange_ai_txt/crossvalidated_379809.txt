You should encode as dummy variables ("one-hot"). I don't understand how you could use your binary encoding, you would have to explain. But you say In some ways, it's closer to an interval data type in that the difference between consecutive codes frequently (but by no means always) has some kind of meaning . This is interesting, but probably difficult to encode information. Maybe there is an Bayesian way. But this could still be exploited, and you say one goal (additional) could be to learn that some labels are close to other labels in effect. One method which could achieve that, is fused lasso , search this site or look at Principled way of collapsing categorical variables with many levels? or Continuous dependent variable with ordinal independent variable
