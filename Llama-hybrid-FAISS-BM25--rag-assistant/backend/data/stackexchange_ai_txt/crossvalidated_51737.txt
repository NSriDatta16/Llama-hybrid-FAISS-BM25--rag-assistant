Interpreting this regression coefficient

Quick background: I am working on a political science project that involves analyzing the impact of different variables on the extent to which a candidate mentions other users when he or she tweets. One of these variables is whether the candidate answers the Political Courage Test (PCT). If he/she does, the value is 1. If they don't, it's 0. Another variable is the amount of money that the candidate raises over the course of his/her campaign. Someone more experienced crunched the data for me via a regression, and sent me the following results: PCT Coefficient: 9.580 Standard error: 8.144 Amount of $$$ Raised Coefficient: 0.000 Standard error: 0.000 PCT*Amount of $$$ Raised Coefficient: 0.000 Standard error: 0.000 I have basically no background in statistics, so I am at a loss of how to interpret this outcome effectively. From what I can tell, neither the amount of money raised nor whether the candidate answered the CPT has much of an effect on the tweets, but I am confused about the third one (CPT*Money Raised), which I am told is an interaction. What exactly is that saying? Thank you in advance for your help.
