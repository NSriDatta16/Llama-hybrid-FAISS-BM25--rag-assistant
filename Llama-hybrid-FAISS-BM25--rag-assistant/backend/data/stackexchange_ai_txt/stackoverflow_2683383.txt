Quote from RFC 5077: “Note that the encoding of an empty SessionTicket extension was ambiguous in RFC 4507. An RFC 4507 implementation may have encoded it as: 00 23 Extension type 35 00 02 Length of extension contents 00 00 Length of ticket or it may have encoded it the same way as this update: 00 23 Extension type 35 00 00 Length of extension contents A server wishing to support RFC 4507 clients should respond to an empty SessionTicket extension encoded the same way as it received it. “ So the server I worked with supports RFC 4507 and not the newer 5077. Removing it 'normally' using SSL_CTX_set_options with SSL_OP_NO_TICKET solved the problem. Hope this will help someone... EDIT: Well, this can be done also with the configuration flag -no-tlsext. (When running the perl Configure script). But, pay attention that in OpenSSL 0.9.8n and OpenSSL 1.0.0, you will need to comment out some parts of the source code or it won't compile - as the secure renegotiation (which is considered to be unsafe by itself) requires it.
