Recommended machine learning algorithms for a 10-class image classification problem with only 1900 samples

I am trying to determine the right approach to take for an image classification problem which involves 10 classes and only 1900 samples. The images (1288 x 964 resolution) are of industrial parts whereby each class of part differs by its serial number as well as other features. I've considered using a CNN but am wondering if this may be infeasible due to insufficient quantity of data; or is this not the case? Otherwise from my research I've determined that the more traditional KNN or SVM may work better due to less data but am in need of some expert guidance. Thank you.
