What is the expectation of the exponential distribution multiplied by indicator function?

I am reading the research paper [A New Bayesian Lasso] , where $u$ has the distribution The expectation of $u_j$ is given by $$\frac{1}{\lambda}+|\beta_j|$$ . I know that the term $\frac{1}{\lambda}$ is the expectation of the exponential distribution but where did the term $|\beta_j|$ come from? I have tried to calculate $$\int _{|\beta_j|}^\infty u_j \lambda \exp(-\lambda u_j)du_j=\exp(-\lambda |\beta_j| )\left(\frac{1}{\lambda}+|\beta_j|\right)$$ which gives $\frac{1}{\lambda}+|\beta_j|$ multiplied by $\exp(-\lambda |\beta_j| )$ .
