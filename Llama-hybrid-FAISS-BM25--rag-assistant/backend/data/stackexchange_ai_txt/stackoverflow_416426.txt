This sounds like color quantization, where you reduce the number of colors in an image. One way would be to plot the colors in space, and combine clusters into the center (or a weighted average) of a cluster. The exact name of the algorithm that triggered this memory fails me, but I'll edit the answer if it pops up, but in the meantime, you should look at color quantization and see if some of the algorithms are useful.
