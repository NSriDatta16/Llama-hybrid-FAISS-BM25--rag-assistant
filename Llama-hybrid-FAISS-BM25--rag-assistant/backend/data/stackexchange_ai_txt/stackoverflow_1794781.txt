Get 3D Math Primer for Graphics and Game Development . It's not a free online tutorial, but I seriously doubt you could find any online tutorial that covers 3D math in such detail while still being very accessible and beginner-friendly. It's got the best coverage of quaternions that I've come across, and it also introduces all the mathematical formulas with a geometric interpretation so that you know how they relate to computer graphics. Other than that, here's a good basic Vector Math Tutorial . For Quaternions there's the Wikipedia article and some other resources you could find with google, but they all seem too brief or tied to a certain technology. Again, just buy that book (or alternatively this one which covers more topics but spends less time on the basics).
