I'm gonna need some help here, but here's one approach to an answer. The parameter you want is not necessarily identifiable from your dataset. Consider the following dataset, where out is the outcome, trt is the encouragement, use is the actual intervention, num says how many people fell into that pattern of encouragement/intervention, and comp is how we might categorize the patients in that group using the compliance classes outlined in this review. id out use trt comp 1 1 0 0 never_taker OR complier 2 1 1 1 complier 3 0 0 0 complier 4 1 1 0 always_taker You'll observe the same data no matter whether participant 1 is a never-taker or a complier. But, participant 1's status affects the parameter you seek. If they are a complier, that pushes the untreated complier outcome probability from 0 to 1/2.
