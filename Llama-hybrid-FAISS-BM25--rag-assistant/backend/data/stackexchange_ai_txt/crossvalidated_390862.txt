Get a plausible distribution from quartiles and mean

I have the 3 quartiles and the mean of the incomes of a population, I would like to get from those a "regular" distribution, there might be several theoretical solutions but I just need a plausible output, it's not academic work, I need to be pragmatic. I saw this question : Build a (normal?) distribution from n, quartiles and mean? but the answers are focused on normal distributions, mine are not normal at all. An example might make it clearer: Q1 = 17965 Q2 = 27401 Q3 = 44607 avg = 36773 At what percentile would sit an income of 50000 ? what is the 90th percentile ? I'm working with R , in case you know a function that could help or would be kind enough to point me to how to build one.
