How to: Cross-Site posting and redirection in ASP.NET webforms

Scenario: The task I have at hand is to enable a single-signon solution between different organizations/websites. I start as an authenticated user on one organization's website, convert specific information into an Xml document, encrypt the document with triple des, and send that over as a post variable to the second organizations login page. Question: Once I have my xml data packaged, how do I programmatically perform a post to the second website and have the user's browser redirected to the second website as well. This should behave just like having a form like: action="http://www.www.com/posthere" method="post" ... and having a hidden text field like: input type="hidden" value="my encrypted xml" This is being written in asp.net 2.0 webforms. -- Edit: Nic asks why the html form I describe above will not work. Answer: I have no control over either site; I am building the "middle man" that makes all of this happen. Site 1 is forwarding a user to the page that I am making, I have to build the XML, and then forward it to site 2. Site 1 does not want the user to know about my site, the redirect should be transparent. The process I have described above is what both parties (site A and site B) mandate.
