How can I unit test a GUI?

The calculations in my code are well-tested, but because there is so much GUI code, my overall code coverage is lower than I'd like. Are there any guidelines on unit-testing GUI code? Does it even make sense? For example, there are graphs in my app. I haven't been able to figure out how to automate the testing of the graphs. It takes a human eye, AFAIK, to check if the graph is correct. (I'm using Java Swing)
