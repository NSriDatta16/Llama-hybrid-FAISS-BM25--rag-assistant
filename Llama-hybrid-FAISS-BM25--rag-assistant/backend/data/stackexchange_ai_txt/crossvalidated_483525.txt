Confusion with the concept of autocorrelation

I'm learning time series analysis and I have a confusion about the concept of auto-correlation. Is the auto-correlation calculated for the time series or the so-called residuals ? I don't know what they mean by residuals here. To me, residuals mean the different between predicted values and ground-truth values. The same confusion arises when I learn the concept of Ljung-Box test. For example, in here , they define the test with residuals, but on wikipedia , they define it on the time series values.
