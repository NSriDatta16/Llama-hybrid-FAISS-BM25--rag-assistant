WCF Unicode UrlEncoded Get not coming over nicely

I have a RESTful WCF service which accepts GET verbs with Unicode encoded urls. The Unicode characters are translated as little boxes strangely when I get the data on the server. Is there something I have to tell the service contract to do in order to get Unicode UrlEncoded Gets to translate into nice strings? Here's my contract: [OperationContract] [WebGet(BodyStyle = WebMessageBodyStyle.Wrapped, UriTemplate = "/Document/{Fragment}", RequestFormat = WebMessageFormat.Xml)] Message GetDocumentFromSearchResult(string Fragment); Here's a sample of the unicode I pass in: %FF%FE%22%00O%FF%FE%20%00King%FF%FE%20%00of%FF I get "King" and "of" ok, but the rest are little of the string are little squares. Gotta be an decoding issue ??
