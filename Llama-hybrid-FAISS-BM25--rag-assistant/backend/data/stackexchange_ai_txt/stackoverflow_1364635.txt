In programming, the following statement is the sign designating the road to Hell: I've been working on a piece of code recently where performance is very important Write your code in the cleanest, most easy to understand way. Period. Once that is done, you can measure its runtime. If it takes too long, measure the bottlenecks, and speed up the biggest ones. Keep doing that until it is fast enough. The list of projects that failed or suffered catastrophic loss due to a misguided emphasis on blind optimization is large and tragic. Don't join them.
