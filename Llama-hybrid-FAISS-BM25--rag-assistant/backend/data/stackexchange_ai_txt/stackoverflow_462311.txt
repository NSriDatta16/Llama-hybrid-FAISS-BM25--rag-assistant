Scripting language for embedding into C#/.NET applications?

[The only similar question I can find was answered long ago and contains a reference to mostly IronPython. I want to consider other options as well] We have a complex data analysis application written in C#. The application should provide users with a sophisticated means of customizing their data analysis tasks. Currently, we use a mixture of configuration files and Excel tables to specify this, but it gets unwieldy, so we're looking for a scripting language to embed. What's the best simple scripting language for C#/.NET embedding? Is it possible to somehow embed VBA similarly to Excel/Word? Or is perhaps JavaScript/Lua are used? Needless to say, it should be easy to expose some API and objects from the main application into the embedded scripts.
