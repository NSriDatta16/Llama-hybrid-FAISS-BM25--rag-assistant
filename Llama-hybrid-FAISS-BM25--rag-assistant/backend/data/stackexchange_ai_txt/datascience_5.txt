How can I do simple machine learning without hard-coding behavior?

I've always been interested in machine learning, but I can't figure out one thing about starting out with a simple "Hello World" example - how can I avoid hard-coding behavior? For example, if I wanted to "teach" a bot how to avoid randomly placed obstacles, I couldn't just use relative motion, because the obstacles move around, but I don't want to hard code, say, distance, because that ruins the whole point of machine learning. Obviously, randomly generating code would be impractical, so how could I do this?
