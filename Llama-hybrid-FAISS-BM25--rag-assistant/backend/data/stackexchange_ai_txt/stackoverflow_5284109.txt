Is it OK to recreate activity in onRestart()

I have a complex TabActivity that contains ListViews and TextViews. Instead of messing up with manual UI update I decided to "recreate" activity (force full redraw) whenever it comes to foreground. Assume that i navigate from activity A to B. When hit back on B, activity A must be recreated. Here is the code: @Override public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) { super.onCreate(savedInstanceState); setContentView(R.layout.activity_search); setupTabs(); } @Override protected void onNewIntent(Intent intent) { startActivity(intent); finish(); } @Override protected void onRestart() { super.onRestart(); onNewIntent(getIntent()); } It works, but i wonder if i am doing something wrong, maybe there is a more elegant solution. Could you please suggest best practice for this scenario?
