two different interpretation of regression coefficient of continuous variable in presence of a categorical covariate

I have the following model: logistic regression: outcome ~ b1*age + b2*smoker + b3*age:smoker smoker has two levels: non-smoker, smoker age is a continuous variable likelihood ratio test shows the interaction term is insignificant How should I interpret b1? interpret b1: The effect of one unit change in age on outcome (log adds), controlling for effect of smoking status (keep smoking status constant). another way to interpret b1: The effect of one unit change in age on outcome for non-smoker (non-smoker is the base level, in this case, smoker==0) I'm a little confused. There interpretation does not seems to be the same... Can anyone clarify me on this? Thanks a lot.
