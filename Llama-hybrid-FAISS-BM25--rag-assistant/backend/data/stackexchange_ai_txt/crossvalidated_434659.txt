feature importance for SVM with a nonlinear kernel

Using sklearn, I did SVR using rbf kernel. Though I got good results, problem is I don't know how to get the important feature that the algorithm used. Also coef_ only works for linear kernel, since for non linear kernel data space is not finite. Is there any way to get features importance?
