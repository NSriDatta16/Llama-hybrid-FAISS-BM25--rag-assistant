The User-Agent is useful for determining the browser being used, which may lead to guessing some of its capabilities. For example, most mobile devices can be accurately identified by their browser's user agent (see WURFL ), thus allowing a site's developer to direct mobile devices to the site's mobile version. However, it can be modified by the user, so its value should be taken with a grain of salt as is the case with any user input. session_regenerate_id() doesn't delete the session. It merely changes its id to a newly created one. To avoid having its old session file hang around until auto deletion by the system, you can delete it yourself by setting the optional function parameter to true . Its use is to avoid session fixation attacks where an attacker can gain access to an existing session's data by knowing and presenting its id to the server.
