Is there any libc project that does not requires linux kernel

I am using a custom user space environment that has barely no OS support: only one char device, mass storage interface and a single network socket. To provide C programming to this platform, I need a libc. Is there any libc project that is configurable enough so that I can map low-level IO to the small API I have access to ? AFAIK glibc and uclibc are expecting linux syscalls, so I can't use them (without trying to emulate linux syscalls, which is something I prefer to avoid).
