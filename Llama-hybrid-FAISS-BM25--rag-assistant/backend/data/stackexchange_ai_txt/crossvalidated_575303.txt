The proportional hazards (PH) issue is pretty much a function of your understanding of the underlying subject matter. It's unlikely that the PH assumption ever holds strictly in real-world data, but small-scale data sets don't provide power to detect the violations. So ask: for flood_risk_simple , is the difference between the minimum coefficient estimate of -0.2 and the maximum of about -0.17, and the apparent trend at later times, large enough to matter in practice? Is the variation of the coefficient for matt_ncdem around its estimate of 0.166 large enough to matter? Only you and your colleagues in the field can answer those questions. Consider those questions in the context of what your model provides when the PH assumption is violated : "a failure-time weighted average hazard ratio over the duration of follow-up." Is that good enough for your purposes? With resid = TRUE in your plot, the scaled Schoenfeld residuals are displayed for each event time. With 2 binary predictors you would get the banded pattern that you see. Their values are extremely high, making the underlying trends impossible to see, as those residuals are inversely scaled with respect to the coefficient covariance matrix and you have very small errors in the coefficient estimates. With large data sets it might make sense to take an approach like that of almost sure hypothesis testing , which tries to account for large sample sizes. That's not standard practice yet, however.
