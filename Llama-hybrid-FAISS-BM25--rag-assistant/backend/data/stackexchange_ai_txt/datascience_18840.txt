Is there a relationship between LDA, linear SVMs and Perceptron?

LDA (linear discriminant analysis), SVMs with a linear kernel, and perceptrons are linear classifiers. Is there any other relationship between them, e.g.: Every decision boundary that can be found by LDA can be found by linear SVM Every decision boundary that can be found by linear SVM can be found by LDA. Every decision boundary that can be found by LDA can be found by a perceptron Every decision boundary that can be found by linear SVM can be found by a perceptron. Every decision boundary that can be found by a perceptron can be found by LDA Every decision boundary that can be found by a perceptron can be found by an SVM with a linear kernel Always on the same data, of course. For example, I think the linear SVM can find more decision boundaries than a perceptron due to slack variables. While the perceptron finds just an arbitrary hyperplane which separates the data linearly (if such a hyperplane exists), the linear SVM will always find the same hyperplane due to the optimality criterium.
