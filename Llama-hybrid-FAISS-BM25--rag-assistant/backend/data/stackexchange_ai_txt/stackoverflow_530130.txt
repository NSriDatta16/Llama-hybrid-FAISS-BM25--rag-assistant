Is it possible to display a message in an empty datagrid

I have a datagrid which is populated with CSV data when the user drag/drops a file onto it. Is it possible to display a message in the blank grid for example "Please drag a file here" or "This grid is currently empty". The grid currently displays as a dark grey box as I wait until the file is dragged to setup the columns etc.
