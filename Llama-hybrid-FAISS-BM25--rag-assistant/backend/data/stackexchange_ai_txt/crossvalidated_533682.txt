How to compare coefficients of two logistic regression models using R?

I am trying to model the effect of an event on the odds ratio using logistic regression. So I have 4 months before and 4 months after the event. The data is pooled cross sectional, so I have one observation for each individual but across different times of collection. However, there is no controlled sample, all the sample in the latter 4 months is affected by the event. So I can NOT create a 2x2 matrix where there is controlled versus treated and before versus after the event. I only have 1x2 dimension: before and after the event. I am trying to compare the coefficients of two logistic regression model, model 1 includes data before the event and model 2 includes data after the event. I used moderation (interaction) so far but my boss thinks it is not the right way. In this, I put all the data in 1 model and I included an interaction between all the predictors and the event. However, he thinks that this model is daunting because it includes a lot of independent variables (the predictors, a dummy variable for the event, an interaction between each of the predictors and the dummy event and finally the controls). My objective: To measure the effect of the event on the influence of the predictors (which are binary, categorical and numerical variables) on the binary outcome variable. I need to find a statistic similar to the t-test: the t-test compares mean values but I need to compare the beta (the regression coefficients) in this case. Is there any statistic parallel to the t-test that compares the coefficients of 2 regression models? (I am using logistic regression using R) Thank you
