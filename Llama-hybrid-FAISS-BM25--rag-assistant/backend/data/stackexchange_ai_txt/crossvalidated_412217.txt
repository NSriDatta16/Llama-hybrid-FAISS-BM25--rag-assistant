Subtraction between features before performing PCA and training a classification model

In my dataset, I've created moving averages for historical indicators. Is it pertinent to perform subtraction between those moving averages before PCA? My stats/calculus feeling : as PCA is a linear transformation, it is useless. My business feeling : the difference between those moving averages could be helpful for a model (showing a change of trend). My experience : I tried it, and I saw a little increase in the number of the components with a given kept variance threshold in the PCA model, but no improvement for the final classification model. Also, what about date subtraction to get the delay between two events? Should I only represent the date, for example as the number of seconds from a given date?
