What algorithms should I choose for a recommender system and why?

To my knowledge, recommender systems are broadly classified into collaborative and content. Collaborative in turn is divided into 1) Memory (uses similarity metrics) and 2) Model (well known Matrix/Tensor factorization). Content based involves constructing a user profile and then an algorithm like SVM to classify and recommend items. Now here are my questions: What other algorithms can I use for recommendation and why? Can I use neural networks? (understanding them has been a bit difficult for me) Is it true that neural networks (NN) are only suited for text and image processing and numerical data doesn't need complex algorithms like NN?
