Cost much memory when creating several vertex and index buffer

I met a very weird issue. When I create some very simple VertexBuffer and IndexBuffer in D3D, the memory consumption reported from TaskManager is huge. I created 60000 index buffer via D3D CreateIndexBuffer method. Each index buffer contains 6 index (int) which represents two triangles. So, one index buffer will occupy 24 bytes. And total memory consumption would be 24*60000 = 1,440,000. But task manager shows application 300MB memory increase! I don't know how did D3D9 do the memory allocation internally, but this issues happens also in D3D10. Is this due to memory fragmentation? This is under x86|bebug version, and d3d is release version, windows 7.
