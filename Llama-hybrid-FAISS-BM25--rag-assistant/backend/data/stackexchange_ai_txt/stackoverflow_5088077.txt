Is it worth to use Cobertura in web project?

I have never used Cobertura or similar tools before, only JUnit (and I've checked what are mocking tools) and in recent days Selenium. I am writing web application with full of JSP, JavaScript (jQuery) and HTML. Can Cubertura helps me in these areas or this tools covered only plain Java classes?
