How can I render different paragraph styles in Core Text?

I'm having a difficult time trying to work out how to build a page using Core Text, where I have multiple paragraphs which follow one another, but in different styles. In other words, I would like to have a title paragraph, followed by a subtitle paragraph, followed by several body paragraphs. In HTML terms, this would be: Some title Some subtitle Blah blah... ... I have got as far as creating a CTFramesetter for the title, creating a CTFrame from that, and then drawing it to the context. However I don't understand how to create a new frame which flows on from the previous paragraph. Can anyone help please? Or is there some good online tutorial to help? Thanks! :-Joe
