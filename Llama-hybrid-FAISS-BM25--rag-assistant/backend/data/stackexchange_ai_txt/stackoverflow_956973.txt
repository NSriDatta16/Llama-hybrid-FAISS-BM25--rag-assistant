F# is essentially the C++ of functional programming languages. They kept almost everything from Objective Caml, including the really stupid parts, and threw it on top of the .NET runtime in such a way that it brings in all the bad things from .NET as well. For example, with Objective Caml you get one type of null, the option . With F# you get three types of null, option , Nullable , and reference nulls. This means if you have an option you need to first check to see if it is "None", then you need to check if it is "Some(null)". F# is like the old Java clone J#, just a bastardized language just to attract attention. Some people will love it, a few of those will even use it, but in the end it is still a 20-year-old language tacked onto the CLR.
