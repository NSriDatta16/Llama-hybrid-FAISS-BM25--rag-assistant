Random Notifications Android

I am creating an widget application and would like to send random "words of encouragement" to the user. Something like positive affirmations would appear in the notification area, but not due to a user action, but rather a random action internal. I would grab a "words of encouragement" randomly from a database full of quotes. Not sure how clear this is, but if it is to someone and they can point me in the right direction...greatly appreciated.
