Oracle doesn't come with an equivalent of the SQL Server roles. This is because it encourages adherence to the principle of Least Privilege . However, it is perfectly possible to come up with our own. create role db_datareader / grant select any table to db_datareader / Similarly we can knock up an equivalent db_datawriter by granting the various DML ANY privileges to the role. As a rule I would advise against this. In most cases only a DBA needs to have the ANY level of privilege, and there is already a DBA role for them.
