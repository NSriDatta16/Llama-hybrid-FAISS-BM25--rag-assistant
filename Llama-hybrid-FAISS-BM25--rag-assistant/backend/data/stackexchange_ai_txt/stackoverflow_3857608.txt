jQuery not even being called

I don't know what's going on here..I'm trying to add a slidetoggle on my menu .. seems very simple .. I've tried to simplify this to try and find the problem (meaning I've taken all the links out and extra jquery, to only have that bottom example - the paragraph at the end) but I don't know what the error is.. (other that it doesn't do anything) Includes: The script: $("button").click(function() { $("p").slideToggle("slow"); }); The HTML: Account Welcome, User Options ( x => x.List(), "All Events" )%> ( x => x.List(), "My Events" )%> ( x => x.Edit(), "My Profile" )%> ( x => x.List(), "All Clubs" )%> ( x => x.List(), "My Clubs" )%> ( x => x.ChangePassword(), "Change My Password" )%> ( x => x.List(), "My Dependants" ) %> Organizer Details ( x => x.Organizer(), "Organizer Details" )%> ( x => x.Edit( default(int?) ), "Post An Event" )%> ( x => x.List(), "Events Created By Me" ) %> ( x => x.Edit( default( int? ) ), "Create A Club" )%> ( x => x.List( ), "Clubs Created By Me" )%> ( x => x.List(), "Event Report" ) %> Timer Details ( x => x.Timer(), "Timer Details" )%> ( x => x.List(), "Events Timed By Me" ) %> Additional Options ( x => x.Timer(), "I Time Events" )%> ( x => x.Organizer(), "I Organize Events" )%> ( x => x.Logout(), "Log Out" ) %> Hide 'em Hiya Such interesting text, eh?
