I don't know about Ganymed. But I have used JSch extensively for remote login and script executions. I used Google Expect4j with JSch for executing scripts on remote machines in expect mode(send/wait). You can get the whole output of executed command or scripts in your code using JSch/Expect4j/Closures. Thanks.
