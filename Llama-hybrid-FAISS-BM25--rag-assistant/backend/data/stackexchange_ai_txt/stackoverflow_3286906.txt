What is the real benefit to make pixel perfect cross browser compatible site for anyone?

IF a site is Valid and Accessible and usable but it's some things are showing slightly different on different browsers and almost matching with design? What is the real benefit to make Pixel perfect cross browser compatible site? While nobody will surf same site on multiple browsers and OS. Why anyone think(client or boss) that pixel perfect look is necessary? It this term coined or hyped by developers to show skills and make more money? What is business and personal benefit to give time to make site look same in all browsers? Why anybody will surf same site on multiple browsers and OS? Is pixel perfection madness? Why Clients give more attention to pixel perfect compatibility than Accessibility and usability of a site?
