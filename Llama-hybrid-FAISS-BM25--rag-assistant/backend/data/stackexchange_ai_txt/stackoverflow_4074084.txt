I assume the scripts are doing manipulation upon the DOM elements you're adding through AJAX. jQuery has an isReady property that it sets once the ready event has been triggered on the page. Any subsequent calls to jQuery.ready(...) will first check this isReady flag. If the flag is set to true, it will call the handler immediately. You can see why this would cause problems in your code. One option would be to load the response into a jQuery fragment and parse out all of the tags for execution later. var ajaxResponse = $(html); var scripts = ajaxResponse.find('script'); // Move your scripts into a new element var tempScripts = $().append(scripts); // Append your content, followed by your script tags $(document).append(ajaxResponse); $(document).append(tempScripts);
