This reminds me of a concept of value-at-risk (VaR) in financial risk management. If we applied it here, then the cutoff would be VaR and the average of all who made cutoff would be conditional VaR (CVaR) and an expected shortfall. Here's the formulae: $$\alpha=CDF(VaR)$$ first you solve for VaR value to match the quantile, or significance. Second, you get the conditional on making the cut, what is the average income: $$CVaR=\frac 1 {1-\alpha}\int_{VaR}^\infty xPDF(x)dx$$ You can compare this to the expected value $E[x]$, which would be a mean of returns of entire population
