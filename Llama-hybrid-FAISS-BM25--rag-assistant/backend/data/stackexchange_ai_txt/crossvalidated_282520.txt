If you model probabilities using OLS, you could get probabilities 1. I'd recommend you use a standard link function and a logistic regression. Of course you can transform your predictors before feeding them into the model. I'd recommend splines rather than polynomials. Be careful about overfitting - the standard caveats apply to logistic regression just as much as to OLS. Best to use cross-validation. For variable transformations and similar topics, take a look at Frank Harrell's Regression Modeling Strategies . Very much recommended.
