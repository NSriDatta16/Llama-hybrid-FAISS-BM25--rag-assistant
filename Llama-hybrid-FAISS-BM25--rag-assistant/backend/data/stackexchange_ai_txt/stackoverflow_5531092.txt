Humberto, This is a very common problem in using SQL Express and the root cause is AUTO_CLOSE database option is turned on by default for SQL Express. When all the users of the database close, the database is closed and shutdown cleanly. When users login next time, the permissions of the users for that database can't be verified quickly if the database is re-opening. AUTO_CLOSE has other side effects also that it flushes the procedure cache and it could lead to higher cpu costs in general. The be low command is your friend. ALTER DATABASE DBNAME SET AUTO_CLOSE OFF http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb522682.aspx
