I am trying to find if there is a turtle on patch-ahead n whose speed - acceleration is if any? turtles on patch-ahead n with [speed but this gives an error that: patch-ahead expects a number, instead got agent set. How do I remedy this? n is a number variable. I want to access the turtle's 'speed', which is a user defined turtle-own variable, at the n th patch from the calling turtle. The command ' with ' doesn't work here. Please suggest an alternative to access the speed of the turtle at, say, the 3rd patch from the calling turtle.
