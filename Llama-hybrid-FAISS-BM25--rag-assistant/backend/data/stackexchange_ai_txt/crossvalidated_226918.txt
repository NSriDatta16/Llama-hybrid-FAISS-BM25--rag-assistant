problem in categorical data: impossible cells in contingency table

I have a dataset of categorical variables. Consider the following predictors: Age (18-23,23-28, 28-35, 35+) Education(high-school,two-year degree, bachelor,master,phd) Experience(0-3,3-5,5-7,7+) I want to predict salary (0-1.5,1.5-3,3-4.5,4.5+) Before using chi-squre test or log-linear model or logistic regression, I created a contingency table to make sure my cells have at least 5 (or 10) values. Here a problem comes in: there are empty cells that cannot be filled logically. For example, phds cannot fall into 18-23 or 23-28 ranges. As another example, 18-23 year olds are very unlikely to have 4.5+ years of experience. The Common practice is combining categories so that each cell in the contingency table has more than 5 (or 10) values. If I do that, I lose the details in my data. What should I do?
