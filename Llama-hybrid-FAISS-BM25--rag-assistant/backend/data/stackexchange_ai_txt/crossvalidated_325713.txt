Some notes: OLS is a fitting algorithm, just like ML. A regression model is somewhat hard to define, see this thread . A time series is a type of data. Now you can take a type of data, use a model for it and estimate the model with an estimation algorithm. Consider an autoregression; it is a regression model for times series data, and OLS is used to estimate it. This is quite close to what you are describing. How does stationarity fit in? It is relevant for the model and for its estimation. A model must account for possible nonstationarity as otherwise it might fail to adequately reflect the data generating process. Moreover, estimation algorithms often do not deliver quality results under nonstationarity, e.g. the estimates of the model parameters become inconsistent. But this is not always the case. If $y_t$ is nonstationary because it is integrated of order one, i.e. I(1), you can still run a regression of $y_t$ on $y_{tâˆ’1}$ and get a consistent estimate of the slope coefficient with OLS. This is again something that you have observed.
