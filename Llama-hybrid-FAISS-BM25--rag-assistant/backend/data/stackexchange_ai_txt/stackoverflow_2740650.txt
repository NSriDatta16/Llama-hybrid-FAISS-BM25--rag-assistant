Using Google Visualization in GWT 2.0

I'm working on learning GWT (total newb) and have a question regarding the Visualiztion API provided by Google. This page: http://code.google.com/p/gwt-google-apis/wiki/VisualizationGettingStarted Describes getting started with a pie chart (which is what I need). However I'm trying to do this in a composite UI using UiBinder. To that end I don't know how to handle the callback correctly that is shown: public class SimpleViz implements EntryPoint { public void onModuleLoad() { // Create a callback to be called when the visualization API // has been loaded. Runnable onLoadCallback = new Runnable() { public void run() { Panel panel = RootPanel.get(); // Create a pie chart visualization. PieChart pie = new PieChart(createTable(), createOptions()); pie.addSelectHandler(createSelectHandler(pie)); panel.add(pie); } }; // Load the visualization api, passing the onLoadCallback to be called // when loading is done. VisualizationUtils.loadVisualizationApi(onLoadCallback, PieChart.PACKAGE); } My First assumption is this would go in the UiBinder constructor, correct? Yet this assumes that I want to place the element in the RootLayoutPanel, and I don't. I can't see an elegant and obvious way of placing it in the binder. I submit that even this guess may be wrong. Any ideas from the experts? EDIT: I should make clear my attempt: public GraphPanel() { initWidget(uiBinder.createAndBindUi(this)); Runnable onLoadCallback = new Runnable() { public void run() { //LayoutPanel panel = RootPanel. // Create a pie chart visualization. PieChart pie = new PieChart(createPieTable(), createPieOptions()); pie.addSelectHandler(createSelectHandler(pie)); mySelf.getElement().appendChild(pie.getElement()); // .add(pie); } }; // Load the visualization api, passing the onLoadCallback to be called // when loading is done. VisualizationUtils.loadVisualizationApi(onLoadCallback, PieChart.PACKAGE); } When run I get the following in the Composites DIV: But I see no graph using the code from the above page. EDIT 2: This link may provide additional information. However, the solution suggested is not optimal since the app then needs to know more about the widget (and if the widget is even there). http://vaadin.com/forum/-/message_boards/message/97850 EDIT 3: It shouldn't matter, but just in case, I'm running FF on Linux. Some articles I've read have implied that this is a problem. EDIT 4: Adding: pie.draw(createPieTable(), createPieOptions()); after the append child gets the graph to display. This implies that the ordering of the example is wrong. If so what is the optimum?
