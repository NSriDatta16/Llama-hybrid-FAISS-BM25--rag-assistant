System.Net.Mail.Attachment implements IDisposable , so I would call Dispose() on it (use a using() ) UPDATE : Opening MailMessage.Dispose() up in Reflector DOES call Dispose on any attachments. Also, calling GC.Collect() can actually lead to fragmentation of the large object heap. Let the framework take care of garbage collection. Have you tried downloading MemProfiler ? (They have a trial version. It usually pays for itself within a few minutes of use!)
