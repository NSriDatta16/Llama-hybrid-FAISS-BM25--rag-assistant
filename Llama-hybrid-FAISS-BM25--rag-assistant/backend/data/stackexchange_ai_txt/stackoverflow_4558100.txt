Font embedding can be a bit complicated due to browser compatibility issues. For example, Safari only supports SVG fonts. IE only supports .eot, which must first be converted from .ttf I have found the easiest way to use custom fonts is with Google Fonts Besides having the free google font directory to choose from, there are a few providers that provide a much wider selection of fonts for free and to purchase.
