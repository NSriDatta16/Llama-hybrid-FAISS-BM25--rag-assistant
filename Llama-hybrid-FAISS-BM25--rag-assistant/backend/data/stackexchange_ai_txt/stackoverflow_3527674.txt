You should be able to just add the Page_ClientValidate method inline. I have never tried this so it might not work: return string.Format("if (Page_ClientValidate()) { this.disabled=true; {0} } else return false;", Page.ClientScript.GetPostBackEventReference(this, string.Empty)); You might have to mess with it or add some checks to support GroupValidation but I think this will get you on the right path. EDIT: I have updated the answer and moved you disable into the if so it only gets disabled when Page_ClientValidate fails. Check out this link as it is doing what you are looking for I think and illustrates what I was meaning with the Page_ClientValidate : http://msmvps.com/blogs/anguslogan/archive/2004/12/22/27223.aspx
