How does ASP.NET MVC Generate JsonResults?

I want to inject some Json into the Html page returned by the server? Is there a public function that returns the Json string when Json(someObject) gets called? Note that I don't want to return Json to the browser in a seperate request. I want to convert an object graph to json and inject it into a script block. Thanks Looking at the MVC source code, I found this: using System.Web.Script.Serialization; ... // The JavaScriptSerializer type was marked as obsolete prior to .NET Framework 3.5 SP1 #pragma warning disable 0618 JavaScriptSerializer serializer = new JavaScriptSerializer(); response.Write(serializer.Serialize(Data)); #pragma warning restore 0618 Why was it marked obsolete?
