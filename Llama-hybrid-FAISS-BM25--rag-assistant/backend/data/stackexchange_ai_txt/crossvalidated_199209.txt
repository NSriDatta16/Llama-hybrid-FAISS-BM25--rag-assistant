How to prove Markov Chain formula?

I saw an question about how often should I roll a 6-face dice to get every number at least once. I have read a lot of interesting answers but one of them caught my attention. It is one which imples Markov Chain. Acording to the author ThePawn has the right idea to attack the problem with a recurrence relationship. Consider a Markov chain with states ${0,â€¦,6}$ corresponding to the count of the number of distinct dice rolls that have happened. State 0 is the start state, and state 6 is the finish state. Then, the probability of transition from state $i$ to itself is $\frac{i}{6}$. The probability of transition from state $i$ to state $i+1$ is $\frac{6-i}{6}$. Therefore the hitting time of the finish state is $$\sum_{i=0}^5 \frac{6}{6-i} = 14.7 $$ I would like to know which steps with more details that I need to develop in order to prove that summation formula. What if I change the dice for a 8-faces dice or even if I put 2 6-dices rolling at the same time? Thank you, guys! Luis P.
