How to allow a many-to-many relationship to be configured in Python

I have a simple app which requires a many-to-many relationship to be configured as part of its set-up. For example, the app requires a list of repository URLs, a list of users and for each user, a subset of the repository URLs. I first thought of using a config.py file similar to the following: repositories = { 'repo1': 'http://svn.example.com/repo1/', 'repo2': 'http://svn.example.com/repo2/', 'repo3': 'http://svn.example.com/repo3/', } user_repository_mapping = { 'person_A': ['repo1', 'repo3'], 'person_B': ['repo2'], 'person_C': ['repo1', 'repo2'] } which I could import. But this is quite messy as the config file lives outside my python-path and I would rather use a standard configuration approach such as using ini files or YAML. Is there an elegant way of configuring a relationship such as this without importing a Python directly?
