Write two methods AverageAndDoSomeMath (Point2 point) AverageAndDoSomeMath (IEnumerable points) and make the 1st one call the 2nd one by wrapping it in a collection. public decimal AverageAndDoSomeMath (Point2 point) { return AverageAndSomeMath(new []{point}); } I'm guessing that's what you already had in mind but thought it wasn't the correct solution, right? Edit: Simplified the method (thanks to Freddy Rios)
