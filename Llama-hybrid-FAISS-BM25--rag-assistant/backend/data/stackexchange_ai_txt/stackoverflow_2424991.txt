First, when you do operation on an UCM component, it is best to do it in a view referencing said component: cleartool: Warning: Unable to determine view for "component:testcomponent@\res_pvob". ComponentRootDir -> That means your current location is unable to see the VOB where the component is defined. And that can explain your error message. Second: true access restriction is not easily done with ClearCase, since it depends entirely on the OS. One way we managed to do it is at the VOB level (not at the component level), by making a chmod 770 on the .vbs (vob storage) directly on the VOB server. The article VOB and view access control can bring a more detailed explanation. When a process requests access to VOB or view data, the process's credentials are evaluated by Rational ClearCase to determine whether the requested form of access is authorized. The following process credentials are important in making this determination: User. The name of the user who starts the process. Primary group. The primary group of the user who starts the process. Supplemental group list. Other groups of which the user who starts the process is a member. That means you need to: restrict the list of groups associated with a VOB ( protectvob ) restrict the list of groups a user is part of (OS-related management)
