Yes: script the ClearCase view creation or explain them the mkview usage. Each user can then create is own view. Create views is definitely not the role of a configuration manager. 1/ Determine a view naming convention username_viewPurpose: non-UCM dynamic view username_viewPurpose_snap: non-UCM snapshot view username_streamname: UCM dynamic view username_streamname_snap: UCM snapshot view I would recommend all-minuscule case for the view names. I really recommend always having the username included (as a prefix) in the name of a view. It is so much easy to manage/administer when you know who own the view without having to "ct lsview' it. 2/ Determine a view storage convention either one central view storage, with a common storage name, or a common UNC path or one view storage per developer desktop. I use the second convention, because I consider their view as transient spaces for them to create / delete / recreate as they need. 3/ "empower" the user Make a script (like Jonathan's one, but with a little more options, and able to work for Windows or Unix) Describe the mkview command in a wiki page I actually use the second convention, because each user can quite easily type a mkview and take into account his/her environment details (Windows/Unix, central storage/local storage, ...) You also need to teach them how configure their config spec (even in UCM), in order to: not select "lost+found" directories (useful when merging in UCM) not select anything not already selected by previous config spec rules, meaning adding if needed a 'element /aVob/* -none' (useful in snapshot view in order to not have many empty directories)
