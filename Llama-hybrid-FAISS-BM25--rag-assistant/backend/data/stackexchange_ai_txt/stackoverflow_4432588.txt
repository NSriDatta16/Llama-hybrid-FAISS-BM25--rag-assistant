XmlReader Innertext Problem

I have an Xml document in which some of the elements look like this: W X Y Z ABC My objective is to get "ABC" out of the above example. I tried looking at the InnerText (which returns "WXYZABC") and InnerXml and Value (which returns null) properties in the XmlElement class and bunch of properties in the XmlReader class too. Somehow I don't see an elegant way to extract the data I need. Can someone please help me out? Thanks in advance.
