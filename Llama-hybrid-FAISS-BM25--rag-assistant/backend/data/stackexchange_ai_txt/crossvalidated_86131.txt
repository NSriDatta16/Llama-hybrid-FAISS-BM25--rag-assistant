I recommend looking at prcomp$rotation[,1] , which tells you how much each dolphin contributes to the first principal component. (I believe these numbers are called scores or loadings.) This might help you to interpret PC1 in your plot. Here is an example where there are ten dolphins and 100 groups, and the dolphins are divided into two clans, with groups tending to be made up mostly of dolphins from one clan. set.seed(100) M biplot(prcomp(M)) prcomp(M)$rotation[,1:2] PC1 PC2 [1,] -0.2088296 0.1042746 [2,] -0.3581626 0.1974796 [3,] -0.3615619 0.2843145 [4,] -0.3754459 0.3319092 [5,] -0.2892279 0.5214507 [6,] 0.3206343 0.4149111 [7,] 0.2782524 0.2736374 [8,] 0.3384193 0.3517811 [9,] 0.2716513 0.2545807 [10,] 0.3228274 0.2272208 Here, PC2 is related to the size of the group since all the dolphins contribute to it. But PC1 distinguishes between dolphins 1-5 and dolphins 6-10. You can also see this on the biplot (although in your case, a biplot might not be very helpful because there will be so many arrows.) However, it's also possible that the separation might be an artefact and doesn't actually mean anything; this can happen with PCA. See Shalizi's PCA tutorials lecture 10 for an example. Another thing you could consider is social network analysis. People have worked on dolphin social networks before, so you might get some ideas from there. There is a data set called Dolphin in the UCI network data repository which might have links to interesting work. [Edit: I also wonder whether PC1 might be related to time, since your data are spread over 20 years?]
