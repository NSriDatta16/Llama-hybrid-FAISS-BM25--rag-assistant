Importing Python modules from different working directory

I have a Python script that uses built-in modules but also imports a number of custom modules that exist in the same directory as the main script itself. For example, I would call python agent.py and agent.py has a number of imports, including: import checks where checks is in a file in the same directory as agent.py agent/agent.py agent/checks.py When the current working directory is agent/ then everything is fine. However, if I call agent.py from any other directory, it is obviously unable to import checks.py and so errors. How can I ensure that the custom modules can be imported regardless of where the agent.py is called from e.g. python /home/bob/scripts/agent/agent.py
