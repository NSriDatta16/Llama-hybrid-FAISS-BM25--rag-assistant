Pandas throwing "Error tokenizing data. C error" while loading data sets from URL

I am trying to work on the Titanic competition to get hands on experience with data science & machine learning. I tried to load up the datasets from GitHub but pandas threw the following error: ParserError: Error tokenizing data. C error: Expected 1 fields in line 32, saw 2 I tried to follow the advice of other SO users so I added skiprows=1 parameter in my pd.csv() call to skip the first row but it didn't work. import pandas as pd train_dataset = pd.read_csv("https://github.com/oo92/titanic-files/blob/master/train.csv", skiprows=1) test_dataset = pd.read_csv("https://github.com/oo92/titanic-files/blob/master/test.csv", skiprows=1) ground_truths = pd.read_csv("https://github.com/oo92/titanic-files/blob/master/gender_submission.csv", skiprows=1) train_dataset.head()
