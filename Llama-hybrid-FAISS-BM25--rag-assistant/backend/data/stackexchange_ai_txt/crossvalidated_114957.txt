You said "...I have developed a new predictor (binary) for a disease...." I am not quite sure what you mean by that. We do not develop predictors like vaccines. May be you identified a hitherto-unrecognized predictor. In any case, you have stated that there are already established predictors for the disease of interest. And you want to determine the unique predictive influence of the 'new predictor' given the already established predictors for the disease. I feel here block entry logistic regression would be very appropriate. Enter the already known predictors in the first block and enter the 'new predictor' in the second block.
