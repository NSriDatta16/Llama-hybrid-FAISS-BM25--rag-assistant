How do I change the tag used by Zend_View_Helpers_FormErrors?

When using Zend_Form, if an element is not valid the form returns the errors by way of an unordered list. How do I change this to use paragraph tags instead? I have attempted loading the Errors decorator for the elements and calling setOptions() to pass in a bunch of tags to replace the ul/li stuff being used by Zend_Form_Decorator_FormErrors, but that didn't work =/ Instead Zend_Form_Decorator_Errors just put the options as attribute/value pairs in the ul tag.
