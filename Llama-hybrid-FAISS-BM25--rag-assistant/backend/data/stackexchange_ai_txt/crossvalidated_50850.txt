I think a better (hypothetical) illustration might be something like this: Store 2011 2012 1 100 ? 2 180 ? 3 190 ? 4 210 ? 5 235 ? 6 300 ? Barring systematic reasons we'd expect the worst performer (from random causes) to not be so again. And so also for the best performer. Hence with 10% average growth I'd expect #1 to do better than 110 and #6 to do worse than 330. I feel the iffy part is the assumptions. It is very rare IMHO that the laggard of the pack is truly just a random fluke and not some underlying heterogeneity.
