What is the relationship between Mohr's Circle and Principal Component Analysis?

While I was studying PCA, I was told that it is related to Mohr's Circle. I don't know what that means. I don't know if they are related or not. I was just told, so I want to make sure here. If they are related, what is the relationship between Mohr's Circle and PCA ?
