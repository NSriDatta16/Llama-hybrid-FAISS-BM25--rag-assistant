T test on whole sample or on averages

Background: Consider the following experiment: There are two groups of subjects, Group A have been treated with a drug that affects the muscle fibre diameter and Group B with a placebo. After treatment, a biopsy is performed, and the diameter of a given number of muscle fibres looks like this. Note that as this is a controlled experiment, the only variation between the subjects is the treatment, and the subjects themselves. (Note: Random data typed out to illustrate concept, variances do not represent actual data) Treatment A: Subject 1: 10,12,15,16,17,20,45 Subject 2: 9,11,12,14,15,16,20,37 Treatment B: Subject 3: 21,22,25,26,34,43 Subject 4: 24,25,25,26,35,40 Now, when evaluating the differences by a t test, I have two options: Option 1: I pool data from subjects 1 &2, and pool separately 3 & 4 and perform a t test on the extended dataset: So essentially, the groups will be Treated: 21,22,25,26,34,43, 24,25,25,26,35,40 Placebo: 10,12,15,16,17,20,45, 9,11,12,14,15,16,20,37 Option 2: I take the averages of the subjects and then perform the T test. Essentially the groups will be: Treated: 28.5, 29.16, Placebo: 19.28, 16.75 Question: Now, convention (my team) say I go for Option 2, but the thing I am afraid of loosing is the variability within each subject, when I take the average. Can I have your thoughts on this ? I know that neither Option 1 nor 2 are ideal, and am at a loss as to what test to use. For the simplicity of the question, assume normal distribution, and equal variances.
