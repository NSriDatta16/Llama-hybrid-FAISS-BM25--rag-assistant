Query multiple mysql rows and seperate into variables after?

I was just wondering if there is a better way to do the following code... I have a table that will never have more than 1000 rows and on average 300 rows. $largeside_mysql = mysql_query("(SELECT url, image FROM advert WHERE placement = 'largeside' AND paid = 'complete' AND city = '{$GLOBALS['user_city']}' ORDER BY RAND() LIMIT 3) UNION ALL (SELECT url, image FROM advert WHERE placement = 'largeside' AND paid = 'complete' AND province = '{$GLOBALS['user_province']}' 'city' != '{$GLOBALS['user_city']}' ORDER BY RAND() LIMIT 3) UNION ALL (SELECT url, image FROM advert WHERE placement = 'largeside' AND paid = 'complete' AND 'province' != '{$GLOBALS['user_province']}' 'city' != '{$GLOBALS['user_city']}' ORDER BY RAND() LIMIT 3) UNION ALL (SELECT url, image FROM advert WHERE user='1' AND uniqid='largeside' ORDER BY RAND() LIMIT 3) LIMIT 3 ") or die(mysql_error()); $GLOBALS['largeside'] = array(); while($row = mysql_fetch_assoc($largeside_mysql)) { $GLOBALS['largeside'][] = $row; } It took me a bit of reading but I have got this to work, basically it passes global variables for use during page load. I want to count the rows found in one query then if the limit IS NOT reached do another query to add additional rows until the LIMIT is reached. Most of the time the first query will find enough rows but the odd time it will need to have some added. I was wondering if this is the best solution for the table size and for what I need to do. Thanks a lot,
