Understanding the Behrens–Fisher problem

This section of this article says: Ronald Fisher in 1935 introduced fiducial inference in order to apply it to this problem. He referred to an earlier paper by W. V. Behrens from 1929. Behrens and Fisher proposed to find the probability distribution of $$ T \equiv {\bar x_1 - \bar x_2 \over \sqrt{s_1^2/n_1 + s_2^2/n_2}}$$ where $\bar x_1$ and $\bar x_2$ are the two sample means, and $s_1$ and $s_2$ are their standard deviations. [ . . . ] Fisher approximated the distribution of this by ignoring the random variation of the relative sizes of the standard deviations, $$ {s_1 / \sqrt{n_1} \over \sqrt{s_1^2/n_1 + s_2^2/n_2}}.$$ I find that I am disinclined to believe this. (Hence, Wikipedia is fallible!) At some point in the next couple of weeks I'm going to read what Fisher and Behrens and Bartlett wrote about this in th 1930s. For now, I'm looking at Fisher's book Statistical Methods and Scientific Inference . As with Edwin Jaynes, I'm getting the impression that the fact that he was occasionally an idiot in no way alters the fact that he was a great genius, but he didn't always express himself in the way that was best for communicating with lesser mortals. On page 97, Fisher writes about Bartlett: [...]the reference set [...] has not been limited to the subset having the ratio $s_1/s_2$ observed, but was eagerly seized upon by M. S. Bartlett, as though it were a defect in the test of significance of the composite hypothesis, that in special cases the criterion of rejection is less frequently attained by chance than in others. On reflexion I do not think one should expect anything else,[...] Thus it seems to me that Fisher did not intend to "ignore" the "random variation of" the ratio $s_1/s_2$ as a means of approximation, but rather, he thought one should condition on $s_1/s_2$. This does seem like "conditioning on an ancillary statistic", which Fisher employed so successfully in other contexts. If I recall correctly, I first heard of Bartlett when I read about this in the Encyclopedia of Statistical Science , which said simply that Bartlett was the first to show that fiducial intervals are not the same thing as confidence intervals, by showing that the fiducial intervals that Fisher had derived in this problem did not have constant coverage rates. That statement didn't leave me with the impression that there was some controversy about this. So here's my question: Which is closer to the truth: the Wikipedia article or my suspicion? Fisher, R. A. (1935) "The fiducial argument in statistical inference", Annals of Eugenics , 8, 391–398.
