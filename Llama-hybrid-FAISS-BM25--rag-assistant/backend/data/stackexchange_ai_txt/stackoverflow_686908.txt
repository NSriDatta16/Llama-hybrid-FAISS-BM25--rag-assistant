Having trouble with Lightbox

OK i downloaded all the files and put them into a directory on m server call "lightbox" when I try to use it on a page, the image pops up on the bottom of the page, not overlapping modal like. I changed the images sources in the lightbox.js file to include the lightbox/ directory. The images in the css file are still relative to the css document . So I am not sure why it is not working correctly. Here is a link to the page Clicky Does anyone have a clue what I am doing wrong? Thanks!! UPDATE the text page located here: clicky which is inside the lightbox directory works fine. So I am pretty sure this is happening because I put the files into a folder on my server instead of just on my server, but I would like to keep my files organized so if anyone knows how to make it work from inside a directory?
