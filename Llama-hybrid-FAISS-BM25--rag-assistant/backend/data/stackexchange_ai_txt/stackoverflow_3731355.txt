If you were using Merge Modules this would be ok because each ID would be appended with a unique module ID. ( dir1.GUIDA, dir1.GUIDB, dir1.GUIDC ) If you are using fragments you either have to change the ID's or normalize the directory structure into a single wxs and use a DirectoryRef to pull it into your other wxs with your components. I'm not sure Heat can handle all of this automatically. It's really just more of a starting point.
