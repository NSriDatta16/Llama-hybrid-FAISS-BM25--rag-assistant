Don't think of this in terms of estimating how long bugs take to fix, because you can't possibly estimate that correctly. Think of this in terms of managing client rage . If you tell them the bugs will take no time at all to fix and they end up taking 3 months, your client will be happy with you now and furious with you in the future. If you tell them the bugs will take 3 months to fix and they actually take 3 months to fix (which they will), your client will be furious now and happy with you in the future. I usually say bugs will take no time at all (2-3 days seems to be a good pacifying number).
