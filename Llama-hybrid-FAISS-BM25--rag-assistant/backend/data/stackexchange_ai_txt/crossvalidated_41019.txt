Advanced procedures using the Median statistic

With the risk of asking a duplicate question (to be fair, I looked at 10 pages): Could you name and explain some advanced procedures which make use of the median statistic? Background: I am interested because today I saw a presentation on a TAR model, trying to figure out a baseline for negative affect within observants. The mean was taken as frequentist approach and also a Bayesian approach was done. My point was that median might be better, since if for some reason a person, when happy, is REALLY happy, while when sad would not be so different from a baseline. The mean would then not be a good estimate and I figured the median would be better? EDIT: Maybe easier to comprehend: For which computations are medians used beyond simple descriptive statistics (and why is better than taking the mean for example)?
