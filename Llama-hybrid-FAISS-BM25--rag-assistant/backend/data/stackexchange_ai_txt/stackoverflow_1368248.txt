Does java garbage scheduler depict it details in some form?

The scheduler that runs as a daemon in JVM to garbage collect objects, can it be monitored with JMX.Do we have some way of telling that these are the objects it might garbage collect now.That way we can figure out that if we are creating specific objects of our classes and the instances are held up in memory of when they can be garbage collected and how much memory they take up. Also is there a way of telling how much memory in average an instance of my class takes. I know this question might be stupid but even though we cannot force garbage collection, can we find out at run time which objects are not being connected by other objects (in other word not being used at all).Can we find weak references at runtime, is there a way to depict that.
