You can leverage JQuery UI 1.6's Effects ( Effects Demo Page ). The following accomplished the desired effect for me. $('#toggleButton').bind('click', function(e) { $('#expandingFooter').toggle( 'slide', { easing: 'easeOutQuint', direction: 'down' }, 1000 ); }); Note: You may want to play with the easing parameter to get the desired smoothness of the effect. You'll need to have the latest versions of both JQuery and JQuery UI Slide Effect to do this.
