Mysql supports a MAX_ROWS parameter when creating (and maybe altering?) a table. http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/create-table.html Edit: Sadly it turns out this is only a hint for optimization "The maximum number of rows you plan to store in the table. This is not a hard limit, but rather a hint to the storage engine that the table must be able to store at least this many rows." .. Your question implied that scripts are ok; is it ridiculous to make one as simple as a cron job regularly dropping table rows above a given ID ? It's not nearly as elegant as it would've been to have mysql throw errors when something tries to add a row too many, but it would do the job - and you may be able to have your application also then check if it's ID is too high, and throw a warning to the user/relevant party.
