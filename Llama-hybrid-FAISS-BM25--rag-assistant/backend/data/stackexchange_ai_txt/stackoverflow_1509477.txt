Can iframe pages tell when they are iframed?

So I know that if I include an iFrame to a page that is not on the same domain I can't access that iframe's DOM via browser policy, but can a page that is in an iframe do any kind of parent document accessing? Specifically I have to ideas that are contingent on this question: If the embedded page can tell that it is not the parent window, one could make either sites that are un-iframe-able so that if the page detects it is iframed it changes to a "Go Away" page OR you could make it only-iframe-able (similar to a server-side script for pages that are only meant to be includes), so that going to the page when it's not iframed would get a "Go Away" page. If the iframed page has certain liberties that the parent window does not, it could request the stylesheet of the parent window and set it as its on stylesheet, thus making the site integrate more with the parent document. (Of course, then I could just make my stylesheet relate more to the iframed site, knowing it will do this, but I don't see that as an issue). Anybody know?
