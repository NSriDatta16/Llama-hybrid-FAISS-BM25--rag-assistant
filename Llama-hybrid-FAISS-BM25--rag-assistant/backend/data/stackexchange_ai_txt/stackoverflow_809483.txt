This example shows creating an AssemblyBuilder then a ModuleBuilder then the TypeBuilder. From there you have to define properties. You have to create methods that have return & parameters that match the get and set accessors. The example shows a basic implementation of standard get/set operations that use a field for storage. If you need more then you'll have to learn CIL to boot. When all done call TypeBuilder.CreateType and possibly AssemblyBuilder.Save if you wish to save it for future use. As for your apprehension about creating an assembly. It's not that big of a deal to define a dynamic assembly & module. It's only a few lines to do that.
