Silly sprintf() question

How do I add the SQL wildcard characters to this: sprintf("SELECT robot FROM robots WHERE robot LIKE '%s'",strtolower($user_agent)); as sprintf("SELECT robot FROM robots WHERE robot LIKE '%%s%'",strtolower($user_agent)); blows up in a spectacular ball of flame, PS sorry for the rather basic question. I'm cutting down on my coffee these days.
