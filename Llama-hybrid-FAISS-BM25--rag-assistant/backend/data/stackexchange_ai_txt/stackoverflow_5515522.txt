UIWebView without Copy/Paste and selection rectangle when showing documents

In my App I want to disable the Copy/Paste/Cut of contents that are showed by a UIWebView object. To achieve this, I created a UIWebView subclass and overrode the - (BOOL)canPerformAction:(SEL)action withSender:(id)sender method: #pragma mark - UIResponderStandardEditActions - (BOOL)canPerformAction:(SEL)action withSender:(id)sender { if (action == @selector(copy:) || action == @selector(paste:)|| action == @selector(cut:)) { return _copyCutAndPasteEnabled; } return [super canPerformAction:action withSender:sender]; } Now the user no longer can make such operations, however the UIWebView still shows the "selection rectangle", as you can see in the following screenshot: NOTE: The content being showed in the UIWebView is not HTML pages. I'm showing document files (PDF, DOC, PPT), loaded from a file using: NSURL *fileURL = [NSURL fileURLWithPath: ]; NSURLRequest *fileRequest = [NSURLRequest requestWithURL:fileURL]; [ loadRequest:fileRequest]; Is there any way to disable/hide this selection rectangle feature too? []s,
