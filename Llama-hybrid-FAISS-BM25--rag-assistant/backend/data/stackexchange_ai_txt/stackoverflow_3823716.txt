I have just discovered something which makes me very red in the face!! quite annoyed, but never mind :) A fellow ffmpeg user pointed out that ffprobe should output more frame info, which it did. here is a link to his handy tip: http://forums.creativecow.net/thread/291/71 Using this I found the following: Actual average bitrate (ffprobe data): 8355.2776056338 Actual average bitrate (ffmpeg vstats data): 8406.23275471698 Ffmpeg -vstats avg_br: 7816.3 Reproduced above: 7816.32168421053 Ffmpeg standard error output 'bitrate=': 8365.8 Below is a link to my workings out: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6743276/ffmpeg_probs/ffprobe_vs_ffmpeg-vstats.xlsx What I have discovered is I should have been using the average bitrate info from ffmpeg standard error output, it looks like the most reliable!
