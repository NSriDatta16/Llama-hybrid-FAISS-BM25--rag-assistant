SVM - running time for detecting if data is linearly separable?

If my understanding is correct, one way to check if a set of $m$ data points is linearly separable is to use support vector machines to find a maximum margin hyperlane for separating the data; the data is linearly separable if and only if such a hyperplane exists. If the data consists of $m$ pairs $(x_1, y_1), \ldots, (x_m,y_m)$, with $x_i \in \{0,1\}^n$ and $y_i \in \{0,1\}$, do we know what the worst case running time is for finding whether or not a maximum margin hyperlane exists?
