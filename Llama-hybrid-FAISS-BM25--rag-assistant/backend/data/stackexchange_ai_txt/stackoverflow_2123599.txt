How to run the same testmethods while only changing the dependencies?

I have 5 testmethods that test the functionality of a PasswordManager object.I use the built in test engine of visual studio 2008. This manager can make use of two Dependencies: an XMLStorageManager or a DbStorageManager. The Dependency is set in the Passwordmanager's constructor. How can I run the tests twice with the only difference the kind of StorageManager I use? (I know, I know, these are NOT unit tests...)
