What represents the output of a logistic regression in R

I've read other similar questions on the site about logistic regression and I've read some articles/book chapters on this, but still I'm a little bit confused about that. I'll try to be as clearer as I can. I have a medical case-control study, with many variables which could be used as predictors of the binary output variable, thus logistic regression is the best fit. I have made some code in R, based on a previous question I made, like this: model where Case is the output variable, thus being 0 or 1 if it is a control or a case, respectively; X and Y are the input variables. I then use the output model to compute the area under the curve like this: aucCP=auc(Case~predict(model), data=data); Okay, now the troubles begin. First, I understand that the object "model" is the output of the logistic regression model, thus being the log(odds) of the probability that model is Case for each couple of data in X and Y. Am I right? Then, I know I can express the object model with an equation, being model: Coefficients: (Intercept) X Y -1.142005 -0.047981 0.020145 thus being model=-1.14- 0.05X+ 0.02Y. Right? Now the biggest problem: could "model" be considered as new variable, a combined predictor of X and Y, using which I predict Case?
