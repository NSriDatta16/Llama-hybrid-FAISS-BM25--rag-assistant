I was just wondering if there was any fundamental reason why using the table for data storage was A Bad Thing. I'd say it's fundamentally "bad" for the same reasons we strive not to mingle javascript or css in with the markup. The page HTML should be used for presentation purposes only. I don't think there's going to be a huge difference performance wise whether you use the table or a javascript object, but the javascript object would be much cleaner, IMO.
