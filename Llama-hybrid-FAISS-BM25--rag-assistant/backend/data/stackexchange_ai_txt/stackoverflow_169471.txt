I use them all the time. Again, like anything else, they can be used for both evil and good, and can certainly be the hallmark of bad design, but they can be used to help organize code very well. #region Properties #region Update Section #region Accessors Certainly you should avoid Jeff's example of #Sweep under carpet What I find odd about them, as Jeff pointed out, is that they are a compiler preprocessor command for ui purposes. I'm sure VS team could have done something just as useful in another way.
