C# ASMX webservice semi -permanant storage requirement

I'm writing a mock of a third-party web service to allow us to develop and test our application. I have a requirement to emulate functionality that allows the user to submit data, and then at some point in the future retrieve the results of processing on the service. What I need to do is persist the submitted data somewhere, and retrieve it later (not in the same session). What I'd like to do is persist the data to a database (simplest solution), but the environment that will host the mock service doesn't allow for that. I tried using IsolatedStorage (application-scoped), but this doesn't seem to work in my instance. (I'm using the following to get the store... IsolatedStorageFile.GetStore(IsolatedStorageScope.Application | IsolatedStorageScope.Assembly, null, null); I guess my question is (bearing in mind the fact that I understand the limitations of IsolatedStorage) how would I go about getting this to work? If there is no consistent way to do it, I guess I'll have to fall back to persisting to a specific file location on the filesystem, and all the pain of permission setting that entails in our environment.
