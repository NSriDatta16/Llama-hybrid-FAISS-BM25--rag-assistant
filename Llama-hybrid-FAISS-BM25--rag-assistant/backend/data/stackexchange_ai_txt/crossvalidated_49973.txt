Geometric mean is useful either when (1) the distribution of observations is highly right-skewed and you expect that measurement error is greater on that right end of big values than on the left end of small values; or (2) the observations (values) are multiplicative for you rather than additive: you prefer to see their collective effect as their product, not their sum. The choice between arithmetic and harmonic mean is usually less obvious and is partly a matter of philosophy. They say that you take harmonic mean instead of arithmetic one when the characteristic which varies hides in the denominator - not the numerator - of the value. It's easy to say - not so easy to do. For example, sprint running, a sportsman got it 100 meters for 10 sec. His speed was 100/10=10 m/s. You want to average speeds of several sportsmen. If the effective feature that varies for you lies in the numerator - the distance ran in a second - you'd choose arithmetic mean of the speed values. But if the effective feature that varies for you lies in the denominator - the time elapsed in a meter - you'd choose harmonic mean of the speeds. The problem here is that the decision between the two alternatives in this example is quite arbitrary due to vague "philosophy" of such terms as "speed" or "rate".
