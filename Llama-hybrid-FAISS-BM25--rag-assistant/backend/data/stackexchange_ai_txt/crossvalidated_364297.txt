In case of semi-supervised data, and PCA pre-processing, should I pre-process all the data or only the labeled data?

suppose I have labeled data and unlabeled data, should I do a PCA process on all the data, and then feed the labeled data through a classifier? Or take only the labeled data through the PCA process and then to the classifier? EDIT 1: Adding t-SNE plot of my data (blue and red are labeled and green is unlabeled) EDIT 2: Goal is to Binary classify the green data (which is unknown) to red or blue (blue is 1, red is 0) t-SNE helps me by giving a picture of how my data spread on a 2D dimension. I hypothesis PCA will help me reduce/compress my data and help me get a better representation of the data (as I only have 4K rows of data and originally, 51 features). Having labeled and un-labeled data doesn't prevent me from solving the problem, but I want to take every advantage I can in order to get a better classification.
