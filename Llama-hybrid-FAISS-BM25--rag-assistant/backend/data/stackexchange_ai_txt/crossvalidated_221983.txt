How to take random draws of a low-entropy "meta-random" distribution

I'm working on a simulation study, and for it I'd like to be able to generate random draws from a random multivariate distribution. I'm looking for something pretty chaotic, in the sense that it's got multiple states with low within-state "entropy" (in a hand-waivey sense of the term). I'm not entirely sure how to pose the question, so perhaps let me start with a few constraints: It can be defined in real numbers, with arbitrarily many dimensions These dimensions vary from being almost-independent to dependent The pattern of dependence between any two dimensions varies from global to highly local. In other words, $x_1$ and $x_2$ may be highly correlated along some of their joint support, but uncorrelated along other parts of it. The change in correlation over the support need not be constant, or even monotonic. Likewise, the pattern of dependence need not be restricted to the first moment. For example, the kurtosis of $x_2$ might depend on the variance of $x_4$. I've got some vague ideas about how such a thing might be approached, but they're not really all that well-developed. For example, I could draw random numbers for each variable, and calculate the entropy of the distribution relative to a maximum-entropy distribution with 5+ moments. I'd then retain those distributions with low entropy. I'm not sure how feasible this would be however, or even if it'd give me what I want. Is there anything already in this space? If there were, it seems like it'd be useful to people working with nonparametric statistics and machine learning.
