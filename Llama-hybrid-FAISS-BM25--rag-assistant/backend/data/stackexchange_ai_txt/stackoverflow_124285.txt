while ($Row = mysql_fetch_object($rs)) { // ...do stuff... } ...is how I've always done it. I prefer to use objects for collections of data instead of arrays, since it organizes the data a little better, and I know I'm a lot less likely to try to add arbitrary properties to an object than I am to try to add an index to an array (for the first few years I used PHP, I thought you couldn't just assign arbitrary properties to an object, so it's ingrained to not do that).
