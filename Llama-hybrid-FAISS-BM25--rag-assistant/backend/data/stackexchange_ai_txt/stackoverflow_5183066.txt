try following: window/preferences -> Plug-in Development/Target Platform click on the selected target platform and on the reload button (if not "Current Installation ..." is selected you have to add the plugin to the plugin-folder of your target platform) make sure, your plugin is listed in your manifest.mf file in your applications launch config, go to dependencies and check if your added plugin is listed there now check your applications launch config. click on the "Plug-ins" tab. if "Launch with" says "all workspace and enabled taraget plug-ins" you should be fine otherwise you should press the "Add Required Plug-ins" Button this should work. if not, maybe your plugin isn't compatible to your target-platform.
