Extracting list of locations from text using R

I have a string containing many words [not sentences], I want to know how I can extract all the words that correspond to a location in that string for example: text The output should be: > China, Japan, United Kingdom, Mongolian something of the type. Basically I am looking at extracting locative information from random text. This is a very general problem I am looking for guidance on how to model my solution, is there any dataset or something I can use to compare or extract information from. I don't want to carry out word by word comparison. I have looked up OpenNLP but I am not sure how to use it's location-models for carrying out Named Entity Recognition in R. In the above example there are only countries but I would like to identify other places, such as provinces, states, counties, cities, etc. as well. I am new to machine learning and R-programming, any guidance is greatly appreciated.
