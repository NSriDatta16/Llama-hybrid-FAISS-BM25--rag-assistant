For this purpose the best option is to ask the provider (if possible) to publish some API. For this purpose sending keystrokes is very fragile. What after clicking Save? A dialog is opened and you should navigate to a folder and click OK. It means that you need to find the window again. And what if there is some similar window opened? Will your script be able to find the right window? (for other scenarios where you need to hide/show/find windows and send keystrokes I would recommend Autohotkey .) Other possibilities depend on what site it is. It seems that the file is generated as a response to the POST command. That means that there is no direct link that you could download. And even if there was a link, it is likely that it couldn't be downloaded via Net.WebClient because you wouldn't send any authentication info (session cookies or session id in query string). You would need to parse e.g. the cookies from $ie.Document.cookie and add them to the request. However, in some cases you could use [System.Net.WebRequest]$webRequest = [System.Net.WebRequest]::Create($url); and specify the POST method and data and wait for response (which would be the file). That would mimic clicking on the submit button. But again, without credentials, it will probably fail. Without access to the site, it is hard to say something more.
