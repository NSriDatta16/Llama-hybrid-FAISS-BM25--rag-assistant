A couple of points: I guess you want to use the linear mixed model to impute the missing values for the outcome Average to be used in another procedure. However, if your only purpose is to fit the mixed model, then you do not need to impute the missing data in the outcome variable. The model will provide you with correct inferences under the missing at random missing data mechanism, provided that the variance-covariance structure is correctly/flexibly specified. The predict() function will give the estimated subject-specific averages at the time points you have missing data. Because these are estimated averages, you will need to account for their variance. Hence, it will be better to create multiply-imputed datasets imputing in each one the missing values from $\mathcal N \bigl ( \hat\mu_{ij}(\hat b_i), \hat \sigma^2 \bigr )$ , where $\hat\mu_{ij}(\hat b_i)$ is the estimated subject-specific average provided by predict() and $\hat \sigma^2$ is the estimated variance of the error terms. The discrepancies between the trends of the observed and imputed data that you observe may be attributed to the fact that the model is not correctly specified, e.g., that the longitudinal evolutions of Average are nonlinear (in your model you assume linear evolutions). Or it could also be attributed to a potential missing at random nature of the missing data. Namely, if the data are missing at random, then the observed you end up to have are a selected sample from your target population. Finally, it would not be advisable to use last observation carried forward. This is a technique suffering from many shortcomings and can give your very erroneous results.
