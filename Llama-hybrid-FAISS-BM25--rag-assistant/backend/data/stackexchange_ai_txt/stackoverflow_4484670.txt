system("killall SpringBoard"); not working in ios4.2.1?

So I had created an app that used the command system("killall SpringBoard"); and it has worked just fine on 4.0 - 4.1. I just recently began testing the app on 4.2 and it still works when I run it in simulator, but when I run it on the device nothing happens. Does anyone know what the cause of this is? The device is a iPhone 3GS.
