You could do this pretty easily with panels. Actually panels is not needed but it's a nice module that let you do a lot of stuff. Basically you can create a view for each term and make a blok display. In panels you can then create a page where you can put all of the bloks. You could also put the bloks in the content area only to be displayed in an empty page but that is in many ways not as elegant.
