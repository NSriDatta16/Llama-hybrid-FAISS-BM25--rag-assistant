Magento Recurring Profiles with non-Paypal payment method

Interested to know if (a) this is possible, and (b) whether any of you have successfully implemented the functionality. The wiki page repeatedly refers to "Currently, by default, Magento supports purchasing items with recurring profiles only for the PayPal payment system and only through the Express Checkout method." - I'm not sure if that's because there are no payment other methods currently implementing the Interface, or because they've hardcoded the architecture such that it will only work with Paypal. To test this, I've created a payment method that stubs out the Mage_Payment_Model_Recurring_Profile_MethodInterface methods, and that payment option is now presented when I go through checkout with a Nominal product (i.e. product with a recurring profile) and the order is placed successfully. However it doesn't appear in the list of Sales>Recurring Profiles or Customer's Billing Agreements. I guess they will be populated by the stubbed-out methods. I suspect that the fields in Mage_Payment_Model_Recurring_Profile are setup to mirror those required by Paypal, so it may take some mapping to translate those into another payment gateway's requirements, but that should be achievable theoretically, possibly using a model override. Sorry for the rambling question, but I'm keen to hear your experiences since the framework seems to support it on first investigation.
