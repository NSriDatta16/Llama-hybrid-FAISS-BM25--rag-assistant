sun's JDK/JRE needs a contiguous amount of memory if you allocate a huge block. The OS and initial apps tend to allocate bits and pieces during loading which fragments the available RAM. If a contiguous block is NOT available, the SUN JDK cannot use it. JRockit from Bea(acquired by Oracle) can allocate memory from pieces.
