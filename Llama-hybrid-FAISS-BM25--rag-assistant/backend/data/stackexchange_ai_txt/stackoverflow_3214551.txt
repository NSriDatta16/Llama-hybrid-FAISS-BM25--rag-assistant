If you didn't need to access it in a strongly-typed manner, but just without reflection, you could use dynamic : dynamic doc = new Bold() doc.InlineCollection. ... doc = new Paragraph() doc.InlineCollection. ... Another option is to define a wrapper, that exposes a property with the same name, and has an overloaded constructor that takes Bold , Paragraph , etc.
