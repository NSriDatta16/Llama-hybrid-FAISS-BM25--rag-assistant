How can a uniform prior make the posterior mean different from the MLE?

I read the following in Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective : How can a uniform prior move the posterior mean? Isn't a uniform distribution supposed to not bias the result? Are there any other examples where this happens? Note: In my original question I had misread the paragraph. I fixed the question accordingly.
