interpret regression result: comparing two levels in a catergorical/factor variable

for example the data has a binary response y , a numerical predictor week , and some categorical/factor predictors: ap , hilo , ID , trt : y ap hilo week ID trt 1 y p hi 0 X01 placebo 2 y p hi 2 X01 placebo 3 y p hi 4 X01 placebo 4 y p hi 11 X01 placebo 5 y a hi 0 X02 drug+ 6 y a hi 2 X02 drug+ 7 n a hi 6 X02 drug+ 8 y a hi 11 X02 drug+ 9 y a lo 0 X03 drug 10 y a lo 2 X03 drug Logistic regression result looks like: Coefficients: (4 not defined because of singularities) Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 2.550e+00 1.251e+00 2.038 0.041561 * app 1.924e+01 8.359e+03 0.002 0.998164 hilolo -1.562e+00 1.617e+00 -0.966 0.334074 week -2.127e-01 6.377e-02 -3.335 0.000852 *** IDX02 -2.525e-01 1.721e+00 -0.147 0.883337 IDX03 2.081e+01 7.562e+03 0.003 0.997804 IDX04 1.572e+00 1.127e+04 0.000 0.999889 IDX05 1.572e+00 1.127e+04 0.000 0.999889 ... Null deviance: 217.38 on 219 degrees of freedom Residual deviance: 118.51 on 169 degrees of freedom AIC: 220.51 Number of Fisher Scoring iterations: 19 It tells us for predictor ID , the baseline is ID == 'X01' (not shown in result). Comparing ID == 'X02' to '01' , the change is not significant, because the p-value is 0.883337. My question is how do you compare ID == 'X02' to 'X03' ? The log adds changes by 2.081e+01 - (-2.525e-01) , what error do I compare this difference to, and how to calculate p value? Can somebody give an example using ID == 'X02' to 'X03' please? Thank you. I leave the code later because my question is only about theory. Code in R : library(MASS) library(stats) data('bacteria') dat = bacteria glm_model = glm(y ~ ., family = binomial, data = dat) summary(glm_model) What I know (not very sure, and would like to get verified) each coefficient has it's estimate and std.error, because there's a population of many different values of this coefficient calculated by using differently sampled data. So comparing ID == 'X02' to 'X03' is to compare the mean of two populations. I read this post , so so, is delta(x1bar) in the equation the std.error in the glm result? I don't need to divide by n any more, right (since the std.error in the glm result in already the standard deviation of the mean)? Comparing ID == 'X02' to 'X03' : z = (-2.525e-01 - 2.081e+01) / sqrt(1.721e+00^2 + 7.562e+03^2) = -0.002785 is this correct? Thanks-
