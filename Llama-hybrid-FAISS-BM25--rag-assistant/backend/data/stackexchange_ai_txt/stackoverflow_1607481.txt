With respect to time tracking, what you're looking for is a burndown chart . Fredrik explained what a burn down is, without using the term. Essentially, you regularly reestimate the time remaining for a particular activity. So to your question of whether or not we track time spent , not necessarily. Scrum likes to work with time remaining instead. (You could substitute hours with story points, the principle is the same, as Robert explained.) To your second question of whether you can adjust your tasks and estimates, most definitely yes. Agile follows the 'reactive to change' philosophy; you prioritize what's most important to the customer. However, some teams to prefer not to add/delete/re-prioritize tasks in a particular sprint once it's begun, since that is almost an ad-hoc way of working, and even scrum requires some structure and discipline. The statement "thus once a project has started we cannot add new tasks or adjust the hourly estimates on those tasks." is almost certainly not in the spirit of agile.
