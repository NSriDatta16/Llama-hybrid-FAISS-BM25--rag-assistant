Trace of quadratic form with Laplacian matrix notation

Reading some papers about spectral graph analysis and graph neural networks I have found the following notation which I'm not too sure how to expand: Given matrices $F, L \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ , let's consider $tr(F^TLF)$ . Assuming that $ L:=D-A$ is the laplacian associated to some adjacency matrix $A$ and $F \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ , How to expand the above formula? What it actually represents?
