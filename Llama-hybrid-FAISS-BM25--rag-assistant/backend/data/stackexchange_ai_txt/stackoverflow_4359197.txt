Embedding a webview into another view

I have in my application 2 views: a. res/layout/main.xml - a standard view with 1 button b. res/layout/web_view.xml When I click the button on the first view(a), it loads the webview(b) and loads an url: // click on the "Browser" button in view a public void goToWebView(View view) { setContentView(R.layout.web_view); WebView mWebView = (WebView) findViewById(R.id.webview); mWebView.getSettings().setJavaScriptEnabled(true); mWebView.loadUrl("http://www.google.com"); } All that is working fine, the url load well but the browser is instantiated into its own view (a third one, not b itself) and my goal is to use the Webview to show some HTML code into my application, not outside of it, in a separate browser. Anyboyd any idea? This is done using API level8/Android 2.2. Thanks for your help. Paul
