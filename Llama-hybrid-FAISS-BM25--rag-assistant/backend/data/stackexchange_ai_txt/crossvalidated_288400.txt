Is 5 in 100,000 the same as 50 in 1000,000 from a Bayesian perspective?

I am learning about bayesian reasoning and I was having a discussion with a friend about it. My friend asked me this question, which I couldn't answer (this is not a homework, I am an adult learning bayesian statistics for the fun of it) There are 2 cities. City A, and City B both are on State C. 1 million people live on City A. Every year 50 people are murdered in that city. 100,000 people live on City B. Every year, 5 people are murdered in that city. Where should I live? Now, I know that if were to randomly pick a person from State C, and that person had just been murdered, there is 90% probability that person would come from City A. So, that seems to point out that I should live on B... But the thing is, I have not been murdered, and from that perspective, the murder rate of both cities looks the same: 5 for every 100,000 habitants. Does that mean that I am really equally likely to be murdered in A and in B, even while, if I had just been murdered, I am more likely to had been murdered on A? What if every year, 6 people were murdered in B? Would that mean that I should live in A (even while if I had just been murdered, I was most likely murdered in A?)
