However, the second measurement has a lower mean, which can therefore drive overall variance. Do you know this for sure? If that's so, you need to figure out what the relationship is and transform the variance to a more stable scale (e.g. log). Otherwise, try the naive approach and use a folded F test, dividing the larger sample variance by the smaller one, and find the p-value for the resulting F statistic. This approach assumes the samples are independent, which might be reasonable if your overall sequence is stationary or the sample times are widely separated. If not, you probably will need to fit some sort of time series model to the data (ARIMA maybe), and compare the variance of the residuals .
