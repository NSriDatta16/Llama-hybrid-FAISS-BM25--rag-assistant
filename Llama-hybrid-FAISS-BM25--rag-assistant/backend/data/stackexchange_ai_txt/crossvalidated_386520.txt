How to validate the results of bayesian causal network?

There are many ways of validating predicting the results: MSE, MAE, AIC, CV, etc.. But I do not hear any validation way of causality. If the true networks not available, how to make sure the results of bayesian networks are right? I am appreciate if there is any way other than randomized experiments. Thank you in advance.
