It's always risky to write to places on the user's computer - the sandbox may not allow you to do it at all, or the user's computer may not have access, or the directory structure may not be what you would expect. Sometimes, you can have access to the application's directory: http://blog.crankybit.com/notes-adobe-air-local-data-storage-options/ http://livedocs.adobe.com/flex/3/langref/flash/filesystem/File.html And you should always be able to shove things directly into encrypted storage: http://www.adobe.com/devnet/air/ajax/articles/encrypted_local_store.html
