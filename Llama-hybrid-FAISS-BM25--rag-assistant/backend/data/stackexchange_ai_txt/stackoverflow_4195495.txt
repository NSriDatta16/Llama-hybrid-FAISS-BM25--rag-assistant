One possibility is to change the way that you store the data. Since the range of possible values is limited to 1-34, instead of storing a list of numbers, you could store the counts of each number present: int[] counts = new int[34]; If your list has one 1 and two 3s, then counts[0] == 1 && counts[2] = 2 (you could alternately use 1-based indexing if that makes things faster (fewer subtractions.)) Now to evaluate that each int in a list appears at least once, you simply index into the array sequentially for each x and verify that all counts[x] > 0. There will be overhead associated with transforming the data from the counts form to the list form, but that's only a problem if you also frequently need to view the data in the list form. Another advantage to this storage format is that adding/removing to counts will never involve more than a single array element; in the list form, removing an element in the middle of the list entails a copy of multiple elements.
