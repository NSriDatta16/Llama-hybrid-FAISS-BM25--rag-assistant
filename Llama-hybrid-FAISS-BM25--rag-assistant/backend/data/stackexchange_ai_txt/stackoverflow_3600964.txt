This simple plugin was developed for rails 2 but seems to work in rails 3 too. http://github.com/Bertg/i18n_action_mailer With it you can do the following: def new_follower(user, follower) @follower = follower @user = user set_locale user.locale mail :to => @user.email, :subject => t(:new_follower_subject) end The subject and mail templates are then translated using the user's locale.
