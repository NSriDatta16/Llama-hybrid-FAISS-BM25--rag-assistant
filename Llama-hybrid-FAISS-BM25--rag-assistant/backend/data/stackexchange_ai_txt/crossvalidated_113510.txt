Is it logical to stand on the chance-line (50-50 %) when we don't know a-priori probabilities?

Let we have two hypotheses $H_0$ and $H_1$ and we don't know their a-priori probabilities. If we wish to calculate the average probability of error, does it makes sense to assume 50-50 % chance of occurrence of any of two, in the context of Neyman-Pearson criteria?
