Learning Eclipse MDT-UML2 Sequence Diagrams

Are there any tutorials or documentation files for drawing Sequence Diagrams with Eclipse MDT-UML2? I can't put a Lifeline on the page. It took me 10 minutes to figure out that I first have to make a big Iteraction, and then I can put Lifelines into it. I can't figure out how to make the Participant box wider in the lifeline. Any name more than 4 characters is too wide for the box. When I do the obvious thing of clicking and dragging the handles, the box springs back to its original size. I can add a Message by clicking "Message" in the pallette and click-dragging an arrow from line Lifeline to another. Now I have an arrow labeled "1: *". I've tried every way I can think of to change that name: double-clicking on it, shift-clicking, ctrl-clicking, changing Name in the properties. Can anyone help?
