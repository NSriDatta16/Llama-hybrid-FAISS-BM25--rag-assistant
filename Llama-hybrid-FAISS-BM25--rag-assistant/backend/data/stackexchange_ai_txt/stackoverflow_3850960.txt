This doesn't sound like a classification problem. Classifiers aren't really meant to take into account "a combination of state changes." It sounds like a sequence labeling problem. Look into using a Hidden Markov Model or a Conditional Random Field. You can find an efficient implementation of the latter at http://leon.bottou.org/projects/sgd . Edit: I've read through your question in a little more detail, and I don't think and HMM is the best model given what you want to do with features. It's going to blow up your state space and could make inference intractable. You need a more expressive model. You could look at Dynamic Bayesian Networks. They generalize HMMs by allowing the state space to be represented in factored form. Kevin Murphy's dissertation is the most thorough resource for them I've come across. I'll still like CRFs though. Just as an easy place to start, define one with the time of day and each of the sensor readings as the features for each observation and use bigram feature functions. You can see how it performs and increase complexity of your features from there. I would start simple though. I think you're underestimating how difficult some of your ideas will be to implement.
