Java packages other than the standard libraries are typically named in reverse order of the domain of the vendor, e.g. Microsoft uses com.microsoft , Apache may use org.apache , etc. (See this link for details on naming conventions in Java.) This is to prevent naming conflicts. So the com is just part of the domain name, it has no special meaning to Java. There is no requirement that you name your packages that way, it's just a very good idea for any package that may remotely end up being used outside your organization.
