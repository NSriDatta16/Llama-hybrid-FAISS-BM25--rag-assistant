select * from table AS t1 inner join (select max(id) As id,nachname,vorname, count(*) from t1 group by nachname,vorname having count(*) >1) AS t2 on t1.id=t2.id This should return ALL of the columns from the table where there is duplicate nachname and vorname. I recommend changing * to the exact columns that you need. Edit: I added a max(id) so that the group by wouldn't be a problem. My query isn't as elegant as I would want though. There's probably an easier way to do it.
