Differential baseline bias vs Heterogenous treatment effect

Where it says 'Differential baseline bias only', I see both a differential baseline bias and a differential treatment effect bias. From my understanding, to have no differential treatment effect bias, $y_i^{1}$ - $y_i^{0}$ has to be the same for both the treatment group and the control group. However it is (20-10 = 10) and (20-0 = 20) in the first panel. Also please refer to the comment on the first answer by Dimitry. Stephen L. Morgan and Christopher Winship ”Counterfactuals and Causal Inference. Methods and Principles for Social Research”. Cambridge University Press.
