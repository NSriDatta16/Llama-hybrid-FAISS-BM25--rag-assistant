How many emails would I need to train a good text extraction model?

I'm looking to train a model that will identify product names in an email that a user has bought. The end result would be something very much like named entity extraction, except this should correctly label only products and not anything else. Just to make things crystal clear, these types of items would ideally be labeled as products: SAMSUNG: EVO Select 128GB MicroSDXC UHS-I U3 100MB/s Full HD & 4K UHD Memory Card with Adapter (MB-ME128HA) WAYF x BFF Hollie Long Sleeve Sweater Dress Super Mario 3D All-Stars - Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch Lite and here are some non-examples: Kansas City Chiefs (unless it was associated with jerseys a customer bought) New York, NY 10025 Python programming language I'm new to the field of NLP and would like to know how many emails I should look at to start off with to train an initial model. Also, what type of model(s) should I try out first? Any help in either of those questions would be greatly appreciated.
