Getting syntax errors when building with python 3.1 and not with python 2.6

Using Mac os X 10.6, python 3.1 and gcc 4.0 trying to build pyfsevent implemented in python2.6 by converting it to python 3.1. Wondering when getting the following errors while building in python 3.1 alone . Why not when building with python 2.6? error: syntax error before ‘CFFileDescriptorRef’ warning: no semicolon at end of struct or union error: syntax error before ‘}’ token warning: data definition has no type or storage class
