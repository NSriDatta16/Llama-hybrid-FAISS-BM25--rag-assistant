He wants the console to stay open and wait for the user to press a key. I think to remember that depending on what happens in your professors program above the "getchar()". There might still be something in the buffer, so he added a second "getchar()". Not exactly the most elegant way to solve the problem. Edit: Here is a little example. There is still a remaining "\n" in the buffer from the "scanf()" If you add a second "getchar()", you get the expected result. You have to flush the buffer before the "getchar()". #include main() { int input; scanf("%d", &input); printf("The input is %d\n", input); getchar(); return 0; } Edit 2: Here is a solution taken from here . int c; printf( "Press ENTER to continue... " ); fflush( stdout ); do c = getchar(); while ((c != '\n') && (c != EOF));
