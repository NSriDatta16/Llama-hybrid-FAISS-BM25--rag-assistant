Large Object Heap fragmentation: CLR has any solution to it?

If you application is such that it has to do lot of allocation/de-allocation of large size objects (>85000 Bytes), its eventually will cause memory fragmentation and you application will throw an Out of memory exception. Is there any solution to this problem or is it a limitation of CLR memory management?
