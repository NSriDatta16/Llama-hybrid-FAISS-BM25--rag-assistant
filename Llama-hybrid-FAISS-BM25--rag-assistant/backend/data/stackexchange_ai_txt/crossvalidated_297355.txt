While the interpretation of the AUC is something you should look up as it's widely available , in cases when you want a deeper analysis of your model, it is a wise choice to plot your ROC curve and not only calculate its area. It can give you insights on how your model is working (for example, your logistic regression model may have a sweet spot where it works well but the other thresholds perform horribly, which would bring the AUC down).
