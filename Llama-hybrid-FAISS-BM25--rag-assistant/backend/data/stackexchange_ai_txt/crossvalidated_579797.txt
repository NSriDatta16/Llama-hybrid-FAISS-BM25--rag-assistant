Your primary interest is differences between two groups defined by expression of the receptor. Each individual cell line represents the corresponding class of cell lines: those either expressing the receptor, or not. The main variance of interest is thus the variance among cell lines within each group. The answer differs somewhat depending on the nature of your "sensitivity" measures. If it's OK to average those measures over your cell lines within each group (the data meet the assumptions of ordinary least squares regression, with constant variance among cell lines within each combination of group and drug), then it's simplest to average the technical replicates for each combination of cell line and drug treatment.* There's no need to use non-parametric tests thereafter, unless you have reason to believe that the linear-model assumptions aren't met. Such measures, however, often shouldn't be simply averaged. Measures like the fraction of living cells following exposure to a drug are often better modeled with binomial statistics, for example a logistic regression. See this page and its links, among many others on this site. A mixed model, with drug and group as fixed effects and cellLine as a random effect, would directly use all the technical replicates and accommodate ordinary, logistic, or Poisson (count-based) regressions. The data setup would be one row per technical replicate, with a column representing outcome (2 columns for some binomial-regression setups) and other columns containing the group , drug , and cellLine . The general form (with the lme4 package in R) could be: model The choice of family represents the type of regression (e.g., gaussian or binomial) appropriate for the type of outcome (e.g., outcome could be a matrix of two columns representing numbers of dead and alive cells in each replicate for a binomial regression). The drug*group term gets expanded into terms for each of drug and group and a set of drug:group interaction terms that allow differences between the groups with respect to sensitivity to the drugs. The random effects term (1+drug|cellLine) allows for random intercepts (baseline sensitivities) and different sensitivities to drugs among the cell lines. See the lmer cheat sheet for details. In the question you seemed to propose multiple non-parametric tests, one for each drug, followed by multiple-comparison correction. A single model evaluating all drugs at once has advantages in combining information from all experiments together and in allowing omnibus tests of whether there are any differences at all. If you want to work more non-parametrically, a proportional-odds model (a generalization of the Kruskal-Wallis test , Mann-Whitney for 2 groups, that you considered) could put all of the data together. One final thought: it's seldom the case that a cell line has a simply binary yes/no expression of a receptor. There can be some low level of expression in "non-expressing" lines, and "expressing" cell lines can differ substantially in expression levels. You might consider using the actual receptor-expression levels of the cell lines as a predictor instead of binary grouping. *If you have different numbers of technical replicates within each cell-line/drug combination, you weight each average by the corresponding number of replicates in the regression.
