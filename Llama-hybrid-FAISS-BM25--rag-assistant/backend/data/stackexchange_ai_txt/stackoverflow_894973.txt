The automation API for Office is a COM API. You can call it from managed (.NET) code, but that just adds an extra layer and makes things considerably more complex. I've done a great deal of Office automation work using both VB/VBA and C# and while I love C# as a language, I have to say that it's much more difficult to drive Office that way. Much . (It's easy to get it to work on your machine, at least once - but don't let that fool you). The API does allow you to trap certain events such as menu selections, command bar button clicks, window activation, document open/close, etc. You can also trap the "selection changed" event which you could theoretically use to figure out what the user is doing. But, there are a lot of direct-manipulation tasks that a user can perform that you would not be able to trap (e.g. drag-and-drop, resize a picture, etc.) and for your purposes I'd say that'd be a big problem. I'd have to say I very much doubt you'd be able to do what you propose - at least, not well enough to make it seamless. And I would think that it has to be pretty bomb-proof given your user base. Sorry. :-(
