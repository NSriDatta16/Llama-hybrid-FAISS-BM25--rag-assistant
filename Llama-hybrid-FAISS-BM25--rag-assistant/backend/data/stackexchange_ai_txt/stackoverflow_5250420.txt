Adding a UINavigationController built with IB

Building an iPhone application. The delegate loads a SplashScreenView which sits there until the user taps the screen. When the user is done tapping the screen, I release that view and I want to load my custom Navigation Controller. I can't figure out how to load the Navigation Controller I designed in IB...it's currently loading a blank instance of UINavigationController. I'm running this from my delegate: mnc = [[MyNavigationController alloc] initWithNibName:@"MyNavigation" bundle:nil]; [self.window addSubview:mnc.view]; MyNavigation is a XIB I created which only has File's Owner/First Responder/a Navigation Controller I added. I set the class of File's Owner to MyNavigationController but I'm not sure how to tell it that I want the view "MyNavigationController" uses to be the one I designed. When I try to drag the "view" outlet of File's Owner in IB to my designed Navigation Controller, it doesn't seem to like it. I'm just not sure how to connect the dots here. Any help would be incredibly appreciated.
