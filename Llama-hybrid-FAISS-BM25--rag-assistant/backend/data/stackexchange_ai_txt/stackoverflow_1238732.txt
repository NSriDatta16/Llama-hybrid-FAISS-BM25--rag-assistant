This could be done using the Zend_Mail component of the Zend Framework Maybe this example, which can also be found in the documentation helps: // get the first none multipart part $part = $message; while ($part->isMultipart()) { $part = $message->getPart(1); } echo 'Type of this part is ' . strtok($part->contentType, ';') . "\n"; echo "Content:\n"; echo $part->getContent(); I don't know however how you can tell Zend Mail to read from strings, maybe there's some work required to do this, but then you'd have a full-fletched library that does what you want and some more(like reading the subject, etc.). Edit : I just had a second look at it and realized that all you have to do is write an own storage implementation(subclass Zend_Mail_Storage_Abstract) which shouldn't be so hard to do. I think that's the cleanest solution you'll get, albeit a little effort is required to make it work. If you're looking for a more quick'n'dirty kind of solution someone else might be able to help you. Hope that helps.
