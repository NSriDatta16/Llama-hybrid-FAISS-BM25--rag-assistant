Apart from the other suggestions, you may consider the virtualenv package. After writing a little setup.py file you can "virtually install" the library and avoid all the PYTHONPATH munging in general. This is a really good practice and is encouraged by the python community. Otherwise I prefer the use of sys.path method (by Rakis)
