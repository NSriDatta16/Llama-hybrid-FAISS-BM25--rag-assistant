Cross Entropy for Language modelling

im currently working on a classification task using language modelling. The first part of the project involved using n-gram language models to classify documents using c5.0. The final part of the project requires me to use cross entropy to model each class and classify test cases against these models. Does anyone have have experience in using cross entropy, or links to information about how to use a cross entropy model for sampling data? Any information at all would be great! Thanks
