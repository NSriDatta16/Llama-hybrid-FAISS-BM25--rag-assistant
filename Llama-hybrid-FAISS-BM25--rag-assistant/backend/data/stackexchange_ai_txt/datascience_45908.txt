The answer by Martin is not right. In his examples, he only shows that the deep network does not behave like a directional edge detector. In fact, his example below is a smoothed vertical derivative (probably Sobel). However, we clearly see that it behaves like a direction-agnostic edge detector, such as a Laplacian or the norm of a gradient. Also, we can see that all images look the same, with the only major differences being that some are inverted and others have an additional constant. In summary, the network behaves like an direction-agnostic edge detector. A bad edge detector, but still an edge detector. This helps explain why deep learning edge detection methods converge a lot faster and with simpler architectures than other problems such as saliency and skeleton extraction.
