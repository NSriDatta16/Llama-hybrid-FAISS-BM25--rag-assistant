extremely strange logistic regression results

I am very new to r and statistics so excuse me if the answer to my question is very obvious. I have surveyed 64 people on their Facebook behaviour related to their political participation. One of my independent variables is how many Facebook friends the people have and i divided their answers into 3 categories: 0-500= 1, 500-1000= 2 and 1000+ = 3.The independent variable is whether or not they voted, coded 0= no and 1= yes. I have been trying to run this as a logistic regression but for some reason it is not working. This is my code: #fit bivariate logistic regression model for amount of friends and voting fit3 However, i continuously get the error message that there is a warning: Warning messages: 1: glm.fit: fitted probabilities numerically 0 or 1 occurred If someone could help me out, that'd be great!
