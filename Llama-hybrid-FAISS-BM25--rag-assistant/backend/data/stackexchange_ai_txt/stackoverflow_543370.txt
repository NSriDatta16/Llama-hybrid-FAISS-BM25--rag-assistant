I think there are three possible solutions (at least!) which don't involve rolling your own or someone else's macro, depending on exactly what you are trying to do. 1 If the numbering is required throughout the document, use \paragraph , which is a lower-level sectioning command (like \chapter, \section, \subsection, etc.) See the LaTeX wikibook for more information. \setcounter{secnumdepth}{5} ... \paragraph{If we want to} do something ... (You may find this overkill/ugly, because it needs a properly nested structure of sections and subsections not to be) Note that if your using the memoir document class (which I recommend unhesitatingly), the \setcounter line becomes \maxsecnumdepth{paragraph} 2 If it's just a small piece, use a list: \begin{enumerate} \item Para No. 1 \item Para No. 2 ... \end{enumerate} 3 Or a generalized list ( \begin{list}...\end{list{} ) if you want to tweak the formatting. I haven't immediately been able to find a good online reference for this, other than the piece in A Guide to LaTeX
