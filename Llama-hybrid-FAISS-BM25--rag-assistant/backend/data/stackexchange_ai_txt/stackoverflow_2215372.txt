Visual Studio 2010 Version Control and Bug Tracking capabilities

We are considering purchasing Perforce and OnTime for SCM and Bug Tracking respectively when discovered that with Visual Studio 2010 we'll get both Source Control & Bug Tracking integrated into it and for free (if you are a MSDN subscriber). More in general, does it still worth to invest in these standalone and expensive tools? What are the benefits compared to what Visual Studio 2010 Team System has to offer? I found this document but still refers to VS2008: http://www.perforce.com/perforce/comparisons/perforce_mstfs.pdf Thanks, Alberto
