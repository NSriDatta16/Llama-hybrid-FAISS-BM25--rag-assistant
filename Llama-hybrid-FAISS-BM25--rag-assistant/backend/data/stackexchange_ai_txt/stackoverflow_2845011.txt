I would discourage you from proceeding with this design. Google is eradicating singletons from their Java code base ; maybe it's a good idea for you, too. It sounds like you're trying to do something that's been done well by Spring's ApplicationContext. You're trying to write a configurable, flexible object factory. It's been done. I'd look into dependency injection engines like Spring and Guice. Even if you decide not to use them, perhaps they can offer some design inspiration. The best you can do is return an Object and cast.
