Because this is the default (user agent css have this rule, to apply underline in every tag a). The default isn't inherit , so even if parent tag has underline, the child won't get it. EDIT 1: For example, firefox have this rule: *|*:-moz-any-link { text-decoration:underline; } Default would be: *|*:-moz-any-link { text-decoration:inherit; } Then, in your example, the tag a would inherit div text-decoration. EDIT 2: You can overwrite default behavior with: a { text-decoration: inherit; }
