There are two aspects to your question: (1) the link between the definition of $\tau_n$ and equation 2, and (2) how to compute the asymptotic variance. I won't give a formal proof, but will try to give the intuition. First, note that if the chain is initialized from the stationary distribution (or, alternatively, if you have removed warm-up/burn-in), then the $X_0$ and $X_k$ are identically distributed and you can rewrite $\tau_n$ using correlations instead of covariances: $$\tau_n=\frac12+\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}\left(1-\frac kn\right)\operatorname{Cor}[X_0,X_k]\;\;\;\text{for }n\in\mathbb N.$$ Let us assume that you have run your chain for very large $n$ , so that your chain has mixed well. For $k$ large enough, $\operatorname{Cor}[X_0,X_k]\approx 0$ (the Markov chain "forgets its past"), so you can truncate the series $$\tau_n\approx\frac12+\sum_{k=1}^{K}\left(1-\frac kn\right)\operatorname{Cor}[X_0,X_k]$$ for some $K . But for the remaining terms in the series, $\frac kn so that $$\tau_n\approx\frac12+\sum_{k=1}^{K}\operatorname{Cor}[X_0,X_k]$$ which corresponds to the truncated version of the series in equation 2. Finally, note that once the chain has reached stationarity, $\operatorname{Cor}[X_0,X_k] = \operatorname{Cor}[X_t,X_{t+k}]$ for all $t$ . You have therefore an unbiased estimator of $\operatorname{Cor}[X_0,X_k]$ : the empirical correlation between the vectors $(X_0, X_1, \ldots, X_{n-k})$ and $(X_k, X_{k+1}, \ldots, X_n)$ . For $k , the size of these vectors is large enough that the estimate will be numerically stable. The numerical computation is now easy as long as you choose $K$ appropriately. I think it is standard to choose $K \approx \arg\min_k \left\{\hat{Cor}[X_0,X_k]\leq 0\right\}$ . For instance, here is a plot from an MCMC run, obtained thanks to the R function acf ; it shows $\operatorname{Cor}[X_t,X_{t+k}]$ against $k$ . In this plot, I would truncate the sum at $K=100$ (and would usually only display the plot up to that point. In the code below, the first line draws the plot and the second computes $\tau$ . (The $-0.5$ term is because acf returns the series starting at $k=0$ instead of $k=1$ , so you need to substract $\frac12$ instead of adding it.) acf(X, lag.max=500) tau = sum(acf(X, lag.max=100, plot=F)$acf) - 0.5
