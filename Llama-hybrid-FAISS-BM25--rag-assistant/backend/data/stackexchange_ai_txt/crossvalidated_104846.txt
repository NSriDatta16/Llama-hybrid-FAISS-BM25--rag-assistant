burn in for Metropolis Hastings MCMC

I was wondering if there is a principled way to figure out how many samples to discard during the MH-MCMC burn-in stage. So, as I understand it, the initial samples can introduce bias in the computation of expectation in the estimated posterior distribution especially if they are really far from the mean. I was wondering, say I do a MAP estimation and try to find some local mode of the distribution to initialise my MH-MCMC. Would that mean I do not have to do the burn in (assuming this mode is in some high density region of the distribution)?
