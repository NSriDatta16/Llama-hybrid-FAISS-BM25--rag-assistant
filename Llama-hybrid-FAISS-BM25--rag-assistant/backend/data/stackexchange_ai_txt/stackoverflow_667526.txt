Logger configs are a waste of time. Why have them if it means learning a new syntax, especially one that fails silently? Don't get me wrong, I love good logging. I love logger inheritance and adding formatters to handlers to loggers. But why do it in a config file? Do you want to make changes to logging code without recompiling? Why? If you put your logging code in a separate class, file, whatever, what difference will it make? Do you want to distribute a configurable log with your product to clients? Doesn't this just give too much information anyway? The most frustrating thing about it is that popular utilities written in a popular language tend to write good APIs in the format that language specifies. Write a Java logging utility and I know you've generated the javadocs, which I know how to navigate. Write a domain specific language for your logger config and what do we have? Maybe there's documentation, but where the heck is it? You decide on a way to organize it, and I'm just not interested in following your line of thought.
