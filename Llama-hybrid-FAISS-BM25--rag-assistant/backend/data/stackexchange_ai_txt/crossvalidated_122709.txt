Prediction interval in nnetar forecast

I'm trying to use the forecast package version 5.6 for doing forecasts with "nnetar" function, so I noticed that there's no prediction intervals for forecasting points by this function, eg.: 95% LS and LI. Does someone could help me about how to compute confidence intervals for forecasts based on "nnetar"? Note: I have used ets and auto.arima functions to perform linear univariate time series forecasts, but in some situations I have also some non-linear time series and I'd like to use neural nets as an optional tool.
