How to determine an appropriate "closeness" threshold when matching for causal inference?

Say I have a [yes/no] treatment variable (e.g. the customer complained about their order) and I want to estimate the causal impact of this "treatment" on the average customer's future spend. To do so, I match tens of thousands of observations in such a way as to minimize their Mahalanobis distance as calculated across a dozen covariates. To estimate the average treatment effect, I prepare a difference-of-means t-test, but before I implement this test across the "treated" and "control" groups, I need to prune my observations of pairs that are insufficiently similar to serve as an effective control -i.e. I need to make a judgement call on the maximum distance a pair of observations can have before being dropped. It goes without saying, the results of the t-test vary drastically as a function of this threshold. How do I rigorously determine an appropriate "closeness" threshold in the context of causal inference matching?
