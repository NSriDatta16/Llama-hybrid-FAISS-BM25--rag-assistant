There is a HTTP response header that makes a HTTP user agent download a file instead of trying to display it: Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=paper.doc I understand that you may not have access to the server, but this is one straight-forward way to do this if you can access the server scripts. See the HTTP/1.1 specification and/or say, Google, for more details on the header.
