Put as much of the common stuff together in a single function. Once you've factored as much out as possible, build a mechanism for branching to the appropriate function for each website. One possible way to do this is with python's if/else clauses, but if you have many such functions, you may want something more elegant such as F = __import__('yourproject.facebookmodule') This lets you put the code that's specific for facebook in it's own area. Since you pass __import__() a string, you can modify that at runtime based on which site you're accessing, and then just call function F in your generic worker code.
