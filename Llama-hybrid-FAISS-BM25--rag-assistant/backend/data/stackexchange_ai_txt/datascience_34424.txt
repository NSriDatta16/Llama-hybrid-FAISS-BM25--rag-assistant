Size of training data is different

I am making a simple machine learning model for predicting the stock closing rate, but while splitting the test and train data the length changes. My code: X_train,y_train,X_test,y_test = cross_validation.train_test_split(X,y,test_size=0.4) print(len(X_train)) print(len(X_test)) print(len(y_train)) print(len(y_test)) The output is: 3010 3010 2007 2007 Why is the length is changing for X and y and because of the same reason I am not able to fit it to the classifier?
