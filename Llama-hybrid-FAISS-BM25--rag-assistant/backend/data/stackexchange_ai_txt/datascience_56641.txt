First of all, it's a bit vague what's your output dimension. Is it the forecast of a single step (j-timestep ahead) or a vector of multi-steps? Question1: I guess time should be similar to vanilla LSTM, which is the i in your case (I need to refer other work to confirm this). Main question: I think this is similar to the question of how to solve regression by CNN (as your output of the ConvLSTM2D is 3- or 4-d data). You can either pass the output to a stacked LSTM, or to CNN-pooling and flattened to dense layers.
