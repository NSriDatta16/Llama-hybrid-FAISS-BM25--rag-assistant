The two tests (logistic regression and chi-square) are equivalent and a power analysis should give the same answer. You are assuming that a value of 0.15 for f2 and w are the same effect size, they're not. A small value of w is 0.1, a small value of f2 is 0.02. cohen.ES(test=c("chisq"), size=c("small")) cohen.ES(test=c("f2"), size=c("small")) Edit: Elaborated on the similarity of the two approaches. IF you give the same data to logistic regression and a chi-square test (strictly: without Yates' correction), you get the same result. Here's an example > set.seed(1234) > x y chisq.test(table(x, y), correct=FALSE) Pearson's Chi-squared test #' data: table(x, y) X-squared = 0.155, df = 1, p-value = **0.694** Warning message: In chisq.test(table(x, y), correct = FALSE) : Chi-squared approximation may be incorrect > summary(glm(y ~ x, family="binomial")) Call: glm(formula = y ~ x, family = "binomial") Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -0.753 -0.753 -0.753 -0.668 1.794 Coefficients: Estimate Std.

I can't remember the formulas for the two different versions of the effect size. Effect size measures are a little weird because in the old days you wanted to minimize the number of tables that you put into books (so we have, for example, $f^2$ instead of $R^2$, when there's a direct relationship between them, and $R^2$ is what everyone understands).
