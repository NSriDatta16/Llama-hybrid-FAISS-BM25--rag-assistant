Given the Gaussian distribution of the error terms $\varepsilon$ and $\zeta$ , this is a Kalman filtering problem. See my answer here for a worked-out example. Generally speaking, $\rho$ and both $\sigma$ terms can be estimated by maximum likelihood even if we only observe $y$ . The intuition of how it works is that once we imposed the structure of the two equations for $\nu$ and $y$ (so called state space representation) in addition to the Guassianity of errors, we can iteratively construct the likelihood. That is, given what we know in period $t$ , the distribution for the realization of $y_{t+1}$ and $\nu_{t+1}$ is Gaussian with a particular, time-dependent, mean and variance. We can construct the whole likelihood this way and then search for $\rho$ and $\sigma$ s that maximize it. For an illustration, let's consider an example from this this book. # this based on the codes acompanying # Time Series Analysis and Its Applications, Ed 4 # by Shumway & Stoffer # https://github.com/nickpoison/tsa4/blob/master/chap6.md library("astsa") set.seed(5) # ground truth rho_true $par[1]) sigma_eps par[2]) sigma_zeta
