Or a slightly different take: Write a setter for icao that converts anything thrown at it to uppercase: def icao=(val) self[:icao] = val.upcase end And then you can use regular uniqueness validation ( back it up with a unique index in your DB ). Might even make things a little easier for the DB during finds, 'cause it doesn't have to worry about case-insensitive comparisons any more. Hope this helps!
