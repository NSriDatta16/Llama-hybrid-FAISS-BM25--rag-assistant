Instead of focusing so much on decision tree classifiers, consider looking at Leo Breiman's Random Forests classifier. Once you understand the elegance of this approach (bootstrapping to train trees, dropping test samples down trained trees for testing, shuffling feature values in trained trees to obtain importance scores, etc.), you will not likely care so much about binary vs ternary straightforward decision tree classifiers, CART, etc. The potential for overfitting is also lower with RF.
