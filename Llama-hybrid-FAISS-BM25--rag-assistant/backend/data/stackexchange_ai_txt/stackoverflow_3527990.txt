Using Bryan's and Mark's answer as a basis you could write your own context-processor: http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.2/ref/templates/api/#writing-your-own-context-processors Doing so would allow you to conditionally serve using if statements in your templates. Probably the most elegant, as you can still use the wrapper as needed. You could combine this with your own template tag, which provides you with extend functionality, but conditional based on a provided variable. (Not sure if you can replicate extends functionality). http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.2/howto/custom-template-tags/#writing-custom-template-tags The other option is to use django's {% include %} tag, and you can wrap that using if statements.
