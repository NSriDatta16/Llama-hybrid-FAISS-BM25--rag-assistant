Non-mathematical Description of Neural Networks

I am not a mathematician. I enjoy a good math puzzle, but I admit my weaknesses whole heartedly. That said, I've always had an interest in Neural Networks, and while I understand them enough to implement them from scratch, I hit a wall when I need to understand any concept that I can only find mathematic proofs for. Where is the programmer's guide to neural networks, using code instead of formula to explain the practical reasonings?
