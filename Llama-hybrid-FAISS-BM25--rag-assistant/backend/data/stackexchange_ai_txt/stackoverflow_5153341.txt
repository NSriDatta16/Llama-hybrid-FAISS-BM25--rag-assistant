Yes - the call to encodeHex() returns a char array ( char[] ) and you're just calling toString on that. Use the String(char[]) constructor instead: new String(Hex.encodeHex("10".getBytes())) (I would strongly encourage you not to use the parameterless String.getBytes() method, by the way, which uses the platform default encoding. It's a constant source of subtle errors.)
