What is important is the extra effect for levels (other that the base level), which are the same for gamlss and mccv, as seen by the fitted parameter effects. Again in the term plot, the difference between a level effect and the base level) is what is important, and is the same in the gamlss and mccv plots. The gamlss term.plot() is centred at 0 vertically at a weighted average of the level effects (rather that the base level).
