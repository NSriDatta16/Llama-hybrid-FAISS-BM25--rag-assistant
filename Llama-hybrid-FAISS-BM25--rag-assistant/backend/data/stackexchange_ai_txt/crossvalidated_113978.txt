regression analysis for dataset with few predictors and few samples

I have a small pilot dataset containing experimental measurements for 12 samples, 4 numeric predictors and 1 numeric outcome variable. The goal is to obtain a first rough estimate on the extent to which the outcome variable can be predicted using one or more of the 4 predictors, before deciding on whether it's worthwile to collect more data. With the lm-function in R, I obtain a linear fit with p Would it make sense to apply any other modelling techniques to obtain more confidence that the data has significant predictive information content (non-linear approaches will most likely lead to over-fitting on such a small dataset, but maybe other linear models, e.g. ridge regression, linear SVM, could still be informative) - or is this not worhtwile due to the worsening of the multiple testing problem? Many thanks for your suggestions.
