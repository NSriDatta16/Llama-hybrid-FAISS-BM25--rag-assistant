If A is correlated with B, then there are more than the three possibilities: A causes B, B causes A, and A and B have a common cause. There are other causal structures that could lead to A and B being correlated! Therefore, you may not even be able to find a common cause C. I think you just say that you don't have enough evidence to conclude that A causes B despite their correlation. Rather than claiming there is a common cause, you can suggest that there may be confounders . Here's Pearl's description: Whenever we undertake to evaluate the effect of one factor (X) on another (Y), the question arises as to whether we should adjust our measurements for possible variations in some other factors (Z), otherwise known as "covariates," "concomitants," or "confounders" (Cox 1958, p. 48). Adjustment amounts to partitioning the population into groups that are homogeneous relative to Z, assessing the effect of X on Y in each homogeneous group, and then averaging the results (as in (3.13)). The illusive nature of such adjustment was recognized as early as 1899, when Karl Pearson discovered what is now called Simpson's paradox (see Section 6.1): Any statistical relationship between two variables may be reversed by including additional factors in the analysis. For example, we may find that students who smoke obtain higher grades than those who do not smoke but, adjusting for age, smokers obtain lower grades in every age group and, further adjusting for family income, smokers again obtain higher grades than nonsmokers in every income-age group, and so on. In plain English, I would start with Pearl's smoking example as an introduction to how critical it is to know which variables to adjust for. Then just say that you think you're missing at least one variable C, which could eliminate the apparent causal relationship between A and B.
