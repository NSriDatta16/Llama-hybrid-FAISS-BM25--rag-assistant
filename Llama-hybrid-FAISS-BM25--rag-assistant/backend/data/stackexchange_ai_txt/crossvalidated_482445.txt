Is double machine learning doubly robust? If so, how?

Is double/debiased machine learning doubly robust to endogeneity? I have heard about using double/debiased machine learning for causal inference (Chernozhukov, et al 2016) , and even played around with it as implemented in EconML . I have been told that double/debiased machine learning is doubly robust to endogeneity. My understanding of doubly robust is that an estimator is doubly robust if it concurrently models (1.) the relationships between the covariates and the outcome and uses those relationships to predict the missing values, and (2.) models the probabilities of missingness given the covariates and incorporates them into a weighted or stratified estimate (Kang and Schafer, 2007). If either one of these two models is correctly specified, then the model will output the correct parameter estimates. Does double/debiased machine learning have this very attractive property? If so, can anyone explain why, or refer me to some materials that might clarify why? Thanks!
