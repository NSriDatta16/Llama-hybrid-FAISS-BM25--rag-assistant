You could always set the list (or the whole window the list is contained in) to collapsed in it's initial state, and then un-collapse it when you get word back from your data retrieval thread that it is done. I have done that with a couple of my other programs and it works pretty well. User executes the program, splash screen displays, and main window loads collapsed. Data retrieval thread executes, gets data, reports it is finished. Splash screen disappears, main window displays and list is populated.
