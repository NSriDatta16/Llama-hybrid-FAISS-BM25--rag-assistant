Online Estimation of a Joint Distribution from batches of data

I want to implement an algorithm for the online estimation of a joint probability distribution from a sequence of mini batches sampled from the real distribution. The distribution is discrete and non parametric. I need to keep updated my estimation by embedding the information from the batches and gradually approximate the real distribution if possible. What I was thinking about was a sort of EMA: $P(x,y)_{t+1} = \alpha \cdot P(x,y)_t + (1-\alpha) P(x,y)_{B}$ where $P(x,y)_{B}$ is estimated from the current sample batch. Is it a good idea? I hope I was able to explain clearly my problem, in any case I remain available for further explanations. Thank you in advance!
