What is a time series A time series is a series of data points indexed (or listed or graphed) in time order. Most commonly, a time series is a sequence taken at successive equally spaced points in time. Thus it is a sequence of discrete-time data. Examples of time series are heights of ocean tides, counts of sunspots, and the daily closing value of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Time series analysis Time series analysis has two main objectives: Obtain an understanding of the underlying forces and structure that produced the observed data Fit a model and proceed to forecasting, monitoring or even feedback and feedforward control. This is the first step on the topic you are looking for.
