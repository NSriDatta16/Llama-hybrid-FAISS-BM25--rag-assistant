Inference from text data without label or Target

I have a use case where I have text data entered by an approver while approving some loans. I have to make some inferences as to what could be the reasons for approval using NLP. How should I go about it? It's a Non-English language. Can Clustering of text help?? Is it possible to cluster TEXT OF non-English language using python libraries?
