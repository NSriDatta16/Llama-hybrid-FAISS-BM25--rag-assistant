What is the best way to estimate an error on stacked data?

I have 400 pixel maps (which are different realisations of the same underlying system) which, individually, don't show much. If I stack them, however, I get a statistical signal; the maps tend to have slightly lower values in the centre of the map, so a stack will show this dip quite clearly. I evaluate the map by dividing it into 10 linear radial bins starting from the centre, within which I calculate the mean of the pixel values. I want to estimate an "error" on this stacked map. My method of choice to do so is "delete 1 jackknife resampling", but I am a bit confused how to interpret the variances I get. What I have done so far is to stack 399 maps, always leaving out a different map, so that we get 400 slightly different stacked maps. I then draw a radial profile on all 400 of these maps, so I get a distribution of 400 mean values for each bin; for simplicity, let's only consider the mean values of the first bin for now, which I call $\mu_{i}^{1}$ . Calculating the average value of those is then straightforward as $\bar{\mu^{1}} = 1/N \sum_{i=1}^N \mu_{i}^{1}$ , but I saw different definitions of the variance and the difference is not clear to me. $\text{var} (\theta_{\text{jack}}) = \frac{N-1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (\theta_{(i)} - \theta_{(.)})^2$ is one version , where we can identify $\theta_{(i)}$ with $\mu_{i}^{1}$ , and $\theta_{(.)}$ with $\bar{\mu^{1}}$ . Another version lists the same equation, but with a factor of $\frac{1}{N-1}$ in front instead. I don't really understand where this difference comes from and how the interpretation differs between them. Generally speaking, the latter definition (obviously) produces far lower estimates for the error. If I plot a "total" radial profile this way, taking the $\bar{\mu^{(i)}}$ as the datapoints and the square root of either of these two definitions of the variance as the errorbars, the latter, smaller errorbars look very "small" compared to the differences between the individual $\bar{\mu^{(i)}}$ , which is why I (and the people I am working with) are taking issue with it, however, I still have not found a satisfying answer as to why the definition is not appropriate. The major question, then: is the current approach sensible for the stated goal, and which of the two variances is more appropriate as an estimate for the "error" of the total stacked map? Also, what is the difference if I first draw the radial profiles and then use jackknife on them, i.e. I create 400 radial profiles on the individual maps, and then use a jackknife resampling approach on those profiles? Is that even sensible?
