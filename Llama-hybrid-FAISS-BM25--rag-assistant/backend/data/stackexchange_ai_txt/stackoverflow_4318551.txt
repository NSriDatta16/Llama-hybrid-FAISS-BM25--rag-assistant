Creating custom *.domain.com domains for sign-ups

I am curious as to how, for example Beanstalk and Server Density, create custom domains (e.g. custom.beanstalkapp.com, custom.serverdensity.com) for each sign-up. I would like to do something similar so that clients and their staff access the web-app at their own sub-domain. Each app either uses LDAP or our own native user storage depending on client choice and would share a common API. Does each custom domain share the same web app code base? Taking this further what if I wanted to allow a completely custom domain as you can get with bit.ly pro. I'd imagine in this case the customer would point the A record for their domain to our web servers and then we would have to programatically edit our Apache configuration to add a new virtual host for that domain? In this application the API is written in Java (using Restlet) with the front-end written in GWT. The data layer is built in MongoDB.
