It is well known that building a model based on what is significant (or some other criterion such as AIC, whether a credible interval contains 0 etc.) is pretty problematic, particularly if you then do inference as if you had not done model building. Doing a Bayesian analysis does not change that (see also https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/201931/86652 ). I.e. you should not do variable selection, but rather model averaging (or something that could get you some zero coefficients, but reflects the whole modelling process, such as LASSO or elastic net). Bayesian model choice is more typically framed as Bayesian model averaging. You have different models, each with a different prior probability. If the posterior model probability for a model becomes low enough, you are essentially entirely discarding the model. For equal prior weights for each model and flat priors, model averaging with weights proportional to $\exp(-\text{BIC}/2)$ for each model approximates this. You can alternatively express the model averaging as a prior that is a mixture between a point mass (the weight of the point mass is the prior probability of the effect being exactly zero = the effect is not in the model) and a continuous distribution (e.g. spike-and-slab priors). MCMC sampling can be quite difficult for such a prior. Carvalho et al. motivate the horseshoe shrinkage prior by suggesting that it works like a continuous approximation to a spike-and-slab prior. It is also a case of embedding the problem in a hierarchical model, where to some extent the size and presence of effects on some variables relax the required evidence for others a bit (through the global shrinkage parameter, this is a bit like false-discovery rate control) and on the other hand allow individual effects to stand on their own if the evidence is clear enough. There is a convenient implementation of it available from the brms R package that builds on Stan/ rstan . There are a number of further similar priors such as the horseshoe+ prior and the whole topic is an area of ongoing research.
