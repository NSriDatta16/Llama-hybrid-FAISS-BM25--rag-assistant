Most games have high performance requirements, where loading times are predictible and it is possible to have fine grained controlled over when and how data is loaded. Unfortunately that is not what a general storage engine like sql database offers, so most games use their own storage in binary files. Any ways, if you want to learn programming focusing on one thing at a time is probably best in the beginning so my suggestion is to keep focused on C# and when you feel you can do at least basic things there, you can broaden your perspective.
