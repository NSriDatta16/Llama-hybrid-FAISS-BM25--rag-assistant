Don't bother. First rule of programming- which also applies to data science: get everything working on a small test problem. so take a random sample of your data of say 100,000 rows. try different algorithms etc. once you have got everything working to your satisfaction, you can try larger (and larger) data sets - and see how the test error reduces as you add more data. furthermore you do not want to apply svd to only 8 columns: you apply it when you have a lot of columns.
