Network version of central limit theorem?

Is there a version of the central limit theorem for random variables that are connected through a network? More precisely, imagine I have $N$ vertices in a graph, and a random variable $X_{i}$ for every $i \in \{1,...,N\}$ . The random variable is given by $$X_i = \sum_{j=1}^{N} \alpha_{ij} X_j + \epsilon_i$$ where $\epsilon_i$ are i.i.d with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$ $\alpha_{ij} \geq 0$ for all $i,j$ $\lim_{N \to \infty} \max_{j \leq N} \sum_{i=1}^N \alpha_{ij} $\lim_{N \to \infty} \max_{i \leq N} \sum_{j=1}^{N} \alpha_{ij} I know from the above assumptions that $L = (I-\alpha)^{-1}$ exists, that $X = L \epsilon$ , and that $\mu_i =_{def} \mathbb{E}[X_i]= \sum_{j=1}^N L_{ij} \mu$ and $\sigma_i^2 =_{def} Var(X_i) = \sum_{j=1}^N L_{ij}^2 \sigma^2$ . However, the variables $X_1,...,X_N$ are correlated, so the standard central limit does not apply. Is there an assumption under which we can prove something of the form $$\lim_{N \to \infty} \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \sum_{j=1}^N (X_j - \mu_j) = N(0,J) $$ for some $J$ ? I'm aware this can be done for time series (e.g. $\alpha_{ij} = \rho for $j = i-1$ , $\alpha_{ij} = 0$ for all other cases), but I'm wondering if it can be done for network defined random variables, where $X_i$ may depend on $X_{i+1},X_{i+2},...$ .
