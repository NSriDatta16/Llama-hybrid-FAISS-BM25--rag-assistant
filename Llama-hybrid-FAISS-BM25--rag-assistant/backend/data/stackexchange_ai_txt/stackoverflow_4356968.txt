UI Tab Bar and Navigation Bar to Detail View

I am having a lot of trouble right now getting my navigaton bar to work properly. The following is my hierachy. TabBarController -- NavigationController -- View -- Navigation Controller -- View -- Navigation Controller -- View I have a abstract class that I inherit from for every tab bar view. This abstract class is set as a NavigationBar delegate and has a navigationbar iboutlet. In one of my views I have setup a table view and when someone selects the table view I want it to go to a more detailed view. The following is the code I am using to do that. When I setup the xib, I dragged a NavigationBar onto the view and then set the ViewController of "VisitedPlace" as the delegate for the navigation bar. // Called when a row in the table view has been selected. // This method will change the view to the current place detailed view - (void) tableView:(UITableView *) tableView didSelectRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *) indexPath { NSLog(@"We are here, and proud of it I suppose~"); PlaceViewController *placeView = [[PlaceViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@"PlaceView" bundle:[NSBundle mainBundle]]; [self.navigationController pushViewController:placeView animated:YES]; [placeView release]; placeView = nil; } When I select the row the log message is printed, but nothing occurs. I'm very lost at the moment, I must be missing some crucial. I was reading about a NavigationController and how I have to implement it, but to be completely honest I have no idea how to do that. EDIT: When I NSLog'd self.navigationController it was nil so I dragged a NavigatonController and set the Delegate as the File Owner of VisitedPlaces. However, the nav controller is still nil. Any help would be greatly appreciated!!
