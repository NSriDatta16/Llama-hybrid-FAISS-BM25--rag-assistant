You may actually want a really low value of mTry. Setting this equal to a high value or #vars means that you are evaluating every variable as a potential splitter at each node and will result in more deterministic behavior like you are seeing because the best splitter will always be chosen. This phenomena is known as "masking" with regards to importance scores. A lower value of mTry will randomize things more and increase the diversity of the trees. Another way to increase the randomness would be to decrease the number of samples bagged for each tree. (Note: some implementations use an algorithm that insists on examining at least one non constant variable per node even if they have to examine more then mtry features. This usually increases accuracy but makes them less sensitive to choice of mTry and can result in more deterministic trees. I'm considering making it optional in my implementation. ) Some work on variable importance including this paper "Understanding variable importances in forests of randomized trees" has suggested that more randomization is good going so fat as to use Extra-Trees. As the splits and splitter become more randomized you would need to incorporate impurity decrease in such an analysis. The first few trees being the only unique ones sounds like a bug unless the trees are somehow sorted. It is quite possible that there are only a few different trees but the growth of each tree should be independent. I've done a bit of this sort of analysis and found it useful and interesting in highly dimensional datasets. I'm not sure I would call the results interactions as the two variables could conceivably be entirely independent except in how they relate to the target variable. I'm no sure if there is a terminology widely used in the literature but I think of the downstream variable as having increased local importance on that side of the split (and likely decreased importance on the other). We also often run random forests to predict every variable in the data set and use importance scores to pick up on non linear relationships between variables not related to a specific target.
