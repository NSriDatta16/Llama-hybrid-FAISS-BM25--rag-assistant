The main problem with your interpretation is that you cannot transform an odds ratio into a probability change. You can make no claim about how the probability changes simply by transforming the odds ratio. You can change an odds into a probability, but the coefficients (other than the intercept) correspond not to odds but to odds ratios (when exponentiated). Here is how I would change your interpretation: The difference in the log odds of penetration between having a unilobular nodule (left) and having no nodule is 0.7169, holding other variables constant. If we exponentiate this we get exp(0.7169) 1 2.049 and it is the odds ratio of penetration for the unilobular nodule (left) compared to no nodule - i.e. the odds of penetration for the unilobular nodule (left) is 104.9 % higher than the odds of penetration in the capsule for no nodule if the rest remains constant. (Equivalently, the odds of penetration for those with unilobular nodule (left) is 2.049 times that for those with no nodule, holding the other variables constant). Every 1 unit increase in Gleason score is associated with a 0.9273380 increase in log-odds of penetration holding the other variables constant. If we exponentiate this: exp(0.927338) 1 2.528 Thus, each one-unit increase in the Gleason score is associated with a 152.8% increase in the odds of penetration into the capsule, with the other variables remaining constant. There are procedures for estimating changes in probability rather than odds ratios, but they are fairly complicated and cannot be done simply by reading coefficients from a logistic regression. Note that logistic regression is not the only appropriate model for binary outcomes, and other models may give similar predictive ability with more interpretable coefficients. See Huang (2019) for an example.
