Exclude time and re-run it. For each eigenvector that you're using to build the factors, plot it to get a better sense of what they mean. There is a significant literature on a PCA of bond yields (rather than bond returns since bond returns are driven by yield curve dynamics), which normally describes the first component as corresponding to the interest rate level, the second corresponding to a shift in the slope of the yield curve, and the third corresponding to a twist in the yield curve. My guess is that the factors constructed from the returns correspond to the impact on bond returns from those changes.
