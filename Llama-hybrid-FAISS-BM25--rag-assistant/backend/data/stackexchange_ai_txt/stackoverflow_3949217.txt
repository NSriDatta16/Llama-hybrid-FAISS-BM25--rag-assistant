Time complexity of Hash table

I am confused about the time complexity of hash table many articles state that they are "amortized O(1)" not true order O(1) what does this mean in real applications. What is the average time complexity of the operations in a hash table, in actual implementation not in theory, and why are the operations not true O(1)?
