jQuery Controlling Single DIVs With the Same Class (Siblings?)

I am building a FAQ module for my site and I want to be able to control single elements on the page even though they all have the same class. I believe this comes under siblings which I am not yet familiar with. Basically I want the user to be able to click the question div and then when they click it the answer div within the same div as the question div is set to show (if that makes sense!). Any help would be greatly appreciated. What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow? Although a definitive answer would of course require further measurements, published species-wide averages of wing length and body mass, initial Strouhal estimates based on those averages and cross-species comparisons, the Lund wind tunnel study of birds flying at a range of speeds, and revised Strouhal numbers based on that study all lead me to estimate that the average cruising airspeed velocity of an unladen European Swallow is roughly 11 meters per second, or 24 miles an hour.
