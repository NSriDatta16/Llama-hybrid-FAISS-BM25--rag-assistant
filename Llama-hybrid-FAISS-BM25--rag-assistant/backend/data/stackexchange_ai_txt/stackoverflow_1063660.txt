Need to have spacing between end of div and beginning of paragraph

I have text within a paragraph tag that that fits snug on the bottom of a div, which you will see in this picture: http://i44.tinypic.com/e05s0z.png I could put some padding at the bottom of the div to fix this, but there might be multiple divs, depending on how many items are on that page. What I need to do, is put some spacing between the end of the very last div (class="article") and the text within the paragraph tag. Here is the css for the article class .article { padding:10px; overflow:auto; } Text w/i the paragraph tag Herkimer County Community College does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, sex, national origin, age, handicap, or marital status in admission, employment, or in any aspect regarding the conduct of College business. What should I do?
