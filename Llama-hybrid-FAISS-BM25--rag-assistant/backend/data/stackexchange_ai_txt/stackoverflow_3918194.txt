You can use FlowLayoutPanel.SetChildIndex() to reorder controls within it through code. Or, you can use some drag/drop reordering for an itemscontrol, and change the template to use a flowlayoutpanel for the items. Here's a related question on SO that does the same thing for a wrappanel, but would probably easily work for a flow panel: WPF : Reorder WrapPanel content via drag and drop?
