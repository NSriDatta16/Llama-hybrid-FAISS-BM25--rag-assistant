Comments: Why do you use vectors for red , blue and green ? Because using push_back can perform reallocations, and bottleneck processing. You could instead allocate just once three arrays of 10 colors. Couldn't you declare rgb outside of the loops in order to relieve stack of unnecessary constructions and destructions? Doesn't Magick++ have a way to average images?
