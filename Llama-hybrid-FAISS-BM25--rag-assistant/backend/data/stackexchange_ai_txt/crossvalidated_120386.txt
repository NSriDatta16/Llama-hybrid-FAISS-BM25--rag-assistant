After reviewing this paper Peugh, J. L. (2010). A practical guide to multilevel modeling. Journal of School Psychology. Retrieved from http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022440509000545 A potential answer for this question can be obtained by calculating the ICC and design effect (DE), which can be used to quantify the amount of between group variation and need the for using multilevel modeling. ICC is defined as: level 2 variance/(level 2 variance + level 1 variance) DE is defined as: 1 + (Average number of individuals in each group - 1) x ICC. So for the reduced models I presented in my question this would be fm1 Calculating the ICC indicates that 49% of response variables variance occurred between individuals. > 42.60/(42.60 + 43.34) [1] 0.4956947 For the DE, the paper above indicates that a DE greater then 2 indicates the need to use a multilevel model, however for the model above the DE is 1.37, so a multilevel model may not be needed for this data. > 1+((407/233)-1)*(42.60/(42.60 + 43.34)) [1] 1.370175
