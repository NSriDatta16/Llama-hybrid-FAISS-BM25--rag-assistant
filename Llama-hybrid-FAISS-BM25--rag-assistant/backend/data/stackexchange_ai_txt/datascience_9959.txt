Autoencoders for feature creation

When using an auto encoder to create non-linear dimensional reduced featires, is it more common to use the output of the network (the prediction of the input features) or to use the weights from the (or 1 of the if there are multiple) hidden layers? If the hidden layer is used, do you use the hidden layer activation as features or weights from the hidden layer to the output?
