Average number of random permutations of a sequence, before seeing a sorted sequence

Suppose you have a sequence of N numbers. You check the sequence and see if it's sorted in ascending order . If not, you shuffle it (i.e., randomly permute the order of its elements) and check again. How many checks do you need to perform, in average, before seeing a sorted sequence? I believe the answer is N!, and (I think) I have a proof, but I would like to see how you would go around proving it, because I don't think my proof is the most elegant/straightforward.
