Online Tree Based Algorithms

Linear regression and logistic regression can do online training(i.e. continuous training as new data arrives) via stochastic gradient descent. Are there any tree based algorithms which can efficiently do online training? The problem with linear regression and logistic regression is both create only linear models and are poor at handling non-linear data.
