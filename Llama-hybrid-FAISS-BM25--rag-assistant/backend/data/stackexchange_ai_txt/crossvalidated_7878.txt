So, if I understand correctly, you are trying to arrive at a weighting scheme that maximizes the amount of total conversions. I am assuming that you are going to reset the conversion values for each heading after each weight change. A simple solution then could be something like this: (I'm not familiar with your syntax so hopefully you understand this pseudocode) heading1: {ConvPView = conversions / views} heading2: {ConvPView = conversions / views} heading3: {ConvPView = conversions / views} heading4: {ConvPView = conversions / views} AvgeConvPView = (h1.cpv + h2.cpv +h3.cpv +h4.cpv) / 4 heading1: {weight = weight + ((ConvPView - AvgeConvPView) * weightChangeConstant)} heading2: {etc..} So, basically, you take a heading's conversions-per-view (conversions / views) and then subtract the average conversions-per-view for all headings. Then you multiply that by a weight-change constant and add the result to the previous weight. Or, in brief: Weight = weight + (((conversions / views) - (mean of (conversions / views)) * constant) This will give a negative number if bellow avg and a positive number if above. A larger constant will give you faster modification of weights but will also be more volatile and less able to settle on an optimal weighting distribution.
