There's a good, if old, book called "Constructing Language Processors for Little Languages" that could get you started. It's very pragmatic and explains the various options that you have as your needs become more complex. Beyond that, you're going to essentially want to research a book or two on compilers and interpreters. If you want a path of lower resistance, and you're doing this to understand concepts rather than something you need for a class or work projects, look at an alternative to C, such as Lisp or Scheme, that will make it easier to build on small experiments. Or learn about building DSLs in languages that make that easier (Boo, Groovy).
