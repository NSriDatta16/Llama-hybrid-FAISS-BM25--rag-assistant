I use Linq2sql for calling my stored procedures as well just because its so fast to generate .net code I can call from my app, its just drag and drop, basically done in seconds. Still I think you need to ask yourself how much time you spend maintaing those stored procedures. If you do you would save a lot of time using linq2sql doing your crud calls. I use sprocs only when doing multiple step operations on the database.
