SMS is a telco service, not an Internet service. That comes with some different rules. For starters, many endpoints are billed/billable, and have contracts with a single service provider. This will include all of your use cases. Secondly, billing is a contract matter both on the sending and the receiving side. You simply cannot state as a sender that "Host pays", unless you restrict yourself to sending SMS to specific countries. USA is the most famous exception. "Receiver pays" is even worse. Due to SMS spam, telco's will usually allow this kind of traffic only when you have a contract with them. Third-party SMS operators can deal with many of these problems. It's very easy for them to be more service-oriented than the average telco. They might even be able to deliver international SMS for you. SMS tends to buffer in the network itself, not necessarily the email gateway. In individual cases, the difference is probably invisible to you. But you would still have delays even if you had a direct SS7 link to the telco. Real telco's have test gateways, but the terms of use for those I can't give you. The idea though is definitely to be able to test you app at lower costs. SMS uses its own alphabet, a rather nasty multi-septet encoding (7/14/21 bits!) The quoted 160 character limit comes from a 140 byte payload. This could also be coded as 70 UTF-16 characters.
