There's an open source mutation-testing tool called Jester that changes the lines of your source code, then runs your tests, and reports whether your tests passed anyway. Sounds closer to what you're looking for than code coverage tools. Jester is a test tester for testing your java JUnit tests (Pester is for Python PyUnit tests). It modifies your source code, runs the tests and reports if the tests pass despite the changes to the code. This can indicate missing tests or redundant code. WRT the discussion about whether these tools are needed in a pure TDD project, there is a link on the Jester project webpage to a posting about the benefits of using Jester on code written during a TDD session (Uncle Bob's infamous bowling TDD example).
