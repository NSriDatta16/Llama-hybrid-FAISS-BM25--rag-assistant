Typically you'd bind your popup button to an array controller that contains custom model objects (through the content binding), and use the content values binding to specify a keypath on those object with the string you want to use as the title. From what I understand, you have an array of plain strings you want to use as the data source, only you want to display a different string for the title, right? I'm not sure why making a data transformer wouldn't work if set up like the above-- or maybe I'm misunderstanding something? You'd have one binding to the actual string, and another binding to the string using a transformer, but both of them would be using the same array controller. Your other options are creating a model class to wrap around the strings and provide a title property, or creating a category on NSString that returns your title to use as the display value binding. In all of these cases you can create your own NSFormatter in code and use it to return the correct string title.
