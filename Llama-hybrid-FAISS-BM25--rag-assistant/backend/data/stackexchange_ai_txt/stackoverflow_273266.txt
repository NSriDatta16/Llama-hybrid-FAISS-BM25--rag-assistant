The pros: You can claim it's a domain model and brag to your developer friends and put it on your resume. It's easy to generate automagically from database tables. It maps to Data Transfer Objects surprisingly well. The cons: Your domain logic exists somewhere else, probably in a class full of class(static) methods. Or your GUI code. Or in multiple places, all with conflicting logic. It's an anti-pattern, so other developers will ask if you understand the concepts of object oriented design.
