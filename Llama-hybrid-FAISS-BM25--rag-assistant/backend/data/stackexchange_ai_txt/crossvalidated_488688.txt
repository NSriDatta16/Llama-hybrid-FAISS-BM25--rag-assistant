$$ E[X] = \int_{-\infty}^\infty x f(x) dx = \int_{-\infty}^0 x f(x) dx + \int_0^\infty x f(x) dx $$ $f(x)$ is a non-negative density so $x f(x) \ge 0$ if $x \ge 0$ and $x f(x) \le 0$ if $x \le 0$ . Thus the first integral is $\le 0$ and second integral is $\ge 0$ . Intuitively, positive values of $X$ pull the average up and negative values of $X$ pull the average down. For $E[|X|]$ we may use the Law of the Unconscious Statistician to find we are integrating over $|x| f(x)$ which is always non-negative. Then you should be able to determine when $E[|X|] = E[X]$ .
