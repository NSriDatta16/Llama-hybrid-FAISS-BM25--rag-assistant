Is it a good idea to use unicode symbols as Java identifiers?

I have a snippet of code that looks like this: double Δt = lastPollTime - pollTime; double α = 1 - Math.exp(-Δt / τ); average += α * (x - average); Just how bad an idea is it to use unicode characters in Java identifiers? Or is this perfectly acceptable?
