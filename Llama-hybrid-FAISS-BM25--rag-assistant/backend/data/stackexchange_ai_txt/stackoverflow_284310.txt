Infragistics grid "on-demand" appearance

We're using Infragistics grid (most probably, we'll have 8.2 version at the end) and we want to configure row/cells appearances "on-demand" in order to be able to provide sort of "dynamic appearance". For example, I want some cell to be red or green, depending on its value. We might want to tweak other characteristics as well (font, size, image, etc). A perfect place to do it would be some event, that happen before a cell gets repainted... But it seems there is no such event in Infragistics... Or am I wrong? Any help? Clarification: I'm talking about WinForms Infragistics UltraGrid
