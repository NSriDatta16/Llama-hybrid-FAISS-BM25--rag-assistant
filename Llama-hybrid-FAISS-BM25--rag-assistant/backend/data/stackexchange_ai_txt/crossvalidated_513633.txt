Is there any impact on the results of random forest if we have perfect separation in the database?

I'm having a perfect separation in my database. One of the solutions is to switch randomly some of the values of the dependent variable to the opposite for the variables that cause the problem this can resolve the problem for regression. My question is about the random forest, I want to know if there is an impact also on the results of the random forest algorithm if we have this problem. Since it's a bagging algorithm, so I cannot guaranty that for some trees we will have perfect separation.
