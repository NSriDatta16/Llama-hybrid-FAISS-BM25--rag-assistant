Serve the XHTML as application/xhtml+xml or construct it so that it follows the HTML compatibility guidelines . You can't tell the browser it is HTML (by serving it as text/html) and expect it to treat it as XHTML. (And try to get the semantics right, what sort of nonsense is a paragraph containing nothing followed by some text that isn't in a paragraph?)
