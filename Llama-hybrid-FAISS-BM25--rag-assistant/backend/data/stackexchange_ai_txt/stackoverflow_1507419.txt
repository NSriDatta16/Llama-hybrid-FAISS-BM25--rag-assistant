Generally you'll do something like this @interface MyView : UIView { // Declare IBOutlets here if you wish or other instance variables you may need } @end @implementation MyView - (void)drawRect:(CGRect)rect { // Drawing stuff } And then in Interface Builder, create a view (usually by making a View XIB or by dragging out a Custom UIView object onto (well, into) another UIView in the XIB thus making it a subview) and then in the Inspector pane, set its Class to be MyView. Then you can connect any IBOutlets you've defined in the MyView interface declaration.
