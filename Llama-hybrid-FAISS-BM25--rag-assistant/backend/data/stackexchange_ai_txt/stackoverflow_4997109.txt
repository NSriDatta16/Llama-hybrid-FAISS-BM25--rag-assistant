NSImageView Drag and Drop issues

I have an NSBox containing two static text fields and two NSImageView. NSBox is subclassed as myNSBox. I have registered the view/NSBox to accept appropriate drag types. So when i drag items to the static text fields, the drag-drop operations work. However, dragging and dropping onto any NSImageView (which are subviews of NSBox) does not work. An interesting observation is that i am unable to drag and drop files from Finder onto the image view. Drag and Drop from outline view to the NSImageView works fine. Any suggestions ?
