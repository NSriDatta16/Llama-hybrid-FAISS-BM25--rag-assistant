Firefox plugin that ask for some input at startup

I would like to know how to implement a dialog that show up when you first start Firefox to ask the user to enter some input. This input will be stored somewhere temporarily, and should be used later on by the plugin when required. I have full understand of how to implement firefox plugin (this includes understanding of XUL and Javascript), so no need for full plugin example. The specific question is how to show a dialog when firefox start that ask for input, and how to store the input in a temporary storage. Any help would be appreciated.
