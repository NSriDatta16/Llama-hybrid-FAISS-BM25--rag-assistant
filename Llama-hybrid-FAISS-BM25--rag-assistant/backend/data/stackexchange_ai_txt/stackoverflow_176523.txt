nchar and char pretty much operate in exactly the same way as each other, as do nvarchar and varchar. The only difference between them is that nchar/nvarchar store Unicode characters (essential if you require the use of extended character sets) whilst varchar does not. Because Unicode characters require more storage, nchar/nvarchar fields take up twice as much space (so for example in earlier versions of SQL Server the maximum size of an nvarchar field is 4000). This question is a duplicate of this one .
