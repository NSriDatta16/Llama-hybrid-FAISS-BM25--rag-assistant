Validation Drop down on a condition

its a bit confusing to write my idea but ill give it a try. Here is what i was able to do. I have a drop down on my vertical cells, so i have a list of names to pick from which is linked by [name]-> [define] and [data] -> [validation]. what i would like is another vertical cell to populate another drop down depending on the condition of the first. for instance i have a list of fruits and vegetables. My first drop down menu asks the type so i select fruit. Because of such selection my second drop down will give me a list of fruits only (no vegetables) and vice versa.+ your help is greatly appreciated. thanks gang! if i want to name the cell instead of vegetable but 2009 and fruit 2010 i get an error. is there a way arround? thanks
