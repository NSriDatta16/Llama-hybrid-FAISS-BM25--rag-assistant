Independence of the residuals or error term from predictors is a core assumption of all regression modeling regardless of the method used to estimate the model, whether it be OLS, maximum likelihood, FIML, whatever. Jeffrey Wooldridge in Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data has the clearest explanation for why this is "bad" for models beginning on page 50, An explanatory variable is said to be endogenous if it is correlated with u (the errors or disturbance)...This usually arises in one of three ways: Omitted variables ...these appear when we would like to control for one or more additional variables but...they cannot be included in the model... Measurement error ...or Simultaneity which arises when at least one of the explanatory variables is determined simultaneously along with y . None of these are desirable properties for any model. Regrettably, many of the workarounds and "solutions," e.g., 2SLS in time series, etc., don't do that great of a job of solving these problems either.
