Thanks for the replies but I have figured out a simple solution. Not the most elegant, but it's a simple change and it serves my end user's needs (they dont want pagination, just a scrollable DIV area). Instead of using this statement inside the loop: ')"> I used the employee ID as the ID of the anchor tag and passed that one instead: ' href="#" onClick="getData(this.id)"> I don't know why, but the difference was night and day in terms of page rendering time. It now renders for just less than 5 secs compared to over a minute when passing the c:out value directly. I was dealing with 10,000 records btw.
