Where is the last vote stored?

I'm using FiveStars module and I'm modifying the code. I need to get the last vote of a user for a specific node. I'm sure that the module stores it, because it displays the stars the user previously selected, when he logs in and re-visits the node. But I'm not able to find this in the code. (I only found the average vote for a node, and the count of nodes).
