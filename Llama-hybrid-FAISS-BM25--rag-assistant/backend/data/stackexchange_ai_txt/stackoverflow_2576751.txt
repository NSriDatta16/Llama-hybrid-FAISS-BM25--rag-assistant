Efficient copy of entire directory

I want to copy one directory and the two files under it to another shared location of shared storage. Is it possible to combine the three(one directory and two files) as a continuous file writing and decompose it at another side to save the cost? I am limited to c language and Unix/Linux. I am considering to create a structure with the inode info and get the data at receiver. Thanks!
