The draggable stuff is interfering with your positioning. Draggable will assign specific left and top CSS via a style attribute as you drag the the around, style attributes override the values that come from the class attribute. You can get around this by using !important : .hi { background: yellow; position: relative; width: 300px; height: 300px; top: 0px !important; left: 0px !important; } Of course, the will cease to be draggable once the hi class is added as the !important positions will override what the draggable is trying to do. I'd recommend that you get yourself a WebKit browser (such as Chrome or Safari) for testing and debugging, WebKit's "inspect element" is awesome and better than anything else I've come across for sorting out HTML/CSS issues.
