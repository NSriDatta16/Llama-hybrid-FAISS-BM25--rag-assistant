How To rewrite a url with PHP?

Let' say for example one of my members is to http://www.example.com/members/893674.php . How do I let them customize there url so it can be for example, http://www.example.com/myname I guess what I want is for my members to have there own customized url. Is there a better way to do this by reorganizing my files.
