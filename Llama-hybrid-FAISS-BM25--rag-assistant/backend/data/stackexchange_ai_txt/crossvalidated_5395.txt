It sounds like you have multiple sources of information about measurements of interest. The aim is to combine the multiple sources so as to maximise measurement accuracy. In general you could adopt a formula that weights the different sources of information based on the confidence you ascribe to the source. It also seems that the confidence in the source might vary. E.g., the more work data you have on someone, perhaps the more weight this information would be given for that individual. You may also have evidence on the accuracy of an individual's self ratings. Thus, a simple strategy would to develop a weighted composite of available information where the size of the weight is relative to the informativeness of the source. This question on Bayesian rating systems might also be relevant.
