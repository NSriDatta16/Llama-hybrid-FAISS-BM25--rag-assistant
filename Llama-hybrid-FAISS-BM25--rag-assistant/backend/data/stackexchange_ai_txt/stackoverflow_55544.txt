I've not seen any studies, but a reasonable heuristic would be something like : ( Time since last application save when crash occurred + Time to restart application ) * Average hourly rate of application operator. The estimation gets more complex if the crashes have some impact on external customers such, or might delay other things (i.e. create a bottle neck such that another person winds up sitting around waiting because some else's application crashed). That said, your 'powers that be' may well be happy with a very rough estimate so long as it's applied consistently and they can see how it is changing over time.
