I don't know Python, but for the averaging part, do you mean an exponentially decaying low-pass filter of the form y_new = y_old + (input - y_old)*alpha where alpha = dt/tau, dt = the timestep of the filter, tau = the time constant of the filter? (the variable-timestep form of this is as follows, just clip dt/tau to not be more than 1.0) y_new = y_old + (input - y_old)*dt/tau If you want to filter something like a date, make sure you convert to a floating-point quantity like # of seconds since Jan 1 1970.
