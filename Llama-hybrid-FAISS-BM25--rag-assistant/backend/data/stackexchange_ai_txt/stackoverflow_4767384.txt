cxGrid new record on last field Enter

I'm struggling to make a TcxGrid to append a new record whenever the user presses Enter key on last field of the current record, however I didn't find any property that might help me achieve this. I tried setting the OnKeyDown event of the grid view(TcxGridDBTableView), with the following code if Key = VK_RETURN then if PaymentViewBetragNetto.Focused then PaymentView.DataController.AppendRecord; however the code is not executed for some reason... Any idea on how to append record on last field OnEnter event would be highly appreciated. Thank you.
