From the Concepts Guide (scroll down to "Hash Cluster Storage": When users insert rows into the cluster for department 43, the database cannot store these rows in block 100, which is full. The database links block 100 to a new overflow block, say block 200, and stores the inserted rows in the new block. Both block 100 and 200 are now eligible to store data for either department. As shown in Figure 2-7, a query of either department 20 or 43 now requires two I/Os to retrieve the data: block 100 and its associated block 200. This means that the overflow block is exclusively allocated to that hash value. I don't know the answer to your second question though.
