Depending on what your email mechanism is, another alternative would be to make a testmail.(py,php,sh) script that records all arguments provided and dumps them into a tag table with event time stamps. It's not elegant, but would do for debugging. Trick all depends on how you send email. Along the same lines, if you use smtp and not sendmail, is write a ghetto app that listens on some high range port number and just dumbly responds back with the correct values.
