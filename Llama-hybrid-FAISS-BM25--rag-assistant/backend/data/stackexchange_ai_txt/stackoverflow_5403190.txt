Sharepoint Foundation 2010 Gantt Charts

I know that Sharepoint has some support for Gantt Charts (Gantt view for tasks). What I'm looking for is way to provide advanced task relations (FF: finish to finish, FS: finish to start, etc.) Is there any way to provide it or is there a free component for that?
