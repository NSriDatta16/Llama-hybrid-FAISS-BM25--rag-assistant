Strong exogeneity is a term related to dynamic models, i.e. when there is time-series data involved. Since you are doing one-time survey, this term does not apply. What might be the problem with the regression though is omitted variable bias . Since GPA is a weighted average purely arithmetical formula applies: $$GPA = w_1 G_1+...+ w_n G_n$$ where $w_i$ are the weights and $G_i$ are grades. This equation is not stochastic. However we can say that each grade is determined by student's ability plus stochastic term: $$G_i=f_i(\mathbf{A})+\varepsilon_i$$ where $\mathbf{A}$ is vector of variables which determine students ability, and $f$ is the functional form of the relationship. When viewed in this light it makes no sense including grades in the regression. What might be of interest how different functional relationships $f_i$ aggregate into functional relationship $f$: $$GPA=f(\mathbf{A})+\varepsilon$$ But this does not answer the questions in your given example. So as other's suggested it is better to use factor analysis .
