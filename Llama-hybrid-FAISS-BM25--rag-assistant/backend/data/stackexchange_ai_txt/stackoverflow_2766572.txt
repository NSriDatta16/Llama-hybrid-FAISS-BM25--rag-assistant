If you've got a database already, it's really not a big deal to create a separate table for tracking this sort of thing. When doing reporting, it's often to your advantage to create derivative summary tables exactly like what you're describing. You can update these as required using a simple SQL statement and there's no worry that your temporary store will somehow go away. That being said, the type of report you're trying to generate is actually something that can be done in real-time except on extravagantly large data sets. The key is to have indexes that describe the exact grouping operation you're trying to do. For instance, if you're grouping by calendar date, you can create a "date" field and sync it to the "created_at" time as required. An index on this date field will make doing a GROUP BY created_date very quick: SELECT created_date AS on_date, COUNT(id) AS new_users FROM users GROUP BY created_date
