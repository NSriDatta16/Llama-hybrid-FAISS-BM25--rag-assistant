If you mean create a new column that gives 1 if the column has missing value and gives 0 if the column has no missing value then it is still a common practice in machine learning. I want to elaborate something about the reason that missing value arises. Case 1: The reason may be random, then the missing value is non-informative so that we may also delete, impute by mean, impure by regression or performing EM algorithm for basic level. Case 2: If the missing value is itself informative, we are interested in the missing values because it tells us something important in the model. I hope it helps,
