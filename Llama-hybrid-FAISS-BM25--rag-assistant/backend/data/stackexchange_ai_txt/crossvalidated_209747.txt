What should be validation strategy?

I am building CTR( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Click-through_rate ) Click prediction model with different (61) variables.Dependent variable is weather 0/1( click).I have build logistic regression model and getting probabilities of click for different combination of independent variable. I am confused about model validation- 1) What are the parameters should I use for model validation? 2) I am not classifying anything but using classification model for click through rate prediction so using Pseudo R square/ likelihood ration would work? 3) Is there any strategy that I can use for model validation?
