Can I ask why you want to use SwitchToThread? If for example it's some form of because thread x is computing some value that you want to wait for on thread Y, then I'd really suggest looking at the Parallel Pattern Library or the Asynchronous Agents Library in Visual Studio 2010 which allows you to do this either with message blocks (receive on an asynchronous value) or simply via tasks : wait for a set of tasks to complete and inline their execution while waiting... //i.e. on an arbitrary thread task_group* tasks; tasks->run(... / some functor/) a call to tasks->wait() will wait and inline any tasks running.
