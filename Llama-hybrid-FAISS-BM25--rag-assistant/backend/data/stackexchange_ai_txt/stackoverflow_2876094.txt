Depends on your location and what you do with the credit card information. If you accept credit cards, you're going to need to be, at a minimum, PCI compliant. Search for "PCI Compliance" and you'll see there's a whole industry that's sprung up just to support organizations being able to be PCI compliant. You may want to look at using 3rd party gateways for your credit card processing, which will reduce your overall exposure, and limit the amount of credit card information you store, and make sure you store it in a secure, compliant manner. No matter what, you want to design this type of compliance from the start. Adding it on after the fact will cost you an order of magnitude more.
