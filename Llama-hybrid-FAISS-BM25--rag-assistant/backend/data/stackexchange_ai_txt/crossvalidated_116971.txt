How to use Bayesian statistics to estimate mean and a covariance matrix given structured observations

I have a real-world problem in which the observations are linear combinations of elements in a vector $\bf{c}$. However, there exist correlation between different element in $\bf{c}$. For example $\bf{c} = (c_1,c_2)^{\top}$ and $B = {\left[ {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {1.0}&{1.0}\\ 0&{1.9}\\ {5.6}&0\\ \vdots & \vdots\\ {3.2}&{0.5} \end{array}} \right]_{(n \times 2)}}$ and observation $y=[\vdots]_{(n\times 1)}$ (number of observations is $n$). In this case how can I estimate both the mean and covariance matrix if $c\sim\cal{N}(\mu,\Sigma)$ (and in this case $y\sim\cal{N}(B\mu,B\Sigma B^{\top})$), in particular when the dimension of $c$ is high. The parameters of interest are $\mu$ and $\Sigma$ (the mean and covariance of $c$).
