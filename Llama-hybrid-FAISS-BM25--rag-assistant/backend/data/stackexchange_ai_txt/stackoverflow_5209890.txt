Updating the position of an image

Hi I am fairly new to Drawing with Android. I was looking for a simplest way to do the following: change the position of an image I have placed at a starting x,y location may layout has background images, etc, I have a frame layout defined with a placeholder in xml. I have found may questions related to moving images on fling, or dragging. I just need a basic setup, where my code generates a value for x,y and then I just translate the image to its new location with these x,y values. i.e. translate.image(x,y); most items I find get complex dealing with gestures, animations etc. I have this basic framelayout in my main xml layout: Thanks
