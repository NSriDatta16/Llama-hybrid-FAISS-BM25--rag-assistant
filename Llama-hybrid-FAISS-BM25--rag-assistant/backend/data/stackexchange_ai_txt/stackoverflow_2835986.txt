The guys at Versant have actually deprecated the FastObjects product in favor of their newer more scalable database for .NET ... which is their prior Linux/UNIX version just called Versant or the Versant Object Database. As I understand it, they recently released a version 8.0 of The Versant Object Database which includes a .NET binding which is just like the old FastObjects API. The Versant Object Database is running some seriously demanding applications .... e.g American Stock Exchange options trading systems, Sabre - Travelocity reservations systems ( original application for which IBM developed the mainframe ), HPC compute clusters for space agency, etc. So, now you can get that super scalable high performance database which stores pure objects ( no DDL required ) for the .NET platform and fully integrated with Visual Studio. http://www.versant.com/en_US/products/objectdatabase/VOD_NET/ Hope this helps.... -Robert
