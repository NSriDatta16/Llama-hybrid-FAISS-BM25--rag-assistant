Shared Library Path as Executable Directory

I have an application that is broken into several libraries for purposes of code reuse. On Windows all I have to do is put the .dll files in the same path as the executable and it automatically finds them. On Linux (since it hardcodes the paths to things) I have to specify the environmental variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH or preload the libraries before the executable. I've seen some things about embedding the path using the linker option of -Wl,-rpath= and I've tried it using . as the path. But that just looks in the current working directory, not the executable's directory. Is there a way to specify in the linker to look in the directory of the executable for the shared libraries by default (like on Windows)? Thanks! Matt
