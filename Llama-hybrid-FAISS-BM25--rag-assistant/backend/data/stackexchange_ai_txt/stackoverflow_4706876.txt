It's not an inconvenience but more a basic concept of objc: A class can have member variables. In OOP you normally define getter and setters for member variables which should be available to the outside. In objective-c you are encouraged to define getters/setters at any time (if they should be private, put their declarations into a private interface). To simplify this task, objective-c uses properties which are not more than a abbreviation. Additionally there are things like key-value-coding and -observing which are enabled by properties, but basically, they are just abbreviations for getters and setters. Conclusion: Inside of @interface you declare members, outside methods including getters/setters (properties).
