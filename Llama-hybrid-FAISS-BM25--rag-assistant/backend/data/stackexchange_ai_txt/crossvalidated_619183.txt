Calculate the average of absolute values of a measurement with a measurement error

I have a few parameters; each is measured imprecisely with a known but unique random measurement error. We can assume that the error is normally distributed, with mean 0 and known variance (different for each parameter). I have two problems I would like to estimate an average of these parameters. I think the solution here is easy; I can take the weighted average of these measurements, weighted by the inverse of the variance of the measurement error. I would like to estimate an average of ABSOLUTE values of these parameters. I can't just calculate the weighted average because the errors will bias the final estimate. Large measurement errors will always result in large absolute values, moving the estimate away from its true value. Is there a method to account for the bias caused by the measurement error?
