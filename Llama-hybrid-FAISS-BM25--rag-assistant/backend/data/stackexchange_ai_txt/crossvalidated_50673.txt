I think you are looking to attribute qualities that are not inherent in, or do not follow from, your data. You have unambiguous data on success rate, and there should be a way to calculate or estimate a merchant's "adjusted success rate" given the rate at which his products tend to sell among all merchants. Similarly, there should be a way to determine each product's adjusted success rate given the success rates of the merchants who tend to sell it. These two angles on the analysis might be accomplished with a nested/hierarchical/multi-level logistic regression, if the data are suitable for it. But that wouldn't necessarily reveal the attributes of "skill" or "attractiveness"; it might yield workable proxies for them, but how adequate these proxies would be is a substantive question more than a statistical one.
