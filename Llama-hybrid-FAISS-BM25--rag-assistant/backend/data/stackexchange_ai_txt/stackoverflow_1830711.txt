Center on anchored image after jump?

When I jump to an anchor tag in on a wide (4000px) page, the anchored image is horizontally aligned to the right. How can I get it to align to the center? I have tried several things but none seem to work. Since I am new here I am not allowed to post the code, so I hope I was clear enough. Thanks for your help, Robert C.
