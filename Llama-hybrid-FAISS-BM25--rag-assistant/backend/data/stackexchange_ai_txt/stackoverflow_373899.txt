The GetCapture API function might be a good start. Basically, when a drag operation starts, the source window "captures" the mouse, which means that it will still receive all mouse events even if the mouse leaves the window. However, applications can also capture the mouse for other reasons, so this is not 100% reliable. You can try it and see how well it works for you. And with applications doing their own drag&drop handling, there's no way to be sure what is going on anyway.
