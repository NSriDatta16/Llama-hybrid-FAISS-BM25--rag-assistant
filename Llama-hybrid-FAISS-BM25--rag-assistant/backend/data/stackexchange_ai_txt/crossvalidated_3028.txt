Essentially, it's because linear and logistic regression make the wrong kinds of assumptions about what count outcomes look like. Imagine your model as a very stupid robot that will relentlessly follow your orders, no matter how nonsensical those orders are; it completely lacks the ability to evaluate what you tell it. If you tell your robot that something like votes is distributed continuously from negative infinity to infinity, that's what it believes votes are like, and it might give you nonsensical predictions (Ross Perot will receive -10.469 votes in the upcoming election). Conversely, the Poisson distribution is discrete and positive (or zero... zero counts as positive, yes?). At a very minimum, this will force your robot to give you answers that could actually happen in real life. They may or may not be good answers, but they will at least be drawn from the possible set of "number of votes cast". Of course, the Poisson has its own problems: it assumes that the mean of the vote count variable will also be the same as its variance. I don't know if I've ever actually seen a non-contrived example where this was true. Fortunately, bright people have come up with other distributions that are also positive and discrete, but that add parameters to allow the variance to, er, vary (e.g., negative binomial regression).
