Largely agree with Jeff that it is a process of trial and error as to what you can remove from the file. In terms of tweaking the runtime and the http pipeline, it can often be a process of adding things to the web.config, in order to turn things off. The out of the box configuration adds a lot of modules to the pipeline, depending on what you are doing, you may not need half of them. Have come across a few articles on this on MSDN, and also this one http://www.codeproject.com/KB/aspnet/10ASPNetPerformance.aspx , by Omar from PageFlakes, which was the only one I could find in my (poorly organised) bookmarks, which is a good starting point on optimising the runtime.
