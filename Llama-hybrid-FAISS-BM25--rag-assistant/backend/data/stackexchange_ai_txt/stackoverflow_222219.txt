There is no DragMove for PopUp. Just a small work around, there is lot of improvements you can add to this. In the code behind , add this mousemove event pop.MouseMove += new MouseEventHandler(pop_MouseMove); void pop_MouseMove(object sender, MouseEventArgs e) { if (e.LeftButton == MouseButtonState.Pressed) { pop.PlacementRectangle = new Rect(new Point(e.GetPosition(this).X, e.GetPosition(this).Y),new Point(200,200)); } }
