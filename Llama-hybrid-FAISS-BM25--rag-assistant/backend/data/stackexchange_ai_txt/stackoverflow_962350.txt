Most Java ".properties" files can be split by assuming the "=" is the separator - but the format is significantly more complicated than that and allows for embedding spaces, equals, newlines and any Unicode characters in either the property name or value. I needed to load some Java properties for a C# application so I have implemented JavaProperties.cs to correctly read and write ".properties" formatted files using the same approach as the Java version - you can find it at http://www.kajabity.com/index.php/2009/06/loading-java-properties-files-in-csharp/ . There, you will find a zip file containing the C# source for the class and some sample properties files I tested it with. Enjoy!
