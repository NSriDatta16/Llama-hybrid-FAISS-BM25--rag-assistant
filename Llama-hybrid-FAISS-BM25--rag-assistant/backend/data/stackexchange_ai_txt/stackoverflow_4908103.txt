Inheritance in .NET is useless?

I'm quite new to .NET programming. I know that .NET programming is 100% object oriented. An intriguing paragraph I read in a book about ASP.NET 4 states that Inheritance is less useful than you might expect. In an ordinary application, most classes use containment and other relationships instead of inheritance, because inheritance can complicate life needlessly without delivering many benefits. Dan Appleman, a renowned .NET programmer, once described inheritance as “the coolest feature you’ll almost never use.” I'm a little bit confused here and I need .NET programmers to tell me what should I take and what should I leave. Edit Please people understand my question, first the author didn't say literally "Inheritance in .NET is useless", that was my way to zip the hole question in some words to fit as a title. Second, the book is from Apress and its title is: "Beginning ASP.NET 4 in C# 2010" page 72.
