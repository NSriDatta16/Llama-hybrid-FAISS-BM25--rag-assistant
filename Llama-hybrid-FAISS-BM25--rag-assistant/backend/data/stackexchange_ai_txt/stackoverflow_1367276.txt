the way I have gotten M2M working in LINQ2SQL: drag the tables into the builder, like you're showing in the question remove the relationship between artworks_subject and artwor k create a new relationship FROM artworks_subject TO artwork click on the new relationship to get its properties change the cardinality from OneToMany to OneToOne (because ManyToOne doesn't exist) open the Child Property section and change the Name field to make it singular (Artworks to Artwork) now the tagSubject entity will have a collection of artwork_subjects , and the artwork_subject will have a property of type artwork called Artwork . so you can now make a LINQ expression like var x = dbcontext.tagSubjects.Single(s=>s.name=="Landscape"). Artwork_Subjects. Select(as=>as.Artwork.Name);
