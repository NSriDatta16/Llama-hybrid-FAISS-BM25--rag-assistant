serialization of dictionary

I have lists of objects that I want to store in the session and I'm declaring them like this: Dictionary > SessionMyObjects = new Dictionary >(); I'm reading some posts that suggest that dictionaries are not serializable and storing dictionaries in the session will cause errors. What is this about? I'm using InProc; there's no serialization with this storage type? If the code compiles, could I still get some strange errors later because of using this structure?
