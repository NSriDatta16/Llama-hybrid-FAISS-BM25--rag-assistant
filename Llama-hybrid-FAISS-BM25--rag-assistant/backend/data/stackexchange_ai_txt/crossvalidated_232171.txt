What introductory textbook material should one read before getting started on learning PCA and high-dimensional clustering?

I've taken some introductory statistics course in uni but not high level multivariate analysis, I also have a minor in math if that helps with the recommendation. I feel like I should go over some chapters in a standard multivariate analysis textbook so I'm not completely lost when I try to learn about high-dimensional clustering and non-linear reduction. But because of how little experience I have on this topic, I want to get some advice on this. What introductory textbook material (specifically chapters) should I read and grasp first before jumping into high-dimensional clustering analysis?
