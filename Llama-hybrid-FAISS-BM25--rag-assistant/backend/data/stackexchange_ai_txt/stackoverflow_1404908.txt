How to organize files in Haskell programs?

I've just started playing around in Haskell. After years of Ruby, I got used to a file organization that's used by Ruby on Rails or Rugui. Are there any guidelines, best practices, or maybe even frameworks about file-organization in Haskell programs? ("Learn you a Haskell" & "Real World Haskell" don't really handle this issue.)
