No. Bayesian statistics has a concept of hypothesis testing . From Wagenmakers and Grünweld: A Bayesian hypothesis test (Jeffreys, 1961) proceeds by contrasting two quantities: the probability of the observed data $D$ given $H_{0}$ (i.e., $\theta = \frac{1}{2}$) and the probability of the observed data $D$ given $H_{1}$ (i.e., $\theta \ne \frac{1}{2}$). The ratio $B_{01} = p(D|H_{0})/p(D|H_{1})$ is the Bayes factor , and it quantifies the evidence that the data provide for $H_{0}$ vis-à-vis $H_{1}$. Eric-Jan Wagenmaker and Peter Grünweld. 2006.
