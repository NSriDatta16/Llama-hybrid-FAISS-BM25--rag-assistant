You need to call a label transformer for your vertex/edge: vv.getRenderContext().setVertexLabelTransformer(new ToStringLabeller()); This is something you'd find pretty often in the samples. It uses the toString() method of your vertex class to specify the label. A slightly more involved example: vv.getRenderContext().setEdgeLabelTransformer(new Transformer () { public String transform(MyEdge e) { return (e.toString() + " " + e.getWeight() + "/" + e.getCapacity()); } }); You don't need to iterate over the edges; the EdgeLabelTransformer or VertexLabelTransformer will label your edges as and when their properties are updated, and the VisualizationViewer will update them on the fly.
