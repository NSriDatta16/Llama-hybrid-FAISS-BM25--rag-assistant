This is the way that I ended up solving this problem. I will not accept my own answer just in case someone has something much more elegant. Originally I had: var visualization = new google.visualization.Table(document.getElementById('table')); visualization.draw(data, { sort: "disable", allowHtml: true, showRowNumber: true, page: "enable", pageSize: 9 }); I added another one that went to a div that I would hide with css. //Create a second Visualization that Will be hidden. var visualization = new google.visualization.Table(document.getElementById('printerFriendly')); visualization.draw(data, { sort: "disable", allowHtml: true, showRowNumber: true, page: "disable" }); Then I added the following rules to one of my css files. @media print { #table{ display:none; } } @media screen { #printerFriendly{ display:none;} } This hides one table during normal use and hides the other during printing. I was hoping for something a little cleaner than this but this solution was very easy to implement.
