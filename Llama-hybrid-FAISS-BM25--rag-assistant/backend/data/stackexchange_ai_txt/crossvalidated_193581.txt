Identifying the most representative observation in a sample

Given a multidimensional X , is there a standard way of identifying the most representative observation? A few options come to mind: Minimum average distance (e.g. cosine, Mahalanobis) from all other observations. Minimum distance from multidimensional center of sample (for certain distance measures I think this would be equivalent to (1)). Maximum centrality (e.g. PageRank) from a social network analysis, where edge weights are inverse to some distance measure.
