Is it valid to use an independent test-set for two different experiments which have been merged and re-analysed as one experiment?

I'm really new to ML so apologies if this is obvious to those with an ML. background. I have two experiments where we analysed intestinal bacteria composition in genetically modified animals with controls in one and another where we associated germ-free (animals bred completely sterile) with the bacteria from the first experiment, also with controls (total n=198). Basically, nearly all of the genetically modified animals will get sick, however in the associated group only ~60% get sick. Although these are two separate experiments, the data was merged and reanalysed, as due to the nature of these analyses it is not valid to compare two datasets analysed separately. I wish to use a subset of data (n=42) from the first experiment to predict which of the germ-free associated group will get sick. My current approach is training a random forest on the aforementioned subset with leave-one-out cross validation, and then using a subset of data from the second experiment (n=32) as the test set. Currently my model seems to predict outcome with an accuracy of 84%. My question is, is this a valid approach? As far as I know you should not choose which data goes into the test set when you are splitting a single dataset into test and training, however in this instance they are technically two datasets.
