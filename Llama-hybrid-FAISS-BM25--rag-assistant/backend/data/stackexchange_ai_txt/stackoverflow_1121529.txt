What does "generalizes the tag object's storage" mean?

could anyone please clarify the meaning of line generalizes the tag object's storage of attributes in the following line of Head First Servlets & JSP (page no. 555): One solution would be to put all of the attributes into a hashtable. This generalizes the tag object's storage of attributes, but what about all these setter methods? We can't get rid of them unless there's a way to tell the JSP engine to set the tag attributes using a generic interface. Thanks in advance.
