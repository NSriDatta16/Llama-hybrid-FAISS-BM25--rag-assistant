How can i check if 2 controls overlap eachother on a canvas in WPF?

I am writing a designer that enables the user to drag controls around the screen. What would be the best way of detecting if a control is overlapping another control while i am dragging the one control around? Should i just get the dimensions of the FrameworkElement and keep on checking the dimensions of the other elements? Thanks. Eli
