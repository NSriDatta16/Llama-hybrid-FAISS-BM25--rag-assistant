Excessive number of touch events slows down Android app

I'm writing an Android game that needs to receive touch events. My problem is that, whenever the user drags their finger along the screen, so many touch events get sent to the touch event handler (which I think runs as a separate thread) that my frame rate plummets! What's the best way I can limit the number of touch events that are handled per second? For example, if my game runs at 60 fps, I really shouldn't need more than 1 touch event being handled every second. Can I do this is a way that doesn't lose any information (i.e. important information about where on the screen the user touched last)?
