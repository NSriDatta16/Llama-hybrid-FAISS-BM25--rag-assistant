To DB or not to DB, that is the question. You're starting a religious war here with Images in DB. The opinion would be split for SQL 2000, but 2005 and above do a fairly decent job of storing blobs - just look at the number of SharePoint installations that use MS SQL Server as their storage. I would only go this route for minor image storage. If you do end up putting them in the DB, I would say that you should separate the image from the data associated with it for ease of querying and reducing your IO and the instances when developers write SELECT * (and yes, they will). Check out FILESTREAM in SQL 2008 - it is meant for things like this. Here are some other points on DB vs. File system that you may want to consider: DB storage, backups, restoring, maintenance licensing is expensive Storage in DB is harded to get at than on disk Disk can be accelerated You will need to write code to get/set images in DB - not required for disk
