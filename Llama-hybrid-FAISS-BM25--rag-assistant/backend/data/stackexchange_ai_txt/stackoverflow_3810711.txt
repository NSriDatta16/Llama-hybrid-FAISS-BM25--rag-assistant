The many other are right: Your pointer to a pointer has to point to something. However, in C99 you can cheat by using compound literals : int a = 1; int **ppa = &(int *){ &a }; Compound literals are just basically unnamed objects and have the same storage rules as normal objects. (But you can't give a function scope compound literal static storage duration with the static keyword). You can even nest them so you can rewrite the previous example to a single line: int **ppa = &(int *) { &(int) { 1 } };
