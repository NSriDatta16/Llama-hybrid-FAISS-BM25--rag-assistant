Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) is the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) when the conditional distribution of the $Y$ is normal. However, the proof of the Gauss Markov Theorem (which shows that OLS is BLUE) does not require the conditional $Y$ to be normally distributed, so the BLUE-ness of OLS is a nonparametric result. In fact, if the conditional $Y$ were any other distribution, maximum likelihood would be more efficient, it's just that the estimator would not be a linear one. It should match our intuition: using the knowledge of the actual distribution should help us. The MLE is always the asymptotically efficient estimator. Reminder: a linear estimator is any estimator of the form $\hat{Y} = bY$ i.e. a projection. There are other forms of linear estimators like the average slope. This is an elusive fact, one must delve into Seber and Lee "Linear Regression Analysis" for the proper definition.
