If you're interested in learning about different econometric methodologies (how to go about creating models and dealing with issues encountered) then I'd recommend the following books: Modelling Economic Series: Readings in Econometric Methodology (Advanced Texts in Econometrics) by C. W. J. Granger. Modelling Nonlinear Economic Time Series (Advanced Texts in Econometrics) by Timo Terasvirta, Dag Tjostheim, Clive W. J. Granger. Dynamic Econometrics (Advanced Texts in Econometrics) by David F. Hendry. Statistical Foundations of Econometric Modelling by Aris Spanos. Specification Searches: Ad Hoc Inference with Nonexperimental Data by Edward E. Leamer. Forecasting, Structural Time Series Models and the Kalman Filter by Andrew C. Harvey. For a history of the evolution of econometrics, see: The Foundations of Econometric Analysis (Econometric Society Monographs) by David F. Hendry, Mary S. Morgan. There's a good deal of math and notation to get through in these books. (Unfortunately, a unified notation is not really used in the field.) I'd suggest starting with the first book on the list, which is a collection of papers, because it will give an introduction and overview of issues in econometric methodology. Indeed, it will help put the material in the other books into context and makes things more digestible. If you'd like a shorter read, you can get a taste of the econometric methodology literature by checking out a recent article by Ray C Fair: Reflections on Macroeconometric Modeling For more recommendations, check out the references listed in each of the aforementioned books. There's tonnes of (exciting) stuff for you to get your teeth through.
