"Flattened out" typically refers to a database where you have one (or a few) very large tables. "Normalized" refers to whether the data has been organized into well-structured, related tables. This typically reduces duplication of values across rows in a table by pulling the values into a separate table and relating to it by ID. For details, see Database Normalization .
