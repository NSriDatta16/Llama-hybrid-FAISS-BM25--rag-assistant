Has there been any research into using Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTMs, GRUs) with multiple prior time-step inputs/outputs?

RNNs and their variations use the previous time-step output and input, but has there ever been any research done into using multiple time-steps (ie, using each time-step going 10 time steps back) ? Is there a reason why such models are not used?
