Sounds like you might need to check out Func<> ??? Just my initial assessment without seeing a little more code to give me a clearer context. To clarify, if you are wanting to pass the values as an argument, like you would on your command line, then you would need to instance the assembly. Otherwise, with Func you can pass parameters dynamically to a method and get the return value. Okay...if I get what you are saying...you want something that would resemble: class Average { public double[] sma() { // do something return dArray; } public double[] ema() { // do something return dArray; } } that is...the function 'name' would be the value of the string returned from a database query of some sort? ...and if that is the case then I don't know why you wouldn't just do a dictionary like: Dictionary testResults = new Dictionary (); void GetDoubles(string name, params double[] args) { testResult[s] = GetAverages(args); }
