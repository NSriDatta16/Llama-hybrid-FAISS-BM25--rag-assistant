Is normalization a form of marginalization?

Is it correct to say that computing the partition function is equivalent to marginalizing the distribution (over all of its variables)? Motivation: Yann Lecun said recently : I like free energies. Which means I like marginalization. What I don't like is normalization. I'm a probability-free Bayesian, AKA an aspiring statistical physicist. as well as : I don't like normalizing, but I don't mind marginalizing. But isn't normalization a type of marginalization ?
