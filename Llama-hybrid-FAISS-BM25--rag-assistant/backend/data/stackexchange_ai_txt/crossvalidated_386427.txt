Is the sampling distribution of a complete sufficient statistic free from relevant subsets?

Let $T_{\theta}(\mathbf{x})$ be a complete, sufficient statistic $T_{\theta}: \Omega \mapsto \mathbb{R}$ , where $T_{\theta}$ is indexed by the parameter $\theta \in \mathbb{R}^n$ . Is it true that the sampling distribution of $T_{\theta}$ is free of relevant subsets . I.e., $P(T_{\theta}(\mathbf{x}) \in S \subset \mathbb{R}|\mathbf{x} \in Q \subset \Omega) = P(T_{\theta}(\mathbf{x}) \in S \subset \mathbb{R})$ ? Example : We use a pivotal statistic to define a $(1-\alpha)\%$ confidence interval. If the distribution of this statistic has relevant subsets, then after we see the data $\mathbf{x}$ we realize that $\mathbf{x}$ falls into a subset such that confidence intervals formed using data sampled from this subset have a different confidence coverage than the unconditional confidence $(1-\alpha)\%$ . If this were true, that means that frequentist inferences (especially confidence intervals) will have a conditional confidence level that is the same as the unconditional confidence level, among other benefits.
