The proper Cobol way to parameterize routines is via the nested subprogram. You can do what you want, but it is dependant upon your compiler and environment, you can pass a file, or a file name, or a DDname. What platform are you on? Edit: On z/OS, you can change what FILE-A points to at runtime using putenv() to adjust the dataset name associated with the DDNAME that FILE-A uses. See: http://ibmmainframes.com/post-57281.html http://cicswiki.org/cicswiki1/index.php?title=How_do_I_allocate_a_file_dynamically_using_COBOL%3F You will need a OPEN-A and CLOSE-A paragraph as well between switching files. It isn't exactly passing parameters to your read statement, but it lets you reuse your OPEN/READ/WRITE/CLOSE statements for different files. But only serially. There was a way, under VS COBOL II, where you could pass an FD to a subprogram, that would look something like: CALL MYREADPGM USING FILE-A CALL MYREADPGM USING FILE-B This possible with Enterprise Cobol but IIRC VisualAge does not support that.
