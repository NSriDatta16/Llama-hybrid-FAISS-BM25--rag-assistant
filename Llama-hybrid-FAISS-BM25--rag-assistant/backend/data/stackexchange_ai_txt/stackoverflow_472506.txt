Summing and averaging: easy with LINQ: var sum = pupils.Sum(pupil => pupil.Age); var average = pupils.Average(pupil => pupil.Age); Building a CSV string - there are various options here, including writing your own extension methods. This will work though: var csv = string.Join(",", pupils.Select(pupil => pupil.Name).ToArray()); Note that it's tricky to compute multiple things (e.g. average and sum) in one pass over the data with normal LINQ. If you're interested in that, have a look at the Push LINQ project which Marc Gravell and I have written. It's a pretty specialized requirement though.
