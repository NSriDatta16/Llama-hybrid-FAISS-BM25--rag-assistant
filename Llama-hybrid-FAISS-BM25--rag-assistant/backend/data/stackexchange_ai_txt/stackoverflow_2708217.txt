In general, it's discouraged to name variables based on their type. Instead, try to provide additional information about the specific context and purpose of the usage. Using the MEMORY_BASIC_INFORMATION example, consider what the context is of the structure. Are you using the information to iterate over a number of such information structures? Then maybe MEMORY_BASIC_INFORMATION currentFrame; Or if you're performing a test on the memory info for some status, maybe it's a candidate. MEMORY_BASIC_INFORMATION candidate; Now you can write documentation like "test candidate structure for ...". You may find that you still want to include type information using the type prefix location. If this is the case, you might call it mbiCurrentFrame or mbiCandidate . If the purpose or context is truly abstract, such as is the case with the API functions themselves, I would chose something simple and direct, such as info or buffer , except in the case where those names could somehow be misinterpreted in the context.
