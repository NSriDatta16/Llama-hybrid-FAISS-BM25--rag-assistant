How to determine if a -long- time series made of discrete observations is markovian?

Let us assume I have a time series made of the following observations: ts = c(163,18,53,189, 243, 101, 150, 39, 60,96,36,76,71,67,56,3,72,96,15,19) How can I determine if it respects the Markov chain properties and how can I get the markovian order? Is there a source where I can find a guide? Any good python or R solutions? The data I am dealing with is made of about 500K observations. Thanks
