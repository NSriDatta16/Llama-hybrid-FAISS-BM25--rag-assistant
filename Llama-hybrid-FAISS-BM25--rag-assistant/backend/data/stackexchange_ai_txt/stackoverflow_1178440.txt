From the mnesia docs: -mnesia no_table_loaders NUMBER specifies the number of parallel table loaders during start. More loaders can be good if the network latency is high or if many tables contains few records. The default value is 2. If you have many tables, this will let you load them in parallel. But it won't speed up start time for a single table. For that, the best way is to have small tables, which you can accomplish by fragmenting them.
