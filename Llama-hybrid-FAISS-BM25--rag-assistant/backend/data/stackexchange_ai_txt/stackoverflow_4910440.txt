My thoughts: you're embedding SQL in code, in a string (as opposed to using LINQ, which is at least syntax-checked, which helps provided you keep your DBML or EDMX mapping file synched with your database structure). Embedding SQL in non-syntax checked code in this way could easily lead to unmaintainable code, where you (or someone else) later changes the database structure or the embedded SQL string in a way that breaks the application. Embedding SQL in strings is particularly prone to producing hard-to-find bugs, because code with logical errors will still compile correctly; this makes it more likely that developers who are less familiar with the code base will obtain a false sense of security that changes they've made have not had any adverse or unintended effects.
