Why can we say that MLE is sufficient? I think it is not. This is similar case to Example 7.8.1. from Robert Hogg's Introduction to Mathematical Statistics : U[θ,θ+1] - uniform distribution on [θ,θ+1]. It's known that (X(1),X(n)) is minimal sufficient statistics. Hence there are no one-dimensional sufficient statistics. Thus MLE isn't sufficient.
