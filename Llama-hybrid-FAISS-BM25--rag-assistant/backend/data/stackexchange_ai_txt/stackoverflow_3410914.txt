Kudos to you for taking the hit on usage and making the WWW a better place. 1) You can use jquery.browser to accomplish this, I believe. Read the result and redirect to your "error" screen as appropriate. 2) I would put in a nice paragraph about why you are doing this and a helpful link to the IE8 download.
