In C, a global variable which doesn't have an initializer or any storage class specifiers is a tentative definition of a variable with static storage duration and external linkage . In a translation unit all tentative definitions and up to one non-tentative definition (e.g. from a declaration with an initializer) are collapsed into a single definition for a variable. Although it's not allowed to have a definition of the same variable in multiple translation units it is a common extension to allow "common" variables, i.e. tentative definitions of the same variable in multiple translation units.
