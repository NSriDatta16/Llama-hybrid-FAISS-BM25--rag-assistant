It depends on what probability you want. If you want the marginal $P(V_3=v_3)$ then observing only realizations of $V_3$ is enough. However, your goal seems to be given the states for $V_1$ and $V_2$ , what is the probability for $V_3$ taking a specific value $v_3$ . In Bayesian Networks, one usually computes the kernels $P(V_i\mid \mathrm{Pa}(V_i))$ where $\mathrm{Pa}(V_i)$ are the parents of the node $V_i$ . In this case, you need to observe the variable $V_3$ jointly with its parents $\mathrm{Pa}(V_3) = \{V_1, V_2\}$ . This is because in a DAG the local Markov condition allows for the factorization: $$P(V_1, \dots, V_n) = \prod_{i=1}^nP(V_i\mid \mathrm{Pa}(V_i)) $$ So it is enough to observe $V_1, V_2, V_3$ because of this factorization. You do not need to condition on the descendants or non-descendants of $V_3$ . In your case the factorization becomes $$ P(V_1,V_2,V_3, V_4, V_5) = P(V_1)P(V_2)P(V_3\mid V_1, V_2) P(V_4 \mid V_3) P(V_5\mid V_3)$$
