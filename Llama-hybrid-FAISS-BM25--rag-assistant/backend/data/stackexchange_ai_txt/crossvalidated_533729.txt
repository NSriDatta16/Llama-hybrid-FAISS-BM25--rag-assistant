unit root tests in R: same test different results

I have to test if a time series is stationary and to this end I have performed some unit root tests. I tried different functions, here the results. adf |t|) (Intercept) 1.3928564 0.1528018 9.115 |t|) yd.lag -0.59178 0.04367 -13.552 adf.test(x=Series$count, k=5) Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test data: Series$count Dickey-Fuller = -16.212, Lag order = 5, p-value = 0.01 alternative hypothesis: stationary Warning message: In adf.test(x = Series$count, k = 5) : p-value smaller than printed p-value It seems to me that according the first two tests I can conclude that the series is non-stationary([[1] -16 Can anyone explain me what I am getting wrong here? Thanks a lot.
