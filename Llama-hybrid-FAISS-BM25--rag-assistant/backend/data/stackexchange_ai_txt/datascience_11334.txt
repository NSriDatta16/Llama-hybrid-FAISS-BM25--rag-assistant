Python : How to use Multinomial Logistic Regression using SKlearn

I have a test dataset and train dataset as below. I have provided sample data with min records, but my data has more than 1000's of record. Here if you see E is my target variable which I need to predict using an algorithm. It has only four categories like 1, 2, 3, 4. It can take only any of these values. Training Dataset: A B C D E 1 20 30 1 1 2 22 12 33 2 3 45 65 77 3 12 43 55 65 4 11 25 30 1 1 22 23 19 31 2 31 41 11 70 3 1 48 23 60 4 Test Dataset: A B C D E 11 21 12 11 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 99 87 65 34 11 21 24 12 Since E has only 4 categories, I thought of predicting this using Multinomial Logistic Regression (1 vs Rest Logic). I am trying to implement it using Python. I know the logic that we need to set these targets in a variable and use an algorithm to predict any of these values: output = [1,2,3,4] But I am stuck at a point on how to use it using python (sklearn) to loop through these values and what algorithm should I use to predict the output values? Any help would be greatly appreciated.
