Generalized Hurst Exponent - What value to specify for $\tau_{\max}$?

Consider a time series $X: S \to \mathbb{R}$, where $S := \{\nu, 2\nu, 3\nu, \ldots T\}$, and $T$ is a multiple of $\nu > 0$. For each $\tau \in (0, \tau_{\max}] \cap S$ and $q \in \mathbb{N}$, define $$K_q(\tau) := \frac{\langle \vert X(t + \tau) - X(t) \vert^q \rangle}{\langle \vert X(t) \vert^q \rangle}$$ where the $\langle \cdot \rangle$ operator denotes averaging over all $t \in S$. Then the generalized Hurst exponent $H(q)$ satisfies $$K_q(\tau) \sim \left( \frac{\tau}{\nu} \right)^{qH(q)} $$ For fixed $q$, we can obtain $H(q)$ by linear regression over all values of $\tau \in (0, \tau_{\max}] \cap S$. My question is what value do we specify for $\tau_{\max}$? The function $K_q(\tau)$ follows a predictable curve until a certain value of $\tau$ (which I assume to be the true value of $\tau_{\max}$), and behaves unpredictably thereafter. For a single time series we could use trial and error to identify an appropriate value for $\tau_{\max}$, but this is obviously not the best approach. $\tau_{\max}$ clearly depends on the length of the time series, and also appears to depend on the variability of $X$. Is there a formula, or maybe some kind of heuristic, that we can use to identify an appropriate value for $\tau_{\max}$? Thanks.
