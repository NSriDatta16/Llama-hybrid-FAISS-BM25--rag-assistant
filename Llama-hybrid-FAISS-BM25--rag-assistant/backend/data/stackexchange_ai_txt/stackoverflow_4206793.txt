I'm not sure if this falls into what you're seeing, but check this out for trusting a share. Relevant information: Since network shares by default only get LocalIntranet permissions, it's relatively common to want to use CasPol to fully trust some shares that you control and know are safe. However, CasPol syntax being what it is, the command to do this isn't immediately obvious. If I wanted to trust everything on the share \ShawnFa-Srv\Tools, the command: CasPol.exe -m -ag 1.2 -url file://\ShawnFa-Srv/Tools/* FullTrust Would setup the policy to do what I needed. Lets break down this command: -m - modify the machine level of the policy. This is needed, since the machine level is where all of the default policy lives. On NT platforms it's also the default level that CasPol works with, however on Win9x, CasPol will default to the user level, so putting -m in the command line explicitly tells CasPol to use the correct level. -ag 1.2 - add a code group under group 1.2. In the default policy, group 1.2 is the LocalIntranet group, so the new code group that we're creating will only be checked if the file comes from the intranet. -url file://\ShawnFa-Srv/Tools/ * - The membership condition for the new code group should be a UrlMembershipCondition, and it should match anything with a URL that starts with file://ShawnFa-Srv/Tools, meaning that any file on the \ShawnFa-Srv\Tools share will match this code group. FullTrust - The permission set to grant assemblies that match the code group. In this case, FullTrust. Note that .NET 3.5 SP1 fixed this. This is only supposed to be for .NET executables running from a share, but might not hurt seeing if this helps your situation. Vance Morrison states: So I do encourage you to down load the .NET 3.5 SP1 service pack . It is a very low risk, drop-in update for the runtime. Once you do this, you get network launch for free. Because it is a service pack, you can also simply just wait, and get the update automatically in the next several weeks via windows update. Thus if you are software deployer, pretty soon now, with high probability your customers will have this newer runtime.
