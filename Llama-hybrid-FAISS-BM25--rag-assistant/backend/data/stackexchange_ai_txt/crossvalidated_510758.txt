The very first thing you should do is try an extremely simple forecasting benchmark, like the exponential smoothing model that is automatically selected by forecast::ets() . I recommend the excellent free online book Forecasting: Principles and Practice (2nd ed.) by Athanasopoulos & Hyndman . After you have calculated this benchmark, which should take about ten minutes, you can go into econometric forecasting, putting all other macroeconometric variables into a giant vector autoregression (VAE). There are many textbooks on econometrics. This second step shouldn't take much more than a year.
