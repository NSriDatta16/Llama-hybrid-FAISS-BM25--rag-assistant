PHP - And bulk retrieval of API stats

I've been looking around for the best way to retrieve stats from systems like bit.ly where you have a lot of URLs and I want to keep my system updated once an hour or so. What's the best approach on PHP? A simple php CRON job that run through the list 15 at a time (or whatever the api limit is at the other end)? Or an php extension? Seems like it could be a big hit once the number of records gets large. Anyone got any tips or examples on this? I have a solution in my head, but I'm intrigued as to how other's approach it as it doesn't seem to be an overly talked about topic. Thanks in advance
