interpretation of Linear regression

I was reading about linear regressions on wikipedia and came across the mean and predicted response . I just wanted to clarify somethings. So suppose we have a simple linear regression model, is the result for the response variable $y_i$ for a given explanatory variable $x_i$ interpreted as the mean result for that specific $x_i$ ? For example if the explanatory variable is temperature, and the response variable is # of ice cream sales, is $y_i$ interpreted as the number of sales that will occur at that specific temperature, or the average number of sales that will occur?
