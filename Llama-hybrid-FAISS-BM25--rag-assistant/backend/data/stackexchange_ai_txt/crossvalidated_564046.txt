Accounting for sampling effort of independent variables in a regression analysis

I would like the test whether the frequency of a cellular structure on a histology section is associated with (binary) patient outcomes. This would be a simple logistic regression of i.e. glm(outcome ~ structure_frequency) . However, the size of the histology sections vary between patients, and I want to properly account for this difference in sampling effort (more structures will be counted on larger sections). Offsets are used to account for sampling effort in the dependent variable, but how can I achieve a similar effect for independent variables?
