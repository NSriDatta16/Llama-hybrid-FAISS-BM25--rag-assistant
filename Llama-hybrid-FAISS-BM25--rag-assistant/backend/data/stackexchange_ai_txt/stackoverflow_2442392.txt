They do make object code bigger, because C++ generates code for every type you use. But I don't believe this will slow execution speed. I have no numbers to suggest that it would. It certainly does improve your lot in life during code development, reading and maintenance. I would not let coding urban myths discourage you from using a language feature that's clearly useful.
