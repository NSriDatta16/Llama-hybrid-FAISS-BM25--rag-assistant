How should I include an external php file in magento module?

I am creating some magento module, and I need to use some 3rdParty classes "ThiredPartyClassA" and "ThiredPartyClassB" that are in an external file "thirdPartyCode.php". where should I place the file thirdPartyCode.php ? and how should I refer (require_once) to if so that I can use it within one of my Action handlers ? Thanks, Eyal
