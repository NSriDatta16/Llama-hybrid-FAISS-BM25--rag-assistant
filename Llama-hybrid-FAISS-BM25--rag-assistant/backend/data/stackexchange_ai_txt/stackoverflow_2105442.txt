A and B are no related to each other by means of inheritance, which means that a pointer to B cannot be transformed into a pointer to A by means of either upcast or downcast. Since A and B are two different bases of C , what you are trying to do here is called a cross-cast . The only cast in C++ language that can perform a cross-cast is dynamic_cast . This is what you have to use in this case in case you really need it (do you?) B* b = new C(); A* a = dynamic_cast (b); assert(a != NULL); a->a();
