Can this type of flash dragging, dropping, and animation be done in a javascript library?

Sorry. I don't know a good title for this, but please look here: http://joshblog.net/projects/logic-gate-simulator/Logicly.html I saw this from delicious over the weekend. It is in flash and I wondered if something like this, as far as the graphics and interaction goes, could be done in javascript (jquery or other library, not rolling my own.) Again, I do not mean logic gates specifically but more the dragging, dropping and the drawing lines between objects, moving them around, etc. Does anyone know of a website that has something like this in javascript? It kind of reminds me of dragging and dropping points on google maps but nicer. Thank you.
