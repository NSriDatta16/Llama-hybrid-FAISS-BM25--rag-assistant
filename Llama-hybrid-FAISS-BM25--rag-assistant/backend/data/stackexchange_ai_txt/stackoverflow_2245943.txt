The sort command would be a good place to start. You should be able to sort by the first dimension, then the second, then the third. I'm not too familiar with RGB values, so I'm not completely sure if sorting the dimensions separately will result in matching colors being grouped together, but some sort of adaptation to the process I described above should do the trick. EDIT: Including the sort index will avoid breaking up the RGB colors. Example: x=[5,6;4,7;3,8;2,9;1,10]; [x1,index]=sort(x(:,1)); x2=x(index,2); x=[x1 x2]; The sortrows command would probably be more elegant, but I was previously not aware of it. HPM's right on that account.
