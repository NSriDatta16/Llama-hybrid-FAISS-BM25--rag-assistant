Now if a MA(âˆž) representation can be written in terms of an AR(1)... This is not always possible. Consider the following MA($\infty$) model: $$ X_t = \sum_{j=0}^{\infty}\psi_j Z_{t-j}, $$ where $\psi_0 = 1$, $\psi_1 = .7$, and for $k \ge 2$, $\psi_k = .7\psi_{k-2} - .1\psi_{k-3}$. This is equivalent to the causal AR(2) model $$ X_t = .7 X_{t-1} - .1X_{t-2} + Z_t. $$ So an ARMA model can be more economical than an AR model. Is there a way to prove it? Yes, here is one example. The following is an invertible (and causal but it doesn't matter here) ARMA(1,1) process: $$ X_t - .5X_{t-1} = Z_t + .4Z_{t-1}. $$ If we wanted to write it in terms of only AR components, it would be an AR($\infty$) process. It is equivalent to $$ \sum_{j=0}^{\infty}\pi_j X_{t-j} = Z_t, $$ where $\pi_0 = 1$, $\pi_j = -(.4 + .5)(-.4)^{j-1}$ for $j \ge 1$. Do you have some books to suggest? These examples are from Introduction to Time Series and Forecasting by Brockwell and Davis (3rd edition) .
