The ROC curve plots specificity vs sensitivity which varies with the threshold of a covariate (which may be continuous or discrete). I think you are confusing the covariate with the response and perhaps do not fully understand what an ROC curve is. It is certainly a curve if the covariate is continuous and we look at a threshold for the covariate changing continuously. If the covariate is discrete you can still plot it as a function of a continuous threshold. Then the curve would be flat with steps up (or down) at thresholds that correspond to the discrete values of the covariate. So this would apply to SVM and any other discrete classifiers. Regarding AUC since we still have an ROC (an estimated one), we can still compute the area under it. I am not sure what you had in mind with your question about cross-validation. In the context of classification problems, cross-validation is used to get unbiased or nearly unbiased estimates of error rates for the classifier. So it can enter into how we estimate the points on the ROC.
