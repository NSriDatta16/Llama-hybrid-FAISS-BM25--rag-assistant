b2.Save(destinationFileName); You didn't specify the image file format. The default is PNG, not BMP. You now probably have a .bmp file on disk that actually contains a PNG image. That can go undetected for quite a while, lots of graphics programs pay attention to the file header instead of the file name extension. MSPaint for example will have no trouble loading the file. Just like any other program that uses GDI+. You might not be so lucky with a program that blindly assumes that the file contains a BMP and does no checking at all. Fix: b2.Save(destinationFilename, System.Drawing.Imaging.ImageFormat.Bmp);
