A simple method is to use sort_by with some arbitrary formatted string, like: countries.sort_by do |c| "%010d-%010d-%010d-%s" % [ c.gold, c.silver, c.bronze, c.name ] end This converts all the countries in to an ASCII sortable listing by padding the number of medals won to the presumably outrageous 10 places. If anyone wins more than ten billion medals your program may malfunction, but that seems like a reasonable constraint.
