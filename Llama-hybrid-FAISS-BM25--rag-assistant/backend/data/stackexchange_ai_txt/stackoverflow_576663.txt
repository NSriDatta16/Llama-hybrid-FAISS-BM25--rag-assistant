A nice little trick is that the icon in the adress bar of explorer could be dragged to a command line window and it insert the full path at your current cursor position. It doesn't work in vista but if you SHIFT-RightClick on a folder you have an "Open Command Windows Here" option that appears. Under xp you could have it by saving this as a .reg and executing it : Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00 [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\Folder\shell\cmd] @="Open Command Prompt Here" [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\Folder\shell\cmd\command] @="cmd.exe /k pushd %L"
