I got the same problem. Took me whole night to solve. The doc gave the wrong instruction - therefore all your archives are created but their size is zero. You can verify this by going to their directory (...derived data...) Anyway, in the "Skip Install", set the value for "Release" as "NO" (the help doc told you the opposite). Once you set it to "NO", archive again. You'll immediately see your app showing up in the archive organizer.
