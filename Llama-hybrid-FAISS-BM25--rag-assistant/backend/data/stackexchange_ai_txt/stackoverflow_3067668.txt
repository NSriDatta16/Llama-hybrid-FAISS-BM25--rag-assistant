Data Binding, DataTemaplates and DataSets... Data Bound TextBox not Updating Underlying Source?

In my WPF App I've got a ListBox. This ListBox is bound to a Dataset(i used the Click-Drag Method onto the Window). The Listbox has a DataTemplate, and the Elements(TextBox's) of this DataTemplate is Bound to the Columns of the Dataset. All works well, the ListBox displays the information correctly. The Problem i'm having is with updating the Underlying Source bound to the objects. The TextBox's UpdateSourceTrigger is set to LostFocus, and the Mode is set to TwoWay. When i edit the Text in the TextBox, and i click a way, the change reflects in the TextBox. When i close the application and open it again, value is reverted to what it was before the change. I've even tried the "UpdateSourceTrigger=Explicit" and "UpdateSourceTrigger=PropertyChanged" of the TextBox, but to no avail. I've studied some examples I've found online and what they're telling me is what i am doing. I just cant understand what i'm doing wrong?
