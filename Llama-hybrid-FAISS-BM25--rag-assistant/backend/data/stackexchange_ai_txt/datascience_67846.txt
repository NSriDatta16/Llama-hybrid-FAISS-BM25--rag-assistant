Answering your questions below. 1) How common is this sort of behavior in the data science world? Not all fingers are equal. Some people are selfish. Dataset is not personal to anyone. They are made public for us to use. Either search dataset online or report this act to your supervisor. 2) Are there good reasons for it, or is it just how people assert power in this space? No good reasons. It is only an act to ensure that they don't loose their importance and dependency. 3) Is the problem most likely my approach to data, or my approach to people? I assume that these are public data. Try searching online with the dataset name or ask for help from your guide or supervisor.
