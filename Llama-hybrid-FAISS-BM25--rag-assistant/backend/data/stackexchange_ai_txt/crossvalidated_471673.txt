auto.arima with regressors

A simple question, but I have not found it anywhere. I have worked with time series for a while, but am new to R. I want to predict future values of Y (all I care about are the forecast) when I believe certain regressors impact these results. I understand that auto.arima allows this capacity, but what is not clear to me is if to use this capacity you first have to forecast the future x values and provide this to R (essentially pre-whitening the data like multivariate ARIMA) or whether auto.arima is projecting the future values of the regressors itself (essentially pre-whitening the regressors for you). I think you use a training data set for the X in the auto.arima that you provide, to determine the Arima model. Then you use a projected future group of X (which you again provide)as the regressor in the predict statement. Something like packagefit
