Overhead when using keyword this?

The scope of my question is solely ASP.NET, as the answer may be different for Java and any other C based language. How much overhead is involved when using the keyword "this" within a class to dereference a property? It seems that I've seen certain sources try to discourage the use of "this" for dereferencing, but generaly I've just ignored them until now.
