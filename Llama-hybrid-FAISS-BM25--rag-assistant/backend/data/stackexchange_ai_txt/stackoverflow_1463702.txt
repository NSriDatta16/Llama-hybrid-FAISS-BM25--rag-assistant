It looks like you have stumbled upon an issue in FileHelpers. What is happening is that the ExcelStorage.ExtractRecords method uses an empty cell check to see if it has reached the end of the sheet. This can be seen in the ExcelStorage.cs source code: while (CellAsString(cRow, mStartColumn) != String.Empty) { try { recordNumber++; Notify(mNotifyHandler, mProgressMode, recordNumber, -1); colValues = RowValues(cRow, mStartColumn, RecordFieldCount); object record = ValuesToRecord(colValues); res.Add(record); } catch (Exception ex) { // Code removed for this example } } So if the start column of any row is empty then it assumes that the file is done. Some options to get around this: Don't put any empty cells in the first column position. Don't use excel as your file format -- convert to CSV first. See if you can get a patch from the developer or patch the source yourself. The first two are workarounds (and not really good ones). The third option might be the best but what is the end of file condition? Probably an entire row that is empty would be a good enough check (but even that might not work in all cases all of the time).
