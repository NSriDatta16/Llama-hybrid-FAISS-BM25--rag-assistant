I'm in the same boat as you right now - I'm just learning Cocoa, I've read the Hillegass book, and I'm building a Core Data app that pulls from a Web Service. I've figured out how to get my app populating a table view from a web service successfully, but I have no idea if the way I'm doing is the right way or best practices. Here's what I did: I created a Core Data model with the same attributes as the entity coming from the Web Service. In Interface Builder, I created a table view and set up the bindings between the table columns and the Core Data attributes. When the app launches, I pull down the data from the Web Service, loop through the items, and create new entities. The table view then automatically recognizes the new data and populates itself. The Core Data book from Pragmatic Programmers , as well as this question both helped me: JSON to Persistent Data Store (CoreData, etc.) I haven't tackled the syncing issue (adding new items, updating existing) but I have this doc bookmarked for when I do: http://developer.apple.com/Mac/library/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CoreData/Articles/cdImporting.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40003174
