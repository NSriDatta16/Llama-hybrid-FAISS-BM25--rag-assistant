Understanding MFA and MCA with FactoMineR

I'm working on a project where I have to perform MCA and MFA. My dataset contains the following data (for context). Also I created some extra variables: WeightTried* for each lift, that has the absolute value to remove the negative values Lifted*? for each lift, that is Not lifted if the lift was Lifted otherwise. There are several questions that I have regarding those methods: What are the support groups and the active groups ? What is the importance of those in MCA and MFA? Why we use cos2 as a metric? My explained variance for 2 dimensions is around 22 percent. Is that important in this kind of analysis? As we have more categories, I could think that is not as important as in the PCA. Thanks
