EF4 Generic Search by ID

I have x number of tables and all tables have a uniqueidentifier/guid primary key. I want to write a generic function that will take a Guid param id where T is EntityObject like so... public T SelectById (Guid id) where T : EntityObject It seems like this would be a simple thing to do. I've scoured the internet and can't quite find a way to do it, much less an elegant way. What am I missing here, why is this difficult?
