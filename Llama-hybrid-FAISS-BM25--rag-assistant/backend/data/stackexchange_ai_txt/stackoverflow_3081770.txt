git will be no less appropriate for a corporate environment than something like CVS or SVN. There is nothing in the design or implementation that makes it inappropriate for the corporate environment. You'll probably end up using a hybrid approach: each developer will have a local git repository and will push back to an internal origin (a central spoke) to keep with the corporation's backup policies and to give the the boss that warm and fuzzy, 'my code is safe' on the repository.corpration.com machine. As you mentioned, github can act as your origin. Have a look at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)#Projects_using_Git for a list of large organizations (open source and non-open source) using git. Also take a look at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XpnKHJAok8 and pay particular attention when Linus tells Google that their current revision control system sucks and that they'd be much better off with git.
