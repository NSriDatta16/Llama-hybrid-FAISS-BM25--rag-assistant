Accessing the root visual of a ContentPresenter hosting a DataTemplate

I'm working with the Adorner model with drag and drop, and I'm instantiating a DataTemplate through a ContentPresenter and adding it to the Adorner layer of my control/window. The problem I have is I need to register mouse events on the root visual element of the instantiated DataTemplate so I can change state and detect the drop in my Behavior. Since I'm writing a Behavior, I need to access this in code. I can try to attach the events to the presenter itself, but that doesn't do anything, I'm assuming I might be able to use TemplateBinding's in the DataTemplate, but I don't really want to put that burden on the person creating the DataTemplate. ContentPresenter presenter = new ContentPresenter(); presenter.Child = myDataTemplate; adornerLayer.Items.Add(presenter);
