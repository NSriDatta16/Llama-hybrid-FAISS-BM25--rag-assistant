Database design - Data feeds from multiple sources

Whats the best way to store the same type of data in the same table fed from multiple sorces? My website table has multiple domains with one being facebook. Buisness rules state that one organisation can have multiple facebook addresses. I was orignailly planning on deleting all website address with the domain of facebook for a organisation each time I got a new feed from one of my sources, but that would delete the other facebook websites loaded from the other sources. What is the best way to over come this Should I keep a record of the source where each record was loaded from in the table, or should I have seperate domain names depending on the load i.e. webfacebook, source1facebook.
