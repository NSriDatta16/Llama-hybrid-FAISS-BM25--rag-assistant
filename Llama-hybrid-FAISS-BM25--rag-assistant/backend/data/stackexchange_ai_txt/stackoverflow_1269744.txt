Regarding your last statement, if you're talking about std::string instead use std::wstring. Toto has already answered the key question: just use L"" , WCHAR/wchar_t, and wstring everywhere that you'd normally use "" , char, and string. If you find yourself needing to convert between unicode and ansi, there lie the dragons. very evil dragons that will eat you alive if you don't understand code pages, UTF8, and so on. but for most types of applications this is the 2% case, if that. the rest is easy as long as you stay all-unicode.
