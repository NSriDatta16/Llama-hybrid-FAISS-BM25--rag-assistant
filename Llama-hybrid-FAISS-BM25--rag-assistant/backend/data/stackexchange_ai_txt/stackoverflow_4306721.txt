Rails 3.0.1 and Paperclip - Image not resizing

I have the following code on my model: has_attached_file :photo, :styles => { :small => "150x150#" }, :storage => :s3, :s3_credentials => "#{RAILS_ROOT}/config/s3.yml", :path => "/photo/:id/:style/:filename", :s3_headers => { 'Cache-Control' => 'max-age=315576000', 'Expires' => 10.years.from_now.httpdate } When an image is uploaded, only the original is saved, the styles are not working. There is no small file generated.
