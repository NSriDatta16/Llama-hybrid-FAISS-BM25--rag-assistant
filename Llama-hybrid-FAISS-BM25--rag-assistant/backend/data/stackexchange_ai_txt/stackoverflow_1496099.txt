Might I also suggest module-starter ? It'll automatically create a skeleton project which "Just Works". I learned what little I know about Perl modules organization by reading the generated skeleton files. It's all well-documented, and quite easy to use as a base for growing a larger project in. You can check out the getting-started docs to see what it gives you. Running module-starter will give you a Perl distribution, consisting of a number of modules (use the command line option --module , such as: module-starter --distro=Project --module=Project::Module::A,Project::Module::B [...] to create multiple modules in a single distribution). It's then up to you whether you'd prefer to organize your project as a single distribution consisting of a number of modules working together, or as a number of distributions which can be released separately but which depend on each other (as configured in your Build or Makefile.PL file) to provide a complete system.
