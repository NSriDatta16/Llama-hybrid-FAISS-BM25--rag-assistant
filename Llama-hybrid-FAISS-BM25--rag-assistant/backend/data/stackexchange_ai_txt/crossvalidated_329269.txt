Normalising features for One Class SVM

I have my feature space that is Year Month Day Hour Minute Second Lane Direction Speed Flag A sample vector would look like: [2015, 11, 5, 2, 20, 58, 4, 2, 45.7, 2] The features take the values: Year : 2012 - 2017 Month : 1 - 12 Day : 1 - 7 Hour - 0 - 23 Minute : 0 - 59 Second : 0 -59 Lane : 1 - 6 Direction : 1 - 2 Speed : continuous values Flag : 1-3 My data is time series data. I am unsure of how to normalise each of these features. For example the year feature, is it necessary to normalise them? Most of my features take discrete values. If I do normalise them, would my SVM model perform better than when I don't normalise them? Any suggestions on how to normalise time series data for SVM or reference to any papers will be appreciated.
