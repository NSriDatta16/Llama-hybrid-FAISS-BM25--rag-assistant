What is the best approach to estimate the differencing order of a FARIMA model?

I am trying to fit a FARIMA model to a monthly discharge time series with long memory properties and forecast it. I have seen two type of approaches: (1) estimate Hurst parameter to find d (d=H-0.5), fractionally difference the time series and fit an ARMA(p, q) model to the fractionally differenced time series. (2) Choose orders for p and q and estimate both parameters of ARMA and fractionally differencing order (d) by methods like MLE. There are functions like fracdiff in "fracdiff" package for this. Which one is the right approach? Should we estimate d before fitting FARIMA or it should be estimated simultaneously with ARMA parameters.
