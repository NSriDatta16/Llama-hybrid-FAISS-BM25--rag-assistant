The difference is that MCMC is stochastic whereas quadrature methods are deterministic. The latter are defined by picking weights and interpolation points, that are usually determined by the zeros of the family of orthogonal polynomials you choose. Quadrature methods are generally superior to simpler numerical integration schemes like the trapezoid rule, in that they give higher accuracy for less computation. However quadrature methods start to fail very badly in high dimensions because of the vast number of points you need to interpolate at, along with the fact that quadrature methods are blind to large variations in your function. As well quadrature methods do not work well with functions that are difficult to approximate with polynomials. With VEGAS monte carlo methods, you usually try to (randomly) pick areas where your function has larger values, which causes them to be more efficient than quadrature methods in a number of (ideal) situations.
