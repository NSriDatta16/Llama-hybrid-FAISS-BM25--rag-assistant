In MSTest there's no built-in way of doing it. This is about as 'elegant' as it gets: [TestMethod] public void Test8() { var t = new Thrower(); try { t.DoStuffThatThrows(); Assert.Fail("Exception expected."); } catch (InvalidOperationException e) { Assert.AreEqual("Boo hiss!", e.Message); } } However, you could consider porting xUnit.NET's Assert.Throws API to a custom library - that's what we did. You could also go to Microsoft Connect an vote on this suggestion .
