Ok, so after wrangling for some time, I found out that the best way to deal with text data is by use of standard tf-idf matrix and cosine similarity calculated therefore as described in any standard Information Retrieval literature. This captures most the similarity between two texts, documents and therefore is best to be applied instead of statistical techniques I have tried above.
