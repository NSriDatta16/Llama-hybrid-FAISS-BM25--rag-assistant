Ideal Java library for cleaning html, and escaping malformed fragments

I've got some HTML files that need to be parsed and cleaned, and they occasionally have content with special characters like , ", etc. which have not been properly escaped. I have tried running the files through jTidy, but the best I can get it to do is just omit the content it sees as malformed html. Is there a different library that will just escape the malformed fragments instead of omitting them? If not, any recommendations on what library would be easiest to modify? Clarification: Sample input: blah blah blah Desired output: blah blah &lt;M+1&gt; blah
