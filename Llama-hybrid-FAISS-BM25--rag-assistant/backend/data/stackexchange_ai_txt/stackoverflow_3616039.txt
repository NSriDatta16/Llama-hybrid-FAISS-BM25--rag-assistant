Your question is unclear, so I guess you want to "output data into an XML file" Outputing data into a file stream in an XML format could be something like: #include #include int main(int argc, char * argv[]) { TreeNode * root = doWhataverGizmoYouWantToCreateThat() ; int count = countNodes(root) ; delete root ; std::fstream output("output.xml", std::ios_base::out) output \n" ; output \n" ; return 0 ; } Please read the iostream help for more information about the fstream object and its uses: http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/iostream/ Now, if you want to parse and modify an existing XML, you'll need an XML parser. You can google those parsers, for example with: http://www.google.com/search?q=XML+c%2B%2B+parser Edit: After reading the comments : XML is a kind of organized text file. Somewhat like HTML, if is about elements, attributes, and data. For example, this is an XML file content: Some text value For more information, read : http://www.google.com/search?q=XML
