Nested effect in GLM

I am sorry that my question repeats many others already available here. However I have read many of them (e.g. this , this and this ) as well as other documents and I am still not sure about my model. I have the following sampling protocol. I study the effect of crop species (e.g. wheat, barley, ...) and other parameters (e.g. humidity) on vegetation. I have 4 different crops. For each crop we randomly chose 5 plots (independant one to each other). In each plot we sampled 5 microplots to measure species richness and humidity (1 measurement per microplot). For some other measurements (e.g. abundance) we went one level further, with 25 squares in each microplot (1 measurement per square). The 5 microplots within each plot (and the squares within each microplot) are not independant. So I should use random, nested effectsto avoid pseudoreplication. # Microplot level modAb = glmer(Richness ~ Crop + Humidity (1|Crop/Plot), family = poisson) # Square level modAb = glmer(Abundance ~ Crop + Humidity (1|Crop/Plot/Microplot), family = poisson) But I have quite few observations, and I read that random effects in such situation were not very appropriate. So is it the proper way to do it? Should I rather average my results on each plot? Any confirmation / guidance will be much appreciated!
