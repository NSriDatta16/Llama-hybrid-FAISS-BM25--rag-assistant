TBPTT the same thing as normal backpropagation. People rename "BP for RNNs" as "BPTT" in order to explicitly point out that the graph must be unrolled. But that doesn't change the algorithm itself, it's just a teaching aid. The "truncation" in TBPTT simply falls out as a logical consequence of the fact that you can only work on sequence of a finite length on physical hardware. So there is no need to "switch" between them or anything like that, because they're the same thing!
