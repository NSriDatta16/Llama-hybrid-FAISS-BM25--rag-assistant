Drag file from desktop to IE and upload

For a project I'm working on I would like the user to be able to drag a file from the desktop or windows explorer and drop it on a web page in IE and have it uploaded to the web server. I've read that its possible with ActiveX but have not found anything about it. Anyone know how to do this and where I can get what I need? Thanks!
