google storage acl change on existing object

im having problems understanding how to put all the headers together to change an acl on an exixting object on google storage for developers. i need to do this manually without boto or other helper libs. what i need to do is basically set an object from public to private and the other way around. this is basically the example i found on the developers guide PUT /paris.jpg?acl HTTP/1.1 Host: travel-maps.commondatastorage.googleapis.com Date: Mon, 15 Feb 2008 21:30:39 GMT Content-Length: 0 Authorization: GOOG1 GOOGTS7C7FUP3AIRVJTE:Y9gBLAEInIlFv5zlAm9ts= x-goog-acl: private what is not clear to me and where im stuck is how i build the signature. the signature is composed by: Signature = Base64-Encoding-Of(HMAC-SHA1(UTF-8-Encoding-Of(YourGoogleStorageSecretKey, MessageToBeSigned))) i dont know which header parts i should include, exclude, newlines.... to compose the MessageToBeSigned. does anyone have a python sample code where he is doing something similar? thank you!
