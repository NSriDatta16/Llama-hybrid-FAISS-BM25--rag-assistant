EM is a very general method to estimate the parameters of probabilistic models with latent variables. In fact, it is so general that it can come along your computer vision way in so many different ways. E.g., as Anony-Mousse said, EM is essentially what is behind K-Means which can be used to find good representations of patches of pictures. Also, EM can be used to estimate the parameters of... a Kalman Filter, which you might want to use for tracking of objects in a video, factor analysis or probabilistic PCA, which are ways of reducing the dimensionality of data (e.g. for face recognition), a student-T distribution, which is better at representing the statistics of natural images than other classic distributions.
