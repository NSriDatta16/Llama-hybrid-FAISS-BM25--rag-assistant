Would the following do the trick? User-agent: * Disallow: /2010/category-name/*/ You might need to explicitly allow certain folders under /2010/category-name : User-agent: * Disallow: /2010/category-name/ Allow: /2010/category-name/product-name-1/ Allow: /2010/category-name/product-name-2/ But according to this article , Allow field is not within the standard, so some crawlers might not support it. EDIT: I just found another resource to be used within each page. This page explains it well: The basic idea is that if you include a tag like: in your HTML document, that document won't be indexed. If you do: the links in that document will not be parsed by the robot.
