It looks like you need to explore the Ordnance Survey OpenData dataset . The UK doesn't have zip codes; rather, it has postcodes , which are much more precise. For example the building where I work has a postcode to itself, BS1 2PH. Commercial organisations that validate postcodes use the Postcode Address File , which is commercially licensed (and expensive!), mostly as maintaining a per-premise address format is very time-consuming. In practice most Web sites. etc. use Web services such as Postcode Anywhere which aggregate and resell the data.
