What are some examples of applied machine learning problems that requires using mixed models?

What are some examples of applied machine learning problems that requires using mixed models? I'm just introduced to the notion of mixed models. As I understand it, it is a combination of parametric model such as logistic function and non-parametric model attempting to model random effects that can be intractable with parametric models. What are some real-world examples that might be useful to develop some intuition or big-picture understanding of this method?
