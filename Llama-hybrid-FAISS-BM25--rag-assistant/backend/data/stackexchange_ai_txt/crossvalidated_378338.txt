How can I mix image and data into a CNN

I've recently been testing around tensorflow and keras and I've been doing a project to classify images. So far it's been working but now I want to use real data mixed with the image in order to solve a different problem. Imagine that I have a camera that takes pictures of a living room and then, combined with the input from sensors I want it to do a different classification. Basically a CNN mixed with a regular ANN.
