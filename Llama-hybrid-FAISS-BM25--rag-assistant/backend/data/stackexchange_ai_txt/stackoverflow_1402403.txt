There are many similarities between them, so I will only try to outline their differences . Neural networks Are able to analyze online patterns (those that change over time). Generally, this is a time-varying sample that needs to be matched and predicted. Examples : Graph extrapolation Facial recognition Genetic algorithms Used when you can code attributes that you think may contribute to a specific, non-changing problem. The emphasis is on being able to code these attributes (sometimes you know what they are) and that the problem is to a large degree unchanging (otherwise evolutions don't converge). Examples : Scheduling airplanes/shipping Timetables. Finding the best characteristics for a simple agent in an artificial environment Rendering an approximation of a picture with random polygons
