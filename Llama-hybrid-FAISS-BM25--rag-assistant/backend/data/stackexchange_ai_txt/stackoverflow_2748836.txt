There is a reasonable article on MSDN about multi-tenant data architecture which you might wish to refer to. Some key topics touched on by this article: Economic considerations Security Tenant considerations Regulatory (legal) Skill set concerns Also touched upon are some patterns for Software as a Service (SaaS) configuration. Additionally, worth a gander is an interesting write-up from the SQL Anywhere guys . My own personal take - unless you are certain of enforced security / trust, I would go with option 3, or if scalability concerns prohibit fallback to option 2 at a minimum. That said... I'm no pro with MongoDB. I get pretty nervous using a shared "schema" - but I will happily defer to more experienced practitioners.
