Interpreting coefficients for Poisson regression

I don't understand how to interpret the coefficient from a Poisson regression relative to the coefficient from an OLS regression. Suppose I have time series data, my left-hand side variable is number of games won per year, and my main right-hand side variable is NASDAQ value. If my preferred specification is to interpret the model as in percentage terms, I take the log transformation of games won. I can also take the log of the NASDAQ to say how much a 1 percent increase in the NASDAQ would increase the percent of games won. Now, I acknowledge that a Poisson model might make sense because the data for games won are counts and not continuous. I run the regression with say many, many control variables. Would I not do a log-transformation on games won and instead use only games? When I get the coefficients, do I do some sort of marginal effects calculation (as can be done for probit)? How do I interpret these coefficients? How do I compare the interpretation of the Poisson to OLS--either the OLS that is log-transformed or the OLS that is not? I know this sort of question has been asked before, but I still don't quite get it.
