I find your question bit convoluted, so I will answer with the following bullet points: Train your own word embeddings : There are many implementations out there, gensim is one. Find related articles : On that point, without being an expert, I would suggest to do some research on Topic Modelling . There are also a lot of libraries you can use. Word embeddings to sentence embeddings : This process is not as straightforward, the semantics change just by adding words together. You can use Word Mover's Distance or numerous other which train in a supervised way sentence embeddings or unsupervised .
