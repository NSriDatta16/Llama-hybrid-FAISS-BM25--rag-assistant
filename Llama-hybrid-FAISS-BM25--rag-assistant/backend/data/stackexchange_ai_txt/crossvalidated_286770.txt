Confused on kpss.test shows both "Trend" and "Level" are smaller than p-value R

I am fairly new to time series analysis. I am using hourly data for six months time period. My time series has seasonality every week. Per Dr.Robert Hyndman I set up my time series variable and then did a kpss.test, cooltemp = ts(training$vol, frequency = 168) checkl output of checkl was, KPSS Test for Level Stationarity data: cooltemp KPSS Level = 4.0716, Truncation lag parameter = 13, p-value = 0.01 output of check checkt was , KPSS Test for Trend Stationarity data: cooltemp KPSS Trend = 1.24, Truncation lag parameter = 13, p-value = 0.01 There is a weekly seasonality in the data and I assume for checkt , it should be "p-value greater than printed p-value" for Trend. The reason is, i checked with the example, x The result of xt is, KPSS Test for Trend Stationarity data: x KPSS Trend = 0.042451, Truncation lag parameter = 7, p-value = 0.1 that shows that Trend station null hypothesis can be accepted. And the result of xl is KPSS Test for Level Stationarity data: x KPSS Level = 12.598, Truncation lag parameter = 7, p-value = 0.01 The result of null hypothesis level can be rejected. I am confused on how to interpret in my case, where I get both are 0.01, where I have to reject both of my null hypothesis.
