It's good to know ANN can create any function f(x) or f(x,y,z,..) or any multifunction for that matter. But it's also important to know that functions have limits in how they can classify data...there are more complex relations subsets of powersets of objects, which are important in classification and these are not described by such functions in an elegant or natural way, but are important in language and classifying objects. ANN can accomplish this however as well.
