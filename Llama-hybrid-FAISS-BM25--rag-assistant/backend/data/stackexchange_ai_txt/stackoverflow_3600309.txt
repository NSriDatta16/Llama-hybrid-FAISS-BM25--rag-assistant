You have two options here as I see it: 1) Add the additional property as a read-only mapped property to your entity, making use of the formula mapping to derive the value using inline sql or a udf. 2) Get only the data you need back using a custom hql query and use the aliastobeanresulttransformer to project to a strongly-typed dto that includes your fields of interest. Which route you go is really up to you, but I'd tend to lean towards option #2 so as not to pollute your domain model with unneeded fields.
