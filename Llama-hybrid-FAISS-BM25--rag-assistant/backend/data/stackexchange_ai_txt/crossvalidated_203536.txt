Actually the height example is related to the CLT. The reason why the normal distribution is so common is because (as per the wikipedia article) 'averages of random variables independently drawn from independent distributions converge in distribution to the normal' Height has lots of random variables - genetics, diet, pollution, and tons of other effects. It's the concert of all of these small effects that can lead something like height to be normally distributed.
