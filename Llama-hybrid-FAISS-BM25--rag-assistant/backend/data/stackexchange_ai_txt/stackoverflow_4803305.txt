Create a unique identifier using SQL

Is there some SQL coding which can generate a unique identifier on the click of a get default button? I'm looking for a system to number physical paper files before they are placed into storage. Problem is there are 3 offices, and each office needs a sequential number system (i.e. P001, P002, P003 and C001, C002...). Below is the code i have so far to generate the prefix to the unique id number. SELECT CASE WHEN ptBranch=3 THEN 'P' WHEN ptBranch=4 THEN 'A' ELSE 'C' END + CONVERT(VARCHAR(2),GETDATE(),12) FROM LAMatter WHERE ptMatter = $Matter$ The idea will be that the code could generate the whole file number e.g. P110001, P110002 (where P, C or A denotes the office the file is in, and 11 denotes the year the file was placed into storage) any pointers greatly appreciated
