I would use a MemoryStream object to write the data to a memory buffer. But It all depends on your business layer, if it's fexible enough to output data to arbitrary streams. Alternatively, if on Unix-like machine, mount a folder using ramfs and use that for temp storage, so the file is stored in memory. But I guess small chance you are using ASP.NET with Linux/BSD.
