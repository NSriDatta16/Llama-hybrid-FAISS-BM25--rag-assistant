public class MyPictureBox : PictureBox { public MyPictureBox(...) :base(....) {} // duplicated ctors public string CustomString {get; set;} } Now, using it will be a bit trickier. If you've created the original picturebox by drag'n'dropping it in the Winforms designer, then you'll have to go into the myform.designer.cs file, and replace the instances of "PictureBox" with "MyPictureBox"
