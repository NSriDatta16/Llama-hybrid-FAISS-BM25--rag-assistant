Depending on how much data you have, a good approach should be some form of a neural network based encoder-decoder. The are plenty of results for "neural network image denoising" on google but a common approach will be: Start with your input image Pass it through smaller and smaller convolutional layers Upscale it back through bigger and bigger deconvolutional layers (usually this part is a mirroring of the first, convolutional, phase) Compare the output to your expected results
