Group items in a Sortable list with jQueryUI

I'd like to be able to group items in a sortable list. If I group two items, then those two should be dragged together and be put inside a container that I can style. Those items inside that group should be able to be dragged as well inside the group, but that's just a bonus :) Does anyone know if this is "possible" jQueryUI Sortables?
