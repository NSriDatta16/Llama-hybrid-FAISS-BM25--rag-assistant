Strategy for Automated UI testing on remote virtual machines

I'm using TeamCity for my CI builds, and I'd like to set up a second build for running automated UI tests on Windows XP and Windows 7 virtual machines. I imagine the build working as follows: Compile, run unit tests, etc. Prepare MSI using WiX Copy MSI to target test machines Remotely execute MSI's Copy test harness code to remote machine Run tests Build finishes The automated UI tests are written using NUnit and would need to be run directly on the test virtual machine (they can't run remotely). It's important that if the tests fail, it appears in the TeamCity build log and the build fails. I'd rather not install VS or the TeamCity build agents on either of the test virtual machines. It seems that most of this should be possible using psexec.exe . Are there any alternative (preferably open source) tools that I should look at?
