There is no reason you cannot use harmonic regressors with logistic regression. This: Does a logistic regression end up modelling linear relationships? references papers doing something like that. Without knowing more of your context we cannot say much more, the details of how to implement this might vary depending on sample size and other details. If you add more context I can try to say more.
