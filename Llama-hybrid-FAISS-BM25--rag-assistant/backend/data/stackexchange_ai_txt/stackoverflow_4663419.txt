Regarding @apneadiving's comment on caching the parts of the app, you'd use the fragment caching to handle that. http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionController/Caching/Fragments.html You can load contents of the "main" part of your page using the approach here (using jQuery) Replace HTML page with contents retrieved via AJAX Unless you know that your site's performance is unacceptable and that ajax will fix an issue you should probably avoid complicating things by using ajax. Remember premature optimization is the root of all evil :)
