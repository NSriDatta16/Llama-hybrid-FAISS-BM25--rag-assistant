A simple and very popular approach is to use mixed models to consider the dependence in longitudinal data. Of simple, I mean there are a few free softwares that you can use to fit your model. If your response variable is discrete, you may apply generalized linear mixed models. Then, you can use R packages "lmer", for likelihood based analysis, or "INLA", for Bayesian analysis.
