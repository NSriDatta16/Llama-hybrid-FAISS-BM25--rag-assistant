how to read time series data? Horizontally or vertically?

Currently I'm reading "Times series analysis and forecast by example", the data given in the appendix is just a bunch of numbers in a table, do the time series read vertically or horizontally? Assuming $t_1$ is $17.0$ , is $t_2$ $16.6$ or $17.6$ ?
