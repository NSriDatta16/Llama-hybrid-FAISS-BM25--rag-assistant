How to change standard resources on phone/emulator

I'm a new in Android and Java and I have the following problem. I want to change standard resources, such as button background, programatically to allow applications using standard buttons be displayed with custom background. My problem is - how shall I identify the path for retrieval resources on phone or emulator? And if we have permissions to access to those resources?
