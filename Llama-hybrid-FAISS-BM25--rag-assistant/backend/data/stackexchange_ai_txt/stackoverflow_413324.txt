there is code in the SQL Server 2008 database engine that supports the intellisense feature in Management Studio 2008. No there isn't. You're entirely wrong, and should be slapped with a wet fish. All it is doing is interrogating the various INFORMATION_SCHEMA virtual tables to do discovery. The reason they disabled it against prior versions is that theoretically it might encourage you to use a syntax that is only valid against 2005, but lots of people were using it with 100% success. Of course the real reason they disabled it is that it reduced one advantage of upgrading your servers to 2008 (which is where they make the real money).
