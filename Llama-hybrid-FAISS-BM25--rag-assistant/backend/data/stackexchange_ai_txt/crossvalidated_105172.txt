Squared random variable $X^2$ vs $X\times X$

As I understand a random variable represents all possible outcomes of an experiment with their associated probabilities. Why $X^2$ is understood as squaring outcomes of experiments instead of as multiplying the results of two identical experiments? Let's X be a throw of a die. I've seen examples where expected value of $X^2$ is calculated as: $$ 1^2\dfrac{1}{6} + 2^2\dfrac{1}{6} + 3^2\dfrac{1}{6} + 4^2\dfrac{1}{6} + 5^2\dfrac{1}{6} + 6^2\dfrac{1}{6} = 15.16 $$ So here we just squaring the outcome of a single experiment. But in math square can be replaced by multiplication. Like: $X\times X$. And for multiplication of two random variable we probably need to construct a product distribution. As I understand it should be something like throwing 2 dice, multiplying the results, and then calculating the average of these values. So as both X are independent in this case expected value can be found as $E[XY]=E[X]E[Y]$. I.e. $3.5 *3.5 = 12.25$
