I assume that you use the independence assumption, but with your sample sizes, I tend to distrust it! There must be some subgroups in your data, you did not give much details --- but maybe country, age, something else. There might be variation of churn rate with some such groups, and if the distribution of such variables are different within your tree treatment groups, that contributes to the differences you have observed. The standard errors computed from the binomial distribution will then be too small ( unobserved heterogeneity ). Some calculations with your data: control enabled - control [1] 0.006677 > ( enabled - control)/(disabled - control) [1] 2.139378 so your disabled group is almost midpoint between control and enabled. One idea could be to treat control and disabled as two control groups, and then the difference between them is really caused by the variance (including non-binomial variance) and that could be a basis for an alternative analysis. For now, here is a stored google scholar search for papers about analysis with two control groups. I will look into it ... but out of time now. EDIT After the question included more information. Since there are additional variables like age range, gender, country, this can be controlled for, and will help to control/estimate (binomial) overdispersion. One way to do it is using a mixed effects logistic regression, which are discussed in many posts at this site, for instance How can I deal with overdispersion in a logistic (binomial) glm using R? , Overdispersion in logistic regression , difference between mixed effect logistic regression and logistic regression
