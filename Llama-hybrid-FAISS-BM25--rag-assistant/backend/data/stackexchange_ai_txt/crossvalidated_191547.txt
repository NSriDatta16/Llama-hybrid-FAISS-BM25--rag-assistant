In order to check if your time series is stationary, I recommend Dickey-Fuller and KPSS tests. In your case, the series clearly exhibits autocorrelation, so you should could use an Augmented Dickey-Fuller test (ADF) . It will model the seasonality and test against a unit root (aka nonstationarity). Make sure that you do use the ADF, not the regular DF. In your case, periodicities are clearly present, and the DF distribution will not give you the right critical values. If you want to be on the safe side, you can additionally perform a KPSS test (which, unlike DF-type of tests takes the null hypothesis to be stationarity and tests against a unit root).
