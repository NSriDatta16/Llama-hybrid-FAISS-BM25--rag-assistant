You should know that owned relationships on App Engine are very different from the JDO spec. Owned relationships actually create an Entity Group which is a storage graph. More info here http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/java/datastore/jdo/relationships.html So in most cases on app engine you are better off referencing other objects by Key. Unless you really meant to define an Entity Group graph. On the same note, I would advise you to avoid large inheritance trees (info in the same reference link above).
