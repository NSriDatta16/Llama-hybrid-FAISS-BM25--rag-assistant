If I understood your questions correctly, you wanted essentially remove disturbances from the time series and model the temperature as a time-variant response to the listed 4 predictors. One R package I used in the past is ' tsoutliers ' to model time series data with known outliers and/or temporary changes. The algorithm iteratively locates, remove outliers and refit the model. If I remember correctly, it uses t-statistics of the residual to identify if a given data point is considered to be an outlier, in your case disturbances. The paper Joint Estimation of Model Parameters and Outlier Effects in Time Series by Chen and Liu in 1993 provides the theoretic contexts if you were interested in that. There are plenty of documentations and cross-validation questions answered that probably can also help you.
