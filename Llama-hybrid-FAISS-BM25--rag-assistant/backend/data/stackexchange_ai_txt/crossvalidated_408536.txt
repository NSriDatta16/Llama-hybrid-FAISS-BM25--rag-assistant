How to use features in regression model with 2 of them in linear relation with the value to be predicted?

I am relative newbie to data science so please excuse me if its a trivial question. I have 6 features and want to predict the 'y'. These features are related to y in the training data-set as follows; (x-axis being the feature data points and y axis being the value to be learnt to predict) Just on observing this it seems that my y can be predicted by using Linear Regression using only Feature 1 & 6. Even if I wanted to use the other features; a) Can I ? b) Feature 3,5 & 2,4 can be combined ? The correlation matrix looks like this; varCorr = featureMatrix.corr() sns.heatmap(varCorr, xticklabels=varCorr.columns, yticklabels=varCorr.columns, annot=True) How can include other features for regression or is my dataset such that I have limited options (linear regression using 2 features) and should I look for more/better features ?
