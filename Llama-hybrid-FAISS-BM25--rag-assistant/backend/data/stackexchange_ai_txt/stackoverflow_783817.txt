How to make swoosh graphic/sound effect?

I have a UIImageView that can be dragged around with a finger. It is sized to an image in it, such as a ball or square. If the user accelerates very quicker, I'd like to trail the object with a blur of itself to give the appearance of going fast. Like what happens with warp speed. I also have a swoosh sound. I'd like the sound to last only as long as the user is accelerating. How can I accomplish these effects?
