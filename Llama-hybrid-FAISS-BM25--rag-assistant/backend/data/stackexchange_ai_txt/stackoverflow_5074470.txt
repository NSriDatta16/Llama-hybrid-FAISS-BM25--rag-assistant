These people are WRONG. You don't need a mac to develop iphone apps. There are many options for Iphone Development on PC. Airplay SDK is a great FREE tool for developing fast, high quality, portable code. It deploys to PC, mac, iphone, droid, and many others. DragonFire SDK costs money, and I would not use it before Airplay, but go ahead and check it out if you want. There are others I'm forgetting but you can do a quick search on google or stackoverflow for them.
