Magento Advance Search - Drop down box of color - Option "All" not coming

I am working on a magento project where advanced search page is already built. I have one attribute called "Color" having following values and also have made attribute property Yes for advance search. Blue Green Yellow. I also have updated form.php of mage/...so that instead of multiselect, drop down box will come. Now, in advance search Color drop down, I am not able to set "All" option. I want this because currently Blue is preselected and in each search, this criteria is added. I have not done any updates in other pages. Please help me. Jeff
