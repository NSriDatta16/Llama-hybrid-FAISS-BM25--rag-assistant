Find an annotation for an xml element in its associated schema-defined type

I have an xml type, USAddress, defined in a schema: Special Metadata Special Metadata And an XML element in a data instance document: Robert Smith 8 Oak Avenue Old Town PA 95819 This schema and instance data are not known at compile time, so all analysis is done dynamically. The simplicity of this schema is only for example purposes. Real schemas will be more complex. Assuming I have the schema loaded into an System.Xml.Schema.XmlSchema, as I visit each node in my instance xml document, how can I get the associated schema element and read its appinfo annotation?
