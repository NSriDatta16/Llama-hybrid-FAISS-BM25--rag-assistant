Time series modeling of choppy data

I'm trying to model 10 years of monthly time series data that is very choppy, and overall it has an upward trend. At first glance it looks like a strong seasonal series, however the test results indicate that it is definitely not seasonal. This is a pricing variable that I'm trying to model as a function of macroeconomic environment, such as interest rates and yield curves. I've tried linear OLS regression (proc reg), but I don't get a very good model with that. I've also tried autoregressive error models (proc autoreg), but it captures 7 lags of the error term as significant factors. I don't really want to include that many lag of the error term in the model. In addition, most of the macroeconomic variables become insignificant when I include all these error lags in the model. Any suggestions on modeling method/technique that could help me model this choppy data is really appreciated.
