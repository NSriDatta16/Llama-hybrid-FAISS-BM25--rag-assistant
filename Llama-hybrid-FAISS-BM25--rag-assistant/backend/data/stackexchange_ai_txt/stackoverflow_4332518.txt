is Git flexible enough to work as-is? Very much so. The way I used to do it, Let the designers work on the design branch or something similarly named and always have a single command to push. Developer merges the content from the design branch whenever he updates the server. In fact, merge will be a command, in the auto deployment script. To stage the design changes only and not the dev changes, you can always switch the branch in the staging to the design branch. For this you can provide the designer with a deploy script that pushes the latest changes, switches to the design branch. That being said, encourage the designers to use git, slowly and gradually. First hook them to the stash command. And pull. Then, ask them to create different branches. As for the bare repository, It is a standard way to keep all people in sync and there is no technical reason to have that one extra really. Except that most people use the github or an equivalent remote backup service that has a good web UI to communicate and co-ordinate, which defacto becomes the central bare repository.
