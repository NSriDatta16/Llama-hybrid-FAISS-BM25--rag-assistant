Best way to manage git repository

I am wondering what is the best way to organize git repository. I am building a web service that I will call Core, and an iPhone application that communicates with core. I want to store my repositories on github, what is the best way to organize this ? Should I create two repositories : - projectname-core - projectname-iphone Or should I have only one repository with 2 different branches iPhone and Core ? Cheers
