Is it okay to mix time windows in time series data?

Suppose you are using a tree-based regression model to predict the popularity of things over time. So if we wanted to predict the popularity of A in 2007, we would use A's popularity in 2006, 2005, and 2004, and if we wanted to predict the popularity of B in 2008, we would use B's popularity in 2007, 2006, 2005, and 2004. Would it be okay to put both those points in the same training set? I am concerned that the popularity of A in 2007 might affect the popularity of B in 2007 (so the label on one data point would affect the features on the other).
