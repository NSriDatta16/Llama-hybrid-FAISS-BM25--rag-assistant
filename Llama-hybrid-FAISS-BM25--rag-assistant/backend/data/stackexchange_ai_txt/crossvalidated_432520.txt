No if you stick to a Gaussian distribution. One alternative is to set the variance to be a very small number; thus, the sampling process is almost identical to picking the mean value. If you don't stick to a Gaussian distribution, some variants of VAE have been proposed, such as VQ-VAE or adversarial encoders. BTW, whether the Gaussian distribution in the VAE has variance or not, the model should be able to reach the highest likelihood as possible as it can, which is ensured by the objective function (maximizing the lower bound of data likelihood).
