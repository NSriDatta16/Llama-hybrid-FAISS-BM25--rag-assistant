Propensity score matching - different sample size

I have a dataset with death outcome and around 25 independent variables. I am planning to use logistic regression with PSM to understand the effect of treatment (a specific drug) which is one of the input variables on the outcome variable. I am using PSM for the first time and have been following tutorials here , here . Are the below called as different propensity score matching methods? PS matching PS weighting PS stratification PS as covariate Are the above the different PS matching methods? If they are not, can you please let me know what are the different Propensity score matching methods? Why is it said that we may/will get different pairs of data when we use different PSM methods? For ex, matching method 1 might give us 300 pairs of data (out of 2000 records in a dataset), another method gives only 100 pairs of data (out of 2000 records in a dataset). Why is this happening? How will this impact when we compute balance measures such as SMD ? Because the findings of SMD from each method may provide us different conclusion. Is there anything that we should do to address this? Can someone help me with this in ordinary laymen terms and link to step-step tutorial if any please?
