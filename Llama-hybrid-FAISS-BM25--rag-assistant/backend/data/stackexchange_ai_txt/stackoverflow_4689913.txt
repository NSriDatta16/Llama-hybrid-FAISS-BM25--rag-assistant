Hhhmm.. that sounds pretty tricky. NSTextField does some pretty similar things as it does not have its own editing facilities but rather delegates them to the parent window's "field editor" which is an instance of an invisible NSTextView. You also get a lot of the NSTextView behavior without a window in NSText. It might be worth checking how NSTextFields delegate to the field editor and see whether you can hook yourself into the field editor in the same way rather than doing your keyDown: events. Another possibility could be to create an invisible NSTextView and delegate each key press to it and then display the NSTextStorage associated with it in your own view. It sounds like you are in for a bit of pain, but that's what I would start by exploring. Of course, I'm no Cocoa Text Subsystem wizard.. I hope this helps.
