First of all one should not rely on #pragma once as the pragma directives are compiler dependent and might cause you a lot of trouble when porting your code to some other platform/compiler. What I prefer using is: #ifndef __MY_HEADER_FILE_NAME__H #define __MY_HEADER_FILE_NAME__H ... ... header file code here ... #endif /* #ifndef __MY_HEADER_FILE_NAME__H */ Coming back to your code, the problem could be because of the above mentioned problem (very less likely though) or could be because of some error/typo in decelration of cApplication App . There is also a possibility that D3Ddefs.h or cApplication.h is missing a semicolon some where in the file. Figuring out the exact reason based on the info that you have provided is a bit difficult. If one of the above mentioned things don't work for you, try posting a smaller version of your code that is causing the problem [Update] It is compiling fine for me. I am using the updated code and modified this part: class cApplication { private: ... --> replaced this with "int a;" }; SO I think the problem is some where in the class cAplication deceleration.
