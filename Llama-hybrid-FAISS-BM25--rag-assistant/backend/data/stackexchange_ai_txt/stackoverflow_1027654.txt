If you want to control the web service's responses via HTTP response codes, then you could indeed use a 404 to indicate this condition. However, I would think it's more natural to have the web service's response defined entirely in the body of the HTTP response, and just return 200 for a successful communication ("I understood your request and have sent you an appropriate response"). In this case then, you'd return 200 as normal with the payload of your request (XML or JSON or whatever) indicating that no matching entity was found I'd consider non-200 error codes similar to exceptions in conventional programming languages, and the HTTP response body more like the return code. Imagine if you were implementing this conventionally - would you throw an exception if no entity was found, or return null ? Personally, given the fragile nature of network connections, I would want to reserve all HTTP-level error codes for problems in communication, and I'd much rather always return 200 OK from the service itself, along with a payload specifying the result or any service-level error.
