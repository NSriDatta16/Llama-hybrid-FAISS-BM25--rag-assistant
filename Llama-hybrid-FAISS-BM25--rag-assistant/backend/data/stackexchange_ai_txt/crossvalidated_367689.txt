How to handle Feature changes in a model deployed?

I implemented and deployed with Flask an XGBoost model for a classification problem. But being aware that features importance can change over time to predict probability of label for new data, I implemented a Cron so that the model can be retrained every two weeks. But I don't know how I can handle new features since I would have to wait a great volume of data to retrain the model to take into account this new feature ? Is there an alternative of model deployment to this problem ?
