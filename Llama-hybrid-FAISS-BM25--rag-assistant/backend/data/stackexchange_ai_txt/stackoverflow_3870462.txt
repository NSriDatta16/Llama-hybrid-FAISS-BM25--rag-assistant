I found this to work for me The best way to Organise photos for a web app is Either Store the File names Seo friendly or use a UUID store the original photos at one place just incase u plan to change the layout and need to resize them to different sizes Make seperate folders for differnt image sizes like 200x400, 150x150 or xlarge, large, medium, small etc. store the respective images with the filename u chose from step 1 as it is. no need of renaming it. referencing is much easier. all you have do is. refernce a file and make sure its from the correct folder. Thanks Santosh for helping me out.
