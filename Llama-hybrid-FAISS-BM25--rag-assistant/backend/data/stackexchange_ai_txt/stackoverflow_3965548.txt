Well your object can act like a queue without actually using the Queue class as its internal storage. Depending on how many items you plan on keeping, it might be easier just to maintain a single LinkedList(T) instead of storing the item in both a LinkedList(T) and a Dictionary(K,V). But basically, instead of using a Queue internally, you could use a LinkedList(T) and just add new items to the end of the list and dequeue from the front of the list. When you need to find one by key, you can just scan the list for the matching key or if the number of items makes this perform poorly, you could double up your storage with a Dictionary(K, LinkedListNode(T)) and use the dictionary for your key lookups.
