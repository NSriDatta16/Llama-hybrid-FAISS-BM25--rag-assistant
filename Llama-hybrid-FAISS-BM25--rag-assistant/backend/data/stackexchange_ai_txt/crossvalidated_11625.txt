You can take a look at the MCMCglmm package that comes with very nice vignettes. There's a also a bayesglm() function for fitting Bayesian generalized linear models in the arm package, by Andrew Gelman. I've also heard of a future release blmer / bglmer functions for hierarchical modeling in the same package.
