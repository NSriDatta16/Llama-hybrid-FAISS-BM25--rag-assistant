Scalability has a wide variety of uses as indicated by Wikipedia: Scalability can be measured in various dimensions, such as: Load scalability: The ability for a distributed system to easily expand and contract its resource pool to accommodate heavier or lighter loads. Alternatively, the ease with which a system or component can be modified, added, or removed, to accommodate changing load. Geographic scalability: The ability to maintain performance, usefulness, or usability regardless of expansion from concentration in a local area to a more distributed geographic pattern. Administrative scalability: The ability for an increasing number of organizations to easily share a single distributed system. Functional scalability: The ability to enhance the system by adding new functionality at minimal effort. In one area where I work we are concerned with the performance of high-throughput and parallel computing as the number of processors is increased. More generally it is often found that increasing the problem by (say) one or two orders of magnitude throws up a completely new set of challenges which are not easily predictable from the smaller system
