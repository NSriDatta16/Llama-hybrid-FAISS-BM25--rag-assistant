What should you consider while constructing a Gaussian prior for the binned fit?

I need to make Bayesian fit of the binned data. The model is simply linear function (background) + Gaussian (signal). I want to set a Gaussian prior on the mean of the Gaussian from the model. What shall I consider while constructing the Gaussian prior? Shall I consider the bin width of the data for its width?
