You can do two things: use linked tables "compact" the database(s) every once in a while The linked tables will not in of themselves limit the overall size of the database, but it will "package" it in smaller, more manageable files. To look in to this: 'File' menu + 'Get External data' + 'Linked tables' Linked tables also have many advantages such as allowing one to keep multiple versions of data subset, and selecting a particular set by way of the linked table manager. Compacting databases reclaims space otherwise lost as various CRUD operations (Insert, Delete, Update...) fragment the storage. It also regroup tables and indexes, making search more efficient. This is done with 'Tools' menu + 'Database Utilities' + 'Compact and Repair Database...'
