The os process functionality is considered obsolete. The subprocess module was introduced in Python 2.4 as a unified, more powerful replacement for several older modules and functions related to subprocesses. They are listed here : os.system os.spawn* os.popen* popen2.* commands.* os.popen was deprecated in Python 2.6 (but, interestingly, it is not deprecated in Python 3, where it is implemented in terms of subprocess.Popen ). There is a paragraph in the documentation on how to replace it with subprocess.Popen .
