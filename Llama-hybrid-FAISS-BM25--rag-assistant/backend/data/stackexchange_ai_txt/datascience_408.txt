The problem with models like KNN is that they do not take into account seasonality (time-dependent variations in trend). To take those into account, you should use Time Series analysis. For count data, such as yours, you can use generalized linear auto-regressive moving average models (GLARMA). Fortunately, there is an R package that implements them ( glarma ). The vignette is a good resource for the theory behind the tool.
