As far as I can tell this appears to be a bug in IE. It seems to be timing related. I found a work around but it is not very elegant and sheds no light to me on what might be wrong. Perhaps another user will gain some insight from my work around. In any event this works for me: function setFocus() { setTimeout(tryFocus,100); } function tryFocus() { document.AForm.AText.select(); } As a bonus, the problem with FireFox not working when you send the same value twice in a row is that it's not sending your second GET because it's identical to the previous GET. You need a cache buster. So change your form to look like this: Change your script to this: function setFocus() { setTimeout(tryFocus,100); } function tryFocus() { document.AForm.AText.select(); } function bustCache() { document.AForm.AHidden.value = (new Date()).getTime(); } This is far from perfect, but should work for your purposes.
