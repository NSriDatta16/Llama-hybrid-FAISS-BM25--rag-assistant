No reason why a simpler method shouldn't give better forecasts for any particular series. Furthermore ... A complex model may include a simple model as a special case. It may still be true that it gives larger out-of-sample forecast errors than the simple model after fitting it to a finite sample from your time series. This is the phenomenon of over-fitting; applicable just as much to time-series models as to multiple regression. A larger sample lets you fit more complex models. One method may be better than another according to one way of measuring forecast error, yet worse according to a different way. For the question as to what methods work better in general, it's hard to define "in general". The M3 competition compared various methods for many relatively short series of mainly "business" type data. The results ( Makridakis (2000), International Journal of Forecasting , 16 ) showed simple methods like Holtâ€“Winters & damped-trend exponential smoothing performing very well, often better than more complex methods.
