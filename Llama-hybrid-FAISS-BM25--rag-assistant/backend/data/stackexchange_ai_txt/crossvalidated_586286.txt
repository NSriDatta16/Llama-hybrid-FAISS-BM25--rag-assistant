I was reading in Logistic Regression Models by Joseph Hilbe that interactions between multiple continuous variables is erroneous for standard logistic regressions (from Page 190): You are overinterpreting, he does not say it is erroneous, only that it is often difficult to interpret. In general, as shown below, interactions (and other complex models) are often difficult to interprete/communicate, so visual summaries might be preferable. An alternative to linear x linear interactions is to use a gam (generalized additive model) with smooth interactions, for instance, as below, represented via tensor product splines. Some R code: library(mgcv) library(Fahrmeir) data(credit) library(gratia) mod0 The fitted interaction can be shown graphically: The code for the graphic is simply gratia::draw(mod0) ### The summary for the model is: summary(mod0) Family: binomial Link function: logit Formula: Y ~ ti(Mes, k = 4) + ti(DM, k = 4) + ti(Mes, DM, k = 4) + Cuenta + Ppag + Uso + Sexo + Estc Parametric coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -0.1208 0.2678 -0.451 0.651825 Cuentagood running -1.9211 0.2091 -9.186 Clarification Additional questions in comments Can you run a similar model for GLMM? In principle yes, but in practice it depends on implementations. But R's mgcv can fit some GLMM's, so see ifd the models you are interested in can be fit with mgcv . How does one interpret the summary/plot? I can't see the Y value in the plot so I'm confused how that works. I've never read much about GAMs so this is new to me. The plot I have shown above is on the scale of the linear predictor. We can however make some other plots, applying the inverse link function to show results on the response (probability of default, in this example) scale. One package that is useful for this is visreg (you can search this site for "visreg" to find additional examples). The plots I will show below are conditional plots, that means they are based on fixing the variables not shown at some constant values. I use the defaults, which are for continuous variables: the median factors: the most frequent (or modal) level library(visreg) visreg(mod0, scale="response") # Not shown ### Interaction: visreg2d(mod0, "Mes", "DM", data=credit) # Scale of linear predictor # Not shown visreg2d(mod0, "Mes", "DM", data=credit, scale="response") Remember that this plot is with all the factor variables kept at their most frequent values. Specifically, for this plot it means loans to men, which do not live alone, and for private (not professional) use ... For a more complete presentation of results, make additional plots using additional arguments to specify the conditioning variables. The plot is interesting, it shows that the loans with highest default risk is the ones with large amounts (DM, deutche marks) and short duration (Mes) and the ones with small amounts and large duration! One problem with this plot is that it does not show uncertainty of the fit.
