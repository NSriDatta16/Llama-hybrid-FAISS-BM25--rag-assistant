I think it is important to realize what a binary logistic regression really does. Say your input is a continuous variable X, and you regress it on binary Y using binary logistic regression and then forecast fitted values you can have any value in between of 0 and 1. A value of 0.40 is a possible outcome as well, which you can interpret as it being a 0. Outcomes larger than 0.5 are to be considered a 1 in case you want to predict something!
