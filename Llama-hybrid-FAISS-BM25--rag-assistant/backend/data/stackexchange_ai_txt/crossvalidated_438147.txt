What is the "direct likelihood" point of view in statistics?

I am reading a Springer title from 1997 called Applied Generalized Linear Models by James K. Lindsey. In the preface, Lindsey writes For this text, the reader is assumed to have knowledge of basic statistical principles, whether from a Bayesian, frequentist, or direct likelihood point of view[.] I've heard of the Bayesian and frequentist/Fisherian points of view - what is the "direct likelihood" point of view? I've been searching on that term to no avail - pretty much just getting that exact excerpt in my DDG search results. Does it go by a different name now, or has it been obsoleted?
