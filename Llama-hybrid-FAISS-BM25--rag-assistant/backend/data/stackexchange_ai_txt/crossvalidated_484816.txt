For a categorical variable with many levels, representing it as a set of dummys might not be the best way! since it forces splits only on one given level. There might well be better splits into two sets of levels , but searching among all such splittings is prohibitive. Many other ideas are possible, and some can be found from here: Random Forest Regression with sparse data in Python
