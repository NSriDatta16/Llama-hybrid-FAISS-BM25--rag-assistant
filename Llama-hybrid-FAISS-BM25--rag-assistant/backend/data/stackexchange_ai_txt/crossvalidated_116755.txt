As nobody dared answered, I will expand my commentary. I personnally think that Hurlbert 1984 is an essential article for all experimenters. Hurlbert coined the word, but also made a detailed article explaining the problem, with examples, potential sources of confusion and a litterature survey. Can we ask for more ? It is indeed a long article. I am sure we can found in books, about statistics or experiments, good introductions of pseudoreplication. But Hurlbert is widely accessible and even tought not published in open access, I'm pretty sure anyone can find a copy (another advantage). If someone want something shorter or want to go further in the subjet, I suggest looking at Hurlbert 2004, who resume misconceptions about pseudoreplication. In the last paragraph of the first page, Hurlbert cites many articles discussing the subjet and even suggest a good book. The main problem of the 2004 article (or the fun in it), is that it is a bit acrid in the tone, as it's an answer to Oksanen 2001. I would still recommand it. References Hurlbert, S. H. (1984).
