This may not be the most elegant solution, but you could try the following: $(this).removeAttr('style'); within your $.animate() callback function. Edit: I suspect that you're losing your :hover styles because $.animate() uses inline styles, which are set after stylesheet rules are evaluated; thus they take precedence over defined styles within the stylesheet.
