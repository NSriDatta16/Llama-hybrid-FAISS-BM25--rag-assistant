javascript setting and retrieval of cookie

I am being returned "-1". Not sure if i am creating incorrectly (cookies exist and are listed at 161 or so), but not sure if mine is in this group. abcdef function cM(){ var cookie_date = new Date ( 2011, 01, 15 ); document.cookie = 'ppkcookie1=testcookie; expires='+ cookie_date.toGMTString()+'; domain=myDomain.com'; alert(document.cookie.indexOf('ppcookie1=')); } Solved I was trying to find the cookie in a way that was not finding it. personal error.
