In general, you cannot depend on particular memory placement. The memory allocator's internal bookkeeping data and alignment requirements can both affect the placement of blocks. There is no requirement for blocks to be allocated contiguously. Further, some systems will give you even "stranger" behavior. Many modern Linux systems have heap randomization enabled, where newly-allocated virtual memory pages are placed at random addresses to make certain types of security vulnerability exploits more difficult. With virtual memory, disparate allocated block addresses do not necessarily mean that the physical memory is fragmented, as there is no requirement for the virtual address space to be dense.
