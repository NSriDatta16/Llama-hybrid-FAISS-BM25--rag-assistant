How can I symbolicate from a .crash file in XCode4 that I've downloaded from iTunes Connect

There is a similar question about symbolicating a .crash file here . However this question does not cover how to easily symbolicate in Xcode 4. I have downloaded the .crash files from iTunes connect. All my production versions have been archived in Xcode. When I then go to Devices>Device Logs and try to import the .crash file, nothing happens. The list of crashes does not increase at all. To add, I have been submitting my apps by archiving first. It appears that there isn't the same build folder that there used to be in older Xcode versions. Now the build folder appears to be empty in apps built with Xcode4. It looks like the builds are now in ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/{application-named-folder}/Build/Products/{debug/release folder} According to this top answer , in prior versions it sounds like this was all you had to do to symbolicate your crash report. Is there something new in XCode4? I have looked around quite a bit and tried a number of things and can't seem to get this dang .crash file to import into Organizer.
