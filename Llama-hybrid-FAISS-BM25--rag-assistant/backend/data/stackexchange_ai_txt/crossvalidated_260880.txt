Logistic regression with time components

Suppose I have $N=10$ participants. For each participant, I have $M=100$ consecutive answers, which are either correct or incorrect. My hypothesis is that the probability of giving a correct answers decreases with time. Can I analyze the data with logistic regression? I would like to do the analysis separately for each participant.
