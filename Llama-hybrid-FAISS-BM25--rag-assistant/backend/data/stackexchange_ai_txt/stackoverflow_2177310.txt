It sounds like it's a complex window controller that's growing to unmanageable proportions? This is getting to be a more common issue because of applications which, like the iApps, do most of their work in a single window. As of Leopard, the recommended way of breaking it down is to factor out each part of the window into its own NSViewController subclass. So, for example, you'd have a view controller for your outline view, and a view controller for each of your content views, etc. Also, I'd like to second the use of #pragma mark s to divide code files up into segments, and in addition to categories, I also like to use class extensions for private methods.
