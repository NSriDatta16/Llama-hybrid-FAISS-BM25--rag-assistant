If you don't have reference image of the background then you could try to make an average of first n frames and use such resultant image as a reference. This number, n , could be 20 or similar and it should be enough if the scene isn't too complex. I recommend you to read a chapter about background subtraction in official OpenCV book ( http://www.amazon.com/Learning-OpenCV-Computer-Vision-Library/dp/0596516134 ) as there are some of other similar techniques presented.
