Jquery Drag and drop to arbitray location

I've got a situation where a user needs to be able to drag and drop an image onto a section of a dynamically generated portion of a page that will will always be enclosed with tags but will have no other information. The only way I can I think to accomplish this is to add a wrapper div with a different z-index, but is it even possible to "drop" this item on an arbitrary location on the layer above the pre-formatted text? Any suggestions/ideas would be greatly appreciated.
