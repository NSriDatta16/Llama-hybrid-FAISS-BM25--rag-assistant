I like Barry's suggestion better and there's nothing keeping you from setting the variable to a hash, that can then be merged with the paperclip options. In config/environments/development.rb and test.rb set something like PAPERCLIP_STORAGE_OPTIONS = {} And in config/environments/production.rb PAPERCLIP_STORAGE_OPTIONS = {:storage => :s3, :s3_credentials => "#{Rails.root}/config/s3.yml", :path => "/:style/:filename"} Finally in your paperclip model: has_attached_file :image, { :styles => {:thumb => '50x50#', :original => '800x800>'} }.merge(PAPERCLIP_STORAGE_OPTIONS) Update: A similar approach was recently implemented in Paperclip for Rails 3.x apps. Environment specific settings can now be set with config.paperclip_defaults = {:storage => :s3, ...} .
