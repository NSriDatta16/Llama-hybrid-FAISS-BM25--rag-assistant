statistics of airline crashes

Ive been going back and forth with a friend of mine on the issue of airline crash statistics. The concept of "independent variables" seems to be the biggest disagreement between us, so I was hoping to have some light shed on it by the statistics community. Ive heard the "2.6 in 1,000,000" flights crash statistics and I don't have an issue with those numbers. My issue is, what exactly is the "independent variable"? Each flight, or each traveler? Lets consider every plane that has met a tragic end. Every passenger on those specific flights had the same statistic 2.6 in 1,000,000 chances of dying going into the flight, but in their situation it was an "actual" 1 in 1 chance of dying in a plane crash (obviously unknowingly to them). In my mind, every flight has a 50/50 chance of landing/crashing. Ok, so that might be a gross exaggeration, but I view it as more of a binary T/F of landing safely. If we use a geometric distribution probability (from this question: If each airline flight has a 2.6 in 1,000,000 of an accident and a person goes on 1000 flights, what are the odds for that person? ) the more flights a person takes, the more their chances of being in a plane crash increase, albeit by a small amount, but they do increase by that model. In summary, how can each flight be considered an independent variable, but also have an increasing chance of something occurring? To me, thats like saying that because I flip a coin 4 times and got 4 heads in a row, I have a much greater probability of flipping tails on my 5th flip, when in actuality it is still the 50/50 heads/tails probability of each preceding flip. I apologize in advance if I am overlooking an important stat concept in asking this question.
