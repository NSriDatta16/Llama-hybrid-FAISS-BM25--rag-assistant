I think the key to the answer is where, or more specifically, when your jQuery fragment that performs the ajax post is being run by the browser. I suspect the jQuery code to load the page happens sometime before the full page has loaded. And maybe your browser doesn't support asynchronous loads from the same domain.. This was the case with IE for a long time. So what's going on is the browser starts loading and processing the iframe somewhat in-step with the rest of the requests that your normal (outer) page is doing. If this is not the case yet try putting the code that starts the ajax post in a document ready handler. Also, check in other browsers to see if the problem occurs across the board.
