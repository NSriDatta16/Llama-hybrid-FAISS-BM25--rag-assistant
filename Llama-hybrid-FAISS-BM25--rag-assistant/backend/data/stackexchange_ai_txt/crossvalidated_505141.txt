For a toss of fair die, if events are, A: {1,2}, B: {2,4,6}, and C: {4,5,6}, then A and B are independent but B and C are not. Why?

As far as I understood independence, A and B should not be independent since if either of them happens then we can tell something about the other one. But if they are independent then B and C should also be. From mathematical proof it is explainable, but I didn't understand the intuition behind it. The example is from “Elementary Bayesian Statistics” by Gordon Antelman, Chapter 2 Text: For a fair die $U = (1,2,3,4,5,6)$ . Let three events be defined as: $A \equiv (1,2)$ , so $P(A)=2/6$ $B \equiv (2,4,6)$ , so $P(B)=3/6$ , and $C \equiv (4,5,6)$ , so $P(A)=3/6$ Then $A \cap B = (2)$ and $P(A \cap B) = 1/6 = P(A)P(B) = (1/3)(1/2)$ , so A and B are independent. $B \cap C = (4,6)$ and $P(B \cap C) = 2/6 \ne P(B)P(C) = (1/2)(1/2)$ , so B and C are not independent.
