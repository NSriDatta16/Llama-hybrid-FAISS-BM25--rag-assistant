No, tablespaces allow you to logically separate objects, and adding more makes no difference - you have the same amount of data stored on the same amount of disk. How tables and indexes are organised across tablespaces can make a difference; particularly having indexes in different tablespaces to their tables, though that's really to do with the underlying data files and how those are organised on disk. (I think there's some debate about whether even that makes much difference any more, as disk technology has improved, and with the widespread use of SAN/NAS.)
