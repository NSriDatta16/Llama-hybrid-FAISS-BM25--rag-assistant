How to find the average given that you have the mean, standard deviation and amount?

I have an assignment where I'm asked to find the the average shoe number for men and women from given data: Sum of men and women: 312 Amount of men: 239 Standard deviation of men: 1.63 Mean of shoe number for men: 43.5 Amount of women: 239 Standard deviation of women: 1.4 Mean of shoe number for women: 38.2 Variance squared: 2321 Sum of all shoe numbers: 13183 But I have no idea how to find that using this data. Please help. Thanks in advance!
