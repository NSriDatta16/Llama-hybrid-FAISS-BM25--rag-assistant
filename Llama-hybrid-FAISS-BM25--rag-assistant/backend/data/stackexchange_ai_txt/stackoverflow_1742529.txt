I've been using dbms_pipe for this purpose. Send messages to a named pipe and read them from another session. This method may not work in a RAC environment when the writing and reading processes may connect to a different node. Alternatively you can insert messages into a table using a procedure that runs in its own session using "pragma autonomous_transaction". You can the query these messages from another session Edit: I see that my second option has already been mentioned.
