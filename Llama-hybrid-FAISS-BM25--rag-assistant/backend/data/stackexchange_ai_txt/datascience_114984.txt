In general this is a prime opportunity to use Geospatial Data Science methods. These are more complex in some cases than ML models and sometimes more simplified. In this case if you have sufficient examples to sufficiently populate your entire study region in a random spread across the landscape, you could use the variables in the actual data as points on a map and create meshes of value across the landscape and use this to interpolate the values of the four individual outcomes which you are looking to predict. QGIS, an open source geospatial modeling application and some youtube searches are a great place to start solving this problem.
