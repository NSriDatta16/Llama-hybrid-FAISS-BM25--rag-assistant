When and why converting a Bayesian network into a Markov Random Field?

I found many slides and tutorials (e.g., [1,2]) on the probabilistic graphical model introducing the procedure of "converting a Bayesian network (BN) into a Markov random field (MRF) by moralization". It seems to me that the BN is a more natural way to model the relationship among the variables comparing to that of the MRF. If one can model the relationship among variables by a BN, why bother converting a BN into a less straightforward MRF? Are there any advantages of doing so? When should we convert a BN to an MRF? Thanks. [1] http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~epxing/Class/10708-07/Slides/lecture3-BN&MRF.pdf [2] http://people.csail.mit.edu/dsontag/courses/inference14/slides/lecture2.pdf
