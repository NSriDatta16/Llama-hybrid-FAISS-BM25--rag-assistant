I would start with putting the images inside the p.myitem block and giving it a: p.myitem { overflow: hidden; } That should take care of the overlap. About the vertical align of the images and the text, that can be tricky using css. If the vertical-align solution does not work and you know the height of the images and it is only one line of text, the easiest solution is giving the paragraph a line-height equal to the images.
