I would keep them as two separate repositories (personally) - but it depends on how you plan to develop and release this. To answer your second question: Detach (move) subdirectory into separate Git repository The best method - IMO - if you wanted to keep these organized create two repos for each folder then a third parent repo which will be able to track the sub- repos Project (Git) - Server (Git) - Client (Git)
