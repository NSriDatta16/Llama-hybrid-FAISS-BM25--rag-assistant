Important features for the XGboost algorithm are also the most important for the training of DNN?

I know that both a deep neural network (DDN) and the gradient boosting decision tree algorithm Xgboost can be used for the task of classification. I'm using a DNN first and it works fine. With XGboost algorithm you can also discover which features are most important in the classification with the F test score. Can I state that the most important features for the XGboost algorithm are also the most important for the training of the DNN?
