First, clarifying the definition of "treatment" and "post": Treatment is the units that were treated, independent of time. Post is the year when treatment began . Treat x Post : is your effect and includes treated firms in treated years. Let's say t=0 is the year of the event and t>0 are posterior years. So the treatment includes only treated firms in all years. Post includes all firms only in treated years when t>=0 . So, in your case, it would be the first case If Korea passed the law in 1997, so the treatment including Korean firms in 1995,1996,1997,1998,1999,2000,2001 and the Korean firms in 1997,1998,1999,2000,2001 will receive the value of 1 (post x treatment) But I also learnt something from this paper. It seems that, he used 8 years for a treatment in total. Let's say, if Korea passed the law in 1997. So, Treat x Post of Korean firms in 1995,1996 will receive the values of 0 but Korean firms in 1997,1998,1999,2000,2001,2002 will receive the value of 1. That is why I said 8 years in total. "7 years surrounding" here means 2 years before and 5 years after and the event year, totally 8 years. But it is still ambiguous to me if it is the case ( 8 years )
