HttpCachePolicy.SetCacheability Method NoCache: Sets the Cache-Control: no-cache header. Without a field name, the directive applies to the entire request and a shared (proxy server) cache must force a successful revalidation with the origin Web server before satisfying the request. With a field name, the directive applies only to the named field; the rest of the response may be supplied from a shared cache. HttpCachePolicy.SetAllowResponseInBrowserHistory Method When HttpCacheability is set to NoCache or ServerAndNoCache the Expires HTTP header is by default set to -1; this tells the client not to cache responses in the History folder, so that when you use the back/forward buttons the client requests a new version of the response each time.
