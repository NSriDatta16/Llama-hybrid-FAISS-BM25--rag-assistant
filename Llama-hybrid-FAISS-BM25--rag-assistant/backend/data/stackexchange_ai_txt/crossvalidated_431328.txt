How to treat low frequency continuous variable in machine leanring

Hello I am working on machine learning model for count data, and I have various features that are highly skewed. The frequency table for one of the feature is given below. 0.0 142730 1.0 30338 2.0 11985 3.0 5727 4.0 3151 5.0 1907 6.0 1183 7.0 912 8.0 678 9.0 532 10.0 436 11.0 332 12.0 308 13.0 236 14.0 217 15.0 207 16.0 178 17.0 151 18.0 135 19.0 128 20.0 127 22.0 114 21.0 112 23.0 89 24.0 81 26.0 62 27.0 61 25.0 59 29.0 57 32.0 56 30.0 52 31.0 48 28.0 48 34.0 46 35.0 44 37.0 40 33.0 39 36.0 33 44.0 31 42.0 31 40.0 28 38.0 27 39.0 27 47.0 25 45.0 24 54.0 23 46.0 20 53.0 20 43.0 19 41.0 18 55.0 18 48.0 17 62.0 16 57.0 16 56.0 15 51.0 15 52.0 15 49.0 14 67.0 14 50.0 14 61.0 13 59.0 12 65.0 11 75.0 11 58.0 10 60.0 10 63.0 10 79.0 10 66.0 10 81.0 9 78.0 9 69.0 9 68.0 9 70.0 8 71.0 8 72.0 8 74.0 8 64.0 8 92.0 7 73.0 7 83.0 7 100.0 6 88.0 6 99.0 6 91.0 5 112.0 5 77.0 5 103.0 5 101.0 5 97.0 5 108.0 5 76.0 5 118.0 5 131.0 4 87.0 4 94.0 4 93.0 4 85.0 4 98.0 4 110.0 4 90.0 4 80.0 4 121.0 4 82.0 3 182.0 3 89.0 3 96.0 3 134.0 3 84.0 3 107.0 3 123.0 3 86.0 3 136.0 3 173.0 3 128.0 3 140.0 2 122.0 2 169.0 2 119.0 2 137.0 2 127.0 2 178.0 2 160.0 2 175.0 2 167.0 2 115.0 2 152.0 2 139.0 2 95.0 2 109.0 2 216.0 2 117.0 2 105.0 2 153.0 2 163.0 2 114.0 2 116.0 2 542.0 1 775.0 1 191.0 1 26063.0 1 188.0 1 193.0 1 176.0 1 132.0 1 133.0 1 253.0 1 189.0 1 102.0 1 202.0 1 310.0 1 4304.0 1 273.0 1 135.0 1 364.0 1 146.0 1 130.0 1 245.0 1 150.0 1 249.0 1 155.0 1 156.0 1 142.0 1 592.0 1 161.0 1 165.0 1 181.0 1 129.0 1 412.0 1 104.0 1 171.0 1 113.0 1 239.0 1 223.0 1 384.0 1 177.0 1 483.0 1 272.0 1 124.0 1 141.0 1 180.0 1 120.0 1 432.0 1 570.0 1 126.0 1 138.0 1 209.0 1 585.0 1 147.0 1 194.0 1 255.0 1 125.0 1 144.0 1 593.0 1 218.0 1 204.0 1 371.0 1 162.0 1 148.0 1 159.0 1 each value in the feature does represent a behavior for the users such that a user with 0.0 would be a low engaged user and user with 159 would be high engaged user. Each value represent the number of times a user has used the feature. Now I am not sure what would be the correct way to deal with these kind of features. Do I do a normal transformation for these variables such log transformation such that they could be normally distributed, or should I go ahead and do binning for all these features. I am not sure if binning all the features would result in the loss of information. Or can I use the variable as it is. In using the variables as it is , I fear that model might not giving correct predictions as the low frequency values would either be in test set or train data set. I was hoping if someone could share some thoughts/suggestions around this problem, that would be really helpful as it is very confusing for me as to what to do. Thanks a lot in advance !!
