Use types referenced by a referenced project in C#

I'm new to splitting up my applications into multiple solutions (in other words I just got into the real world), I have a situation where I'm fully seperating the logic from the UI into a seperate project. Where I'm falling down is my glue code. As a simple example. Project car references projects containing door,radio etc Project garage references project car, but needs to use radio. Do I need to add a reference to the radio project in the garage project?
