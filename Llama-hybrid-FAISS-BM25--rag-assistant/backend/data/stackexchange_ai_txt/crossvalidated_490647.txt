(Agglomerative) Hierarchical Clustering: Which linkage for the detection of outliers?

In (agglomerative) hierarchical clustering (and clustering in general), linkages are measures of "closeness" between pairs of clusters. The single linkage $\mathcal{L}_{1,2}^{\min}$ is the smallest value over all $\Delta(X_1, X_2)$ . The complete linkage $\mathcal{L}_{1,2}^{\max}$ is the largest value over all $\Delta(X_1, X_2)$ . The average linkage $\mathcal{L}_{1,2}^{\text{mean}}$ is the average over all distances $\Delta(X_1, X_2)$ . The centroid linkage $\mathcal{L}_{1,2}^{\text{cent}}$ is the Euclidean distance between the cluster means of the two clusters. We can clearly see the outliers as "singletons" in a dendrogram: (From https://www.statisticshowto.com/hierarchical-clustering/ ) Which of these linkages is best for the detection of outliers?
