As Nikita described it's impossible to have something always better than O(log n). Even if you allowed to do some additional operations, it's still not enough - I'm sure it's possible to prepare elements sequence where interpolation search will perform worse than binary search. We can say interpolation search is better only because: We consider average performance, not worst case. Probability of each possible incoming data set is non-uniform. So the answer is - it all depends on the additional knowledge we have about incoming data sets.
