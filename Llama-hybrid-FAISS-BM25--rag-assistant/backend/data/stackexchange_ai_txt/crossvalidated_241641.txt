Measuring negative correlation of time series?

Following case: We have one time-series A trending upwards. We have one time-series B trending downwards. Is there any good way to measure their relationship? Making them stationary by first differencing and then potentially measuring negative Pearson correlation? The assumption is that the increases in A affects the decrease in B. I.e. the rise of temperature lowers the sales of snowboards. Thanks!
