In feature engineering, is using x*y as an interaction term different from using x/y?

I want to engineer some new features for a classifier, say, logistic regression. Let's say I have two continuous (numeric) features $x$ and $y$ . I know that you can create a new feature from $x$ and $y$ by multiplying them, i.e., $x*y$ . So then you have $$ z = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \beta_2 y + \beta_3 xy $$ And I see this in literature a lot. What about using $x/y$ ? Would using this instead of the multiple $xy$ change the accuracy of the classifier? Could it be beneficial to have both interaction terms (if you can call them that)? Or is it redundant?
