AppEngine : howto see content from a POST request

I send a POST request to my AppEngine server. The HttpServletRequest says me : POST /connexionDeconnexion HTTP/1.1 User-Agent: Java/1.6.0_20 Host: localhost:8888 Accept: text/html, image/gif, image/jpeg, *; q=.2, */*; q=.2 Connection: keep-alive Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Content-Length: 25 I have sent the world "HelloHelloHelloHelloHello", which is correct according to the Content-Length. However, I don't know how to recover it. Can you explain me ?
