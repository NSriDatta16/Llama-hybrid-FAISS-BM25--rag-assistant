I don't think that using enabling plug-ins will lead you to assembly count problems. You would have a really killer application (like Firefox) to have that number of plug-ins, but event then an average user won't load all the available plug-ins. Assembly number problems are more often caused by too much granulation in the project itself. I've seen monolithic application which consists of a 100 Visual Studio projects because architect said 'we need low coupling'. Try to adhere to Roy Osherove's rule: each assembly should have a physical (not logical) reason to exist. Logical problems are better solved by namespaces, not assemblies. Hope that helps.
