I've used a similar branch strategy in SVN on my last teams (small teams: current is 4 devs large) and have adopted the approach in TFS on my current team. We branch per bug tracker work item. This strategy provides the branch-per-developer benefit of an isolated source control environment for the developer where (s)he can bang away on code, revert, etc. using the luxuries SVN provides but never allows the developer to drift too far from the mainline in trunk. The development of long-standing features outside the trunk is quite discouraged. The idea being reinforced by stressing that the intended scope + duration of a bug tracking work item should not significantly exceed one business day. In practice, I've found this results in small changesets being merged into the trunk fairly frequently. Given the small nature of my teams, we're rarely stomping on each others' feet getting a merge down so conflicts aren't typically problematic. I will say, this system was quite comfortable in SVN: less so in TFS which doesn't seem to handle merges as gracefully as SVN 1.4 even, let alone 1.5+.
