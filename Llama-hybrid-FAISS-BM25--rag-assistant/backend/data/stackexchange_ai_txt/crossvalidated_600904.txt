Understanding feature significance in logistics regression

I have a classification problem. The response is whether a player will be banned (Yes=1 or No=0). I am considering a feature whether a player cheats. Intuitively, if a player cheats, they should be more likely to be banned, and thus this feature should be included in the model. When I look at the ban rate for 2 groups (cheat or dont' cheat), I realize the ban rate is not that much difference. Table of ban rate Cheat Don't cheat 37% 35% When I build a logistic regression with that feature (cheat or don't cheat) and some other features, the pvalue of that feature is extremely small ( My question is: given a minor difference in the ban rate between 2 groups (cheat vs not-cheat), why is that feature so significant in the output of logistic regression with correct coefficient sign? The model I considered has no interaction terms if it makes any difference
