If you are building a form with variable inputs, I wouldn't recommend building it as one table. This is inflexible and dirty. Normalization is the key, though if you end up with a key/value setup, or effectively a scalar type implementation across many tables and can't cache: a) the form definition from table data and b) the joined result of storage (either a caching view or otherwise) c) or don't build in proper sharding Then you may hit a performance boundary. In this KVP setup, you might want to look at something like CouchDB or a less table-driven storage format. You may also want to look at trickier setups such as serialized object storage and cache-tables if your internal data is heavily relative to other data already in the database
