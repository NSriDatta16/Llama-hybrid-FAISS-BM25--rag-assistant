Installing Office 2007 breaks Data Retrieval Services in Dashboard Designer

I had Office 2003 & Dashboard Designer installed. I was creating a bunch of reports in dashboard designer that started by creating a data source using Microsoft's Data Retrieval Services to connect to a SharePoint list. I installed Office 2007 and I no longer can create a data source using Data Retrieval Services. I reinstalled Microsoft Office 2003 Web Components, but I still do not have the option to create a report based on a data source pointing to a SharePoint list. Do I need to install Excel 2003 or something?
