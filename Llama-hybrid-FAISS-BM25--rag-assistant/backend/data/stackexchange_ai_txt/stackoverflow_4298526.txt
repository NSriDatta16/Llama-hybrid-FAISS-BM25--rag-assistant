Open a file descriptor to /dev/null and try write(null_fd, ptr, size) . If it returns -1 with errno set to EFAULT , the memory is invalid. If it returns size , the memory is safe to read. There may be a more elegant way to query memory validity/permissions with some POSIX invention, but this is the classic simple way.
