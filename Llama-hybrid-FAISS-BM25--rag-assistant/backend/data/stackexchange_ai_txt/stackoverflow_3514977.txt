In Ubuntu 9.10 and newer Upstart has some udev capabilities through the upstart-udev-bridge service. #thumbdrive_special.conf start on block-device-added task script if [ `blkid $DEV` -eq "YOUR-THUMBDRIVES-UUID" ]; then /home/you/bin/thumbdrive_special $DEV fi end script I love how simple and elegant upstart can be. However, a DBus solution might be better if less elegant. With a DBus solution you could pop up notifications to the user and provide easy user control.
