Customer similarity for customer-product interactions over time

I have a table that has 3 columns: Customer, Item and Date of Interaction between customer and item. I would like to calculate a similarity between customers based on how these customers interact with the items considering time. Usually I would tranform: |---------------------|------------------|------------------| | Customer | Item | Date | |---------------------|------------------|------------------| | 0 | A | 01/01/2000 | |---------------------|------------------|------------------| | 0 | B | 05/01/2000 | |---------------------|------------------|------------------| | 0 | B | 11/01/2000 | |---------------------|------------------|------------------| | 1 | B | 06/01/2000 | |---------------------|------------------|------------------| Into: |---------------------|------------------|------------------| | Customer | Item A | Item B | |---------------------|------------------|------------------| | 0 | 1 | 2 | |---------------------|------------------|------------------| | 1 | 0 | 1 | |---------------------|------------------|------------------| And calculate similarity based on those vectors. However, I want to consider time. I want to say that interactions that happened in closer dates are more similar. My final task is to predict future interactions and I want to do some feature engineering using this similarity. For example, if I know that customer 0 is similar to customer 1 and customer 0 interacted with item A last week, maybe customer 1 is more likely to interact with item A in the following week.
