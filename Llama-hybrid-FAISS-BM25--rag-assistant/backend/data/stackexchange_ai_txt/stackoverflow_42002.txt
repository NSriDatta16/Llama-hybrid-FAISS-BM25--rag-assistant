Grab PROJ Cartographic Projections library - open source library. Suggested parameters for 10TM: +proj=tmerc +lon_0=-115 +k_0=0.9992 +x_0=500000 +datum=NAD27 According to this post you may need to: change the ellps to GRS80 if your 10TM data is referenced to the NAD83 datum (instead of NAD27/clrk66). You may also need to change the false northing (y_0) to be -5000000 if your 10TM coordinates for Alberta are less than 5,000,000 (an AltaLIS "standard"). I should mention that proj.4 is the library to get for any kind of geographic coordinate system transformation. There's pretty much no transformation it can't do. I also recommend reading Map Projections-A Working Manual (Paperback) by John Snyder if you are into these kinds of things.. it's a classic. :) (fixed the link)
