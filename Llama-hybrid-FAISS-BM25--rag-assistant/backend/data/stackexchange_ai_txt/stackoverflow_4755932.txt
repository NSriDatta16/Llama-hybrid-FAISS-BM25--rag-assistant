I don't encounter noticeable problems with Helios (3.6.1). We bundle Helios (Classic more or less) and a bunch of plugins we write together with ADT to form MOTODEV Studio. As a general rule, the integration and support for Android have gotten better with each Eclipse release. I don't believe the Android team tests against Ganymede any longer, so at the very least I'd suggest moving to Galileo.
