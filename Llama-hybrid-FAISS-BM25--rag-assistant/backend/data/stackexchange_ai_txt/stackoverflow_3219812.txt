Basically what I understand you want to do is drag a non-existent file from your application to explorer and have a physical file created. Well, your solution of creating a temporary file and then setting that in the DataObject is probably the short cut solution. The "correct" solution, without creating a temporary disk file will require significant amount of P/Invoke type interop to create a custom IDataObject that can render the file descriptor and content from memory rather than a physical source file. I have not done this in .NET, but I can guess it would be a fair amount of work.
