I ran Java code with a StringBuilder in place of a String and saw an average finish time of 10ms (high 34ms, low 5ms). As for the Python code, using "Method 6" here (found to be the fastest method), I was able to achieve an average of 84ms (high 91ms, low 81ms) using unicode strings. Using non-unicode strings reduced these numbers by ~25ms. As such, it can be said based on these highly unscientific tests that using the fastest available method for string concatenation, Java is roughly an order of magnitude faster than Python. But I still
