You can use OLS because there is no serial autocorrelation (at least in the sample you supplied); note the Durbin-Watson test statistic of 1.966 (â‰ˆ2). So, the significantly negative coefficient estimate for x1 is all you need to say something like The observed count of [certain species] is decreasing by about 1,000 per year. or The observed count of [certain species] is decreasing by between 628 and 1,408 per year (at 95% confidence). This assumes that the methodology for counting the species has good coverage and is consistent over the years in your sample. This was produced with this Python code (sorry; don't have R handy): import numpy as np import statsmodels.api as sm y = [10,12,10,11,8,9,6,4,2,4] x = np.arange(len(y)) x = sm.add_constant(x) mod = sm.OLS(y, x) result = mod.fit() print(result.summary())
