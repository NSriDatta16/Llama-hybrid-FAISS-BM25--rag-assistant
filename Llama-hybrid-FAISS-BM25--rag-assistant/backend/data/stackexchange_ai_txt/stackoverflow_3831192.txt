Why is the use of Triggers discouraged in Silverlight 4?

The MSDN documentation for Silverlight now states in several places: The entire Triggers syntax is a discouraged technique in Silverlight 4. [ 1 , 2 ] Expression Blend seems to happily support and encourage their use, though, and there are plenty of blog posts extolling the use of Triggers and Actions without any caveats. What is the recommended replacement for triggers? Should I stick to code-behind event handlers?
