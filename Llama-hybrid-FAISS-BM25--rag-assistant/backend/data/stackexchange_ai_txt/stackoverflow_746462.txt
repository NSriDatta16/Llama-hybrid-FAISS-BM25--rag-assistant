OK. NEARPT3 http://www.ecse.rpi.edu/Homepages/wrf/Research/nearpt3/nearpt3.pdf algorithm could be helpful in your case. And it all depends on how many space you can afford to use for your N points. If it is O(N*logN) then there are algorithms like kD-tree based ( http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/inf2b/learnnotes/inf2b-learn06-lec.pdf ) which would work for O(logN) to find nearest point. In case of 64K point Nlog_2 N = about 10^6 which is easily can fit into memory of modern computer.
