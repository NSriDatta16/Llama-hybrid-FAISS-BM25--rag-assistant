jQuery Plugin: Get the "this" object inside other functions

I am trying to create a panorama slider as a jQuery plugin, and I have the following code: $.fn.panorama = function(settings) { var myPanorama = this; .. this.mousedown(function(e){ //do stuff $(this).css... //this all work } //Call mouseup on document in case user lets go of mouse outside draggable object $(document).mouseup(function(){ $(myPanorama).easeDragging(); //works but probably not the way to do it this.easeDragging(); //ideal but refers to wrong object }); } My question is how do I refer to the this object inside the $(document).mouseup call? Since it thinks this is the document itself and not the object attached to the plugin. For now I am just making a variable and it works but there must be a better way! thanks!
