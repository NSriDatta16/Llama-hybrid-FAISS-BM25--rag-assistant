How Can I Tell If My Web Page Is Too Large For Google Crawler?

Here is the situation: I have a client who runs a web site selling various smart toys. Every toy has one page on which four tabs describe its features, manual, after-sells-services-agent and comments, respectively. One of the toy which seems very intricate has a very long features tab as well as enormous manual(almost 70 images). In the perspective of SEO, I believe is too large for Search Engines to consume. Therefor I think it is hurting my SEO efforts because of that. That is why I persuade my client to either delete some of the content which I believe useless or make a new page and put this manual on it, or whatsoever if emit manual is not good for it users. The impediment I have is that I need to show some evident to this client. However, except telling him it is not good for SEO if we have pages which have large number of content on one page. I can not get anything obvious. Anyhow, every SEO expert says page with large volume of content is not good, but how much volume is large volume? I checked Google's cache of that page which shows all of the content on that page is cached for sure. Does it means that page is not too large for Google? Please help me.
