How to combine partitioned dataset to single dataset?

I have been doing some Machine learning research on Microarray dataset. So, I downloaded breast cancer dataset from " http://datam.i2r.a-star.edu.sg/datasets/krbd/BreastCancer ". The problem here is , this dataset is partioned to "test" and "Train" set. So I have few questions related to this. 1) Why do they want to partition the dataset to "Train" and "Test". Why can't they provide a single dataset file. 2) Is there any advantage on using partitioned dataset ? 3) How can I do crossvalidaton on Partioned dataset ? 4) If I want a single dataset file, Can I combine both "Test" and "Train" to single file and use it ? Does this make any problems ? Any help on this regard will be greatly appreciated. Also, I am new to Machine Learning field, Please excuse if there are any mistakes in the question.
