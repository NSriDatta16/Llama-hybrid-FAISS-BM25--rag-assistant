Is it possible to calculate the prediction intervals for top down, bottom up, and middle out reconciliation of hierarchical time series?

I have read in several places (heres one ) that we can not calculate prediction intervals for the classical reconciliation approaches, top down, middle out, and bottom up, and hence optimal reconciliation is more useful in that sense. But whats confusing to me is that I think I have seen the intervals in practice. SAS forecast studio for example provides forecasts using those techniques and they claim to provide the reconciled confidence intervals. So to be more specific the questions I have are: Is it possible to calculate the prediction interval for td, mo, and bu forecasts? If so, how can I do it? (R code would be very helpful) If not, what is meant when papers say there are no intervals with these methods? Thanks in advance for any help that can be offered!
