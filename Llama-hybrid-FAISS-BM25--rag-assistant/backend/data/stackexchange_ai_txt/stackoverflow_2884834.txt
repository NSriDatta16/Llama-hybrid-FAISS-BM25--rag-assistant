@@IDENTITY returns a decimal(38,0) that can in turn be cast as any other integer type like so. cast(@@identity as [int_data_type]) where int_data_type is one of the following. Data type Range - ( Storage ) bigint -2^63 (-9,223,372,036,854,775,808) to 2^63-1 (9,223,372,036,854,775,807) - ( 8 Bytes ) int -2^31 (-2,147,483,648) to 2^31-1 (2,147,483,647) ( 4 Bytes ) smallint -2^15 (-32,768) to 2^15-1 (32,767) ( 2 Bytes ) tinyint 0 to 255 ( 1 Byte ) Consider though that it won't exceed the decimal(38,0).
