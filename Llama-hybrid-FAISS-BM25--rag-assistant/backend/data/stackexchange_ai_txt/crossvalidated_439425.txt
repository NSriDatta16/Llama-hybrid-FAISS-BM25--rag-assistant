This is sometimes called learning from label proportions in machine learning, falling into the realm of weakly supervised classification . A machine learning paper that establishes one variant of the problem, along with some algorithms and some theoretical guarantees, is Quadrianto, Smola, Caetano, and Le. Estimating Labels from Label Proportions . JMLR 2009. There's been a decent amount of work on it since; check out papers citing that one. A closely related problem, with a long history in statistics and political science, is ecological inference . This sometimes refers to inferring about subgroups, rather than individuals: given labels on how the total population of counties voted, how did different demographic groups vote? But it's also sometimes used to refer to individuals.
