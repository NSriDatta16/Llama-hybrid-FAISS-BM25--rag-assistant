There appear to be at least two different meanings of "kernel": one more commonly used in statistics; the other in machine learning. In statistics "kernel" is most commonly used to refer to kernel density estimation and kernel smoothing . A straightforward explanation of kernels in density estimation can be found ( here ). In machine learning "kernel" is usually used to refer to the kernel trick , a method of using a linear classifier to solve a non-linear problem "by mapping the original non-linear observations into a higher-dimensional space". A simple visualisation might be to imagine that all of class $0$ are within radius $r$ of the origin in an x, y plane (class $0$: $x^2 + y^2 r^2$). No linear separator is possible, but clearly a circle of radius $r$ will perfectly separate the data. We can transform the data into three dimensional space by calculating three new variables $x^2$, $y^2$ and $\sqrt{2}xy$. The two classes will now be separable by a plane in this 3 dimensional space. The equation of that optimally separating hyperplane where $z_1 = x^2, z_2 = y^2$ and $z_3 = \sqrt{2}xy$ is $z_1 + z_2 = 1$, and in this case omits $z_3$. (If the circle is off-set from the origin, the optimal separating hyperplane will vary in $z_3$ as well.) The kernel is the mapping function which calculates the value of the 2-dimensional data in 3-dimensional space. In mathematics, there are other uses of "kernels" , but these seem to be the main ones in statistics.
