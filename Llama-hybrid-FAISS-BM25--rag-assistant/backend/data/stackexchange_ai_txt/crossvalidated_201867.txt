Forecasting with lower frequency independent

I'm trying to forecast a time series variable that was sampled on a weekly frequency. All of the potential independent variables I'm considering are also available on a weekly frequency. The catch is that the independent variable forecasts are only available on a monthly basis. This is also the frequency that the model forecast will be reported. Is there an approach that would let me take advantage of my higher frequency dataset while also capable of generate forecasts at a lower frequency?
