Regressing price on volume

What are the basic pitfalls of regressing stock price on volume of shares traded? This is a time series dataset. The model I'm using is: $$\ln(price)=b_0+b_1t+b_2\ln(volume)+\epsilon$$ As you can see I include a time trend $t$. The R2 and p-value appears to come out good, but I'm more accustomed to cross-sectional analysis so don't really know what I'm doing. I'd appreciate it if someone with more time series knowledge could let me know if this is totally naive. Thanks
