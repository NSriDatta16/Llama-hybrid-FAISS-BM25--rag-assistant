Leverage is a measure of how far the value of the independent variable is from that variable for other observations. The residuals (standardized, studentized, or whatever) are measures of how far the observation is from the regression line. And, though you didn't mention it, there are also influential points , which are observations that have a big effect on the coefficients. Suppose you are modeling weight as a function of height in adult human males, and you have a sample of (say) 200. Then if, by chance, someone who is 2 meters tall is in your data set, he will be an outlier on height and have high leverage. But, if his weight is near what the rest of the data implies (say 130 kg) then he will have a low residual. But if his weight is much lower, he will have a big residual. It would be like the difference between an American football lineman (very tall, very heavy) and a center in basketball (very tall, sometimes not so heavy). (For an extreme case, Manute Bol was 2.3 meters tall and weighed only 91 kg).
