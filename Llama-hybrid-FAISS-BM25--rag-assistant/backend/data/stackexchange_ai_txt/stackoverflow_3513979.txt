By the sounds of it, you will need to code something. Luckily, the DraggableViews module is there as an example. You might also want to look into Views Bulk Operations , the 10,000 pound Gorilla in the World of My-Views-Change-Things. If you want the draggableviews drag-action to directly set multiple fields, it sounds like you need to visit it's issue queue, post a request, and be prepared to offer a patch. It sounds to me like what you need is a hook in draggableviews that allows you to specify additional field and a callback function for how to update it in the course of dragging.
