How can I drag an eMail from Outlook into an Adobe AIR application

This is a quiestion concerning both, Adobe AIR and MS Outlook. I'd like to drag an eMail from Outlook into an AIR application. I want the following data to be transferred into the AIR application: unique ID of the mail in Outlook to create a link into Outlook rich text of the mail some information about the mail like sender, recepient, date etc. Some windows applications do this, like My Life Organized or Linker . Is this possible in any way for AIR? I'm pretty sure I need not only the AIR application but also some windows app or Outlook plugin to achieve this. Any ideas?
