and beyond the reasons stated above, how about simple ease of use ? if i want to traverse a family tree using your design, the code would look something like: Cat firstCat = //get starting cat somehow Object someBroker = //get a 3rd party broker (like an entity manager) Cat parent = broker.getCatById(firstCat.getParentId()); using actual Object references while be more elegant: Cat firstCat = // get initial cat while ((Cat ancestor = firstCat.getParent)!=null) { //work with ancestor }
