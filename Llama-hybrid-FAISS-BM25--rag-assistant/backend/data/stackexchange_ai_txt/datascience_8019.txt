There's an inherent problem that anybody who chooses to use a system designed primarily for extreme privacy is interesting to the surveillance org. So the surveillance org will likely learn about any such system or class of systems if it becomes significant, and develop means of identifying its traffic (and possibly filtering out the fake traffic), and then give special attention to the users sending that traffic. You can also consider the opposite approach: instead of auto-generating traffic for existing users with false negatives, auto-generating new users with traffic full of false positives. However it suffers from the same cat-and-mouse dynamic . The solution is for the tools used by most users (Android, iOS, telcos, Gmail, Facebook, Google Search, OEMs) to feature security capabilities client-side by default AND to not provide backdoors to surveillance orgs. That would also make it more difficult to provide useful features like recommendations and well-targeted adverts. For various reasons, in large part because most consumers do not demand it, they do not prioritise this, and that may not ever change.
