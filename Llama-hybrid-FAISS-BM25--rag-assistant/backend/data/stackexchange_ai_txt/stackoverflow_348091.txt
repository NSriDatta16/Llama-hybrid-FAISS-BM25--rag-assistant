it is fairly trivial to use data-binding to tie an object model to the UI. How can I tie an object with a GUI control without a persistent storage? If I do it manually that means I have to write ridiculous amount of code for every single object in memory. I already have some sort of class storage for this data but it's not bind sort scenario, it's like read this write here. Am I supposed to write a loader which loads serialized XML and get the object and then read the object and fill up the whole GUI? Obviously this more like manual loading not binding. Am I missing something ?
