This is about code in general (it uses Java/C/.Net for the examples if I remember correctly), but Code Complete 's the best book I've read on general code structure. It covers everything, from the nuts & bolts of how to write and organise variables and methods up to program structure. I'm not sure how applicable the examples are to PHP but probably worth a look.
