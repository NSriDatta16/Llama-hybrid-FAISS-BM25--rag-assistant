Measure the performance of your application itself with the new and old servers. It's not necessarily easy: Set up a performance test environment with your application on (depending on your architecture this may consist of several machines, some of which may be able to be VMs, but some of which may not be) Create "driver" program(s) which give the application simulated work to do Run batches of work under the same conditions - remember to reboot the database server between runs to nullify effects of caching (Otherwise your 2nd and subsequent runs will probably be amazingly fast) Ensure that the performance test environment has enough hardware machines in to be able to load the database heavily - this may mean swapping out some VMs for real hardware. Remember to use production-grade hardware in your performance test environment - even if it is expensive. Our database performance test cluster contains six hardware machines, several of which are production-grade, one of which contains an expensive storage array. We also have about a dozen VMs on a 7th simulating other parts of the service.
