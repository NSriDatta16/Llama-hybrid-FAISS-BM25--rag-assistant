Index on partitioned table not used

I have to query a reasonably large table (450M rows) that is partitoned and indexed. suppose this structure: load_num(int) cust_id(int) ... some more columns ... The table is partitioned over load_num, around 3 loads go into one partition. (so load_num is not unique within a partition) There there are three indexes, two of them who have load_num, cust_id as the first two columns (int that order) When I issue this query: select * from fact where load_num = 100 and cust_id = 12345 It takes quite long to return, so I hit explain plan and it gets the right partition but then does a FULL table scan on it. Why isn't oracle using one of the two indexes to do a ROWID scan on the partition to get the rows? The cust_id should be fairly unique and the statistics on the table are up to date. We're on 10g Entreprise. Came from MS SQL so I'm not up to speed with Oracle yet. Thanks in advance, Gert-Jan ** EDIT: Some anonimized DDL: CREATE TABLE FACT ( LOAD_NUM NUMBER ... columns .. , CUSTOMER_ID VARCHAR2(20 BYTE) .. columns ) TABLESPACE "TS_A" PCTFREE 0 INITRANS 1 STORAGE ( BUFFER_POOL DEFAULT ) PARALLEL 12 PARTITION BY LIST (LOAD_NUM) ( PARTITION FACT_46 VALUES (46) TABLESPACE FACT_PART_DATA_46 COMPRESS , PARTITION FACT_52 VALUES (52) TABLESPACE FACT_PART_DATA_52 COMPRESS , PARTITION FACT_56 VALUES (56) TABLESPACE FACT_PART_DATA_56 COMPRESS ... more partitions ... )CREATE INDEX SOMESCHEMA.FACT_IDX2 ON SOMESCHEMA.FACT (LOAD_NUM ASC, CUSTOMER_ID ASC, OUTSTANDING_ID ASC) LOCAL ( PARTITION FACT_DATA_46 LOGGING TABLESPACE "FACT_DATA_46" PCTFREE 10 INITRANS 2 STORAGE ( INITIAL 65536 MINEXTENTS 1 MAXEXTENTS 2147483645 BUFFER_POOL DEFAULT ) NOCOMPRESS , PARTITION FACT_DATA_52 LOGGING TABLESPACE "FACT_DATA_52" PCTFREE 10 INITRANS 2 STORAGE ( INITIAL 65536 MINEXTENTS 1 MAXEXTENTS 2147483645 BUFFER_POOL DEFAULT ) NOCOMPRESS , ... etc etc .. )
