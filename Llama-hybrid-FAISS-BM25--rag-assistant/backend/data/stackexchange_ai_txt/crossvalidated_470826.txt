What is the intuition behind the Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm?

I've been studying Bayesian Statistics lately, and just came across the Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm . I understand that the goal is to sample from an intractable posterior - but I'm not really able to understand how the algorithm achieves what it sets out to achieve. Why and how does it work? What's the intuition behind the algorithm? To clarify the parts I've problems with, in particular, I've attached the algorithm above. How is the $q$ distribution (the proposal) related to the intractable posterior? I don't see how $q$ popped out of nowhere. Why is the acceptance ratio calculated the way it is? It doesn't make intuitive sense to me - it'd be great if someone could explain that better. In Step 3, we accept the $X$ we sampled from the $q$ distribution with some probability - why is that? How does that get me something closer to the intractable posterior, which is our goal? (right?) Please help me out here. Thanks!
