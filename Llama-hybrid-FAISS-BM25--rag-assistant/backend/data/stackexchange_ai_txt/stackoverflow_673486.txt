Just to get some background, presumably you want to pass the interface implementation to something else in this assembly, which is also internal, because otherwise they wouldn't have been able to compile this other assembly (it being an error to refer to an internal type in a public method's parameters). I think you'll have to use Reflection.Emit to build a type that implements the interface, having obtained the interface's Type object by reflection. Not exactly a straightforward task, and the result will be fragile because you're digging around in the internals of someone else's assembly. Other options: Disassemble the other assembly, using Reflector and that cool addin that builds a whole project from the assembly. Talk to the owner of the other assembly and explain your needs to them
