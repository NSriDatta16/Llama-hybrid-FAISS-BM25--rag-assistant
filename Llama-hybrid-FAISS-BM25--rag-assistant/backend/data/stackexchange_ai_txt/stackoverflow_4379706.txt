I'd advise against using Google Website Optimizer and other javascript-based A/B packages. They drag your site's performance down and kill off any SEO you might have had, both of which affect your bottom line. Since you're probably using AB testing to make your site better at converting random strangers to money, it would seem counterproductive to do anything that damages that. Look into something that runs on the server, such as ABingo for Rails and FairlyCertain for ASP.NET . Both of those are open source and free.
