You can call Mage::getModel('catalog/category')->getCollection()->addFieldToFilter('parent_id', '319')->addAttributeToSort('name', 'ASC'); and you'll get the whole bunch sorted right away, rest is just iteration over typical Varien collection. It's a pseudo sample and i don't know if the parent_id is the actual field name in db so you might check that out before you get the right results. Great read about collections in Magento is written by Alan Storm
