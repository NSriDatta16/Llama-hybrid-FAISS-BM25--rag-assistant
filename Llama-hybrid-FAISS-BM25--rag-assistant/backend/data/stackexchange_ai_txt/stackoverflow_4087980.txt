Have you looked at DateTime.Parse ? It accepts "08:14am" , "8:14" [1] and other variants, and returns a DateTime set to 8:14 am on today's date. [1] In the UK culture at least -- consider providing a CultureInfo parameter depending on whether you want to pay attention to the user's local format preferences, or adopt a fixed format. EDIT I also have other replacements in mind; for example 814 goes to 08:14am, and 8 goes to 08:00am Take a look at DateTime.ParseExact : you can provide an array of valid time formats (such as "hh:mm", "hmm", "h" etc.)
