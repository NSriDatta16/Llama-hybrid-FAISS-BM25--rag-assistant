I did this before. Its a mess, you need to keep the filesystem and the database synchronized all the time, so that makes the programming more complicated, as you would guess. My advice is either go for an all filesystem solution, or all database solution, depending on the data. Notably, if you require lots of searches, conditional data retrieval, then go for database, otherwise fs. Note that database may not be optimized for storage of large binary files. Still, remember, if you use both, youre gonna have to keep them synchronized, and it doesnt make for an elegant nor enjoyble (to program) solution. Good luck!
