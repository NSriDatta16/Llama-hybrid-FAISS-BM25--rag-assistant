Get customer in Mage_Tax_Model_Calculation::getRate in magento

I have overwritten the Mage_Tax_model_Calculation::getRate , so that I want to not tax certain customers. I do not have a special customer class for them. I have a custom field in my customer model, which I want to check after I am able to load my customer model and if this field has a value I do not tax him, otherwise I call parent::getRate($request) Is it possible to get that in the function.
