How can I build a 6D Convolution Layer in a CNN, using R or Python?

As stated in the title, I would like to build an N-dimensional Convolutional Layer as part of a Convolution Neural Network, without doing dimensionality reduction on my data; because I have multiple spatial features. I am a bit stumped as to what the best package to build one would be, or where to start. It looks like both Pytorch and Tensorflow lack the ability to create this type of high dimensional convolution layer. E.g. Imagine I have 6 spatial dimensions, and I want to input them to a 6-dimensional CNN layer. To be clear, I'm dealing with high-dimensional but manageable counts, and I am okay with relatively long training times. This is mostly an exercise in curiosity, at the moment. EDIT: To be more precise, what I have is 3D vectors in a relatively sparse 6D space with short dimensions. I definitely want to use a true 6D convolution in the first layer. That is the specific aim of this exercise. I am just looking for the mechanics of how to achieve this. It seems Nvidia/MinkowskiEngine on GitHub might address my dilemma. https://github.com/NVIDIA/MinkowskiEngine
