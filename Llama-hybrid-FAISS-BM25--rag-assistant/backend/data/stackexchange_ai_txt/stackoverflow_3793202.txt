Remove duplicated code - using Action

I have the following code which obviously has some duplication. I'm sure this could be removed using a delegate or Action but can't quite grasp it. anyone got any ideas? public void DealStartingCards() { for (int i = 0; i 0) player.Hand.FaceDownCards.Add(Deck.TakeTopCard()); } } } for (int i = 0; i 0) player.Hand.FaceUpCards.Add(Deck.TakeTopCard()); } } } for (int i = 0; i 0) player.Hand.InHandCards.Add(Deck.TakeTopCard()); } } } } InHandCards, FaceUpCards and FaceDownCards are all of type List
