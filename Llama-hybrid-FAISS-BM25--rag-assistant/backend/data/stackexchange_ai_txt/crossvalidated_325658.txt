It looks like what you really want to do is just to check (a) whether the mean time significantly differs between conditions and (b) whether the mean "average fraction of nodes with majority choice" significantly differs between conditions. Your model isn't necessary for either of these. For (a), you could use the Mann-Whitney $U$-test, or an independent-samples $t$-test on the logged time. For (b), you could use the Mann-Whitney again or Fisher's exact test (for the latter, you'll need to recode the fractions into node counts). I still can't tell what the study is about, what the network means or comes from, how the stated model equation relates to the data, what the experimental manipulation is, etc., so it's possible I'm misunderstanding your situation.
