I believe this can be an artefact on how you calculate your metrics. If you are using an moving average to calculate a metric and reseting the moving average at epoch boundaries than it is reasonable to expect a jump in epoch boundaries. For example if you accuracies are going from 0 to 50 in the first epoch you moving average at the end of your first epoch will be less than 50. Depending on the window size assuming you report at the whole batch level it will be 25. But at the start of the next epoch it will start from 50 hence the jump.
