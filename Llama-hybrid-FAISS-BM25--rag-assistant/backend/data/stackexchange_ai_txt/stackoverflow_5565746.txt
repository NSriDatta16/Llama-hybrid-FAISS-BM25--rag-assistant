Using Solve in Mathematica

To get acquainted with Mathematica's solving functions, I tried to work out a solution to a MinuteMath problem : There is a list of seven numbers. The average of the first four numbers is 5, and the average of the last four numbers is 8. If the average of all seven numbers is 46/7, then what is the number common to both sets of four numbers? Of course, this is an excercise that can be solved without computer, but how can I solve this using Mathematica? My first approach X = Table[Subscript[x, i], {i, 1, 7}]; cond = { Mean[Part[X, 1 ;; 4]] == 5, Mean[Part[X, 4 ;; 7]] == 8, Mean[X] == 46/7 }; Solve[cond, Subscript[x, 4]] returned no solution. My second approach X = Table[Subscript[x, i], {i, 1, 7}]; rules = {Mean[Part[X, 1 ;; 4]] -> 5, Mean[Part[X, 4 ;; 7]] -> 8, Mean[X] -> 46/7 }; Solve[ Mean[X] == Mean[Part[X, 1 ;; 4]] + Mean[Part[X, 4 ;; 7]] - Subscript[x, 4] /. rules, Subscript[x, 4] ] gives a wrong solution (45/7 instead 6). What did I wrong?
