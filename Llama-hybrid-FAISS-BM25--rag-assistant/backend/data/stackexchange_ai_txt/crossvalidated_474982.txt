The approach seems to be correct although the expression for $x_{t-1}$ and $y_t$ may not be. Ths is an instrument variable model where the causality between X and Y needs to be inferred in the presence of a confounder affecting both. Consider a DAG where we want to understand the effect of A on X. Because there is an unknown/unobserved variable U affecting both A and Y, we cannot have the independence between Y(a) and A. Y(a) is the random variable when A is fixed to some value a. Now, imagine there is another variable Z that can completely predict A and hence renders the arrow connecting U->A completely useless i.e, . Due to this strong predictor of A, we can have $Y(a) \perp A$ . In most cases however, you are going to have a middle ground between the two which implies $Y(a,z) \perp {A}$ . It allows us to create linear models to understand the causal relationship between A and Y. $A = v_0 + v_1 * Z + e_1$ $Y = u_0 + u_1 * A + e_2$ and, $Y = w_0 + w_1*Z + e_3 $ Getting the average causal effect of A on Y i.e, $E[Y(1)] - E[Y(0)]$ is now straight forward. Using Sewell path analysis method gives us $E[Y(1)] - E[Y(0)] = \frac{E[Y(z=1)] - E[Y(z=0)]}{E[A(z=0)] - E[A(z=1)]} = \frac{w_1}{v_1}$ $Y_{t-1}$ is doing the same job as Z in your case
