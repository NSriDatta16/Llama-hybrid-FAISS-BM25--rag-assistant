memcached memory consumption

I set up a memcached on 3 machines with each allocated 4G. I have totally 200M items. Thus, on average, each item has 60 bytes. The hash key is a length 10 string. The hash value is boolean. The memory looks more than enough. However, I still found "evictions" number increases. What's the memcached memory consumption?
