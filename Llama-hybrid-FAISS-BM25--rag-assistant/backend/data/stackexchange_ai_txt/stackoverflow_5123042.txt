I would use Tim Pope's surround plugin to accomplish this. Add the following to you ~/.vim/after/ftplugin/erb.vim let b:surround_{char2nr('=')} = " " let b:surround_{char2nr('-')} = " " Now when you press = it will insert just as you wanted. You may also want to look at Tim Pope's ragtag plugin which has such mappings already included.
