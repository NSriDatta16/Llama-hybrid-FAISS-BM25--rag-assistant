Reasonable compared to what? How wide are the rows? How fast is your CPU? How much RAM do you have? Is the table already in RAM when you start the query? Are you delivering the results over a network? If so, how fast is it? How fast is the client that's retrieving the rows? How fast are your disks? How fragmented is the table? Is the DB machine doing anything else at the same time?
