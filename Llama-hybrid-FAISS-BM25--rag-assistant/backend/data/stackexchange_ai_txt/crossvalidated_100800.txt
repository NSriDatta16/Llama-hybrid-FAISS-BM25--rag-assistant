ML & AI - Algorithm recommendation for "optimization by tuning parameters"?

As a newbie in Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), I am here to ask some general algorithm pointers on my following question, which I have simplified into a very generic question. I have a model $M$ defined by a few parameters $p_1, p_2, \dots,p_n$. Now I wish to optimize $M$, i.e., maximize one property value of $M$, by tuning $p_1, p_2, \dots,p_n$. I am looking for algorithms that sort of "learn" what is good and what is bad along the way and find the optimal solution in the end. One similar algorithm in my head is genetic algorithm in AI, but for some reason I cannot use it. So I am here to get some algorithm pointers in ML, hopefully.
