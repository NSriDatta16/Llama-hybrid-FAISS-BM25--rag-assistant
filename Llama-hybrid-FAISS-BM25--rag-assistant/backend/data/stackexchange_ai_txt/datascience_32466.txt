welcome to DS-SE and to Data Science in general! :) Your problem can be solved really easily in Python. Please, take a look at Pandas DataFrame class to represent your data, it makes it really convenient because of all the pre-built methods that includes. One of its methods is pandas.DataFrame.rolling() (see here ) that does exactly what you asked for: rolling (sliding) window calculations, please take a look! Hope it helps!
