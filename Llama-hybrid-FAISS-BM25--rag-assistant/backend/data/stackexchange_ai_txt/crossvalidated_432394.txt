Correlation Matrix or Covariance Matrix in PCA

I have 4 metrics, three of them measured on the scale 0 to 1, and one measured on the scale 0 to 6. When I stored my data, I converted the fourth one by dividing it by 10, so that I can get values between 0 and 0.6. Now I am using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to analyze my data with OriginLab software. Should I use correlation matrix or covariance matrix with PCA? I used correlation Matrix, but I am not sure if what I am doing is correct. The fourth metric makes me confused ..
