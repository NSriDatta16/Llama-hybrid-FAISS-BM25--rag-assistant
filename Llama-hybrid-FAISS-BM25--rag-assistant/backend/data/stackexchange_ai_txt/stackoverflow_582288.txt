How do I place a hyperlink on every page of a SSRS 2005 report?

I am building a SSRS 2005 report that has potentially multiple pages. I would like to put in a hyperlink so that it appears on the top of every page. The hyperlink links back to the same report - basically I have a "summary" and "detail" mode and want to have hyperlinks to switch between. So far I tried two approaches: Put a textbox in the body, and in Properties -> Navigation, jump to a report. This works fine except it only shows on the very first page. Drag the same textbox in the header of the report. Now it appears on every page, but clicking on it results in an error message: "The source of the report definition has not been specified". google turned up nothing, what now? Thanks.
