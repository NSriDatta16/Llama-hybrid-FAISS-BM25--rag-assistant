Interpretation of a three-level contrast in a linear mixed-effect model in R

I have a linear mixed effect model in R where my fixed effect consists of three levels: Yes , No and Maybe I have two research questions regarding these levels and my dependent variable: Is Yes smaller than No ? Where does Maybe stand in relation to Yes and No (closer to which)? I specified centered contrast for my levels: -Yes+No -Maybe+Yes&No Maybe 0.0 -0.6666667 No 0.5 0.3333333 yes -0.5 0.3333333 The output of the linear mixed effect model (the fixed effects part) is: Fixed effects: Estimate Std. Error t value (Intercept) -2.24393 0.09051 -24.791 Grammaticallity-Yes+No -0.82596 0.17168 -4.811 Grammaticallity-Maybe+Yes&No -0.73459 0.11753 -6.250 From this I can clearly see that the response to Yes is less negative than the response to No by -0.8 in the scale of my dependent variable. My doubt is how to interpret the second contrast. I know by looking at bar graphs that the response to Maybe is the less negative of the three responses: However, from the output I would interpret the response to Maybe is 0.7 more negative in the scale of my dependent variable than the average of the responses to Yes and No . However, this is clearly not the case, as the response to Maybe is more positive (less negative) than the responses to Yes and No . I would appreciate any help to interpret and properly report the estimate of the second contrast comparing Maybe to the average of Yes and No . Thanks in advance.
