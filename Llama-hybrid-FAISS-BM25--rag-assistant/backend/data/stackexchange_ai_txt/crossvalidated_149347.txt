Suggestions for Time Series Exercises

Do you know of a good set of exercises, preferably with solutions, that would help me learn Time Series by myself? I was searching for solutions to the exercises of Shumway and Stoffer's «Time Series Analysis and its Applications», since it's the book I chose to follow, but I didn't find any... Any help would be appreciated.
