I'm not all that familiar with light GBM, but in general yes gradient boosting does require access to the full dataset. However, one option might be to take an ensemble approach. Split the data into multiple batches and train a model on each. Then at inference time simply make a prediction with each model using all the new data and take the average to get the final prediction.
