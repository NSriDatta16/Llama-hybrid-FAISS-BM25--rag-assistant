As far as I know, it's not possible, nor is it sensible, to do this all from the CMS page. You're best bet would be to create a widget . Widgets are reusable template tags that are very similar to the blocks used in the Magento layout system. Once your widget is made, you can then call the widget in the CMS page with a product option, {{widget type="mywidgets/productname" product_id="1"}} , and modify the widget's output based on the product id entered. The tutorial I've linked to is very good, and should be a great starting point.
