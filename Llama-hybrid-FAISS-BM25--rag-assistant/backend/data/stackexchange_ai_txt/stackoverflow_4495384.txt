One of my pragmatic favorites is cycle . cycle [False, True] generates the infinite list [False, True, False, True, False ...] . In particular, xs ! 0 = False , xs ! 1 = True , so this is just says whether or not the index of the element is odd or not. Where does this show up? Lot's of places, but here's one that any web developer ought to be familiar with: making tables that alternate shading from row to row. The general pattern seen here is that if we want to do some operation on a finite list, rather than having to construct a specific finite list that will “do the thing we want,” we can use an infinite list that will work for all sizes of lists. camcann’s answer is in this vein.
