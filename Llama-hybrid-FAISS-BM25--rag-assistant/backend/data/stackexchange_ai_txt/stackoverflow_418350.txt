Google Calendar supports tasks (new feature, very bare bones), or you can use the RememberTheMilk site/gmail add-on. It's has all the basic features you could ever want and it's simple to use. If you use an iPhone or the gPhone you can access the website in a 1st class experience from both your desktop and your pocket.
