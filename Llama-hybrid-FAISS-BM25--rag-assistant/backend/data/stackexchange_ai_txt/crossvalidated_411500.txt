Chi Squared Test to see if a treatment group spent more than a control group

I have two groups of people. One group were shown an ad and the other were not. I know in aggregate that the treatment group spent \$799 and the control group spent \$412, so overall it seems people responded. Both groups had 1000 people in them. I am not sure how to translate this to verify whether this is statistically significant. I was going to do a chi squared test with treatment group observed values and use the expected value of the average spend per customer in the control group (\$0.412). Is this the correct way to choose an expected value?
