Commenting out the two texture parameter lines enables MIP mapping. Since you upload only one level of texture, all the other levels are blank. That's why you subsequently don't see anything. By what means are you concluding that you're causing twice the size of textureData to be allocated and how do you reach the conclusion that this is an error? It's up to the GL driver how it allocates memory internally and where it caches what it wants. There's no reason to assume that double is incorrect, especially if you're adding video RAM to main RAM. Furthermore, storing MIP maps adds one third to your overall storage requirements, not 100%.
