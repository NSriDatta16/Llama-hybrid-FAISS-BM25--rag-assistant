Forgive me if this doesn't answer your question very directly, but since it is a homecooked blog system is it really worth spending time thinking about what storage backend right now is faster? You're not going to be looking at 10,000 concurrent users from day 1, it doesn't sound like it will need to scale to any maningful degree in the foreseeable future. Why not just stick with MySQL as a sensible choice rather than a fast one? If you really want some sense that you designed for speed maybe bolt sqlite on instead.
