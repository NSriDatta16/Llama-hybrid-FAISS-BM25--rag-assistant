Mohr's Circle is a graphical method to calculate principal stresses. So basically, you calculate the principal components for a 2D or 3D problem. The nice thing is that you can do that with very simple calculations and drawing so you don't need a computer. You know engineers had to be smart and creative before machine learning. :D
