The output of every layer of a neural network can be considered as features for a model (which usually consists of the following layers). Typically, neural networks use neurons in the output layer, but this may well be anything, including SVM as suggested in the paper. In this sense, the deep network is used to construct features which allow linear separability by the SVM. That said, I don't see the appeal of using a linear SVM as a drop-in replacement for a typical output layer, as they are almost equivalent.
