the "white noise" is the "leftover" after adjusting for previous "shocks" Here MA (q) denotes a moving average model of order q. For a stationary time series, the current observed value y(t) can be related to the current and all past unobservable shocks, a(t), a(t-1), …, a(t-q). This relationship is a moving average process. The MA (q) is a representation of this process. Here a shock is simply the one step ahead forecast error. For example, a(t) is the forecast error for period t. In practical modeling, q is always a finite number. The MA (q) model of order q follows: y(t)= a(t) + 1a(t-1) + 2a(t-2) + … + pa(t-p) ) y(t) is an observed value, where, a(t), a(t-1) …, a(t-p), are unobservable shocks. Because a(t), a(t-1) …, a(t-p), are unobservable, the OLS procedure can not be used to estimate the coefficients (). The unobserved a(t} series and s must be estimated iteratively with a nonlinear procedure. Under certain conditions, however, a MA model can be expressed as an AR model. The term moving average for these types of models is somewhat misleading. The term used here has nothing to do with the usual moving average calculations, which is simply an arithmetic average of a fixed number of terms in a sequence by moving the terms forward or backward. In summary the errors are the result of an estimated set of coefficients.
