If you host the designer in your own application and provide the business focused custom activities you can make a good user focused application; provided that is your end users are familiar with concepts like flow charts and business process design. I would say if the target user is a business professional then its probably a good fit. If your hoping to provide this functionality to a less business oriented audience then I would agree with Jlafay, its not for the "average Joe". Its perhaps a narrow band of ideal target users, but I suspect not that uncommon as users of much software.
