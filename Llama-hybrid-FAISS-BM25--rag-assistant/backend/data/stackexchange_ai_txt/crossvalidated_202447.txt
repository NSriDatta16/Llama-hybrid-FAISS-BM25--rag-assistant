Choice of classification method based on dataset attributes

I often come across a classification problem - where we have 0/1 binary outcome and several features. And the main goal is build a classifier on training set. Now given several choices of algorithms - Random forests, logistic regression, SVM, etc., is there a scientific approach one can apply to choose one among the above algorithms just based on the data attributes. By attributes I mean number of features in dataset, no. of categorical variables, how many levels in categorical variables, etc. In other words, you have dataset and based on it you take a call which method suits best. The reason I ask is that I currently apply different methods and choose one with the best accuracy on cross validation set. But I think there is a way to narrow down on methods just based on dataset features. Would appreciate any thoughts on this. Thanks in advance!
