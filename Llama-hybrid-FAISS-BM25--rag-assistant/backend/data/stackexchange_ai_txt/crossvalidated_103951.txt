Intercept from standardized coefficients in logistic regression

I have fit a logistic regression model with original y and standardized x variables. Slope coefficients can be easily converted back to their original scale by $\beta^*_j/\sigma_{x_j}$ where $\beta^*_j$ is the output from the fitted model. However, I am not sure how to get the original intercept estimate from the output. Any help is appreciated. Thanks
