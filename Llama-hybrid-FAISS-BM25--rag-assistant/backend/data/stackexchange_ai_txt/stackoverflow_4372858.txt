xdebug code coverage analysis with simpletest framework

I am doing unit testing with simpletest framework and using xdebug for code coverage reports. let me explain you my problem: I have a class which I want to test lets assume name of class is pagination.php. I write another class for testing. I wrote two test cases to test pagination class. there are around 12 assertion in two test cases which giving me correct result "Pass". Now I want to generate code coverage report, for this I use xdebug to show that my test cases covering all code or not. I use xdebug_start_code_coverage() function and for showing result I use xdebug_get_code_coverage() function. Now the problem is that, when I print xdebug_get_code_coverage() Its give me 2 dimension assosiative array with filename, line no and execution times. the result is like this: array 'path/to/file/pagination.php' => array 11 => int 1 113 => int 1 line 11 is start of class and line 113 is end of class. I don't know why it is not going inside class and why it is not giving the statement coverage for class functions. However, my test cases looks ok to me and I know all condition and branching covering are working. I will really appreciate if you help me in this regard and guide me how to solve this problem. Maybe I missed something here. If you want something more please let me know.
