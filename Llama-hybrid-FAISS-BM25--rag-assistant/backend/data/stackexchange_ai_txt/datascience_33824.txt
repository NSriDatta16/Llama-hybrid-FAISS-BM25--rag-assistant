How to train a machine learning model if there is a relationship between two different data points?

How to train a machine learning model if there is a relationship between two different data points? I mean not relationship between two variables among the point but that between two different data examples or points, so that i want to classify similar such set of datapoints into one single class . Which algorithm is most suited in this case . I want to write the algorithm on my own.
