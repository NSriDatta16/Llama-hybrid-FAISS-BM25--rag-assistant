How do weka classifiers deal with missing values?

I tried using a training set that has missing values. I applied filters (like replace missing data) and then after there were no more missing data I applied naive bayes, trees etc... I thought this was the only way to do it: Preprocess the dataset and prepare it for classification. But then, without meaning to, I learnt that the classifiers can deal with missing data on their own without preprocessing (and the accuracy, based on my tests, is almost the same) so I wanted to know how do these classification algorithms do it? I couldn't find any useful documentation that explains whether these classifiers are replacing the missing values with the average/most recurring value...
