Approach to a multi-view object classfication problem

I'm currently working on a common object classification and I use a CNN to do that. Each instance has 3 images with differents views (front, back, side) and I would like to use this to improve my network, so I want to build a multiple input network. I'm wondering if I should : Build 1 network with 3 different pipeline convolutional, merge their result and then use a softmax. Build 1 network with shared weigth for features part and then softmax
