How many genes are sampled in either data set you've obtained? When the number of genes is large, it shouldn't be surprising that a gene may be highly differentially expressed in one replicate but not in another. This is a consequence of multiple testing. When you filter genes according to a $p=0.05$ statistical significance level, you have a 5% chance of making a type I error for any given gene. When averaged over several dozens or hundreds of genes, the chance of including at least one erroneous gene is greatly multiplied. If you don't want to exclude more genes than you have to, why not just include them all?
