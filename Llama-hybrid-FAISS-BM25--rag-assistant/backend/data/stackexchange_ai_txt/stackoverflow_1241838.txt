Not enough Storage is available to process this command when running java utilities from command line

I'm on Windows Vista 64 bit, with a 64 bit jvm installed. I'm trying to use jstack and jmap -- two utilities that come with the JDK -- to peek into an application server's guts. This works fine on a windows xp machine, 32 bit. However, when I run these commands against the processid for a ColdFusion application server on this vista64 machine, I get the error message in the title of this post. All I'm doing is running jstack , where pid is the processid of my CF server, and I'm getting this this machine has plenty of available memory, but I highly doubt it's a memory problem. The reason I say that is that if I start JBoss, which is taking up just as much memory as CF, I can run jstack against that process. Thanks for advice
