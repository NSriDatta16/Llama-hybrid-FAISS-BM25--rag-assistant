You say "I have done 100 measurements. These had a Gaussian distribution with some mean $u$ and std. dev. $s$". Assuming independence, the translation of this statement is $$ D_i \stackrel{ind}{\sim} N(u,s^2) $$ and thus $$ p(D|\theta) = \prod_{i=1}^n (2\pi s^2)^{-1/2} \exp\left(-(D_i-m)^2/2s^2 \right) $$ where $D=(D_1,\ldots,D_n)$ with $n=100$ and $\theta=(m,s)$. Now you need to assign a prior to $\theta$, i.e. $p(\theta)$ and the posterior is $$ p(\theta|D) \propto p(D|\theta)p(\theta).$$ Depending on the form of this prior, it may or may not be conjugate. P.S. There appears to be nothing related to time series in this question.
