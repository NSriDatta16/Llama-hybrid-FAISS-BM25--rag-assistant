Sounds like you're getting the old file name stuck in the file upload field. Not sure if that can happen for filefield but this is a feature for other field types. Try adding the -nosticky pragma, eg, use CGI qw(-nosticky :all); . Another pragma to try is -private_tempfiles, which should prevent the user from "eavesdropping" even on their own uploads. Of course, it could be that you need to localize ( my ) some variable or add -force to the filefield.
