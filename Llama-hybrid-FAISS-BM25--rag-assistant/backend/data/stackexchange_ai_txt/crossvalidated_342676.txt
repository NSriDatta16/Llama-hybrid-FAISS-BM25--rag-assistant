A logistic regression aims to model the probability of success of an event (here, the intent to pay). The associated formula to the model is the following. $$ {\rm logit}(p(1 |X)) = \log\!\Bigg(\frac{p(1|X)}{p(0|X)}\Bigg) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + ... + \beta_j x_j $$ Here, $p(1|X)$ stands for the probability of success (intent to pay), $p(0|X)$ for the probability of failure (not paying), $\beta_i$ the coefficients of your regression and $x_i$ your predictors (whether they are discrete or continuous). Basically, coefficient $\beta_i$ explains the influence of predictor $x_i$ over the outcome. A positive $\beta_i$ implies that the occurrence of the predictor increases the odds ratio (chances of success) for a binary predictor. For a continuous predictor, this implies that the odds ratio increases as the predictor increases. A negative $\beta_i$ implies that the occurrence of the predictor reduces the odds ratio for a binary predictor. For a continuous predictor, the odds ratio will decrease as the predictor increases (and vice-versa). A null $\beta_i$ implies that the predictor has no effect on the outcome. The exponential version of these coefficients only changes the scale of the interpretation values. $\exp(\beta_i) > 1\;\; \Leftrightarrow\;\; \beta_i > 0$ $\exp(\beta_i) $\exp(\beta_i) = 1\;\; \Leftrightarrow\;\; \beta_i = 0$ For visualization purposes, I would simply use a bar plot, and privilege restitution of $\beta_i$ coefficients, especially if you are presenting these results to non-statisticians. Why these coefficients ? Because from personal experience, non-statisticians visualize better the idea of positive / negative impact of a predictor if they see positive / negative values rather than values below / above 1. Most will pay little attention to the numbers. You can however complete this graph with another bar plot to represent the exponential coefficients. They give you directly the odds ratio, but in my opinion, this should come in second for high-level visualization. People will get the general idea with the first graph, and only those who are willing to dig in the numbers will be interested by the second graph.
