SQL export to ListView using C#

I have a query that selects 3 columns from a SQL table, I need to export the resulting query into a listview. I don't need any help with the SQL setup, just how to format it into the listview. There is where I am stuck. Any help is appreciated. Thanks! string sql = "select distinct pro,ds,date from dbo.Sge where date IN (select max(date) from dbo.Storage) order by project"; SqlConnection con = new SqlConnection("Data Source= ;Initial Catalog= ;Integrated Security= SSPI"); con.Open(); DataSet ds = new DataSet(); SqlDataAdapter adapter = new SqlDataAdapter(sql,con); adapter.Fill(ds); foreach (DataRow row in ds.Tables[0].Rows) { for(int i=0; i Edit: Sorry guys, i mentioned ListBox originally and i meant ListView. My ListView is detailed and had a column for each of my columns in my select, i just simply need the SQL export to go to the right column. This is what I have come up with, but it doesn't add to each column, just to the first column foreach (DataRow row in poplb6ds.Tables[0].Rows) { listView1.Items.Add(row["Pro"].ToString()); listView1.Items.Add(row["size"].ToString()); listView1.Items.Add(row["Date"].ToString()); }
