I've used several products. The ones that I can recommend are: SchemaAgent ( http://www.altova.com/schemaagent.html ) From their feature list: Connect to any file repository to analyze file relationships Visualize files as graphical components Immediately identify linked, referenced & related files Analyze file relationships based on color coded lines View details of displayed files (IIRs, global elements, namespaces, etc.) Drag & drop to manage IIR relationships between XSD, XSLT & WSDL files Automatically insert & save required IIR code in impacted files Build complex XSD, XSLT & WSDL files from smaller components Re-use standardized components in a modular development approach Access SchemaAgent schema components in XMLSpy schema editor Save & print graphical designs to document your XML information architecture Understand file dependencies & the impact of every change and XPathVisualiser ( http://www.xml.com/pub/p/275 ) Disadvantage (at least in my eyes): requires MSXML3 and IE
