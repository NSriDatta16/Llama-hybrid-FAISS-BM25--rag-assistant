How to take advantage of browser caching of XAPS

I have a Silverlight Application that currently downloads XAPs on demand using Package.DownloadPackageAsync() from the System.ComponentModel.Composition.Packaging namespace. As far as I can tell this circumvents any sort of browser caching of XAPS that may take place. Does anyone know how to take advantage of browser caching using on demand downloads ? The only thing i can think of is doing my own caching of XAPs in isolated storage. Thanks,
