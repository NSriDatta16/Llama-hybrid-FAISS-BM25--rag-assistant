it seems odd to have logic like that in my view. View will have view logic in it. MVC is not MVP or MVVM where any code behind is discouraged. I believe having if in the view is quite normal. Alternative is to have the model (view model) have a property which will be set as CSS class of the span . If error is empty, CSS class could have display:none;
