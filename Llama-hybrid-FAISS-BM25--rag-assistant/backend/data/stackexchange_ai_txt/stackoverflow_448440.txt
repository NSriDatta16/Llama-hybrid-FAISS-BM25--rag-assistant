Generic Exception over webservices

I am integrating with MS Dynamics GP WebServices from C# and I am not sure how to handle exception. If I do a GetCustomer with a inexistant ID, the web services return me a "generic" SoapException and the message is "Business object not found." So the only way I see to be sure it's an invalid ID and not any other error, is by parsing the error message, I find this solution extremely fragile. My GP version is English, on customer site it's gonna be french and I have no idea in which language web services message gonna be. I am thinking about catching it, parsing the message and throw a more meaningful error type. Do you see a better option ?
