A/Bingo not writing conversions correctly?

I'm using A/Bingo for Rails, and it seems to be working fine, except for counting conversions. It looks like conversions for the first user that converts are counted, but then it gets stuck and doesn't record any other conversions. I know that conversions occurred because I see them in two completely separate and unrelated analytics apps. My test is called body_background_white , and is set up like this: #application.html.erb # conversion trigger (not cached) def install bingo!("installation") # redirect_to "/images/pixel.gif" response.headers["Pragma"] = "no-cache" response.headers["Cache-Control"] = "no-cache" logger.info "Installation complete for ABingo participant #{session[:abingo_identity]}" logger.info " Campaign data: #{cookies[:campaign_data].inspect}" logger.info "Cachebusting check: #{rand(10000)}" render :text => "" end #log output Installation complete for ABingo participant 3462657478 Cachebusting check: 2699 Completed in 2ms (View: 0, DB: 0) | 200 OK [/_conversions/install] -- Installation complete for ABingo participant 1402985604 Cachebusting check: 5050 Completed in 2ms (View: 1, DB: 0) | 200 OK [/_conversions/install] -- Installation complete for ABingo participant 5021442890 Cachebusting check: 6231 Completed in 2ms (View: 0, DB: 0) | 200 OK [/_conversions/install] -- Installation complete for ABingo participant 9682352285 Cachebusting check: 6665 Completed in 2ms (View: 0, DB: 0) | 200 OK [/_conversions/install] Do you know what might be causing the conversions (beyond those of the first user) not to register on the abingo dashboard page?
