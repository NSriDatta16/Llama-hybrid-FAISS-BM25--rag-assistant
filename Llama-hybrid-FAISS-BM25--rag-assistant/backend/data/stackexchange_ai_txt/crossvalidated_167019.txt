The package QSARdata also contains the mutagen data set. The variables are named Mutagen_Dragon and Mutagen_Outcome, so you need to rename them descr and mutagen respectively. Unfortunately, both these data sets have the same problem: The example code in the good old paper of Kuhn does not work. When I call findCorrelation(), I get the error message 'missing value where TRUE/FALSE needed'. Kuhn reports the descr table contains 1576 columns, whereas our data set contains 1579. Khun himself later suggested this fix: zv = apply(trainDescr, 2, function(x) length(unique(x))==1) sum(zv) # there are 3 zero-variance columns; remove them which(zv) trainDescr = trainDescr[ ,!zv] testDescr = testDescr[ ,!zv]
