My opinion is twofold: Learn the language . JavaScript closures and {key: {function}} are not that hard to understand. In fact, it's a pretty common dialect. Learn the framework . jQuery, prototype, etc. are all great frameworks that tries to follow a principle of regularity and homogeneity along all the API. If you grasp this way of doing things in your own JavaScript code, things become clear. For example, I recently needed a method for applying custom behavior to some inputs. Instead of going functional style, I extended all the elements with my method (I'm using prototype), which goes in line with the rest of the prototype stuff. If one keeps these kinds of principles in mind when developing, most of the code becomes pretty straightforward. My biggest complaint for JavaScript is to know how to organize my .js files, but that's another story.
