OneNote like web clipping software for notes, code examples, and articles on Mac OS?

As a developer I find I am gathering more and more information from blogs and other resources from the web. Whether it be tips on configuring Drupal on IIS7 or tips on using the Entity Framework I find I am looking for a way to capture and organize content from the web. I also would like to be able to edit and annotate content to be able to add my own notes and remove add banners or any other content not related to what I am capturing. When I used Windows OneNote seemed to fit the bill but I have recently moved to Mac OS and I am looking for an equivalent software package. I could run OneNote in a VM but would prefer to have a Mac OS native app. Here are some of the things I am looking for .. Native app rather than web based. Because a web based product could go out of business and my collection could be lost. Ability to organize and handle a large amount of data. Good web clipping ability. So much of my content comes from the web. Thanks for any suggestions!
