Why not leverage bash-completion while you're at it? You should be able to fork a bash shell with /etc/bash_completion sourced and talk to it over pipes to interrogate it. That way you'd have all the shell goodies. Of course, you could do as I do and C-z suspend Vim to drop back to your shell instead.
