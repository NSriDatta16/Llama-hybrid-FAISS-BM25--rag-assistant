The ORM Provided by Magento's Framework does not support many to many relationships. If you need to provide this type of functionality for additional Magento functionality you'll need to use a different ORM system, or write your SQL queries manually. If you want to stick to the Magento core files, I'd investigate the Zend_Db* files that come bundled in lib. Remember, while there's a lot of cool Framework features in Magento, it wasn't built to be a general purpose development framework. It was built to service the needs of Varien/Magento Inc in building an Ecommerce Platform.
