I suggest using http://south.aeracode.org , it's a DB migration app for Django and it allows to make such changes without even touching MySQL shell/admin. This way you have kind of replayable macros for updating any computer to the latest DB scheme. And using it is as simple as what they have written here: http://south.aeracode.org/wiki/ConvertingAnApp
