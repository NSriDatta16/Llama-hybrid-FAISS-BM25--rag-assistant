Magento Custom Field Defines Product

I am running a Magento store where someone can buy a personalized item with their name on it. Under the product, you see "Name:" with an input box where they can fill out their name. They click "Add to Cart", it ads it, I fill the order and everyone's happy. But, in order to purchase another product with a different name, they have to go from the cart back to the product. Its a mess. I'd like there to be a button under the "Name" field that says "Add Another". Upon click, it pulls down another field for "Name:". Now we see two name fields, I add "John" and "Joe" in the first and second fields, then click "Add to Cart". In my cart, I now see two products added. One with Johns Name, and one with Joes. Any and all help is greatly appreciated. I'm a Wordpress guy trying to figure out Magento!
