The root of the problem was on the LINQ To SQL designer and a previous screw-up on the FK relationship. The association between Customer and Color had the association to another field on the Customer. This was total PEBKAC, and I hadn't checked the L2S designer for any problems. I deleted the Color table from the L2S designer, refreshed the table list in Server Explorer, and dragged the Color table over to L2S again. The association was corrected.
