Yes, in multi-label learning the label information is often encoded as the binary vector you described. It is also easier so for evaluation. We may want to check MULAN , an open source Java library for multi-label learning. It is a Weka extension and has implemented many multi-label classifiers, neural networks included. For example, you can find BP-MLL here .
