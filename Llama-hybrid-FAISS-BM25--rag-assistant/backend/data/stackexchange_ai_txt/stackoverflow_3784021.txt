You got it. Take a look at that JSON.encode output. Only simple data types are allowed in JSON representations, partly for ease of creation, and partly for security. (The reason we use something like JSON.decode instead of eval is the possibility of embedding functions.) You'll have to modify the JSON library source code to accept functions, or write your own in order to preserve the literal definition of the object upon conversion to string. Consider, though, the possibility that you don't really need to do this. There's probably a better solution, but I can't begin to address that without knowing your exact situation.
