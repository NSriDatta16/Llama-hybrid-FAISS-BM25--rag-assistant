Quantifying the error from a Bayesian model

I have a Bayesian model that predicts the chance of some event occurring. This is basically a binary classification. To view the accuracy, I took the prediction output of my test data and binned it every 10%. For example, if the model predicted a 15% chance of the event occurring I placed it in the 10% - 20% bin. Once I had binned all the test data, I then calculated the actual probability for that bin. Using the last / far right bin as an example, the predicted was 90-100% while the actual was 97.2%. For this model, the prediction and the actual are fairly close. Accurate Model In this model (below), the predicted and the actual are off for most of the bins. In other words, my model isn't predicting the event very well. My question is, how do I describe / quantify the error between what the model says will happen vs what really happens. I was thinking something like, the probability of this event happening is 22% +- 6%, but I have no idea how to calculate that. Inaccurate mdoel
