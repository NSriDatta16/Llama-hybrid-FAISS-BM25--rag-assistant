I built a Tween engine for java that is generic enough to be used to tween any attribute of any object. The generic part is done through the definition of a "Tweenable" interface that users need to implement to tween their objects. I greatly encourage you to use it as inspiration to build your engine, or directly port it. I can also plan a home-made port to C++, but it would be quite a lot of work to maintain it up-to-date with the current java version (which grows very fast). http://code.google.com/p/java-universal-tween-engine/ NB: I made a more elaborated answer about this engine in this question: Android: tween animation of a bitmap
