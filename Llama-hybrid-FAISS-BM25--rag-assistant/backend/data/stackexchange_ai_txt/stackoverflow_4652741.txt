Using named anchors is a bit old-school these days. You can link to any point in the page by using its id. So, knowing that, a better way might be to grab all but the first two paragraphs, like you're doing, and put them into another div: var $more = $(' ', { id : 'linkFromReadMore' }); $('#bookDescription > p').slice(2).appendTo($more); $('#bookDescription') .append(/* whatever you want in-between */) .append($more) ;
