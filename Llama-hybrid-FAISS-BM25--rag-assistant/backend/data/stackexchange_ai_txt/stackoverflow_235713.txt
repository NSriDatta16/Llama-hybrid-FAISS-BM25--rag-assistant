The only way that will "always work," so far as I've been able to find, is changing the user-agent string in the registry . That will, of course, affect every web browser instance running on that machine. You might also try a Google search on DISPID_AMBIENT_USERAGENT . From this Microsoft page : MSHTML will also ask for a new user agent via DISPID_AMBIENT_USERAGENT when navigating to clicked hyperlinks. This ambient property can be overridden, but it is not used when programmatically calling the Navigate method; it will also not cause the userAgent property of the DOM's navigator object or clientInformation behavior to be altered - this property will always reflect Internet Explorer's own UserAgent string. I'm not familiar with the MSHTML component, so I'm not certain that's helpful. I hope that at least gives you a place to start. :-)
