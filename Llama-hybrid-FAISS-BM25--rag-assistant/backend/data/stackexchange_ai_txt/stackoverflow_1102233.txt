NHibernate mapping: UserTypes with many-to-one

New to NHibernate and learning it as we are modifying an existing solution to use this ORM. Ideally, the storage structure and object classes need to stay the same, so Ive come across one or two mapping problems. One class 'Money' has a value and currency. The value is a double and the currency is a foreign key to a list table of currencies. Money can appear as a type on many objects/tables, so Ive created a CompositeUserType to map it along with a standard mapping to currency. This works fine, but for the life of me I cannot get the currency relationship to lazy load from NHibernate. We use fluent, but am happy for any pointers in hbm.
