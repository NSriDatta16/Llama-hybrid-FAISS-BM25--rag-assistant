P/Invoke C# to C++

I'm trying to learn how to run C# and C++ code together using Mono on RedHat. I'm fooling around in order to learn how to get the two to interoperate together in order to be a bit more educated when I work on a larger project. I've got a problem that I'm making a P/Invoke call from the C# to my C++ code and an exception is being thrown. Using Mono, I can get the C++ code to call the C# code no problem. My C++ method that I want the C# to call is as follows. extern "C"{ void Foobar(){ printf("Hooray!"); } } My C# code that I have uses the following P/Invoke lines. [DllImport ("__Internal", EntryPoint="Foobar")] static extern void Foobar(); In my C# program, I call Foobar(); further down in a function. The exception I catch is an EntryPointNotFound exception. I'm probably overlooking something silly. I've used http://www.mono-project.com/Embedding_Mono as instructions regarding how to do this. Any suggestions appreciated. Thanks, mj
