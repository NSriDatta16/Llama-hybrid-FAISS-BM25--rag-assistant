Why do they name the EventArgs parameter 'e'?

As all of us know, .NET has very good documentation and variable/parameter naming. Oftentimes, you can figure out how to pass parameters to a function just by variable names shown at design time without consulting the documentation at all. Something that is very interesting for me is that the only variable that has an unrelated name is e which is used in nearly all event function declarations such as: private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) private void button1_DragDrop(object sender, DragEventArgs e) My question is why do they name all event arguments e ? Is there history behind it?
