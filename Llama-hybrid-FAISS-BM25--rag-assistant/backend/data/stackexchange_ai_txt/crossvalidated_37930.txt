Prediction with Bayesian networks in R

I've been trying to teach myself about Network Analysis, and I've been able to develop DAG charts in R. However, I've looked through three or four R packages and have seen little in the way to a function to generate joint probabilities for the network. The DAG plot tells me about the variables in relation to one another, but I'm more curious about the probabilities and haven't found a way to do that in R. If anything, there seem to be a lot of packages dedicated to generating plots or focused on inference, and I want to know how I can get the probabilities for the networks. library("bnlearn") library("Rgraphviz") dat=data.frame(won=c(1,0,0,1,0,0), sold=c(0,0,0,1,0,0), insured=c(0,0,1,0,0,1), credit=c("POOR","FAIR","GOOD","FAIR","FAIR","GOOD")) dat$won = factor(dat$won) dat$sold = factor(dat$sold) dat$insured = factor(dat$insured) dat$credit = factor(dat$credit) highlight.opts
