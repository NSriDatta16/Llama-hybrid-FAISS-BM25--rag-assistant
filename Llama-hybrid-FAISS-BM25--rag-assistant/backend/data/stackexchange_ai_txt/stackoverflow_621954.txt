Ways of representing frequency of updates as a graph?

I want to create a graph representing the frequency of updates to a site (for example, how often I have posted to my blog over the past 5 years). One obvious way to do this is to plot "number of entries posted per month" for the past 60 months, but this feels unsatisfying. Should I be looking at using something like a rolling average instead? What are good visialisation techniques for displaying this kind of data?
