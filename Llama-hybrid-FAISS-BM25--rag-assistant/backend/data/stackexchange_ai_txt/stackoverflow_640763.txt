What programming languages/platforms can you use for GUI in a WinPE environment?

I'm starting work on a project that must be delivered in WinPE . I will likely be able to use WinPE 3.0. I'm also aware of Bart's PE and VistaPE , but I think I'm going to stick with WinPE. I need x64 support and the full range of storage drivers. I want to develop an app with a GUI and network access. I would like to work in Visual Studio to design my GUI, although that's not a requirement. What programming languages will I be able to use to target WinPE, with GUI support? With a little bit of research I've discovered that .NET simply isn't supported (by Microsoft), so that seems to exclude all C#, modern VB, etc. Has anyone run Java/Swing? C++ with MFC or ATL (modern)? Hacked in .NET to get CLR support? I can run Perl with Win32::GUI. But it does not allow me to use Visual Studio with the Resource View to create the GUI I want. It must all be done programmatically. Or is that possible?
