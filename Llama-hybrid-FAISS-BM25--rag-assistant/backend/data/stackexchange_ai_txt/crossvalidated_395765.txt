This operation is called de-meaning or more informally making the series/signal zero-mean . The "de-mean"ed version of $Y$ is surely $y=\{-1 -1,0,0,1,1\}$ as you wrote. But, this operation shouldn't be confused with the definition of zero-mean time series , i.e. a random process / signal is zero mean when $E[X(t)]=0$ . You can make the signal zero-mean by subtracting different values from each entry. For example, $y=\{1,1,2,2,3,-9\}$ is also a zero-mean signal. I just subtracted the sum of your series from the last element.
