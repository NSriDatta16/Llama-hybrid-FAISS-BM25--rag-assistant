A minor improvement to mattiast's case statement (I'd edit, but I lack the karma) is to use the compare function, which returns one of three values, LT, GT, or EQ: doGuessing num = do putStrLn "Enter your guess:" guess do putStrLn "Too low!" doGuessing num GT -> do putStrLn "Too high!" doGuessing num EQ -> putStrLn "You Win!" I really like these Haskell questions, and I'd encourage others to post more. Often you feel like there's got to be a better way to express what you're thinking, but Haskell is initially so foreign that nothing will come to mind. Bonus question for the Haskell journyman: what's the type of doGuessing?
