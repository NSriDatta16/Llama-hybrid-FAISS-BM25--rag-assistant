I agree with @treeface. Use jQUery's DatePicker, but use the date format localized for your country users. It happened to me, that around the world people uses diferent time formats. Pay attention to that. You can store that time in your database using MySQL DATE (YYYY-MM-DD), DATETIME (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS) or UNIX TIMESTAMP. Comparing dates it's easy, there are lot of scripts to read about that. Use your controleer to send the data to your model, compare, and return TRUE/FALSE depending on the result. With that boolean, you can show the results to your user. Also, you can accomplish that using a jQuery. Send the selected date to the server, compare, and return a JSON response with and OK/NOTOK status. For example: .... .... $("input#datepicker").datepicker({ showOn: 'both', buttonImageOnly: true, buttonImage: 'images/calendar-trans.png', firstDay: 1, dateFormat: "dd/mm/yy", // Select a time format that suits you changeMonth: true, changeYear: true, onSelect: function(dateText, inst) { $.post(url+"/calendar/check_date/", { date_selected: $("input#datepicker").val(); },function(data){ if(data.status != 'OK'){ alert('Your date is wrong. Try again!'); } }); } });
