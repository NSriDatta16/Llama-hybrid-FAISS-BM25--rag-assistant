so, to answer my own question, i believe that creating a DataProvider object with the XML is the best solution. assigning the XML to the DataProvider doesn't require setting up and iterating thru a loop, although there may be an internal loop happening behind the scenes. i would be interested to know if it does or not, so please leave a comment if you know. additionally, DataProvider objects also support sorting, retrieval and flexibility for the creation of lists, data grids, etc.
