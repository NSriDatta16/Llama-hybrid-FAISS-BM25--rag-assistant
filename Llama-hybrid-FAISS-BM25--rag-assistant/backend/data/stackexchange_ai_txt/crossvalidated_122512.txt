What are the alternatives of a chi square test in testing for changes in categorial data?

I have done a survey trying to understand the waste disposal habits of people. One question is "What proportion of waste paper do you recycle". Another question is "Given a new local policy is enacted, what proportion of waste paper do you recycle." I have provided the following options to each of the questions: 0 to I want to find out whether the policy is effective in encouraging people to recycle paper. What statistical testing tool can I use? I am thinking about the chi-square distribution, but I think this only shows whether there is a difference, not increase or decrease. If there isn't any test I can use, I plan to do a chi-square test showing whether there is a difference, plus some other visual aid to show an increase or decrease. How does that sound? I know this is an awkward question, but since I am a newbie in the world of statistics, I haven't thought carefully about it beforehand. Any answers appreciated.
