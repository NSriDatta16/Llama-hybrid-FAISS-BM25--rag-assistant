The best books on the subject are "Pro Drupal Development" and "Using Drupal." "Pro Drupal Development" includes several nice flowcharts and thorough summaries of each of Drupal's APIs (forms, theming, etc.). It's intended to be especially instructive to people making their own modules and themes, but has lots of value to the average PHP-savvy developer who wants to understand Drupal. Besides which, I've created a custom module for every site I've built, just to gain the extra control over things like selectively hiding fields on various forms (which you generally want to do for the sake of simplifying node forms for end-users), so it's good to have this knowledge under your hat. "Using Drupal" is aimed at the site developer who wants to know how to build the good stuff like galleries, blogs, and social networking sites. It goes through several use-cases and shows how to configure existing modules to do each job. In the process it familiarizes you with the essential add-on modules "Content Construction Kit" (CCK) and "Views," how to make custom blocks and templates, and the ins-and-outs of maintaining a Drupal site. I recommend this book especially for those who want to get up to speed and actually USE Drupal right away. In the process you gain an understanding of the internal organization of Drupal.
