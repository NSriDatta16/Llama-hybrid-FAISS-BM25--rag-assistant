You could look at sensitivity and specificity . They can be combined effectively to either provide a basis for a correct classification, or the basis for an exclusionary classification within each class. That said, if you are looking for a measure for the model as a whole, you'll probably want to look at some sort of weighted average of the sensitivity scores. sensitivity is the same calculation as precision , but specificity is not the same as recall . That said, you may need to have several models that specialize in different areas or, perhaps as worst case scenario, you may need to produce a one-vs-the-rest ensemble of models to get the best results. This might help if, as anymous.asker suggested, perhaps you can introduce some cost around positive or negative outcomes. HTH
