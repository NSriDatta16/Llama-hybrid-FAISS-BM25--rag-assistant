Don't use logging for this, use Performance Counters instead. The runtime impact of performance counters is minor and you can simple have them always on. To collect and monitor the performance, you can rely on the existing performance counters infrastructure ( perfmon.exe , logman.exe , relog.exe etc). I personally use XML and XSLT to generate the counters . I can then decorate all my code with performance counters tracking functions being run, average call duration time, number of executions, rate of executions per second and so on and so forth. Good choice of counters will give an immediate, accurate, performance picture much faster than logging can. While logging can give more insight on certain event paths (ie. order of events that lead to certain state), logging can seldom be 'always on' as the impact on performance is significant, not only on performance but most importantly on concurrency as most existing logging infrastructures add contention.
