Proxying with django and gunicorn

I have a django application that i serve using gunicorn. I do that by using the method prescribed on the gunicorn site - embedding gunicorn into my django application. I'm trying to set up a proxy into my application so that when you go to "http://mysite.com/proxy/" it does proxy you to "http://mysite.com:8100". I know i can do that with apache and other webservers. For some reasons i would prefer to do it directly with gunicorn/django. One of theses reasons is keeping everything in the same place. My question is, what is the best way to do that ? Also is it a terrible idea altogether ? Thanks.
