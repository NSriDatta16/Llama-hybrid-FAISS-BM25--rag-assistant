Structure of NN for input data with drop out

In financial markets, there is a simple problem of trading calendars varying across different countries. For example, Sweden observes Sweden National Day and Norway has Whit Monday. Typically, what happens then is that a time-series in the equity market that was closed for a holiday 'catches up' the next day when the market is open again. For example: +-----------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+ | Date | SEK 1 | SEK 2 | NOK 1 | NOK 2 | +-----------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+ | Date 1 | + 0.2% | +0.4% | +0.3% | +0.6% | | Date 2 | + 1.1% | +0.7% | +0.3% | +2.1% | | Date 3 | -3.2% | -2.9% | NaN | NaN | | Date 4 | +0.1% | -0.2% | -2.8% | -1.6% | +-----------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+ The objective of my model is to adjust the NOK returns for dates 3 and 4 since they have been distorted by the NOK holiday on Date 3. To do this I will use as many good dates as I have, such as date 1 and build a large dataset by randomly dropping out some data, adjusting the following the date and using the dropped out adjustments as the input and obviously I know the supervised output as the real data. I feel that this would be well suited for a neural network, but I have never constructed one before with dropped out input. Would it be appropriate to just build network where input data-points that are missing have no impact on the weights for that round? Are there any neural networks (or all) that do this by default?
