I'm not sure what you consider "painless." C strings are pretty painful. We can find the first non-whitespace character position trivially: while (isspace(* p)) p++; We can find the last non-whitespace character position with two similar trivial moves: while (* q) q++; do { q--; } while (isspace(* q)); (I have spared you the pain of using the * and ++ operators at the same time.) The question now is what do you do with this? The datatype at hand isn't really a big robust abstract String that is easy to think about, but instead really barely any more than an array of storage bytes. Lacking a robust data type, it is impossible to write a function that will do the same as PHperytonby's chomp function. What would such a function in C return?
