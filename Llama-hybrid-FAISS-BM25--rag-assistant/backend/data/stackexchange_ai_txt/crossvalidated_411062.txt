Comments on ordinal vs. nominal categories: Ordinal. Suppose we are interested in ages, treat the categories as ordinal, and seek to use the available available information on the locations and variability of age in each region. Then using 'average' ages m = c(5, 15, 20, 40, 75) as in my answer, the average age in three different regions (1, 2, 3), with three different vectors of proportions for the categories, are as shown below. The first region has the same proportion in each category, the second tends to have "older' inhabitants than the third. The three averages reflect these differences as expected. m = c(5, 15, 20, 40, 75) p1 = rep(.2, 5) p2 = c(.1, .2, .3, .2, .2) p3 = c(.2, .3, .2, .2, .1) a1 = sum(m*p1); a2 = sum(m*p2); a3 = sum(m*p3) a1; a2; a3 [1] 31 [1] 32.5 [1] 25 Using my second variability formula (something like a standard deviation), we see that the first region may have more diverse ages than the third. v1 = sqrt(sum(p1*(m-a1)^2)) v2 = sqrt(sum(p2*(m-a2)^2)) v3 = sqrt(sum(p3*(m-a3)^2)) v1; v2; v3 [1] 24.77902 [1] 23.58495 [1] 20.24846 My formulas for average and variability are essentially ones that have long been used to approximate sample mean and sample standard deviation from grouped data, Nominal. If we view the categories as nominal then it may make sense to use some kind of index of diversity among the categories. If we are mainly interested in the needs for vaious kinds of social services (pre-school, parks with playing fields, elder care) in the regions then then looking at a diversity index might be a reasonable approach. User @4k3x9d7r suggested using Shannon entropy in his Answer (+1). I think it would be inappropriate to dismiss this suggestion. This method does not require speculating about 'average ages' in the various categories. Results for Shannon entropy (using $\log_2$ ) are shown below. Notice that regions 2 and 3 have the same Shannon entropy because they have the same proportions (but assigned to different categories). se1 = -sum(p1*log2(p1)) se2 = -sum(p2*log2(p2)) se3 = -sum(p3*log2(p3)) se1; se2; se3 [1] 2.321928 [1] 2.246439 [1] 2.246439 Simpson's diversity index (for five categories) $\lambda =\sum_{i=1}^5 p_i^2.$ Results for the three hypothetical regions are shown below. For five categories, $\lambda$ takes its minimum value in region 1. sd1 = sum(p1^2); sd2 = sum(p2^2); sd3 = sum(p3^2) sd1; sd2; sd3 [1] 0.2 [1] 0.22 [1] 0.22 These two indexes are discussed in Wikipedia , including rationales for the formulas involved. Another recent Q & A on this site has discussed the Simpson diversity index.
