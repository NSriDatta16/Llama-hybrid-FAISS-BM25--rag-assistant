C# Friend classes and OOP Composition

Given class A, which contains sets of raw data, and class B, which contains a re-organized version (GUI ready) of that data I would like to make the raw data in A visible in B. Clearly the raw data in class A is contained in private members. I would like to make that data visible in B though the use of something akin to the C++ friend classes method. How can I approach this? Thank you.
