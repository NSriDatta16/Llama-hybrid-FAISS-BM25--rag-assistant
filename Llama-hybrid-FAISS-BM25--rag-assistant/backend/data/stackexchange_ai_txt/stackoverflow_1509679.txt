I'll be the contrarian here ... I think your first impulse (to throw an exception) is the right thing to do. If you're checking within the business logic rather than the UI, there won't be any feedback at that level to the user. (If you're not checking in the UI, we have other problems). Therefore, the proper way to handle it is by throwing an exception. Of course that doesn't mean you have to have the exception bubble up to the UI level thus short-circuiting the rest of your logic. What I usually do it put the enum assignment in its own little try-catch and handle the exception by reassigning or whatever other elegant solution you've devised. In short ... you were on the money with your first thought. Go with it. Just change your exception handling a little different.
