James-Stein estimator: How did Efron and Morris calculate $\sigma^2$ in shrinkage factor for their baseball example?

I have a question on calculating James-Stein Shrinkage factor in the 1977 Scientific American paper by Bradley Efron and Carl Morris, "Stein's Paradox in Statistics" . I gathered the data for the baseball players and it is given below: Name, avg45, avgSeason Clemente, 0.400, 0.346 Robinson, 0.378, 0.298 Howard, 0.356, 0.276 Johnstone, 0.333, 0.222 Berry, 0.311, 0.273 Spencer, 0.311, 0.270 Kessinger, 0.289, 0.263 Alvarado, 0.267, 0.210 Santo, 0.244, 0.269 Swoboda, 0.244, 0.230 Unser, 0.222, 0.264 Williams, 0.222, 0.256 Scott, 0.222, 0.303 Petrocelli, 0.222, 0.264 Rodriguez, 0.222, 0.226 Campaneris, 0.200, 0.285 Munson, 0.178, 0.316 Alvis, 0.156, 0.200 avg45 is the average after $45$ at bats and is denoted as $y$ in the article. avgSeason is the end of the season average. The James-Stein estimator for the average ($z$) is given by $$z = \bar{y} + c (y-\bar{y})$$ and the the shrinkage factor $c$ is given by (page 5 of the Scientific American 1977 article) $$ c = 1 - \frac{(k-3) \sigma^2} {\sum (y - \bar{y})^2}, $$ where $k$ is the number of unknown means. Here there are 18 players so $k = 18$. I can calculate $\sum (y - \bar{y})^2$ using avg45 values. But I don't know how to calculate $\sigma^2$. The authors say $c = 0.212$ for the given data set. I tried using both $\sigma_{x}^2$ and $\sigma_{y}^2$ for $\sigma^2$ but they don't give the correct answer of $c = 0.212$ Can anybody be kind enough to let me know how to calculate $\sigma^2$ for this data set?
