I came across this post while searching for the answer. Here is the solution. In the config file of QTAgent32.exe and devenv.exe in C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\Common7\IDE, add the following element to the section: This can be added to machine config file (C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\Config\ machine.config) for all VS2010 tools. Be sure to run notepad as administrator to allow machine.config to save. See this link for details: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd409252%28VS.100%29.aspx
