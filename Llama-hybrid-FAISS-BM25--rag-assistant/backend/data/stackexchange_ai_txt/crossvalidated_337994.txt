Regressing adjusted-R2 on a constant

Lets say I have a panel of adjusted-R2 statistics from some regressions involving experiment / survey data. Can I regress these adjusted-R2 statistics on a constant to find the average adjusted-R2, and the 95% confidence interval associated with the average R2? In particular, I have data on multiple individuals and conduct an experiment on each individual three times a day (morning, afternoon, and evening). I then regress the outcome of the experiment for each individual on a number of covariates and, among other things, record the adjusted-R2. I now want to find the average adjusted-R2 across all my regressions and have some kind of confidence interval around it. Can I run the the simple regression outlined above to do this? Ideally, I would like my confidence interval to be constructed using robust standard errors. Edit: To make the question more general, if I have data for two countries and run the following regression within each country (note, the $i$ here indexes country): $Y_{i}=X_{i}\beta + \varepsilon_{i}$ And $X_{i}$ represent the same variables within each country / individuals / firms, can i interpret the average $\bar{R}^{2}$ from the two regressions as the average variation in $Y$ that $X$ explains across the countries / individuals / firms?
