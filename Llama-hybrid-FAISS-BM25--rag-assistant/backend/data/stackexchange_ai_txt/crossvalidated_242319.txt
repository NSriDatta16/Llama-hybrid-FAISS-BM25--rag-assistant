Usually when performing Bayesian inference it's easy to encounter heavy integration over nuisance variables for instance. Another example can be a numerical sampling as in this case from a likelihood function, meaning to perform a random sampling from a given distribution. As the number of model parameters increases, this sampling becomes extremely heavy and various computational methods have been developed to speed up the procedure and allow very fast implementations, keeping of course a high level of accuracy. These tecniques are for instance MC, MCMC, Metropolis ecc. Take a look in Bayesian data analysis by Gelman et. al it should give you a broad introduction! good luck
