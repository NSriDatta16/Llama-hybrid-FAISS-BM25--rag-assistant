How can I git clone without a proxy?

I am on Ubuntu and am trying to git clone some packages off arago-project.org However, I do not seem to be able to do this. My laptop is connected via WiFi to my home wireless router. carson@carson-laptop:~/oe$ git clone git://arago-project.org/git/arago.git Initialized empty Git repository in /home/carson/oe/arago/.git/ It just does nothing after that... Some googling reveals that some people use a proxy. However, is this really necessary? And if so, what proxy do I use in that case? UPDATE: waited for longer and got this error carson@carson-laptop:~/oe$ git clone git://arago-project.org/git/arago.git Initialized empty Git repository in /home/carson/oe/arago/.git/ 2011/01/09 10:00:14 socat[4024] E connect(3, AF=2 150.229.98.44:8080, 16): Connection timed out fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly carson@carson-laptop:~/oe$
