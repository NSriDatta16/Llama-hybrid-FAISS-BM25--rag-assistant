Semantics of header elements and WCAG 2.0

Am doing some accessibility testing on a site i am currently working on using Total Validator and the WAVE toolbar. When using these it raises issues with the header structure of my documents and causes failures under Guideline 1.3.1 - Use structural markup in a way that does not represent relationships in the content http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/F43.html I always understood that the most important heading on the page should be the h1 and that this heading does not always have to be the first heading on the page. So for example i have a h2 in the masthead of the site which appears before the h1 in the markup. However, even though the h2 appears prior to the h1 i would not say that it describes the page as well as the text i have marked up as a h1. If i were to mark up the h2 as a h1 the most important heading throughout the site would only be contextual to the site and would not describe the page effectively. I would have thought that this was not good practice for all manner of reasons e.g. SEO, Accessibility (Assistive technologies using headers to navigate through the site) Am pretty sure that this is a case of pragmatism over validation.
