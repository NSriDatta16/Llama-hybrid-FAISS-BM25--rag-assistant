The solution posted by Vikash doesn't work; it produces an "Incorrect syntax" error in SQL Management Studio (2005, as the OP specified). The fact that the "Compact Edition" of SQL Server supports this kind of operation is just a shortcut, because the real process is more like what Robert & JohnFX said--creating a duplicate table, populating the data, renaming the original & new tables appropriately. If you want to keep the values that already exist in the field that needs to be an identity, you could do something like this: CREATE TABLE tname2 (etc.) INSERT INTO tname2 FROM tname1 DROP TABLE tname1 CREATE TABLE tname1 (with IDENTITY specified) SET IDENTITY_INSERT tname1 ON INSERT INTO tname1 FROM tname2 SET IDENTITY_INSERT tname1 OFF DROP tname2 Of course, dropping and re-creating a table (tname1) that is used by live code is NOT recommended! :)
