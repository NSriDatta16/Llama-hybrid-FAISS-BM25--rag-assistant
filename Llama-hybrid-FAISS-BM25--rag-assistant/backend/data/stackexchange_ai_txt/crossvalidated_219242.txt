The function ndiffs allows for at most second order differencing by default (argument max.d=2 ), see the help file . Perhaps that is why it returns 2 (which indicates order of at least 2). Consider the following example: generate a series that is integrated of order 3 and find its order of integration using the function ndiffs using the default maximum order: set.seed(1) x=cumsum(cumsum(cumsum(rnorm(1000)))) ndiffs(x) ndiffs(diff(x,differences=1)) ndiffs(diff(x,differences=2)) ndiffs(diff(x,differences=3)) It will suggest 2 for the raw series (incorrectly, and similarly to your case), 2 for the first difference of the series (correctly), 1 for the second difference (correctly) and 0 for the third difference (correctly). Now allow for a greater maximum order of integration: ndiffs(x,max.d=5) ndiffs(diff(x,differences=1),max.d=5) ndiffs(diff(x,differences=2),max.d=5) ndiffs(diff(x,differences=3),max.d=5) Now you are getting order 3 for the raw series, which is correct. However, beware that economic and financial time series can rarely be argued to have an order of integration greater than 2 (this could be the motivation for the default value max.d=2 ).
