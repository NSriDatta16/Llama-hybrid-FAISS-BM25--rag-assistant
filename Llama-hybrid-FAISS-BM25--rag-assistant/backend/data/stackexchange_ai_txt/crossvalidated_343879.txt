Applying GARCH Model to Forecasts

I'm reading up on GARCH models in Springer Introductory Time Series, and had a question on how we actually apply the model to forecasts. The data can be grabbed like so: stemp I originally fit a seasonal ARIMA to the data using auto.arima. The squared residuals appear to be correlated so I thought I'd fit a GARCH(1, 1) model to the residuals. library(forecast) stemp.arima The correlogram of the squared stemp.garch residuals appear to be white noise. Now that I have that knowledge, though, I don't understand how it would impact my predictions. I was thinking I could simulate a GARCH process using the coefficients from the GARCH output and the distribution of the seasonal ARIMA residuals. I could then take that and add it to my seasonal ARIMA predictions. Not sure if that's a good method, though.
