You cant change the license on a piece of code without the authors permission. End of story, full stop, etc etc. If you are embedding it in another project (as I believe the CodeProject license allows), then make sure to put a notice inside your COPYING file (or equivilent) with a copy of the codeproject license, the affected file[s] and the authors legal name.
