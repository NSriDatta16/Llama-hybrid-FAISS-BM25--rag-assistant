In your example the size of the subclass doesn’t matter because you are allocating memory for the big fat subclass on the heap, then you store the pointer to it in a pointer to a superclass. To correct your analogy you told someone to build a garage big enough for your wife’s car. And all you do is point to where that garage is. You may be pointing to a large garage, or a small garage, it doesn’t matter to you since you’re only pointing your wife to where the garage is, someone else took care of making sure the garage is big enough.
