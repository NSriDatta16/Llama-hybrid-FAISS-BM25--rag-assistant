I have never found a better tool than thinking it through and using my own mind. If the query is so complicated that you cannot do that, you may want to use either CTE's, views, or some other carefully organized subqueries to break it into logical pieces so you can easily understand and visualize each piece even if you cannot manage the whole. Also, if your concern is effeciency, then SQL Server Management Studio 2005 or later lets you get estimated query execution plans without actually executing the query. This can give you very good ideas of where problems lie, if you are using MS SQL Server.
