Relative/Absolute still won't do what you want, so long as the orientation isn't changed too. There is no generic mechanism to tell the X server to interpret pointer devices in a different orientations. You'll need to somehow get the underlying device to report differently. There is a generic mechanism for communicating with the underlying device, however. I have a Wacom stylus built in to my laptop. To restore normal orientation, I can do the following: xsetwacom set "stylus" Rotate NONE which directly talks to the underlying driver. I can also do the following: xinput set-int-prop stylus 'Wacom Rotation' '8' 0 which communicates with the X driver via XInput "properties" to do the same thing. The "evdev" is fortunately one that does allow such remapping. xinput list , in addition to the stylus shows my laptop's trackpoint and an external mouse which are both run via evdev: ⎡ Virtual core pointer id=2 [master pointer (3)] ⎜ ↳ Virtual core XTEST pointer id=4 [slave pointer (2)] ⎜ ↳ stylus id=6 [slave pointer (2)] ⎜ ↳ eraser id=7 [slave pointer (2)] ⎜ ↳ TPPS/2 IBM TrackPoint id=14 [slave pointer (2)] ⎜ ↳ HID 0430:0100 id=11 [slave pointer (2)] ... xinput list-props 'HID 0430:0100' Device 'HID 0430:0100': Device Enabled (135): 1 Device Accel Profile (251): 0 Device Accel Constant Deceleration (252): 1.000000 Device Accel Adaptive Deceleration (254): 1.000000 Device Accel Velocity Scaling (255): 10.000000 Evdev Reopen Attempts (299): 10 Evdev Axis Inversion (301): 0, 0 Evdev Axes Swap (303): 0 Axis Labels (304): "Rel X" (143), "Rel Y" (144) Button Labels (305): "Button Left" (136), "Button Middle" (137), "Button Right" (138), "Button Wheel Up" (139), "Button Wheel Down" (140) Evdev Middle Button Emulation (306): 2 Evdev Middle Button Timeout (307): 50 Evdev Wheel Emulation (308): 0 Evdev Wheel Emulation Axes (309): 0, 0, 4, 5 Evdev Wheel Emulation Inertia (310): 10 Evdev Wheel Emulation Timeout (311): 200 Evdev Wheel Emulation Button (312): 4 Evdev Drag Lock Buttons (313): 0 xinput set-int-prop 'HID 0430:0100' 'Evdev Axis Inversion' 8 1 1 inverts my external mouse.
