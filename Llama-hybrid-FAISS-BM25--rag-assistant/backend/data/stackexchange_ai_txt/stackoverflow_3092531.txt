If you're working with an overworked MySQL server then yes, cache that data into a file. Then you have two ways to update your cache: either via a cron job, unconditionally, every N minutes (I wouldn't update it less frequently than every hour) or everytime the data changes. The best approach depends on your specific situation. In general, the cron job way is the simplest but the on-change way pretty much guarantees that you won't ever use stale data. As for the storage format, you could just serialize() the array and save the string to a file. With big arrays, unserialize() is faster than a big array(...) declaration.
