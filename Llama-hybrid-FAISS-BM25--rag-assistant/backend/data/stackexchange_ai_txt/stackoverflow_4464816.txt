It would be much more helpful if you were to post the PICTURE/USAGE clauses for the data item in your input file record as well as the DB/2 column definition. However, this looks a lot like a data conversion issue. Things to check out are: Does the input file record have a PICTURE/USAGE something like PIC 9(5).99 . The key point is that there is an explicit decimal point in the declaration. If you look at the input file with a text editor (eg. the ISPF editor) you would see a number something like 12345.67 . These numbers are in display format. Think of them as being text. DB/2 column definition. Decimal numbers in DB/2 are commonly declared as something like: DECIMAL(7,2) . Numbers declared in this way are stored by DB/2 in packed decimal format. Display format numbers, as probably exist in the input file, are not compatible with Packed Decimal numbers (apples and oranges). To illustrate this point consider the following little COBOL program: IDENTIFICATION DIVISION. PROGRAM-ID. EXAMPLE. DATA DIVISION. WORKING-STORAGE SECTION. 01 A PIC 9(6).99. 01 B PIC 9(6)V99 PACKED-DECIMAL. PROCEDURE DIVISION. MOVE 123456.78 TO A DISPLAY 'A=' A MOVE A TO B ADD 1 TO B DISPLAY 'B=' B MOVE B TO A DISPLAY 'A=' A GOBACK. Variable A is in display format, with an explicit decimal point. All you can do is assign it a value for display purposes. Trying to do something like ADD 1 TO A will result in a compile error. The trick is to get numbers in display format into something that is a compatible with DB/2 (eg. Packed Decimal). The COBOL MOVE verb does this job. Declare a new variable with a data type compatible to that used by DB/2. Variable B above is such a variable. Move the display formatted variable to the Packed Decimal variable as in: MOVE A TO B . The COBOL run-time does this conversion. Notice that you can now add something to B . Display B (woops the decimal point disappeared - I will let you figure out why). Then move it back to display format, hey, the decimal point came back. DB/2 takes host variables as they come without conversion. If that host variable does not have the correct data format you will get an error. You probably need to do something like: Read Record MOVE record display data (eg. `A`) to a DB/2 compatible field (eg. `B`) EXEC SQL INSERT INTO table ( ... SALARY, ...) VALUES ( ... :B, ...) END-EXEC.
