Object detection with just one image?

Deep neural networks require lots of examples to learn tasks like image classification, and object recognition. On the other hand, we humans can learn and identify object just by looking at it once. Is there any method that allows us to do object detection just with one example? I tried to search for it, but couldn't get any satisfactory solution.
