How to use 5 by 5 or 7 by 7 kernel size for a deep learning network with 3 by 3 kernels?

I am using a U-Net architecture. The visual area of the segmentation mask is very small and after learning it is giving a lot of false positives. I am thinking of changing the kernel size of 3 by 3 to 5 by 5. What precautions/care shall I take while creating the model? I am getting issue of dimensionality mismatch if just change 3 by 3 to 5 by 5 kernel size.
