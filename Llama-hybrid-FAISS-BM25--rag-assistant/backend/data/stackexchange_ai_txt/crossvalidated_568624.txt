You can think of mixed models as a two stage modeling approach. Firstly, you fit a model irrespective of the random effects; secondly you model the effect for each level of the grouping factors (random effects) via an approach known as partial pooling, see here and here for some more explanations and details. Finally, you adjust the fixed effects model based on the random effects. All of this happens together when running a mixed-effects model. Here is an example using the sleepstudy data in R : > m fixef(m) (Intercept) Days 251.40510 10.46729 Which is the same as this: > m2 coef(m2) (Intercept) Days 251.40510 10.46729 Going back to the lmer model, the random slopes estimates are: > ranef(m) $Subject (Intercept) 308 40.783710 309 -77.849554 310 -63.108567 330 4.406442 331 10.216189 332 8.221238 333 16.500494 334 -2.996981 335 -45.282127 337 72.182686 349 -21.196249 350 14.111363 351 -7.862221 352 36.378425 369 7.036381 370 -6.362703 371 -3.294273 372 18.115747 with conditional variances for “Subject” Now you adjust the average (fixed effect) intercept for each subject based on the estimated random effect, let's look at Subject 308 as an example: $251.40510 + 40.783710 = 292.1888$ The result can also be checked by looking at coef(m) as well: > coef(m) $Subject (Intercept) Days 308 292.1888 10.46729 309 173.5556 10.46729 310 188.2965 10.46729 330 255.8115 10.46729 331 261.6213 10.46729 332 259.6263 10.46729 333 267.9056 10.46729 334 248.4081 10.46729 335 206.1230 10.46729 337 323.5878 10.46729 349 230.2089 10.46729 350 265.5165 10.46729 351 243.5429 10.46729 352 287.7835 10.46729 369 258.4415 10.46729 370 245.0424 10.46729 371 248.1108 10.46729 372 269.5209 10.46729 And now here's your example that also includes random slopes: > m3 fixef(m3) (Intercept) Sepal.Width Sepal.Length 0.20829042 0.27271644 0.01795717 > ranef(m3) $Species (Intercept) Sepal.Length setosa -0.3483057 -0.12751737 versicolor -0.1508964 0.06863214 virginica 0.4992021 0.05888522 with conditional variances for “Species” Let's combine the fixed and random intercept and slopes together for setosa as an example: Intercept : $0.20829042 - 0.3483057 = -0.1400153$ Sepal.Width stays the same (no adjustment, i.e. not included in random effect terms): $0.27271644$ Sepal.Length : $0.01795717 - 0.12751737 = -0.10956019$ Let's check with: > coef(m3) $Species (Intercept) Sepal.Width Sepal.Length setosa -0.1400153 0.2727164 -0.10956019 versicolor 0.0573940 0.2727164 0.08658932 virginica 0.7074925 0.2727164 0.07684240 Here is a good explanation and an example that is not too complicated to follow and easy to understand: https://m-clark.github.io/mixed-models-with-R/random_intercepts.html#the-mixed-model Another helpful link understanding complete pooling, no pooling and partial pooling: https://www.r-bloggers.com/2017/06/plotting-partial-pooling-in-mixed-effects-models/
