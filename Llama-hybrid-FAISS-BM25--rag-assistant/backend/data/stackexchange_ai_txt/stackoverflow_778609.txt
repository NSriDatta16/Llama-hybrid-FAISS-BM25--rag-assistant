datagridview with comboboxes

I have created two classes: public class Params : List { } public class Param { public enum enType { Integer, Double, String, DateTime } private string sName_m; public string Name { get { return sName_m; } set { sName_m = value; } } private string sValue_m; public string Value { get { return sValue_m; } set { sValue_m = value; } } private enType eType_m; public enType Type { get { return eType_m; } set { eType_m = value; } } } Now I want to be able to show the Params in a Grid type control on a windows application, so I dragged a DataGridView on to my form, and chose a datasouce by picking Other Data Sources -> Project Data Source, and then choosing my Params Class (frmMain+Params). Now when I run the app, I can add/delete/edit records and the grid shows the three columns. What I'd like to be able to do is have the Type column be a drop down letting my pick values in the enumeration. Currently, I have to type a string that has to match the enumeration. Possible?
