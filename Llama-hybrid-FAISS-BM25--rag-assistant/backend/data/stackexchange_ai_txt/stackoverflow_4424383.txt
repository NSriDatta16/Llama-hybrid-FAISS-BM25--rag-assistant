Another extended comment, simpler still than @steabert's: PROGRAM print_int INTEGER s s = 2 CALL print_my_int(s) CONTAINS SUBROUTINE print_my_int(x) WRITE(*,*) x END SUBROUTINE print_my_int END PROGRAM print_int By containing the subroutine in the program you coerce the compiler into making an explicit interface, saving 3 lines of code. By leaving the declaration of x within the subroutine implicit, the compiler spots the error.
