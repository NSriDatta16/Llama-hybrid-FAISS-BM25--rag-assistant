You can't. The order in which for..in loops through the property names is implementation-specific and cannot be controlled. Your only alternative is to organize the properties yourself in some way, such as building an array of keys and then sorting it, e.g.: var keys, index; keys = []; for (k in obj) { keys.push(k); } keys.sort(); for (index = 0; in dex You could, of course, put that in a function on the object and use it to iterate through the keys. Alternately, you could keep a sorted array on the object itself, provided you kept it up-to-date when you created new properties.
