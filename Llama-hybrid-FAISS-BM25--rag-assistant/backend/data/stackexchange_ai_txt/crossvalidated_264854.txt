There are several advanced methods built on the PS logic that might be of interest to you. One is " covariate balancing propensity scores ," which use logistic regression but instead of maximum likelihood, they use GMM with covariate balance as the moment condition. In this way balance is included in the estimation procedure itself. This yields propensity scores which almost always achieve very good balance. Another is entropy balancing , which generates weights that satisfy moment conditions, where the moment conditions are user-specified statements of balance. For example, you can say you want balance on average age and after entropy balancing the groups will be nearly identical on average age. Another that you might find particularly appealing is genetic matching , which allows you to specify a matrix that contains balancing criteria and preferences of some variables over others. These three methods are the cutting edge in preprocessing and may alleviate your distaste for traditional propensity scores. All of these can be implemented in R.
