Correlation between multiple time series

For research, we put some test samples through a physical process for a certain period of time and make measurements. The general structure of the data we collect is as follows: Experiment A - Measurement A1 - Measurement A2 - Measurement A3 ... and similarly Experiment B - Measurement B1 - Measurement B2 - Measurement B3 ... Note that each measurement is an independent time-series data on a test sample (might be univariate or multivariate). By the nature of the test samples and the process, it is expected that some measurements from different experiments should somehow match or correlate. I would like to calculate the matching pairs from different experiments (ex. A2 and B4). So far, I was doing this by iterating through measurements and calculating a cross-correlation function. But I want to switch to a Deep Learning/Neural Network approach using PyTorch. I have some prior experience on time-series data classification using PyTorch. However, I couldn't come up a with a solution to that problem. So here are my questions: What kind of a problem is this? I would say it is a classification problem? What are the keywords should I use for further research? How should I structure the architecture of my model? In general, any kind of leads are appreciated. Thanks!
