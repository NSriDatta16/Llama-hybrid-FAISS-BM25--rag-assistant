As the previous two answers show, there's really no built-in functionality in SQL Server that's readily available for your requirements. There are a ton of dynamic management views which can tell you some of your points of interest, e.g. sys.dm_db_index_usage_stats which tells you when a given index has had its last seek or update. But there's really nothing in the box per se that you could leverage to get all the information you're looking for - you really have to do this yourself, adding e.g. datetime fields to your tables and filling them with triggers. Sorry I can't give you any better news - that's just the way it is for now. In SQL Server 2008, you have additional new features, that might cover some of your requirements - check out: Change Data Capture SQL Server Auditing Marc
