It depends I generally work first on an AJAXless site and build up. Always try to be trustful to the concept of graceful degradation and unobstrusive javascript . Separation of functionality (the "behavior layer") from a Web page's structure/content and presentation Best practices to avoid the problems of traditional JavaScript programming (such as browser inconsistencies and lack of scalability) Progressive enhancement to support user agents that may not support advanced JavaScript functionality This can be achieved by making sure links and forms can be resolved properly and rely not solely on Ajax. In JavaScript, e.g. a form submission can be halted by using "return false". If nothing goes wrong, Ajax code will be executed and the form submission will be skipped. If any problems occur with the user agentâ€™s Ajax support or if the user does not have JavaScript enabled, the form will be submitted and the traditional version of the action will be performed. On some sites it could be more work than it's worth, but generally people use AJAX for coolness sake, that it's always a bad reason, and end up giving up with pages that break http common and basic functionality (like bookmarks and open in new tab when clicking).
