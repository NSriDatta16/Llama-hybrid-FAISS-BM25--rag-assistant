Recognising made up terms

Say I have a tagging system on an electrical circuit: Name Description ------- -------------- BT104 Battery. Power source SW104 Circuit switch LBLB-F104 Fluorescent light bulb LBLB104 Light bulb ... ... I have a hundreds of tags created by people who should have followed my naming conventions but sometimes they make mistakes add unnecessary additional characters to tag names (i.e. BTwq104 etc.). Up until now I used regular expressions, that I built over time whilst observing various inconsistencies that users introduce whilst naming different parts of their circuits, to parse the names and tell me what the different elements are. For example: name ' BT104 ' would tell me it's a battery on circuit 104 . I would like to investigate or use a machine learning technique to identify what a tag name is (same way I used regular expressions). Any suggestions and approaches are welcome. So far I tried Named-entity recognition suggested technique " Bag of words ". Followed a few tutorials here and here (latter being the most useful in learning). None of them produced wanted results if any. I think that "Bag of words" are mostly used for real word rather than made up words.
