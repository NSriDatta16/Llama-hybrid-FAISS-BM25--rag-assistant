Here's how you set the user agent for all requests made by mechanize.Browser br = mechanize.Browser() br.addheaders = [('User-agent', 'your user agent string here')] Mechanize can fill in forms as well br.open('http://yoursite.com/login') br.select_form(nr=1) # select second form in page (0 indexed) br['username'] = 'yourUserName' # inserts into form field with name 'username' br['password'] = 'yourPassword' response = br.submit() if 'Welcome yourUserName' in response.get_data(): # login was successful else: # something went wrong print response.get_data() See the mechanize examples for more info
