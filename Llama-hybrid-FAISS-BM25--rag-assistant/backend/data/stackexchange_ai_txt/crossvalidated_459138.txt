It's not a matter of philosophy, it's wether we get where is bayesian inference being done. Remember that under bayesian inference estimates come from the posterior distribution . In your problem the bayesian approach does not limit you on what type of hypothesis test you want to make. What limits you is wether your hypothesis statements make sense in relation to the posterior distribution. For instance if your posterior is absolutely continous, making statements suck as $H_0 = k$ does not make any sense. This is because to make bayesian hypothesis tests you simply have to compute the probability of the $H_0$ statement from the posterior and atoms under continous distributions have 0 probability. As for what your particular problem concerns, you can still test the simple vs compound case. From your question I can see $P(H_0) = .45$ this is $H _0: p = .1$ , it is clear that $P(H _1) = .65$ where $H_1: p > .1$ (this a kolmogorov axiom of probability), then you reject $H _0$
