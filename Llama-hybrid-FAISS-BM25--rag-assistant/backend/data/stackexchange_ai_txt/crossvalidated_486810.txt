There is no advantage to using the log-rank statistic and several disadvantages: Unlike the Cox model, log-rank does not generalize to a Bayesian framework the log-rank test only works for mutually exclusive categories and does not handle a continuous exposure variable log-rank does not allow for general covariate adjustment Since the log-rank test is a special case of the Cox model, it does not have fewer assumptions or more power. IMHO we no longer need to be using or teaching the log-rank test.
