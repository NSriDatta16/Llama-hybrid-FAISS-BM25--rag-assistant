I would recommend using the jQuery accordion widget , also. I've worked with it and it very easy to use, light weight, works on all browsers and I've found no bugs whatsoever. There are a lot of skins you can choose for and, if push comes to shove, it's not really that much of a pain in the ass to build your own skin. Besides that, take a look at the way you're embedding your SWFs, especially the wmode attribute. There's a good explanatory article written here , you could start with that. You can ignore the GPU and direct modes, because I think you're not using a SWF compiled for Flash Player 10. And of course, you should unload the flash movies that are not visible.
