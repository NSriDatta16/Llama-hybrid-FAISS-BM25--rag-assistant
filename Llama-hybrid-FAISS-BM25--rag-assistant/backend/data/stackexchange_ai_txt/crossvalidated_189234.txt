which is better/how they differ? independent t-test or simple logistic regression?

As a beginner in stats, i am wondering do simple logistic regression do what independent t-test does? and if yes, why do we still do t-test ? e.g. If there is a binary variable (e.g. smokers to non-smoking ) and a continuous variable (e.g. age) I can use t-test to test the mean difference between the 2 groups I can use simple logistic regression and consider smoking as outcome and age as predictor I think i can also use bisereal correlation ?? are they different ?
