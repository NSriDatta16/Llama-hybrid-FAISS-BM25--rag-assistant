The server in question is currently called Stratus. You can find out more about it at Adobe Labs . You can absolutely get smooth streaming with a server-based solution with Flash, but you have to have enough bandwidth to support all of the streams (4 streams for a two person conversation - 2 up and to down). There are a few options here, but the two best are probably Adobe's Flash Media Interactive Server and the opensource (and quite awesome) Red5 . I agree that an applet-based solution would be inelegant, but it may be the only real way to get p2p video at this time. Jingle is very cool, but as you mentioned the open source bits don't support video yet. I don't think re-implementing it is a really viable solution only because of the level of effort required.
