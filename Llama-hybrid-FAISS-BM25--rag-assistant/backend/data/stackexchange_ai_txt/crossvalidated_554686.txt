No, I fear this is not possible. Kernels are inner products, which means they live in vector spaces which are Hilbert spaces. The $l_2$ norm is the only $l_p$ norm induced by an inner product. The other norms only give you Banach spaces. Check wikipedia for this. It may be possible to generalise the notion of Kernels or Kernel-methods to Banach spaces. But this would be a very different theory and I am not aware of any applications.
