Ratio of odds ratio to Cohen d

If I have two binary predictors and a binary response how can we calculate the effect size of the interaction term. I use logistic regression from statsmodels package in python. Will it be ratio of odds ratio (ORR)? Can I use ORR also for effect size of other interactions like binary-quantitative, binary-ordinal, binary-categorical? Do we have any guidelines to interpret this term in simple words like small, medium or large (like we can for cohen d)?
