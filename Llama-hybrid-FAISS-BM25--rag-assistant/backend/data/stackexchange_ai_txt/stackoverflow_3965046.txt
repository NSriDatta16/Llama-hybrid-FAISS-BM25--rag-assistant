@HeRz you are correct, there is no way to filter behaviors by their targeted type. Blend (and probably vs designer) use reflection to find all of the types you create which inherit from base type Behavior and displays them in the assets list. Blend will prevent you from dragging a behavior or trigger onto an item which it is not intended. So that should help prevent their misuse. I usually try to write behaviors as reusable pieces of code, not scoped to a specific case. They are simply tools with specific purposes.
