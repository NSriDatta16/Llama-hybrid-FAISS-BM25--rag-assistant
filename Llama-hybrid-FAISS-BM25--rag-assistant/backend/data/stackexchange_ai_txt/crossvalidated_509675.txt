Is Dropping Interaction Terms Reasonable if You Just want Partial Regression Weights

Without interaction terms in a model, coefficients of lower order terms represents partial regression weights (i.e. how much influence does one parameter have assuming all other parameters are held constant). With interaction terms in a model, these same coefficients now represents conditional regression weights (i.e. how much influence does one parameter have when all other parameters are zero) and interaction terms* represent how much does one parameter's influence change when the value of another parameter changes. ( Citation ) This means that by including interaction terms you lose the partial regression weights. Is there ever a situation where I can justify not including interaction terms by saying 'I wanted to know how much influence a parameter had when all other parameters where held constant, so I had to exclude the interaction terms'? *This is the interpretation for second degree interaction terms, but my question does not change if you include higher degree interaction terms. Edit to provide example: Lets say you have enough data to make a linear model where the parameters are a bunch of characteristics of female wolves and the response is fitness. Three of these parameters are how dark the wolves' coat is ( C ), the weight above the average ( W ), and the age of the wolves ( A ). You have three wolves available to you; a male and 2 females. The females are the same age, but one has a darker coat and the other is larger. If presented with both females, which will the male prefer? If you do not include interaction terms, this is a simple question to answer. A is constant, so if C has a larger coefficient than W than the darker wolf should be selected, and if the coefficient of W is larger than the reverse should happen. In other words, if the benefit gained by a dark coat is greater than the benefit gained by having a larger mother, than the male should pick the darker wolf, and the reverse should happen if the benefits are reversed. If you include interaction terms, I do not see how you can answer the question. The coefficients of C and W only mean something if all other parameters are 0, which they are not in this case. The interaction term CxW tells you how the influence of C changes if W changes or vice versa, but that is irrelevant to the question you are asking.
