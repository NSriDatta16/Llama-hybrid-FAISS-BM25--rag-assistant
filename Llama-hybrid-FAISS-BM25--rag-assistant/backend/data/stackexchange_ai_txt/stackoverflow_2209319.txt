Creating a "Universities Attended" Profile field/block (Drupal)

Interesting question for everyone. So I have am thinking of adding a "university attended" field to the profile page of members in Drupal. I guess I am trying to figure out the best way to go about it. I was originally thinking of a text field, but than I thought you could get multiple instances of of university names, making it hard to sort people by school (ie. UF, University of Florida, Florida, U of F, etc). I then began to think about creating a drop down, but I wasn't quite sure where I could get a listing of all the schools. Perhaps I could find a database population that a site like LinkedIn or Facebook uses. Then I thought of what happens when someone has attended multiple schools, how would I account for that? So, I guess I wanted to pose the question of how would you go about adding a University(ies) attended field to profile pages if you had to design a site to do so?
