For the most part, that's the decision that I've faced in the past. On number 2 (creating categories), don't forget that it's difficult to create much more than an informational page using this technique. Any page that requires controller logic is effectively blocked out. Depending on what the actual customer requirement is, another approach would be to add admin configuration options for URL and Label. Your link structure would be more constrained, but you'd be able to enforce ULs, classes, extra classes for the current page, etc. You would probably leverage this on the back of number 1.
