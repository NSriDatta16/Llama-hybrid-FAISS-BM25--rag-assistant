Statics are bad for testability, and very much discouraged in MVC. Why do you want to access the current controller and action method? The best way to do this is to implement your own ActionFilter . This gives you a means of intercepting requests before or after actions methods execute. EDIT: By intercepting the result inside OnActionExecuted of a filter, you can do your noscript/script checks and modify your ViewData accordingly for consumption by the View. Inside OnActionExecuted, you can also do the noscript check and have complete control over the final ActionResult or the ViewData, as you please. Or, you can write your own ActionResult that makes all these decisions. So, your controller action ultimately does return new MyActionResult(format_and_view_agnostic_model_object);
