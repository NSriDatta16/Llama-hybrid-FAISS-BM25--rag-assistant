You always need to reference the server session somehow, cookies are the de-facto standard for this sort of stuff. How the session is stored on the server side is usually up to you... I really like PHP's approach with session_start(); which does all the session storage and cookies setting for you. PHP for example stores the session data in a file, making it cross-platform (all platform's have disk storage APIs). Other session mechanisms use a relational-database like MySQL, but that's not really cross-platform unless you want to target those type of users.
