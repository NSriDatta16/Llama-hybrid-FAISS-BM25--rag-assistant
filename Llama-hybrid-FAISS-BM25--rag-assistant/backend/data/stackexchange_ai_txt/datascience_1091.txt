Creating Bag of words

What is the best technology to be used to create my custom bag of words with N-grams to apply to. I want to know a functionality that can be achieved over GUI. I cannot use spot fire as it is not available in the organization. Though i can get SAP Hana or R-hadoop. But R-hadoop is bit challenging, any suggessions.
