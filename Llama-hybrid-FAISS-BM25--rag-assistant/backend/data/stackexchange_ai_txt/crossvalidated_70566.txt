Why Bayesian logistic (probit) regression instead of standard logistic (probit) regression?

I wonder under what condition I should use Bayesian logistic regression instead of standard logistic regression, or vice verse? I have individual-level data regarding whether a person purchase a particular item online (say, 11 inch MacBook Air) or not (dependent variable y=1 if purchase, 0 otherwise), meanwhile, I have information regarding each person's past online experience across different categories (independent variable x1=# of total past experience) but I don't know if such experience contains purchasing experience of MacBook Air or not. Also, I have info regarding different stores' feature (such as x2=shipping fee, x3=seller's reputation, etc.), I don't know if it's worth applying Bayesian framework on this problem since I never used Bayesian statistics before but really interested in knowing? Any advice would be appreciated!
