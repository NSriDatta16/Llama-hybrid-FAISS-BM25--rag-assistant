What are the error distribution and link functions of a model family in R?

When building models with the glm function in R, one needs to specify the family. A family specifies an error distribution (or variance) function and a link function. For example, when I perform a logistic regression, I use the binomial(link = "logit") family. What are (or represent) the error distribution (or variance) and link function in R ? I assume that the link function is the type of model built (hence why using the logit function for the logistic regression. But I am not too sure about the error distribution function. I had a look at R's documentation but could not find detailed information other than how to use them and what parameters can be specified.
