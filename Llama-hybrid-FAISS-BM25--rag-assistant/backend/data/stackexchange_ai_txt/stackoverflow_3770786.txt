The word "infinite" rules out a UISCrollView or a CATiledLayer , obviously. I'd say the easiest way to achieve this is to initialize enough UIImageView s to completely fill your screen (or scroll area), plus one, and implement your own dragging/scrolling system and recycle the UIImageView s as they go off one side of the screen to reappear on the other side. Because all the UIImageView s are the same image you shouldn't ever have to worry about memory/cache management.
