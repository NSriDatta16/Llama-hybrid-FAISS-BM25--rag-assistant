The answer to this question depends on how you define "3rd party tools". I usually take that to mean products from companies other than MS but excluding free open source software. When it comes to 3rd party products (for-profit) I cannot think of any common products that I've used or been asked to learn over the last decade that I've been doing .Net development. Most MS shops I've worked with turn to MS solutions (for good or ill depending on your personal view). That said, in recent years the number and quality of the various FOSS solutions out there has risen dramatically. I use the following whenever I can: Logging: log4net Inversion of Control Container (plus more): Castle Windsor ORM: NHibernate Unit Testing: NUnit Mocks for unit testing: Rhino Mocks For most of these projects there are many other options, these are just my current favorites. Learn to use these (and WHY they are needed) and you'll be many steps above the average .Net developer (sad but all to true).
