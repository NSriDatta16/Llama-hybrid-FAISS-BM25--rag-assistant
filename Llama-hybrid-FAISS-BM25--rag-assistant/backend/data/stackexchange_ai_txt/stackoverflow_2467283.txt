The correct way to do it is to use PROC EXPAND. There are a lot of options you can use with it but you might want to do PROC EXPAND DATA=TESTTEST OUT=MOVINGAVERAGE; CONVERT VAL=AVG / TRANSFORMOUT=(MOVAVE 5); RUN; and likewise for MOVSTD. It automatically ignores missing values but you can adjust that behavior as well
