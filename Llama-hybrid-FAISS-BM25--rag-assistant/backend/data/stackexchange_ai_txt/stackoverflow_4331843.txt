Planar Embedding (Planar Face Traversal) Algorithm in C#

I have a graph G . The graph is a planar graph . I wish to find all the faces of the graph. I understand that constructing a planar embedding is the way to find the faces ( or regions, or cycles) , such that all the edges must be shared by at most 2 faces. Is there a readily made implementation of planar embedding algorithm in C#? Either commercial or open source is fine.
