Firstly, no... the names are created based on the second table in the relationship. But what you should know is that you don't have to "refresh" (meaning, delete the table in the DBML then re-drag-and-drop it). For the project I'm working on, we have over 200 tables... about 50 of which we have manually tweaked after dragging them from the database. We never delete and re-drag tables as there have been so many changes post-auto-generation.
