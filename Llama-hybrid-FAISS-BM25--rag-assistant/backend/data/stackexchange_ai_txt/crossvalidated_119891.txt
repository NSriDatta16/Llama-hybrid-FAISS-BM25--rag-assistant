Firstly, adding up and averaging the scores per measure per respondent does not 'exclude you from using spearmank rank correlation test', it ENABLES you to use a real correlation test like Pearson's. This is better (more power). I think you should average scores for each measure (scale, set them to scale in SPSS), then test for correlation (by using Pearson's) 3 seperate times (AtoB, AtoC, BtoC) (subscales I wouldn't use seperately unless they have a seperate function in your hypotheses) Hope this helped!
