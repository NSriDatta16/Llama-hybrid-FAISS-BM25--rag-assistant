Interesting, I don't know the drag and drop interface well enough to be sure, but it looks like there's some sort of bug here. I modified your code slightly to add a handler for the drop event on the editable div: ContentEditable This is editable content This is not editable content I'm testing in Firefox 3.7 alpha: if I drag the image on to the middle of the text the event fires, I get an alert, and the return false stops the image being dropped. However if I drag on to the start of the text the event doesn't fire but the image gets inserted inside the div. Mind you, in Firefox 3.6 and Chromium 6.0 the event doesn't fire at all, so either I've completely misunderstood how it works or none of it works well enough right now to rely on.
