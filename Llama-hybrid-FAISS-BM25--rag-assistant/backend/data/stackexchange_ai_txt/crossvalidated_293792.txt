I think your own suggestion is a good place to start - "find which genes have a higher overall expression in the cells of one cluster versus the cells in the other" So ... get the average expression of each gene by cluster. Take the absolute value of the difference between the means for the two clusters and then sort these values. Since you do not really give your data structure it is hard to answer precisely, but it will look something like ExpDiff = apply(Expressions, 1, function(x) { abs(mean(x[Cluster == 1]) - mean(x[Cluster == 2])) } which.max(ExpDiff) OR sort(ExpDiff)
