As long as your ImageSource is a BitmapImage you could use the BitmapImage.DownloadCompleted event. The only problem I have found so far is that it only works from C#, so you would lose some flexibility. I'm guessing you could access that event from XAML, but I'm not sure how. The following sample starts loading the image with the click of a button, and updates a label when the image finished loading. XAML: Code: private void Button_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e) { BitmapImage bi = new BitmapImage(); bi.BeginInit(); bi.DecodePixelHeight = 100; bi.CacheOption = BitmapCacheOption.OnLoad; bi.UriSource = new Uri("bigImageUri"); bi.EndInit(); bi.DownloadCompleted += new EventHandler(bi_DownloadCompleted); image.Source = bi; } void bi_DownloadCompleted(object sender, EventArgs e) { label.Content = "dl completed"; } Hope it helps!
