To add to @whuber's excellent answer, and to further address OP's question "How to make the RM perform better?" , the condition presented where b=0.25 or less can often be a good approach if additional averaging is performed by way of Cesàro summation. Specifically, Polyak–Ruppert averaging can be used to construct rolling estimates of the $\theta$ root of the form $$\bar{\theta}_n=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\theta_i$$ given the much larger steps, where $a$ must necessarily be smaller than 1 in order for the rolling average to converge correctly. One of the main benefits of Polyak–Ruppert averaging is that it is often easier to automate due to its robustness rather than tweaking the a and b parameters because a just needs to be small enough such that the iterations randomly sample the area around the target root. The figures below demonstrate this phenomenon with $b=.05$ and $b=0.25$ . Of course, averaging over the independent Polyak–Ruppert averages is also a useful strategy if the independent search trajectory information is available. Finally, below is the modification to @whuber's code for b=0.25 and the much smaller b=.05 , though now with the Polyak-Ruppert averaging. f
