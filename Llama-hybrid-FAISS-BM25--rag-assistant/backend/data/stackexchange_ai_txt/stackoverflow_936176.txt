Hmm... I'm not sure about the whole drag-drop business, but if it's all working the resource will have been embedded into your assembly. I suggest you have a look with Reflector - you can see the resources embedded within assemblies using that. Have a look at the build properties for the item in Solution Explorer - in particular, if the build action is Embedded Resource then it will indeed be built into the assembly.
