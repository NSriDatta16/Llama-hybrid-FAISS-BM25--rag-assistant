logistic regression with conflicting results, so to speak

I was trying to duplicate values by running the same set of data, and my coefficients were different. there is one 0-1 dependent variable, and there are four 0-1 independent variables. I found out the reason I was getting different coefficients was that I had run it with the independent variables as nominal, and the person whose data I was trying to duplicate had run them as continuous. they were actually correct as verified by the interpretation of the intercept along with the actual data (i.e. leaving out variable rank4 as one of the variables gave an interpretation of 79% "ones" when rank4 was set to one, and that is exactly what the data reflected). so, two questions. one is why it mattered. I cannot fathom the mathematics behind it. secondly, does that suggest that in all cases one should run independent binary variables as continuous? thanks John
