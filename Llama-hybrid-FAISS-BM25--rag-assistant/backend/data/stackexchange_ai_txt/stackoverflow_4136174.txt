If you want to do this, you would need your Favorite class to be a NSObject with native storage that you synchronize with the [Connect] attribute, something like this: [Register] public class Favorite : NSObject { [Connect] public string Description { get { return (string) this.GetNativeField ("Description"); } set { this.SetNativeField ("Description", new NSString (value)); } } } You would do the same for your Song class. You can only store native classes in the NSStandardUserDefaults object store. An alternative would be what Jason suggested and just serialize to a string and then store that as a NSString.
