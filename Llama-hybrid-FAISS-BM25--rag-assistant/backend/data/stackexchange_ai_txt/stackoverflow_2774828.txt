Cakephp 1.3, Weird behavior on firefox when using $this->Html->link

Greetings, I am getting a very weird and unpredictable result in firefox when using the following syntax: $this->Html->link($this->Html->div('p-cpt',$project['Project']['name']) . $this->Html->div('p-img',$this->Html->image('/img/projects/'.$project['Project']['slug'].'/project.thumb.jpg', array('alt'=>$project['Project']['name'],'width'=>100,'height'=>380))),array('controller' => 'projects', 'action' => 'view', $project['Project']['slug']),array('title' => $project['Project']['name'], 'escape' => false),false); OK I know it is big but bear with me. The point is to get the following output: Name I'm not sure if this validates correctly both on cakephp and html but it works everywhere else apart from firefox. You can actually see the result here: http://www.gnomonconstructions.com/projects/browser To reproduce the result use the form with different categories and press search. At some point it will happen!! Although most of the time it renders the way it should, sometimes it produces an invalid output like that: name Looks like it repeats the link inside each element. To be honest the only reason I used this syntax was because cakephp encourages it. Any help will be much appreciated :)
