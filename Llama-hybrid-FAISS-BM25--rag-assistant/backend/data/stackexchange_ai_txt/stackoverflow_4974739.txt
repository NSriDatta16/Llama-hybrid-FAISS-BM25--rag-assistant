Edit: This does not check the edge case where the beginning of the week starts in the prior month. Some updated code to cover this: https://stackoverflow.com/a/14688780/308315 In case anyone is still paying attention to this, you need to use ordinalityOfUnit:inUnit:forDate: and set firstWeekday to 2. (1 == Sunday and 7 == Saturday) Here's the code: NSCalendar *gregorian = [[[NSCalendar alloc] initWithCalendarIdentifier:NSGregorianCalendar] autorelease]; [gregorian setFirstWeekday:2]; // Sunday == 1, Saturday == 7 NSUInteger adjustedWeekdayOrdinal = [gregorian ordinalityOfUnit:NSWeekdayCalendarUnit inUnit:NSWeekCalendarUnit forDate:[NSDate date]]; NSLog(@"Adjusted weekday ordinal: %d", adjustedWeekdayOrdinal); Remember, the ordinals for weekdays start at 1 for the first day of the week, not zero.
