Which model should I use in R?

I have a dataset consists of 22 variables with 1424410 observations. The dependent variable is tripprice which is numeric. The independent variables is categorized and I have converted them into factors with 2 - 8 levels. Example; Passengersize consists of 8 levels. Small group, medium group and large group consists of 2 levels which is 1 or 0 for presence. I've also got daytime, eveningtime, othertime which also is 2 levelse. I've tried to run a multinominal logistic regression, but couldnt get the results with glm because of the dependent variable is like numeric "2000" "153" and not a factor variable. I understand that I use glm when the dependent variable is categorical and the independent variables is continous? And the same for when the dependent and independent variables both are categorical that I use logistic regression. I also tried lm models, but then I've got 2 not defined because of singularities for large group and othertime..... SO what kind of regression do I use when my dependent variable is "normal numeric observations" and my independent variables is categorized with factor levels? Dependent variable; Trip price ("200, 59, 300...") Independent variables (Every categori got 1 or 0); Rush morning (2 levels, 1 or 0 for presence or not) Rush evening (2 levels, 1 or 0 for presence or not) Day time -"- Evening time -"- Other time -"- Passenger size (8 levels, 1 or 0 for presence or not) Small group -"- etc... But When I use lm in R, I've got "2 not defined because of singularities" for the independent variables large group and for othertime? I dont know why, cause I made all the independent variables as factors before I run lm.
