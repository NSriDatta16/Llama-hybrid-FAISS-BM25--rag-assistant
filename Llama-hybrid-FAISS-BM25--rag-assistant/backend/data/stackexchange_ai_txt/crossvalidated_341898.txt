Does anyone know how the accuracy of CNNs compare with fully connected networks for image recognition? The sole fact that since AlexNet won ImageNet competition, every neural network that wins it uses CNN component, should be enough to convince you that CNNs are better for image data. You most likely won't be able to find any meaningful comparison, since CNNs are able to handle image data that is infeasible using only FC layers. Why? The number of weights in FC layer with 1000 neurons for 224x224x3 image is something like 150M. That's 150M for only one layer . If you're not convinced this is a huge number, then note that modern CNN architectures that have 50-100 layers while having overall couple dozen milion parameters (for example ResNet50 has 23M params, InceptionV3 has 21M parameters). Also are CNNs good at anything other than image recognition? Yes. They're good for any data that has spatial structure (for example 1D convolutions over time for music). Also they're used in NLP - see this paper on sentiment analysis or this one on translation .
