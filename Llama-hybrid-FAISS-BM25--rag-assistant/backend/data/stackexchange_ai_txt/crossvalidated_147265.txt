Model to predict categorical outcome from continuous and categorical variables

I have to fit a model to test whether Learning (1=learned, 0=failed) depends on lizard sex (M or F), Lizard SVL (snout-vent length), or an interaction of the two. I am new to both R and this website. Please explain each step fully. This is random data given to us as part of a zoology/statistics assignment. It is related to lectures 'Generalized Linear Models' and 'Model Selection and Model Averaging'. Snout-vent length is used as a a measure of size (in millimeters). Specifically, what R code is required to fit a GLM when a categorical and continuous predictor variable are used to predict a categorical dependent variable? The following is from a previous example with two categorical predictor variables that we have worked through if that helps with what I am trying to ask: plot(ProportionSurvived ~ Treatment, data=dat) interaction.plot(dat$Sculpin, dat$Lake, response = dat$NSurvivors/dat$NSticklebackAdded) glm(cbind(NSurvivors, NSticklebackAdded - NSurvivors) ~ Lake * Sculpin, family = binomial(link = "logit"), data=dat) Treatment is one of four possible conditions (2 levels of 2 predictors; lake and sculpin present or absent). This example was testing the proportion of sticklebacks that survived ( proportionsurvived ) in a pond.
