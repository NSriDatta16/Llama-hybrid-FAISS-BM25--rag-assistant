How to specify dyad and subject ID random factors in an MCMC model in R?

I am working on a model to analyze a categorical outcome variable (7 categories) for a design with two fixed factors (Condition and Group) as well as the random factors of Subject ID nested in Dyad ID. I know how to do this type of nesting in lmer, but I am unsure in MCMCglmm. I am using the MCMCglmm package and I have put my current code below, where I have left Condition out for now (as it has not been previously significant in earlier models, which is confirmed visually; this also simplifies the model), and I currently only have DyadID included as a random factor. In addition, following previous tutorials and advice, the trait variable included. My question: How do I include Subject ID and nest it appropriately in this model? Also, if I do so, how does trait relate to this and what is the effect on the prior? prior5 ```
