How to summarize a time series independent variable for regression?

One of the things I've struggled with is the issue of effectively summarizing some sort of time series metric (i.e. independent variable) for use in a regression analysis. The most common solution that I've encountered (which may not be the best) is to compute a meaningful average. Although I can get a single number I still have the nagging feeling that it doesn't really capture what I need. Here's an example graph: Let's assume that there are 3 data points which when plotted over time we can see different types of growth. What I wish to capture/model is that the "flattens" represents the possibility that item sale (or whatever it represents) is eventually going to take a downturn or just stop selling. The "growth" curve is something that won't immediately stop but for the time being (e.g. 1 month) it's a safe bet to assume item popularity. Here are my questions: How can/should we capture the "shapes" of such time series based independent variables for regression? Does it even matter or is the average the best we can do? I thought of computing "slopes" (start, end) but as the graph shows (approximately) that there such a computation could lead to similar values for both flattens and growth curves. Is this even a thing? What could/should I use? Note: These shapes are just examples and the actual time series could be rather fluctuating. What I think I'm interested in is a way to capture a notion of a general trend in some way (if at all). I understand trends could be captured via moving averages, but I don't know how to capture "up/down-ness" or summarize it in a meaningful way. I'm hoping this doesn't become a two-step problem where we first train a model on "learning" these curves and what they represent and then feeding the output into the regression. That would be too complicated for now but I don't even know if that's a valid solution or should I just stick with averages.
