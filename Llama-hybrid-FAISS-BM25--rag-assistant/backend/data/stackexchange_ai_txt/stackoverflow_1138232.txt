HTML Embedded PDF's & onload

I'm embedding a PDF in a web page with the following html :- " /> " width="1024" height="600"> Your browser does not support embedded PDF files. The PDF's can be a little slow to load so I'd like to hide the object and display a loading message / gif until it's fully loaded so the user isn't looking at a blank screen. All I really need is a way of telling when the object is fully loaded. I've tried the 'onload' event of the but it never seems to get fired. I'm beginning to think it might not be possible, but it never hurts to ask...
