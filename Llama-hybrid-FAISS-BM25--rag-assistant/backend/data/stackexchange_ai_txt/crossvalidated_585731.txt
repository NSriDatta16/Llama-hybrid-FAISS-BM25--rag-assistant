So I did fit a longitudinal bayesian proportional odds model using brlm as suggested by Frank Harrells. The fit is quite good and seems to model what I wanted while still retaining the inferior bounds. However, I would have liked to do a posterior predictive check, but I don't quite comprehend the calculation of the predicted probabilities given all these confusing intercepts and the other "standard" Bayesian toolboxes don't seem to recognize the brlm models. Moreover, I tried calculating the contrast between the different groups at t=2, but I am at odds as how I can convert the value into the raw Y-units. The calculated contrast between the green and red group at t=2 is 1.866.
