Well I already explained this question here , in general terms. In Liferay portal you have to also specify windowState="exclusive" parameter in your action request. " /> It causes that the response won't be wrapped by some html fragments that would otherwise be needed in case of a render response, that doesn't return raw data but some View (JSP) to be rendered.
