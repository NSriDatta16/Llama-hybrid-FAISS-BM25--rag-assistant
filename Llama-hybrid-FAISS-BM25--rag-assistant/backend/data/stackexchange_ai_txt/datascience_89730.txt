The example's "micro-averaged ROC" is a little strange. It's like micro-averaged statistics in that each individual sample and possible label gets treated equally, but unlike them in most other respects. It essentially treats the problem as though it were multi-label ; as the threshold decreases, initially every row is classified as having no label, then picks up more and more labels, until finally every row is labeled as having all the possible labels. Then the true/false positives/negatives are taken over all the possible labels. This might be useful, and it might be ROC-like, but I don't think it's clear that such a curve should have any particular relationship to the individual class ROC curves (certainly not an average of them in any usual sense).
