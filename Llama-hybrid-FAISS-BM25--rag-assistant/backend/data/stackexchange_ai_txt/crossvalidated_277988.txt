Ben's answer is the most general result. But the intuitive answer to the OP is motivated by the case of categorical predictors, which are usually encoded as multiple dummy variables: one for each category. It makes sense in many analyses to consider these dummy variables (representing one categorical predictor) together rather than separately. If you have a categorical variable with, say, five levels, a straight lasso might leave two in and three out. How do you handle this in a principled manner? Decide to vote? Literally use the dummy variables instead of the more meaningful categorical? How does your dummy encoding affect your choices? As they say in the introduction of The group lasso for logistic regression , it mentions: Already for the special case in linear regression when not only continuous but also categorical predictors (factors) are present, the lasso solution is not satisfactory as it only selects individ- ual dummy variables instead of whole factors. Moreover, the lasso solution depends on how the dummy variables are encoded. Choosing different contrasts for a categorical predictor will produce different solutions in general. As Ben points out, there are also more subtle links between predictors that might indicate that they should either be in or out together. But categorical variables are the poster child for group lasso.
