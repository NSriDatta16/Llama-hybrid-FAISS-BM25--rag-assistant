Sounds like you need to figure out whether the browser supports certain features. From http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.support/ Rather than using $.browser to detect the current user agent and alter the page presentation based on which browser is running, it is a good practice to perform feature detection. This means that prior to executing code which relies on a browser feature, we test to ensure that the feature works properly. To make this process simpler, jQuery performs many such tests and makes the results available to us as properties of the jQuery.support object. Following are a few resources that explain how feature detection works: http://peter.michaux.ca/articles/feature-detection-state-of-the-art-browser-scripting http://www.jibbering.com/faq/faq_notes/not_browser_detect.html http://yura.thinkweb2.com/cft/
