Burns survival dataset - meaning of midpoint of set interval

I'm using the well-known USC Burns Survival dataset to explore logistic regression in R. The independent variable is burn area, and the outcome is binary survival (yes/no). In the documentation, burn areas are grouped as the 'midpoint of set intervals', and taken as a log ie. log(area + 1) for sample datapoints like (highest/lowest): 1.35 yes 2.35 no Medically, burns are usually specifed in terms of surface area % of total body eg. 40%, or alternatively, as an estimate of surface area in square meters. My question is: how does this relate to the dataset independent variable ie. what does '1.35' actually mean in terms of % body surface area burnt? What would eg. 30% burns become in the dataset, using the 'midpoint of set interval'? Thanks guys Ref: http://statmaster.sdu.dk/courses/st111/data/index.html#burns
