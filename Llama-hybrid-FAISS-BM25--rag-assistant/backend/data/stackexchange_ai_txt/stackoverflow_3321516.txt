Magento Description/Attributes Replace?

I'm having trouble swapping Short Description (Quick Overview) with Additional Information (Attributes) Here's an image better explaining what I'm trying to accomplish: I posted links to CodePaste.net Here is my View.PHTML Here is my Attributes.PHTML Here is my Tabs.PHTML Here is my Catalog.XML I know most files posted are not involved, but I figured it might help. Any help or questions are greatly appreciated. Thanks!
