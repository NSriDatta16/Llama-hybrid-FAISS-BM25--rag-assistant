Why Root Finding is important in Logistic Regression? (i.e. Newton Raphson)

I'd like to ask what is the main reason why we find the roots in logistic regression (i.e. why we use Newton Raphson method on logistic regression ). I understand the basics of Newton Raphson method, but I just can't understand what is the importance of finding the roots or using second derivatives. P.S. I know the idea of Newton Raphson, I am wondering why do we need to use this method and find the zero's or roots of function? What does it want to tell us for logistic regression for instance?
