From your description, it seems that the paper you cite has little relevance to your problem. First, as far as I can tell, there is no time-varying aspect to your data, i.e. the features are different characteristics of the mammogram, not a single quantity changing over time like a lead in an electrocardiogram. Consequently, auto-regressive models do not seem particularly relevant. There are however many other techniques for classification. If you already have a “correct” label (it's also called a “gold standard” or the “ground truth”) for a set of mammograms, creating a model to recognize which class they belong to is called supervised learning. Logistic regression would be a common technique for these kind of things but there are many other techniques in statistics and machine learning. If you don't know which mammogram belong to which class (e.g. which one indicates a pathological condition) and you just want to split them in two tentative classes based on how similar they are to each other then you are looking for unsupervised learning techniques. Here you could for example consider some form of cluster analysis. Note than in both cases (and in the paper you mentioned), what is being classified are not features but cases or exemplars (i.e. ECG recordings or mammograms). If your goal is not to classify mammograms but to understand the relations between different features you would typically use other techniques (e.g. factor analysis but cluster analysis is sometimes applied to variables or features as well).
