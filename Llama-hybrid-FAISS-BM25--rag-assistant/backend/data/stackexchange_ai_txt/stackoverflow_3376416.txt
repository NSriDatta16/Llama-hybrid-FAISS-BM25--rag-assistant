Several of the -f code generation options are interesting: -fverbose-asm is useful if you're compiling with -S to examine the assembly output - it adds some informative comments. -finstrument-functions adds code to call user-supplied profiling functions at every function entry and exit point. --coverage instruments the branches and calls in the program and creates a coverage notes file, so that when the program is run coverage data is produced that can be formatted by the gcov program to help analysing test coverage. -fsanitize={address , thread , undefined } enables the AddressSanitizer, ThreadSanitizer and UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer code sanitizers, respectively. These instrument the program to check for various sorts of errors at runtime. Previously this answer also mentioned -ftrapv , however this functionality has been superseded by -fsanitize=signed-integer-overflow which is one of the sanitizers enabled by -fsanitize=undefined .
