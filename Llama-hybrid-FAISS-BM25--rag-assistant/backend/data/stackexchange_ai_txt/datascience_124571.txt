Model for small sample time series

Im a total novice and i need to estimate some kind of relation-proof model(Granger test results, correl matrix are already provide some evidence) with following dataset: 20 observations (2001-2021), 4 variables, one dependent. Some of them are non-stationary, which method should i use and why (ARIMA, VAR, VECM, BVAR etc)?
