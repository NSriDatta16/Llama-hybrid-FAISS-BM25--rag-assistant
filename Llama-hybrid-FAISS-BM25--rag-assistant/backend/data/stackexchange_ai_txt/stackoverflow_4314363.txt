How to capture packets with netfilter?

I am using libpcap to capture GRE packets and forward now, I think the efficiency is not very good. so I decide to do forwarding with netfilter, but I am new for this. Could someone gives me one simple example to capture IP or GRE packets with netfilter? thanks!
