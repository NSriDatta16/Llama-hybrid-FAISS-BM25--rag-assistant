The only complete test you can use to test among three choices is to use Bayesian model selection. AIC and BIC are approximations of the posterior density under some restrictive assumptions. If the AIC and BIC have a very clear winner and two clear losers, then you could use them. If they are close you should consider two Bayesian alternatives. The first is to test the three distributions as three separate simple hypotheses. The second would be to have an infinite number of hypotheses, but test to see if the data is inside the Pearson families of distributions. The log-normal, the normal and Student's t distribution are all members of the Pearson family of distributions or the Burr family. For the Pearson family, you can find specific examples of the method at: H.M. Markowitz and N. Usemen. The likelihood of various stock market return distributions, part 1: principles of inference. Journal of Risk and Uncertainty. 1996. 13 pp. 207-219 and H.M. Markowitz and N. Usemen. The likelihood of various stock market return distributions, part 2: empirical results. Journal of Risk and Uncertainty. 1996. 13pp. 221-247 Generally speaking, to test H!: data follows normal versus H2: data follows log-normal versus H3: data follows Student's t you would construct a model selection process as in Markowitz or either of the two links below. There is a decent discussion of it at http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~tpminka/statlearn/demo/ A more detailed approach is at: http://www-stat.wharton.upenn.edu/~edgeorge/Research_papers/ims.pdf
