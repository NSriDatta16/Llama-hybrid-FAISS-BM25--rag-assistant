Demand forecasting: training a model using falsified historical sales as a target instead of actual sales

The framework : We have different products being sold for a short period of time (maximum 3 weeks) once a year. Some products may have no sales history - new products. Since this is not a classical time series forecasting we decided to use ML (Machine Learning) approach by estimating the future demand based on the history of sales using different features like price, name of a product (text based features), store information, store location, etc. The assumption is that the model will learn complex interactions between all features and will forecast sales for the next year. Optimisation goal The forecasted demand should lead to the situation that a predefined percentage (%) of units of each product will be sold in the first 7 days even so a product can be sold in total for maximum 3 weeks. A human expert is responsible for forecasts that should theoretically reach the goal. Preliminary analysis The analysis of historical sales showed that the forecasted demand doesn't optimize for percentage sales. Products were sold in any day within 3 weeks interval without peaking at day 7. Proposed Approach The logic of the proposed approach is the following Use some heuristic that will retrospectively find the demand for a product that should have led to X% of sales. Apply heuristic on all historical sales and create a new "would-be" sales Train a model on a "falsified" sales data My question to experts: what would be the consequence of this approach?
