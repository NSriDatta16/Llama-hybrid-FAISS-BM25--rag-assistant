I assume the problem is that the MCMC sampler finds it difficult to sample from the joint posterior distribution of $v$, $\mu$ and $\sigma$. This kind of problem has been described before for the kind of parameterization you use in case of very little data about each unit (in your case no data). You might be a lot better off, if you sampled $v'$ from $N(0,1)$ and then obtained $v$ as $v=\text{invlogit}(\mu+v'\times \sigma)$ (yes, this weird re-parameterization really helps massively in some cases, however hard it may be to believe). By the way, it can be easier to diagnose such issues with some other MCMC samplers such as the NUTS sampler in Stan (available in python via PyStan ). One possible hint with a standard Metropolis-Hastings would be in how the trace plots get stuck in certain regions of the posterior for a while, which one can see from the trace plots, and of course the low effective sample size is also a strong hint.
