N-tiered refers to the "distributed" layers of a system (i.e. server and client), whereas n-layered refers to the layers in a self-contained program; although the two are often used interchangeably, some suggest that there is a significant difference (like the one I mentioned above), as seen on the first paragraphs on Multitier architecture and Multilayered architecture on Wikipedia explains the difference.
