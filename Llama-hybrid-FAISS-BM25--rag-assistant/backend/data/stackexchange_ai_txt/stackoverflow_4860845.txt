For the second issue - the compiler by default will pad structure members. The default pad is to the sizeof(int) , 4 bytes (on most architectures). This is why an int followed by a char will take 8 bytes in the structure, so the string member is at offset 8. To disable padding, use #pragma pack(x) , where x is the pad size in bytes.
