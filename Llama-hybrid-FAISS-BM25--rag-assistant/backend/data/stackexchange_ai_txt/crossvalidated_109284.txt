Significant main effect in one-way, but not in two-way, MANOVA

I used a one-way MANOVA to study the effect of age groups on the average of height and weight and found that they were significant. Then I used a two-way MANOVA to study the effect of age groups and gender on the averages of height and weight and found that gender had an overall effect but not age groups. Is there any logic in the result obtained using the above two methods? Update. The data are of 75 males and 75 females and I randomly made age groups 18-25, 25-30, 30-35, 35-40 and 40+. The number of members in each group varies.
