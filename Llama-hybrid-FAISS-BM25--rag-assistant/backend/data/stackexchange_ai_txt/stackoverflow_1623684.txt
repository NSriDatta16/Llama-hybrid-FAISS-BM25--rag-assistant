Here is what I came up with in the end: HANDLER a OPEN; HANDLER a READ BC BC is the name of key (B,C). If we order the table by B DESC, then the result is guranteed to be equal to SELECT * FROM a WHERE (X BETWEEN a.B AND a.C) ORDER BY a.B DESC LIMIT 1; Now if X is not in the range of the table a, we just have to check that a.C is greater than X, if it's not, than X is definitely outside of the range and we don't need to look any further. This is not very elegant though, and you will have to resort the table on each insert or update.
