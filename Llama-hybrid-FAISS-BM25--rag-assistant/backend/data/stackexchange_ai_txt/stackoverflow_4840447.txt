Trouble Dragging Android Views

I'm trying to learn Android development and using the Android SDK in Eclipse . I'm following a tutorial to build the Main.XML file on the Graphical Layout tab. It instructs me to drag several Views onto the screen surface, including: EditText , Button , RadioGroup and RadioButton . My issue is that these Views do not seem to drag. I place the mouse cursor over them, press the right button but the Views are not captured for dragging. There are other Views (such as Gallery) that seems to drag OK but those I'm interested in (to complete the tutorial lesson) do not drag. Any help making this work properly would be appreciated.
