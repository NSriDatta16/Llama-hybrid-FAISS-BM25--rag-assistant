Embeddable language with good string manipulation support

I've been working on a C program which does quite a lot of string manipulation, and very often needs to be tweaked and recompiled for some sort of special case processing. I've been thinking that embedding some scripting language with good string manipulation support might make sense for the project. What language would provide the best string manipulation support while being easy to embed in a C program? For some extra background... Performance is pretty important (especially startup time) Needs easily be compiled on multiple platforms (Linux, Solaris, Win32 (ideally with MinGW), Darwin) Needs to be a language which will still be around in 5 years time I've looked a little at Python (perhaps too heavy weight?) and Lua (perhaps not focused on string manipulation?) but don't really know enough about them or what other choices might be out there.
