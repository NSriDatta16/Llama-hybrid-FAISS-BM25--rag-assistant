Bayesian Inference: Prior in Chinese Restaurant Process

For the Chinese restaurant process, as used in Dirichlet Process mixture models, we have a prior that data point i belongs to cluster j, where c is an indicator. n represents the total number of data points that are assigned to cluster j, where subscript -i refers to all observations excpet i. As we take k to infinity, (which represents taking the number of components in the mixture model to infinity), the expression transforms to when that cluster already exists (which I understand). For the case that the cluster doesn't already exist, the prior transforms to This is where my problem lies - how does alpha feature in this expression if (alpha/k) tends to 0 as k tends to infinity?
