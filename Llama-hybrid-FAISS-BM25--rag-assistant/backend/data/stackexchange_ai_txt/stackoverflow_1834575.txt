That depends on how tightly you want the cart integrated with the rest of your Cakephp app. I have tried Bakesale for online store, and I ended up dumping it for ZenCart after too many complaints from the client. I tried bakesale because it seemed simple, but it was too simple. It is does not have all of the features of a Magento or ZenCart. Some parts of it are unfinished or just plain broken. Bakesale is a nice Cakephp app but really misses the mark as an ecommerce solution. The development on both bakesale and phpshop seem pretty dead. I would suggest building your cake app separate and then setting up something like store.mydomain.com using magento. There are still ways of getting them to talk to one another.
