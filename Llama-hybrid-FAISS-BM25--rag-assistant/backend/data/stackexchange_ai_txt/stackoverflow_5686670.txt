If you are open to using a third party module, I ported the Python 2.x module rfc822 to Python 3.x https://github.com/MarkNenadov/rfc822py3 It hasn't been tested thoroughly yet. I encourage you to try it out and let me know how it works and whether you have any problems. To make your code work in both Python 2 and 3 you can take my rfc822py3 module and do: try: import rfc822 except ImportError: import rfc822py3 as rfc822
