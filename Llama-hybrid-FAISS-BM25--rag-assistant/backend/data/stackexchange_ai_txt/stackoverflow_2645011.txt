How can I access attributes of Html elements in ASP.NET MVC

With ASP.NET Webforms, I could drag and drop a control on a form and be able to access its properties: if (number == 0) AddButton.Enabled = false; Although I cannot drag and drop a control on a ASP.NET MVC View template, can I change its attributes? For instance: disable a button in some conditions and be able to enable it if conditions change. Be able to change the text of a button from " Next-> " to " Finish " etc.
