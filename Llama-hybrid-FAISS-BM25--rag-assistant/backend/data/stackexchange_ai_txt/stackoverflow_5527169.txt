File-based Document Storage in android

I'm in the early stages of a note-taking application for android and I'm hoping that somebody can point me to a nice solution for storing the note data. Ideally, I'm looking to have a solution where: Each note document is a separate file (for dropbox syncing) A note can be composed of multiple pages Note pages can have binary data (such as images) A single page can be loaded without having to parse the entire document into memory Thread-safety: Multiple reads/writes can occur at the same time. XML is out (at least for the entire file), since I don't have a good way to extract a single page at a time. I considered using zip files, but (especially when compressed) I think they'd be stuck loading the entire file as well. It seems like there should be a Java library out there that does this, but my google-fu is failing me. The only other alternative I can think of is to make a separate sqlite database for every note. Does anybody know of a good solution to this problem? Thanks!
