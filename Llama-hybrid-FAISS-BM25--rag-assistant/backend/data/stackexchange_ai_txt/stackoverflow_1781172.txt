Generate a two dimensional array via LINQ

I am trying to create a matrix of doubles, representing a correlation between entities. Here's how I'm doing it via LINQ double[][] correlationsRaw = (from e in entitiesInOrder select (from f in entitiesInOrder select correlations.GetCorrelation(e, f) ).ToArray()).ToArray(); That works fine. But what I want is a two dimensional array ( double[,] ), not a jagged array. Obviously, I can write some nested for loop to convert one into the other. But is there some elegant LINQ trick I can use here?
