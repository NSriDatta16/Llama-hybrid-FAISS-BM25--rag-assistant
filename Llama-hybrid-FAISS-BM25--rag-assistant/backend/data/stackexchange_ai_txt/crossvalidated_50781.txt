Choosing a multiclass strategy

What would be the best approach to choosing the multi-class strategy (MSVM, OVA, ECOC) for classifying a large number of classes with limited examples of each class? Another two factors that define the solution, in my case: The probability of prediction is an important factor that decides the next steps in my solution. The size (i.e. size of the classifier object on disk which can later be loaded in memory and used for prediction), of the fitted classifier (since I need the solution to be portable without providing it as a service). I do not need to analyze the classifier(s) any more than getting the category with reasonable probability. UPDATE: The problem is basically that of text classification.
