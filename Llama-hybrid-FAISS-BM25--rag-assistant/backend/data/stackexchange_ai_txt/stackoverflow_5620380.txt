Adrian, you're absolutely on a right track with usage of element. However you need to add last piece to the puzzle - define how content inside this element has to be validated. By default validating parser will expect schema defined for this element and will fail validation if it's not available (or content is not valid according to this schema). In order to change behavior you need to specify attribute . Another option (maybe more preferable) is to specify processContents="lax" which means that parser will look for schema definition and if it's found it will use to validate the fragment but if it's not then it will ignore it. More about this attribute you could find in specification . Also there is quite helpful article on creating extensible schemas.
