Time series analysis: Why am I getting a reciprocal condition number when trying to estimate VAR-Model? /w reproducible example

I'm currently trying to identify an appropriate VARMA( p , q )-representation for a multivariate time series using the MTS:: -package in R. The series comprises n = 126 observations representing 12-hour intervals each and k = 14 dimensions. The goal is to identify relations among the series. Specifically, I'm interested in finding out whether the first time series is influenced by the other 13 in a unidirectional relationship. Prior to the analysis, all series were tested for stationarity using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller- (ADF) and the Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin-Test (KPSS). In one case—namely, the suspected output time series of the MTS—ADF- und KPSS-test both suggested that the series was nonstationary, DF = -2.9581, p = 0.1784; KPSS -level = 0.7663, p For four other series the KPSS-Test suggested nonstationarity, albeit only barely (only just below p = .05). Since the time series plots didn't show any trends and the ADF-test indicated stationarity, I didn't difference these four series, either. Following Tsay's ( 2013 ) procedure, the first step then is selecting a sensible p -order, using VARorder(da) which should yield something like selected order: aic = 5 selected order: bic = 2 selected order: hq = 2 indicating the appropriate p order by consulting various information criteria. However, for my data, the command gives Error in solve.default(xpx, xpy) : system is computationally singular: reciprocal condition number = 2.92466e-18 suggesting that the matrix containing my data is non-invertibile. Unfortunately, I can't quite figure out why. Possible problems I've ticked off the list: m k : Observations by far outnumber dimensions Multicollinearity: I've checked the data by looking for high, significant correlations of individual series—there weren't any. Nevertheless, I tried excluding some series with the highest significant correlations (max r .85, min r = .56 or so). I still received the same error message (obviously with a different condition number). Nonstationarity: I've tried excluding the five series mentioned above. I still received the same error message (obviously with a different condition number). I'd be very grateful if you would share possible explanations and solutions for this error message . Note: I'm able to check different VAR models and their information criteria "by hand" using, for example VAR But I'm not sure why VARorder(da) wouldn't suggest the appropriate VAR order itself.
