VECM in cointegration analysis: How to chose the form of the deterministic terms from dataplots

Please have a look at the plot of 5 different time series $Y_t=(y_{1,t},y_{2,t},y_{3,t},y_{4,t},y_{5,t})$ . I want to use R's urca package to perform cointegration analysis on $Y_t$ using the VECM ( vector error corrected model ): $$ \Delta Y_t = \Pi Y_{t-1} + \sum_{i=1}^k\Gamma_i\Delta Y_{t-i}+\Phi D_t +\epsilon_t $$ How should I determine the form of the VECM regarding the deterministic term? Can I by "eyeball" method make a reasonable decision? The 3 most common ways are implemented in urca as: trend = none,const drift . I am using these books: Analysis of Integrated and Cointegrated Time Series with R by Pfaff New Introduction to Multiple Time Series Analysis by LÃ¼tkepohl Neither of these books say anything about this topic but in there examples (I think) they use the "eyeball" method
