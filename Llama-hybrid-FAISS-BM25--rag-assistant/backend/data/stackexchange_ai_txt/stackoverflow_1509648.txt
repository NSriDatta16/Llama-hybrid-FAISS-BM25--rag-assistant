What's wrong with application settings? It's the simplest way to store settings (hence the name), since you set it up in the designer and can access it through an auto-generated class, much like the auto-generated resource classes. This data will be stored in the application data directory. There is a default settings file in a WinForms applications, but you can create additional ones easily. It does not support dynamic key/value pairs either, but you can get around that by using a dictionary (though Dictionary does not serialize to XML, you have to work around that, like using a KeyValuePair list or KeyedCollection for storage).
