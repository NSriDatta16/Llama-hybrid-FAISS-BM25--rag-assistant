When to normalize learning?

I'm trying to determine the effect of three types of learning on a group of subjects. I have their pretest scores and posttest scores. The current goal is to determine which intervention reduced the percentage of wrong questions before the learning correctly answered after: That is to say, (Post - Pre) / (100 - Pre). However, doing this per subject means that people who did very well on the pretest have a huge impact on efficacy. Averaging the Post/Pre per intervention corrects for this. But I have no clue of the tradeoffs involved.
