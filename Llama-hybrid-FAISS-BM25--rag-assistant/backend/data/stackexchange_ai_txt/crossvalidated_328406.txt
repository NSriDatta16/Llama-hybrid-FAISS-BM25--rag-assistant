What does predict() in combination with prcomp() do? (R)

I have a small data set with 40 patients (20 positive and 20 negative on some disease), where for each patient gene expressions of 40 cytokines are measured. The goal is to be able to predict status of disease and reduce dimensions simultaneously. I am trying to perform PCA on part of my data and subsequently use the results to correctly diagnose the rest of the data with 0 or 1 respectively (using CART-algorithm, which is not included in the example below). The whole algorithm works fine - however, I do not really understand what is happening in predict() in the last line of the example below. The result is obviously the predicted PC-score for each individual in pred.data . But what are these predictions based on? prin.comp , as the object returned by prcomp has many elements, and to be honest, I don't understand all of them. And even more important to me: are these predictions meaningful and useful for my purposes (i.e. using them as newdata in a subsequent prediction with CART) at all? library(caret) dat
