I couldn't get this @BillyLogans suggestion to work.... I found the problem was the default FTP directory was /home/usr/fred When I used: String directory = "ftp://some.domain.com/mydirectory" FtpWebRequest requestDir = (FtpWebRequest)FtpWebRequest.Create(new Uri(directory)); I found this gets turned into "ftp:/some.domain.com/home/usr/fred/mydirectory" to stop this change the directory Uri to: String directory = "ftp://some.domain.com//mydirectory" Then this starts working.
