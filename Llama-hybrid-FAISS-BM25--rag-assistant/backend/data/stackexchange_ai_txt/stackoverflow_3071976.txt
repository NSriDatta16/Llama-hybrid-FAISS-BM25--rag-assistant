You might put something like the following into a.c and then extern it from b.c . In a.c: int a[] = {1, 2, 3}; const int lengthofa = sizeof( a ) / sizeof( a[0] ); And then in b.c: extern int a[]; // the extern (thanks Tim Post) declaration means the actual storage is in another // module and fixed up at link time. The const (thanks Jens Gustedt) prevents it // from being modified at runtime (and thus rendering it incorrect). extern const int lengthofa; void somefunc() { int i; for ( i = 0; i
