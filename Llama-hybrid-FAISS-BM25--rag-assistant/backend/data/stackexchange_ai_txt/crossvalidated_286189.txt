You should not use linear regression here, nor should you transform your data with the logit transformation. You have a percentage variable in a sense, but that's just a way to display your data in a simplified manner. In another sense, you have a count of obese children out of a known total of kids. That is, you have binomial data. Thus, you should use logistic regression, using the counts of actual children. How that will be done, exactly, depends on how your software implements this, for a discussion of SAS and R, see: Difference in output between SAS's proc genmod and R's glm . People often think of logistic regression as the option to use when your response is 0/1, but it is actually applicable to any binomial distribution, even when there is more than one Bernoulli trial.
