This is caused by a bug in IE: This is a very peculiar bug in IE where for each Flash movie in the page the fragment identifier part of the URI (#foo) is repeated in the document title. It has been reported by Macromedia that this bug can be fixed by updating the VBScript engine the browser uses. However, for those users who still have the wrong engine sIFR contains a workaround. http://wiki.novemberborn.net/sifr/Fragment+Identifier+Bug sIFR 3 has a workaround but it doesn't kick in unless the page is loaded with a fragment identifier ( window.location.hash != "" ). In your case, I assume the page is loaded without the identifier, then you add one, and then you re-run replacements, reinvoking the bug. You can patch r436 by opening (the compressed version of) sifr.js and replacing this.fix=c.ua.ieWin&&window.location.hash!="" by this.fix=c.ua.ieWin .
