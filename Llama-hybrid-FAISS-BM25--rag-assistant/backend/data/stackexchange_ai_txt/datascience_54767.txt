Never remove features from your dataset. Always try to make use of them. Try using some DR techniques like PCA to eliminate the multicollinearity between the features. Removing features means you are losing some info. unless Multicollinearity means that the correlation between them is 1 one then you can delete them safely. Using Tree-based models will capture these little differences between features.
