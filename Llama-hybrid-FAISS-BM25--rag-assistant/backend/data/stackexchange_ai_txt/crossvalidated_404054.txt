R - multivariate random forest for variable importance

A little background - I'm trying to use multivariate random forest modeling to understand the importance of environmental variables on microbial communities (illumina sequencing) along a latitudinal gradient. I have used db-RDA and variance partitioning to try to get at this question, but I'm interested in how a non-linear model will perform. I've tried to use the package 'randomForestSRC' in r, but the function doesn't calculate prediction error, which as I understand it is necessry to calculate variable importance. Implimentation of the randomForestSRC is as follows: rf_model Has anyone ever used MRF with a community matrix for variable importance? Thank you -
