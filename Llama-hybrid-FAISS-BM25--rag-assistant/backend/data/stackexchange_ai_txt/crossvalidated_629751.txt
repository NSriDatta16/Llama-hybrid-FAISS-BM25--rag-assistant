I would guess there is a finite number of possible outcomes. So the starting model, with no temporal correlation could be something like: $$ X \sim Categorical(\{\pi_{i=1\dots N}\}) $$ I.e. state of your system at any point is random. You can start by determining the probabilities of different states under such assumptions. Where you have $N$ categories and $\pi)$ are the probabilities of these events. Next, you could look into something like Markov Chain . Where there are finite number of outcomes, but probabilities of transitioning between different outcomes are now non-trivial, and depend on the initial state. Before diving any deeper it might be good to check just how far your results are from Markov Chain, i.e. just how much of the next state depends only on the previous step, and no steps before that. You may find that it suffices, especially if you allow complex outcomes. If nothing else, this will give you a good baseline, if it suffices then you will have a quite robust modelling framework with all the asymptotic results already known for Markov Chains. After this you can try more complex models, but I would probably seek for choice of these models to be motivated by why Markov Chain does not fit the data.
