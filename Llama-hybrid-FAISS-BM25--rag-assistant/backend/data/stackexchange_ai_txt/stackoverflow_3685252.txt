How to organize repositories with reusable components

I have the following git repositories: ReusableA ReusableB ReusableC Application1 ReusableB and C both depend on ReusableA. Therefore both repositories include ReusableA as a git submodule. Application1 depends on ReusableB and ReusableC, so it includes both as git submodules. However, this should cause the Application1 repository to contain two instances (of possibly different versions) of ReusableA. So my question is basically, is this something I should avoid, or can I just make a build script in Application1 that simply ignores one of the ReusableA instances (and preferably I wouldn't want to initialize it either)? Can you give me some advice? If this really is a scenario to avoid, how could I accomplish that? Best practices?
