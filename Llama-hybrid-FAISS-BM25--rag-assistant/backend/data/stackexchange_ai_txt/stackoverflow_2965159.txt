Jaxb doesn't generate Interface for element of complex type

I have an xsd (for basecamp xml) that contains and I'm looking at http://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/tutorial/doc/bnbah.html and can't understand what I'm doing differently from the sample schema in Table 17-13 where there is an element named purchaseOrder of type PurchaseOrderType . According to the tutorial, running xjc on the schema, one will get a PurchaseOrder.java interface and PurchaseOrderType.java interface. When I run xjc on my schema I only get a ProjectType.java class, and when the xml actually consists of a single element, this won't parse because there is no Project.java class/interface to match.
