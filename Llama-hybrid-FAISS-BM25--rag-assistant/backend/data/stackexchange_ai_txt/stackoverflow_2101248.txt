The most important reference for patterns is "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" by Gamma, Helm, Johnson and Vilssides (the "Gang of Four"). http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns_%28book%29 Lists, Sets, and Collections all have specific meanings in the Java world - and the Java API defines them. http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/ Such terms can have slightly different semantics in other places. Expression is typically related to language syntax. If you want an accurate understanding of, say, a java expression, you'll need to see the Java language specification (Chapter 15). http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/
