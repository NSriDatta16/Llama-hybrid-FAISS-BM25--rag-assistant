As I have mentioned in this question , clearexport_ssafe should be used for import from Source Safe to ClearCase. However, the documentation for that tool explicitly mentions : Shares. There is no feature in Rational ClearCase equivalent to a Visual SourceSafe share. clearexport_ssafe does not preserve shares as hard links during conversion. Instead, shares become separate elements So your script would need to list all links, and create soft links between their initial directory and the newly created separate element. But I believe you may want to consider another organization for the target ClearCase repository, one in which all share files are no longer directly used, as illustrated by this answer (for SVN repository in this instance): We have eliminated all of our linked files. All class files that were previously linked have been placed into class libraries which are shared to our other projects as shared project references in the solution. So in essence you share libraries, not class files. There was a bit of an adjustment process getting used to this, but I haven't missed links since then. It really does promote a better design practice by having your code setup like this. I work mainly with UCM , and all those "share" are natural candidate for UCM component , with UCM baselines to refer to their different version, and you can then make your own "configuration" (list of labels) in order to select the different components you need, making them easily reusable across projects.
