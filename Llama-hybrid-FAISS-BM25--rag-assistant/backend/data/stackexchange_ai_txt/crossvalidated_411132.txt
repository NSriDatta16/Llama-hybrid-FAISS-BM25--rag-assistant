In hierarchical model, how to choose groups that meet exchangeability, automatically?

In hierarchical model, we assume exchangeability. For example, y[i] ~ Norm(b0 + b1[groups[i]], sigma) and b1 ~ Norm(mu_b1, sd_b1) above, all groups are assumed exchangeable. But, it might be better model: for(i in 1:3) b1[i] ~ Norm(mu_b1a, sd_b1a) for(j in 4:9) b2[j] ~ Norm(mu_b2a, sd_b2a) but it is tiresome to change and try groupings many times. So, how can I automatically choose which group belong to same category? Though I can do that if some work like k-means or pca beforehand for finding category, I want to do both at once.
