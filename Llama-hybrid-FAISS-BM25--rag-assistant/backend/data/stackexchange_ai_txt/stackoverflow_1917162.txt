I'd be less worried about storage space and more worried about record retrieveal i.e., indexability/searching. For example, I imagine performing a LIKE or REGEXP in a WHERE clause to find a single item in the list will be quite bit more expensive than if you normalized each list item into a row in a separate table. However, if you never need to perform such queries agains these columns, then it just won't matter.
