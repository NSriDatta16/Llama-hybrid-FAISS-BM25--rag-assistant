Best way to show screens to user on application

I'm developing a Winforms application which has been running for years with an explorer view (TreeView left, screen right). I means that: All the screens have an hierarchy organization All the nodes on TreeView have one and only one screen related. A screen gets activated when a node on treeview gets selected. One of the advantages is that the user has an ordered stucture and one of the inconveniencies is that with hundreds of screens the user gets confused. I see other options: use classical menus, use tabs or a mix of everything. Any advice for a good way to show a lot of screens to user in a user-friendly way? Update: I'm changed "hundreds screens" by "a lot of screens". The most important thing is not show all at time but that the user can find what they need easily. Update2: In this proposal, the user only see one screen at time. Update3: I'm talking about handling multiple screens not showing multiple screens. No MDI, only one ontime .
