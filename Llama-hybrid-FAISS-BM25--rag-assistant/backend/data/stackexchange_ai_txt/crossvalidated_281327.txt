Calculate size and density of pre-defined clusters

I am performing semantic similarity on a number of texts. Using PCA, the similarity can be visualized as below Is there a way to quantify the density of each cluster, as well as the overall size? I would like a way to show that TD is more dense than FXSA, as well as smaller in total size.
