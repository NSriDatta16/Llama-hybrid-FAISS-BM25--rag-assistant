Get insights from Random forest::Variable Importance analysis

I run variable importance on my Panel data (TV viewing over specific period) which consists of the old-Panel (Panel 0) and the new panel (Panel 1) I am interested in understanding the differences in viewing based on the panel, as well as demographics like region. I used Avg daily total viewing in minutes as target variable and select age_group, region and big cities as predictor variables in R ( group by/repeat by panel ( 0 and 1) ) I visualized the result in R , in each chart’s Y-Axis is the prediction probability, X-Axis shows each variable’s values. How can we interpret the outcome to turn it to actionable insight? In other words, what is the difference between plotting mean(prediction) vs. plotting mean(actual)? And how to make conclusion from it?
