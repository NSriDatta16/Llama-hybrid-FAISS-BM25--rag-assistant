Cost function for Ordinal Regression using neural networks

What is the best cost function to train a neural network to perform ordinal regression , i.e. to predict a result whose value exists on an arbitrary scale where only the relative ordering between different values is significant (e.g: to predict which product size a customer will order: 'small' (coded as 0), 'medium'(coded as 1), 'large' (coded as 2) or 'extra-large'(coded as 3))? I'm trying to figure out if there are better alternatives than quadratic loss (modeling the problem as an 'vanilla' regression) or cross-entropy loss (modeling the problem as classification).
