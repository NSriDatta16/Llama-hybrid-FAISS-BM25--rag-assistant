Resampling as prior distribution?

Suppose we've got a small dataset that we have no prior knowledge about and we're going to use linear regression on it. I have been wondering whether instead of fitting a normal OLS it would make sense to first estimate regression coefficients using jackknife/bootstrap and - if there is a difference between the resampled regression and OLS applied to the whole dataset - use the $\mu$ and $\sigma$ of the resampled models as the prior distribution to bayesian regression. Can I actually do that? Is my way of thinking correct or I'm not taking something into account?
