Is there a way to "check" if your MCMC is "correct"?

Is there a way to "check" if your MCMC is "correct"? Suppose I have the following irregular probability distribution (a mixture of two normal distributions): P(x,y,z) = **0.3 * N1 + 0.7 * N2 N1 (x,y,z) ~ Normal with mu = (1,1,1) and sigma(1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1) N2 (x,y,z) ~ Normal with mu = (1,0,1) and sigma(1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1)** I am interested in generating Random Samples this mixture distribution when x1 = 2 (conditional distribution). I wrote the following R code for the Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm to take these random samples. First, I defined a function that represents the conditional probability distribution I am interested in: #define constants needed for the multivariate normal sigma1 Then, I took MCMC samples from this function using the Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm: library(mvtnorm) x = rep(0,10000) y = rep(0,10000) x[1] = 3 #initialize; I've set arbitrarily set this to 3 and 1 y[1] =1 for(i in 2:10000){ current_x = x[i-1] current_y = y[i-1] new = rmvnorm(n=1, mean=c(current_x,current_y), sigma=diag(2), method="chol") # generate bivariate random numbers proposed_x = new[1] proposed_y = new[2] A = target(proposed_x,proposed_y)/target(current_x,current_y) if(runif(1) The samples from this conditional distribution can be seen below: head(data.frame(x,y)) x y 1 3.0000000 1.0000000 2 1.7251393 0.2930731 3 0.7847516 0.3534722 4 0.4495596 1.4447259 5 0.4654599 1.2970119 6 0.4654599 1.2970119 Question: The above R code ran and produced what appears to be random samples from the conditional distributions. When inspecting these random samples, there does not appear to be irregular values : if the random samples included extremely large numbers (e.g. 43321), this number would be extremely unlikely to have come from a probability distribution having a mean vectors and a covariance matrix with elements far smaller than such extreme numbers. But apart from checking that the code actually ran and the samples are within a logical range given the model parameters - is there any way to "check" if the MCMC random samples are in fact from this conditional distribution? (I am also not sure if there is a straightforward way to check if the random samples have passed the "burn in stage" and converged : I have heard that if you generate a large number of samples, they will likely converge - but this of course is not an exact way). Can someone please tell me how to do this? Thanks!
