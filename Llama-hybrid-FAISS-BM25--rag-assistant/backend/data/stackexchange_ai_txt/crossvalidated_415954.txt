The trick here is that you want to parameterize your trajectory so that it is a function of time. In your case the trajectory is $\theta(t) : t \to \mathbb{R}^2$ . This is also implicit in the way you phrased the question you want to answer, since you want to estimate the variance of the trajectory at a particular "step" (time). Gaussian processes have recently been receiving a lot of attention in the context of robot motion planning. I know Byron Boots has been working a lot in this area, for more formal treatments/ideas see this paper and his google scholar page.
