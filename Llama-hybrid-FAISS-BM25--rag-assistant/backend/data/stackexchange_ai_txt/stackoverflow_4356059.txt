Linq to XML: I am not able to compare the nested element

Thank you in advance, this is a great resource. I believe the code explains itself, but just in case I am being arrogant I will explain myself. My program lists movies, to a treeview, according to the drop down lists selected genre. Each movie has a few genres, ergo the nested genres. This is the XML: 2012 Roland Emmerich Roland Emmerich, Harald Kloser 12-Nov-2009 John Cusack, Thandie Newton, Chiwetel Ejiofor H:\2012\2012.avi ~\image\2012.jpg 158 min Dr. Adrian Helmsley, part of a worldwide geophysical team investigating the effect on the earth of radiation from unprecedented solar storms, learns that the earth's core is heating up. He warns U.S. President Thomas Wilson that the crust of the earth is becoming unstable and that without proper preparations for saving a fraction of the world's population, the entire race is doomed. Meanwhile, writer Jackson Curtis stumbles on the same information. While the world's leaders race to build "arks" to escape the impending cataclysm, Curtis struggles to find a way to save his family. Meanwhile, volcanic eruptions and earthquakes of unprecedented strength wreak havoc around the world. http://2012-movie-trailer.blogspot.com/ Action Adventure Drama PG-13 This is the code: string selectedGenre = this.ddlGenre.SelectedItem.ToString(); XDocument xmldoc = XDocument.Load(Server.MapPath("~/App_Data/movie.xml")); List movies = (from movie in xmldoc.Descendants("movie") // The treeView doesn't exist where movie.Elements("genres").Elements("genre").ToString() == selectedGenre select new Movie { Title = movie.Element("title").Value }).ToList(); foreach (var movie in movies) { TreeNode myNode = new TreeNode(); myNode.Text = movie.Title; TreeView1.Nodes.Add(myNode); }
