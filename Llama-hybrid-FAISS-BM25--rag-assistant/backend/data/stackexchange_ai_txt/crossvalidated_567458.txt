How to extract key words from text that predict the value of a metric?

I have a large data set of houses; per house a single string describing the interior of the house, and a separate score from 1 to 10 describing how well the house is actually renovated. I would like to identify the key words in each description that best predict the renovation score of a house. Are there any NLP modelling techniques that would be suitable for this? Thanks!
