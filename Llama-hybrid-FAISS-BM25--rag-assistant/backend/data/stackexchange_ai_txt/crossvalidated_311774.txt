Building a model that can estimate the equation of a parabola, trained on sample 'trajectories'

I discovered a parabolic relationship between time and a quantity in my time series data that looks like the one below: How do I go about building a model that can learn the shape of these parabolas from thousands of samples, and estimate the equation for the curve based on the initial trajectory of a new series (e.g., t=0 to 5). I am not very technical and I have no idea if this is a reasonable request. The quantity is viewers per minute of a video stream. Trajectory is metaphorical. At the end of the day I want to be able to input some array of t(3,5,8..n) of viewers for n minutes and get a better and better projection of the curve the more data points I give it, such that I can estimate max height and area under the curve, and do backtesting. Some resources I found that seem relevant: https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/predict.smooth.spline.html and Equation of a fitted smooth spline and its analytical derivative I can fit a spline to trajectory but I don't know where to go from there: d.spl Call: smooth.spline(x = t, y = viewers) Smoothing Parameter spar= 0.2297785 lambda= 0.0000001153716 (12 iterations) Equivalent Degrees of Freedom (Df): 60.23867 Penalized Criterion (RSS): 10483.72 GCV: 175.7969
