I've been using PersistJS with great success to do pretty much what you're describing. It's a lightweight plugin ( flash: Flash 8 persistent storage. gears: Google Gears-based persistent storage. localstorage: HTML5 draft storage. whatwg_db: HTML5 draft database storage. globalstorage: HTML5 draft storage (old spec). ie: Internet Explorer userdata behaviors. cookie: Cookie-based persistent storage. It transparently picks the best storage backend based on browser capability and installed plugins. It works with: globalStorage: Firefox 2.0+, Internet Explorer 8 localStorage: development WebKit openDatabase: Safari 3.1+ userdata behavior: Internet Explorer 5.5+ ...and optionally falls back to cookies if none of the other persistent storage options work. The DOM storage methods get you at least a few megabytes worth of storage space; you'll be limited to roughly 4kB if you fall back to cookies.
