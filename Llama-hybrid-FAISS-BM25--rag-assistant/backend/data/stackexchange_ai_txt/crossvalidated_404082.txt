Rather than trying to describe variability of individual meter measurements as being the meter reading $\pm 20$ or $\pm 20\%,$ it might be better to make a confidence interval based on your $n$ measurements. If $n$ is small, you might say the the standard deviation of measurements is $\sigma = 10.$ That amounts to saying that each individual true glucose value is within $\pm 20$ of the given meter reading 95% of the time. Then using statistical principles, you can get somewhat shorter intervals based on the average of $n$ measurements. One important statistical principle here is that averages are less variable than individual values: For example, suppose $n = 6$ meter readings on the same subject average $\bar X = 103.2.$ In that case, assuming a normal distribution, a 95% confidence interval would be of the form $\bar X \pm 1.96\sigma/\sqrt{n}.$ For the numbers assumed above, the confidence interval would be $(95.2,\, 111.2).$ If $n$ is larger, you might use the sample variance of the actual meter measurements to estimate $\sigma$ (instead of your rule of $\pm 20$ for individual measurements). For example, here are $n = 15$ hypothetical measurements for which the sample mean is $\bar X = 99.54$ and the sample standard deviation $S = 7.07.$ 113.8 105.0 104.6 98.1 97.3 96.2 107.1 94.5 95.2 100.4 99.5 107.8 90.7 96.1 86.8 A 95% confidence interval is of the form $\bar X \pm t^*S/\sqrt{n}.$ This is known as a t confidence interval because it is based on Student's t distribution. In this case with $n = 15$ meter readings, $t^* = 2.14$ cuts probability $0.025$ from the upper tail of Student's t distribution with $n-1 = 14$ degrees of freedom. Computation leads to the interval $(95.6, 103.4).$ Notes: (1) Formulas for sample mean and variance: $$\bar X = (X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_n)/n = \frac 1 n \sum_i X_i.$$ And $$S = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_i (X_i - \bar X)^2}.$$ You can use a statistical calculator or statistical software to compute $\bar X$ and $S.$ (2) You can read about t confidence intervals in an elementary statistics textbook or in Wikipedia under Confidence Intervals.
