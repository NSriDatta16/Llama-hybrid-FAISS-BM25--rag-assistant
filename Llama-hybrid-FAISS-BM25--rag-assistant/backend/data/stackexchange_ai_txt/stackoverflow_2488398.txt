You need a change in habits which is much deeper than simply dropping the mouse. You need to understand that if you really want to learn Vim you have to do it "the hard way": read and memorize text-objects ( :help text-objects ) operations and movements and try using arrows/hjkl as little as possible. At first you will be a lot slower, but don't fall back to normal movement. If you need to select a paragraph, use v a p , if you need to change the text inside a pair of double quotes use c i " and so on. When these things will come out of your fingers naturally, you'll realize how worth it was the time spent to get used to them.
