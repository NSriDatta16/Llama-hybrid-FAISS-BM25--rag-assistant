Doing 'clandestine' includes like this would also make testing more difficult. You want to compile a smallest-possible subset of code when testing a particular component. Figuring out what that subset is would be difficult if the headers/sources aren't being honest about their dependencies, so you'd probably just drag your my_cpp_std_lib_hack into every unit test. This would increase compilation time for your test suites a lot . Established code bases often have more than three times as much test code as regular code, so this is likely to become an issue as your code base grows.
