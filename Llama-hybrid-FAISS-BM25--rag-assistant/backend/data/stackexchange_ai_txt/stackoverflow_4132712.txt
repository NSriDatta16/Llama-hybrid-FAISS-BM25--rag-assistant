Organizing lots of timestamped values in a DB (sql / nosql)

I have a device I'm polling for lots of different fields, every x milliseconds the device returns a list of ids and values which I need to store with a time stamp in a DB of sorts. Users of the system need to be able to query this DB for historic logs to create graphs, or query the last timestamp for each value. A simple approach would be to define a MySQL table with id,value_id,timestamp,value and let users select Select value form t where value_id=x order by timestamp desc limit 1 and just push everything there with index on timestamp and id, But my question is what's the best approach performance / size wise for designing the schema? or using nosql? can anyone comment on possible design trade offs. Will such a design scale with millions of records?
