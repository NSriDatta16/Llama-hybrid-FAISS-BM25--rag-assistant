Windows Phone 7 - Sql Compact Alternatives?

From what I've read so far, Windows Phone 7 does not support a Sql Compact database for local storage. What are you using for local storage for times when the phone has no service? Sure, I can read/write to an xml file or something similar, but if anyone has any suggestions for something that feels a little more "database-like" I'd love to hear them.
