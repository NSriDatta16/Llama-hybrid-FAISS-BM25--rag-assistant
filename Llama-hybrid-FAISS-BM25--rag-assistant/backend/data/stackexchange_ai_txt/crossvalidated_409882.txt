Is it possible that PCA works better without data scaling?

I am a beginner. I have a dataset of 1700 samples with 4 features and I have to perform Hierarchical Clustering (the agglomerative version) and I need to decide whether or not to scale the data and perform PCA. If I scale the data (I tried almost all the "scalers") and then perform PCA, the clustering seems to be incorrect, while if I perform PCA without data scaling, it seems correct. Why is this? Or do you think I am probably doing something wrong?
