LSTM, regression or classification output layer

I am currently implementing an LSTM RNN with an underlying binary classification problem (0,1) and I am thinking what to choose as an output layer. From my point of view, both, regression and classification layer should work, right? Classification output layer: response variable categorical 0 and 1, Regression output layer: response variable number and for response >0.5 =1
