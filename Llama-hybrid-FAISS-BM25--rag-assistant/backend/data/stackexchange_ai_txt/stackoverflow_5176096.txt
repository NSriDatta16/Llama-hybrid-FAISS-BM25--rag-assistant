Cannot access file in Network Attached Storage (NAS) by using C++ access() function?

I have an Isilon NAS in 10.20.30.11 for example, and I mounted it like following: mount 10.20.30.11:/folder /content I could use ls command to find the file in folder or /content . Its mod is 777. bash-3.00# ls -l /content/a/b/1.txt total 344131 rwxrwxrwx 1 1005 65533 140750 Feb 28 00:58 1.txt But I cannot access it by access() function. #include #include #include #include using namespace std; #include int main( int argc, const char* argv[] ) { int returnVal = 0; returnVal = access(argv[1], R_OK); cout It will return -1 and 2 as a result, which means 'No such file or directory'. ./a.out /content/a/b/1.txt -1 2 #define ENOENT 2 /* No such file or directory */ It is not a permission problem I think, because the mod is 777, and the result is 'No such file or directory'.
