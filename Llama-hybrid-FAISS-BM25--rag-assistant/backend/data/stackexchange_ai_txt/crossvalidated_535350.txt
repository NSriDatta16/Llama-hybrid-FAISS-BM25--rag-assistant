You are looking for a test for equivalence (general to statistical inference, and not restricted to mediation analysis). A simple approach is to use two one-sided tests for equivalence. Uniformly most powerful tests for equivalence are a more sophisticated approach. Generally, one chooses a minimum magnitude of difference $\delta$ that you care about (i.e. a minimum effect size): any difference $\delta$ or smaller indicates quantities which are equivalent for your purposes. The null hypothesis for a test for equivalence is $\text{H}_{0}\text{: } |\theta| \ge \delta$ . (In plain language "the magnitude of the difference between quantities is at least as big as $\delta$ .") And the alternative hypothesis for a test for equivalence test $\text{H}_{\text{A}}\text{: } |\theta| . (In plain language "the magnitude of the difference between quantities is smaller than $\delta$ .") If one rejects $\text{H}_0$ , then you have found evidence that $\theta and $\theta > -\delta$ . I.e. you have found evidence that $-\delta . One can express this equivalence interval asymmetrically (often used for asymmetrically-scaled measures, such as odds ratios, etc.). Finally, you can also combine inference from a test for difference with a test for equivalence (and thereby guard against confirmation bias ). See the 2×2 table in my answer for the logic of combined inference in so-called relevance tests . Some useful references Hauck, W. W., & Anderson, S. (1984).
