[ This is an edited response, based on the updated project description and feedback from other people ] Main point: as stated earlier, the project description is a classification problem. We work with a collection of independent N-variate time series. Each time series to is to be classified into one of K classes. The nature of the data is 1) irregular, 2) multidimensional, 3) with potentially different importance between extreme movements and regular diffusive movements , 4) not amenable to good old continuous and "regular" basis functions, 5) etc, etc, etc. For that reason, random forest has been suggested as a classification tool. The suggestion has been scrutinized and explored in detail in a well-thought-through response by DeltaIV. Now....... when a machine learning method is proposed in a complex setting, almost never does it mean that the data must be fed to the algorithm in the raw form. The data must be preprocessed and what is done to the data depends on the choice of the machine learning method. In fact, there was a recent thread raising a question: are the decisions made during the data preporcessing stage more important than the choice of the machine learning algorithm? The answer is: both are important. Of course, how can it be any different?... To complement the well-written overview of DeltaIV, let me talk about one particular data preprocessing approach popular in world of systematic trading. Every N-variate time series is compressed into a set of features before being submitted to a random forest. The features can be 1) mean reversion as quantified by ADF statistics, 2) momentum as quantified by autocorrelation in the log-returns, 3) codependence of extreme values of log-returns (tail dependence), 4) n4-dimensional summary of time trends, 5) n5-dimensional summary of GARCH-implied volatilies, 6) Spearman's rho or Kendall's tau calculated off the N components of the time series, 7) etc, etc, etc. The choice of features is specific to the objective of your project. Good luck!
