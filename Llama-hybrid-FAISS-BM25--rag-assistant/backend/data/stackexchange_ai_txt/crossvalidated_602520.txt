Logistic regression with known probabilities for some datapoints

I have a dataset with several features and a binary outcome (0 or 1), from which I want to estimate the probability of getting 1 based on some of those features. I thought of applying logistic regression, however there’s a constraint I have on some datapoints where the probability is expected to be around 1/2. How do I enforce this in the model training? (Related question: how do I enforce this with sklearn?) Intuitively I’m thinking of modifying the usual likelihood function by adding the terms with probability at 1/2, but not sure if there’s a better way or if I should use another approach altogether.
