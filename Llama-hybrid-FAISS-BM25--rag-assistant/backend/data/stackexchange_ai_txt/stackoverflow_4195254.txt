DB2 JDBC connection to a schema in IASP

I have a JDBC receiver adapter in PI 7.1 running on i5/OS. I deployed the DB2 driver with JSPM and it's working fine on a schema who is NOT in the independent auxiliary storage pool (IASP) When I try to access my schema in the IASP the Adapter cannot establish a connection. Any idea if I need to modify my connection url, the driver, security, ? thanks, Martin
