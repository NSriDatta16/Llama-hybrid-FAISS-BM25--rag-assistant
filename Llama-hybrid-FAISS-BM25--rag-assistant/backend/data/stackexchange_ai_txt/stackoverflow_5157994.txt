PHP is complaining that it can't find the constant on RANGE_CALCULATION_AUTO defined on the class Mage_Catalog_Model_Layer_Filter_Price Based on your comments above, it sounds like you already checked the file at app/code/core/Mage/Catalog/Model/Layer/Filter/Price.php to ensure is had the correct constant defined. const RANGE_CALCULATION_AUTO = 'auto'; Based on that, my guess would be there's a different Price.php being loaded for this class. This can happen if Someone's placed a different version in community or local Someone's monkied with the include path beyond Magento's normal monkey business Check for files at app/community/core/Mage/Catalog/Model/Layer/Filter/Price.php app/local/core/Mage/Catalog/Model/Layer/Filter/Price.php If that doesn't work, add some temporary debugging code to app/code/core/Mage/Adminhtml/Model/System/Config/Source/Price/Step.php that uses reflection to figure out what file PHP is loading the class from class Mage_Adminhtml_Model_System_Config_Source_Price_Step { public function toOptionArray() { //NEW LINES HERE $r = new ReflectionClass('Mage_Catalog_Model_Layer_Filter_Price'); var_dump($r->getFileName()); //echo $r->getFileName(); // if too long for var_dump exit("Bailing at line ".__LINE__." in ".__FILE__); //END NEW LINES return array( array( 'value' => Mage_Catalog_Model_Layer_Filter_Price::RANGE_CALCULATION_AUTO, 'label' => Mage::helper('adminhtml')->__('Automatic') ), array( 'value' => Mage_Catalog_Model_Layer_Filter_Price::RANGE_CALCULATION_MANUAL, 'label' => Mage::helper('adminhtml')->__('Manual') ), ); } }` This will dump out a file path that points to the exact place PHP is loading the class from, which should get you where you need to go.
