Do PHP 4.4.9 based applications run on PHP 5.2.0 flawlessly?

I need to change upgrade the PHP version to at least 5.2.0 for my new magento OS Commerce installation, but would it mess up my current store which runs on 4.4.9 (PHPCart)? The real question is, can I upgrade without harming the old cart?
