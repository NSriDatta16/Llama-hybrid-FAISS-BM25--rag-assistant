how can i make my program more responsive? (program that loads atleast 200 files) - i might have 1 idea

first - i want to say sorry for my butchered English. I am building a program that uses a lot of files. i have a lot of foreach loops that loops through the harddisk and those files (atleast 200 files - 600 bytes each file in average), the loop is using XPath to search for values in the file (the files are XML files of course) I need to find a way to make my program more responsive - i thought of one which is the following: Computers memory has a faster speed of loading than computer harddisk - and i thought - maybe i should load those files to the memory and than loop the memory instead of looping the harddisk.., by the way if someone can tell me how much faster computers memory are (from harddisks) than thanks Thanks in advanced.. Din if someone didn't understand my English i will try to explain again
