You have the correct syntax for doing two-sided t tests om R. It seems to me that two-sided tests are appropriate because you would not want to use a method that consistently gives values either above or below target. You might want to pay specific attention to the two confidence intervals for the 'true' mean of each method: The 95% confidence interval for Method A is $(331.7295, 372.7205),$ which does not include target value $405.$ The 95% confidence interval for Method B is $(371.7133, 417.9367),$ which does include $405.$
