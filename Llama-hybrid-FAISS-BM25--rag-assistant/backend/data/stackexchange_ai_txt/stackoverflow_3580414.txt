If you're using SVN this should be a simple Branch. Else you might want to consider a copy/past operation and merge yourself at the end. Personally I think telling others that stuff their working on will be in a non compilable state for a couple of days is kinda outrageous. You're essentially telling your peers two things. Your changes are much more important than theirs You won't be able to work for a couple of days.
