Hamiltonian Monte Carlo - Is it generally a good method for obtaining random variables in Machine Learning?

I once saw the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method for use in machine learning. But It seems to me that it is not actually a random sampling; It follows the dynamical equation of motion. Is it generally a better method than pseudo-random number generation? If not, what problems Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method perform better?
