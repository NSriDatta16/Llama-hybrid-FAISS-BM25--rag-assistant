Django save a dynamically created file to s3

I am wanting to dynamically create a css file for my site that updates when I upload new navigation items. I know that I need to override the save of my navigation model and after the file has been uploaded to my s3 I can then call a function to do some action, but I don;t know how I can create a file dynamically and then upload it to the same s3 server, but a different location. from django.db import models from django.forms import CheckboxSelectMultiple import tempfile from django.conf import settings from django.core.files.base import ContentFile from django.core.files.storage import default_storage as s3_storage from django.core.cache import cache from datetime import datetime import Image, os import PIL.Image as PIL import re, os, sys, urlparse def createDynamicCSS(): #create then save a css file here #probably best to 'navigation/nav.css' #loop through all entries and create class for all of them navs = PrimaryNav.all() cssfile = "" for n in navs: string = "." + n.slug + " { ... }" cssfile += string #save cssfile to s3 class PrimaryNav(models.Model): title = models.CharField(max_length=200) slug = models.SlugField(max_length=200) active = models.BooleanField() #saves to s3 (s3 address + /icon/ ) icon = models.ImageField(upload_to='icons') def save(self): super(PrimaryNav, self).save() # Call the "real" save() method createDynamicCSS() ... I'm not sure where to start. I was going to try and dissect the csv functions I have seen around the web, but that proved to be too difficult. Help please
