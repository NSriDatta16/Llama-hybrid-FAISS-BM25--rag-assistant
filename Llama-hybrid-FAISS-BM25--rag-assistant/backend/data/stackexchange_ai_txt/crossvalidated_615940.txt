Why would you expect anything to be wrong? You are using default settings and it is a valid result. You could try using more iterations to see if it leads to more useful results. It's better if the algorithm can say “I don't know” rather than forcing an arbitrary choice. But why are you using it in the first place? Random Forest will pick the features it needs on its own, even colinear features are not a problem .
