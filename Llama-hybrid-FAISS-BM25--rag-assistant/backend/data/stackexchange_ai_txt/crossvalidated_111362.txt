German credit data: neural network, svm, logistic regression : input variables

I'm using the following data set on some credit scoring models: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Statlog+(German+Credit+Data) My teacher told me that it's best to use the same data set for all the different techniques, but how do you handle the different restrictions? The data set consists of 7 numeric and 13 categorical variables, how do you use those categorical variables for the sum? Doesn't the support vector machine only accept 1 or 0 as input? Or is it values ranging between 0 and 1 ?
