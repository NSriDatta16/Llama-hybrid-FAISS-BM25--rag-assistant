Model the CV of response variable as a function of CV of predictors

Suppose I have a big county that has 10 farms. In the county, the planting of a crop could happen between March to April. I collected for a given year, the planting date of a crop across the 10 farms and the date of harvesting and the total rainfall between planting date and harvest date. set.seed(123) df I do not know the yield of each farm for each year. Instead I know the average yield across all the farms in each year farm.yield I am interested in writing a simple model that predicts average farm yield as a function of total rainfall. To do this, I calculate the average rainfall across all farms. df.sum % dplyr::group_by(year) %>% dplyr:::summarise(avg.rain = mean(rainfall), cv.rain = sd(rainfall)/avg.rain * 100) final.dat % dplyr::left_join(df.sum) and then I regress the avg.yield against avg. rainfall lm(avg.yield ~ avg.rain, data = final.dat) However, I am also interested in knowing the coefficient of variation around each prediction i.e. I expect years with high variability in rainfall among the 10 farms to also result in higher variability in avg yield. Since I do not know each farm's yield, how I can model such an effect? i.e. what tools I can use to model the variation around the avg.yield as a function of the variation around the rainfall cv.rain Also note that the data here will not result in any model since they are just made up data. Thanks
