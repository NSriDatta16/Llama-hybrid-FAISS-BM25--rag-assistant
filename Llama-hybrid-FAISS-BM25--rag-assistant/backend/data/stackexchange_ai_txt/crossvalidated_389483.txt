Deriving non-Gaussian uncertainties using Gaussian process regression

I came across this work on "Gaussian Process Regression with Heteroscedastic or Non-Gaussian Residuals" which is intriguing, but I believe I am failing to properly interpret its results. Namely, it appears non-Gaussian uncertainties can be derived using Gaussian process regression (GPR), but I am not recognizing how that is possible. For example, in Figure 2, a plot is produced whereby the residuals are clearly asymmetric and non-Gaussian after running multiple samples ( $n = 19$ to be specific). But how can this be the case in general (i.e. $n \rightarrow \infty$ )? Intuitively, how does a latent or unobserved variable permit non-Gaussian uncertainties in GPR? The conditional mean, $\mu_{y^* \lvert x,y,x^*}$ , and variance, $\Sigma_{y^* \lvert x,y,x^*}$ , of the prediction is given by (13) and (14), respectively. Is not the fundamental assumption of GPR that: $$y^* \lvert x,y,x^* \sim N(\mu_{y^* \lvert x,y,x^*},\Sigma_{y^* \lvert x,y,x^*})?$$ Therefore, in Figure 2, how is it possible that the predicted output, $y^* \lvert x,y,x^*$ , can have residuals on average that are non-Gaussian? In general, can any data set with non-Gaussian errors be modeled using this approach or must the hidden variable, $w$ , be known? Any references to GPR codes/numerical packages incorporating non-Gaussian residuals and further literature on the topic would be appreciated as I cannot find anything explicitly beyond this author's own work.
