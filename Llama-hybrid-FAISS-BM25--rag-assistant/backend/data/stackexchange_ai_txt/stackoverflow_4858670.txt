Global constants in Groovy

It is often desired to declare constants at the top of a script that can be referenced anywhere else in the script. In Groovy, it seems that if you declare a constant using final then it isnot accessible in child scopes. What is the solution for this very basic and common requirement? The workaround I have right now is to create an unbound variable but this is not a constant and is not elegant.
