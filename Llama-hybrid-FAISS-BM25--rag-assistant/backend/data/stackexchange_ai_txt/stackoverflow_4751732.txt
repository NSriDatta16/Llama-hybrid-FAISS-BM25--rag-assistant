The easiest solution is to display a different page altogether. Failing that, you can use a Panel to put all your optional components in. Something like this: public MyPage( String param ) { if ( param != null ) { add( new MyPanel( "content", param ) ); } else { add( new Label( "content", "" ); } } And your html will be !-- Feedback panel goes here --> ... You can also use `Fragment s, but I don't recommend it, it doesn't give you very nice code.
