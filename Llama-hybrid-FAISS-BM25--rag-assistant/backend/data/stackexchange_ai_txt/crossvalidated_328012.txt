To provide dimensionality reduction, 1x1 convolutions are used, before passsing them through a 3x3, or 5x5 convolution in an Inception module.

To my understading what a 1x1 convolution does is gives an embedding of the (i,j)th entry of the feature map along its depth. Besides here some dimensionality reduction is also done. How will the scenario change when we have 5x5 or 3x3 convolution done followed by a 1x1 convolution. I know that the number of computations will blow up. But is their some other point that I am missing?
