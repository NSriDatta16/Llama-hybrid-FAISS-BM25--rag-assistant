In certain instances, when you need to perform the same task on a regular basis, it might be a good idea of using past completion times to average against. For example, I have an application that loads the iTunes library via its COM interface. The size of a given iTunes library generally do not increase dramatically from launch-to-launch in terms of the number of items, so in this example it might be possible to track the last three load times and load rates and then average against that and compute your current ETA. This would be hugely more accurate than an instantaneous measurement and probably more consistent as well. However, this method depends upon the size of the task being relatively similar to the previous ones, so this would not work for a decompressing method or something else where any given byte stream is the data to be crunched. Just my $0.02
