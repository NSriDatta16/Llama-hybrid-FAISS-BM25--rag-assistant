how to use erb to output file after binding

I got the following example: require 'erb' names = [] names.push( { 'first' => "Jack", 'last' => "Herrington" } ) names.push( { 'first' => "LoriLi", 'last' => "Herrington" } ) names.push( { 'first' => "Megan", 'last' => "Herrington" } ) myname = "John Smith" File.open( ARGV[0] ) { |fh| erb = ERB.new( fh.read ) print erb.result( binding ) accompanied by text.txt Hello Hello hi, my name is } it prints nicely to screen. what is the simplest way to output to another file: "text2.txt" instead of to the screen? I know this is really a piece of cake for most of you experienced ruby masters, but for me who just picked up a Beginning Ruby from Novice...it's challenging now...but I want to use the code for real life purpose... thank you!!!
