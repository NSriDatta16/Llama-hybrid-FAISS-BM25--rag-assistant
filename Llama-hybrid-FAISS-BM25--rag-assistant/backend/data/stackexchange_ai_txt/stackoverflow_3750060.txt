Searching many-to-many relations with Vici CoolStorage

For an application used for managing booktitles and such, I'm using CoolStorage as an ORM. The database has a table named 'titles'. Each title can have n authors, stored in the 'authors' table. The two tables are connected through the linktable 'titles_authors', which is pure. When I try to filter titles on authors, I get an exception: Unable to cast object of type 'QueryExpression' to type 'System.String' Does anyone know how to filter the titles by author?
