It seems to me that you are facing a metric learning problem. Here is a survey on the topic: https://people.bu.edu/bkulis/pubs/ftml_metric_learning.pdf In particular, the scikit-learn library for Python provides algorithms to learn Mahanalobis distances over the labelled part of your data ( supervised metric learning ), which you can use to transform your complete dataset to a lower dimensional space before applying k-means. If the dimensionality reduction is significant, so will be the performance improvement of k-means which likely spends a lot of time calculating the distances between your large feature vectors.
