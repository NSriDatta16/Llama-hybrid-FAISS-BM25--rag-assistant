Another route you could take is not to mess around with your own repository per se, for fear of messing things up, but you could use someone else's repository or set up your own elsewhere. Point being, I learned by using SourceForge, which has both CVS and SVN... but hearing good things about SVN and weighing the differences between the two, I of course went with SVN. Getting back to SourceForge, I applied for a test project, more or less to see how SourceForge worked... but once I was in I got to playing around with their SVN for my own project listed there; experimenting with it both remotely and locally. Once I got a broad grasp of its features through testing it there, I then went on to read the go-to book for SVN, the freely distributed book by the tool's authors(the book already mentioned). It's truly a great book and at that point I began to feel comfortable setting up my own repository on critical systems. From that point all you need is a Q&A site like this for specific issues you come across and of course keep the free SVN book referenced in a bookmark for easy access. Post your questions if you get stuck along the way and we'll be happy to help. Best of luck!
