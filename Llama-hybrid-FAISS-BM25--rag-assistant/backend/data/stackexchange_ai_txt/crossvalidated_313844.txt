When to use deep learning instead of AR models?

Autoregressive models & deep learning(rnn-lstm) models both are used for time series prediction. As we choose the 'look back' for lstm's, provision to choose optimal lag by viewing acf-pacf plot or AR coefficient is also there for Autoregressive models. When can we know that we have to use deep learning instead of other time series methods? How do AR model & LSTM model differ? I know lstm is composed with gates & inherent memory blocks unlike AR, but theoretically why should not I use AR models? On an other note, i would also like to know why RMSProp optimizer is used(or better) in recurrent neural networks?
