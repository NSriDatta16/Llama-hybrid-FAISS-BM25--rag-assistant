I don't see anything inherently wrong with it, but it makes more sense to me to store the parsed out values instead of the data in querystring format. It might future-proof it a little more, for example if you changed the name of the query string parameters in your app at a later time. Elaborating: Instead of storing "?param1=A&param2=B&param3=C" into a field called "querystring" it would probably be better to store A, B, and C into three fields called "Param1, Param2, and Param3. Update: Based on the use case you added to your question, specifically the part about this data only needing to be stored temporarily until the user has confirmed their account, I don't think there is anything wrong with storing the query string in raw format. If you were intending long term storage of this info my original recommendation stands.
