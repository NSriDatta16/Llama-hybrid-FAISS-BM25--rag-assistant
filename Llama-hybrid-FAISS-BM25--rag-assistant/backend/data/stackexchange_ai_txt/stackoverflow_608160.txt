Pros/Cons of Binary Reference VS WCF

I am in the process of implementing an enhancement to an existing web application(A). The new solution will provide features(charts/images/data) to the application A. The new enhancement will be a new project and will generate new assemblies. I am trying to identify what would be most elegant way to read this information. 1) Do a binary reference and read the data directly. The new assemblies live with your application and are married together 2) Write a WCF call and get the data. This will help to decouple the application. The new application will involve me to buy some expensive licences. So if i go with the 2nd option i can limit the license fee to a single server or atmost 2-3. My current applicaiton runs under a webfarm of 8 servers. Please share out the pros/cons of both approach. Thanks.
