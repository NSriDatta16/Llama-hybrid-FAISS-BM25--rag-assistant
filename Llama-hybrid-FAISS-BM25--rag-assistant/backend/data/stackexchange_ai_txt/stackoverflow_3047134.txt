Well, one way is by overloading the object you're testing. Then you can override the getResource() method to return a "Mock" object (one that always behaves deterministically, and that you can "set up" for each test). The trick is to isolate the functionality that you want to test, and remove any dependencies that may get in the way (the getResource method in your case)... I'd recommend reading some tutorials (not just one, a few), and trying to understand the philosophy as well as the methodology...
