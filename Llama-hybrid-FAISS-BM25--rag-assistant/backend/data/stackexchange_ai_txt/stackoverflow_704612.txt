read text file into class object type array ( C++ )

So i have a class object type, myClass classType as a global. whats not happeing is that would prefer to have // MyClass.h { private: char FirstName; char LastName; char MiddleName; int ID; int Age; }; // Globals const int myIndex = 256; myClass classType[ myIndex ]; int main() { // assume preprocessors are included cout > cArray; if ( !inFile.good() ) { cout Thats a rough idea of what main looks like for me today. I have yet to use myClass.cpp at all! My Text file is of this format: FirstName LastName ID Number Age ... After debugging, i notice that the newline character was not detected and now everything is BUNCHED in, on the same index! Like my Increment didnt work or something.. I wanted to increment for however many lines their are in the file. ( more than one ) Im trying to fix the linecount ( idx ) in hopes of fully resolving this issue. My Private members, FirstName LastName, and so on as i wrote above are present when debugging and dragging on the myclasstype. I just Need to get them with their proper varaible. I just hope the ifstream::read() function is not leading me in a bad direction. Any Suggestions?
