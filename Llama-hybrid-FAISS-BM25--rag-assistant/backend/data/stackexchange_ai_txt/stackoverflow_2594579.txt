jQuery.ui.draggable.js and jQuery.ui.widget.js conflict

I had a working application, which uses a jquery ui dialog. I wanted to make the dialog draggable. As far as I know the only thing needed is the jquery.ui.draggable.js script. So I added it to the scripts I am using, but know I get the following error (as shown in the firebug console): base is not a constructor The relevante line in jquery.ui.widget.js is: var basePrototype = new base(); This is how I am adding all the scripts: Am I doing something wrong? or is this a problem with jquery? Thanks in advance for any help
