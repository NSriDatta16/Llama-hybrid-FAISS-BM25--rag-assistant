procrustes alternative

Im comparing two multidimensional MDS solutions, the solutions have the same number of dimensions. I don't think I can use the permutation version of procrustes analysis (commonly, PROTEST in R::vegan) because I doubt my two sets are exchangeable. I read that the sets must have similar covariance matrices to be exchangeable, which they don't. I can also not motivate exchangeability from a design perspective, as it is not experimental, rather it is a study comparing human and model-based assessment in lower dimensional space. My endeavor turned towards bootstrapping as it has fewer restrictions, however now I doubt I can use that as it seems to sample individual rows multiple times generates an incredible bias (procrustes of original datasets estimate of correlation is just half of the estimate from the bootstrap) Any ideas? I'm wondering if I have to take another path entirely or if it is possible to run permutated procrustes and I'm just not knowledgeable enough. BR, Eric
