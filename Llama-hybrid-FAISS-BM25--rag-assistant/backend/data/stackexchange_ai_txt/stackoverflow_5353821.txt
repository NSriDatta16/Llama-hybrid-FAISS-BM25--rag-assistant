WebRequest "HEAD" light weight alternative

I recently discovered that the following does not work with certain sites, such as IMDB.com. class Program { static void Main(string[] args) { try { System.Net.WebRequest wc = System.Net.WebRequest.Create("http://www.imdb.com"); //args[0]); ((HttpWebRequest)wc).UserAgent = "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/525.19 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/0.2.153.1 Safari/525.19"; wc.Timeout = 1000; wc.Method = "HEAD"; WebResponse res = wc.GetResponse(); var streamReader = new System.IO.StreamReader(res.GetResponseStream()); Console.WriteLine(streamReader.ReadToEnd()); } catch (Exception ex) { Console.WriteLine(ex.Message); } } } It returns an HTTP 405 ( Method Not Allowed ). My problem is, I use code very similar to the above to check if a link is valid and the vast majority of times it works correctly. I can switch it to method equal GET and it works ( with an increase in timeout ), but this slows things down by an order of magnitude. I am assuming the 405 response is a server configuration on IMDB's server side. Is there a way for me to do the same thing as above, in a light weight manner in .NET? Or, is there a way to fix the above code so it works as a GET request that works with imdb?
