Designing a rich UI using Webview for a non-network-using Android application

I am in the process of designing an application for android where the user can see a list of resources with short summary (e.g., title and date of an event) , and clicking on an item shows the details (e.g., event description, who is attending, etc). Currently I am exploring making a custom ListView and LinearLayout for this in Android, but styling elements looks a bit tedious. I have read/noticed that many apps such as GMail and Twicca use webview for a large part of their UI. Since I have more HTML/CSS experience than I have Java UI experience, I am considering going that route. Hence this set of (related questions) How do I enable loading of 'local' pages using URLs in the web view? [e.g., provide a hyperlink for the details page of an event as a url on the list page, which is loaded in the same webview, without accessing the internet] Can I refer to a "local" CSS file to style my app? Thanks in advance for your answers (or links to good resources). -A P.S. I searched on this site, but I could only find fragments of this question.
