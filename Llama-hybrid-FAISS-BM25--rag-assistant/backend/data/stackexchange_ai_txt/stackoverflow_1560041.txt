What's the best strategy for large amounts of audio files in mobile application?

I have an S60 app which I am writing in Qt and which has a large number (several thousand) small audio files attached to it, each containing a clip of a spoken word. My app doesn't demand high fidelity reproduction of the sounds, but even at the lowest bit rate and in mono MP3 they average 6k each. That means my app may have a footprint of up to 10Mb. The nature of the app is such that only a few audio clips will be needed at any one time - maybe as many as 50, but more like 1-10. So my question has two parts: 1) is 10Mb for a mobile app too large? 2) what is a reasonable alternative to shipping all audio files at install time? Thanks
