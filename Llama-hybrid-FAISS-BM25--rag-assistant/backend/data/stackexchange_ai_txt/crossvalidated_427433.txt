An attempt at an answer. Autocorrelation is no different than any other relationship between predictors. It's just that the predictor and the dependent variable happen to be the same time series, just lagged. isn't every state in the universe dependent on the previous one? Yes indeed. Just as every object's state in the universe depends on every other object's, via all kinds of physical forces. The question just is whether the relationship is strong enough to be detectable, or strong enough to help us in predicting states. And the very same thing applies to autocorrelation. It's always there. The question is whether we need to model it, or whether modeling it just introduces additional uncertainty (the bias-variance trade-off), making us worse off than not modeling it. An example from my personal work: I forecast supermarket sales. My household's consumption of milk is fairly regular. If I haven't bought any milk in three or four days, chances are high I'll come in today or tomorrow to buy milk. If the supermarket wants to forecast my household's demand for milk, they should by all means take this autocorrelation into account. However, I am not the only customer in my supermarket. There are maybe another 2,000 households that buy their groceries there. Each one's milk consumption is again autocorrelated. But since everyone's rate of consumption is different, the autocorrelation at the aggregate is so much attenuated that it may not make sense to model it any more. It has disappeared into the general daily demand, i.e., the intercept. And since the supermarket doesn't care who it sells milk to, it will model aggregate demand, and probably not include autocorrelation. (Yes, there is intra-weekly seasonality. Which is a kind of autocorrelation, but it really depends on the day of the week, not on the demand on the same weekday one week earlier, so it's more a weekday effect than seasonal autocorrelation.)
