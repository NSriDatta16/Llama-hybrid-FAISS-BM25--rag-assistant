High precision with low recall SVM

I'm classifying a data set using SVM and those are the precision and recall values for two classes. precision recall f1-score support H 0.91 0.99 0.95 1504 R 0.81 0.23 0.36 192 avg/total 0.90 0.91 0.88 1696 Following is the confusion matrix. Confusion Matrix: [[1494 148] [ 10 44]] Can I say this is a good classifier for my dataset based on average? I'm not sure because I'm getting a low recall value for class 'R'?
