Even though correlation can be calculated (it is technically possible), that does not automatically imply it makes sense. @StasK proposed a more suitable solution than simple correlation analysis, but he did not explain the motivation. I will try to do that briefly. The problem with prices and unemployment is that they are not independently and identically distributed ( not i.i.d.) The unemployment this month is closely related to the unemployment last month (the month-to-month change is usually quite small, except for seasonal effects). Meanwhile, it is much less related to unemployment 100 months ago. The same argument also applies to prices. Correlation of non-i.i.d. variables does not measure what it measures for i.i.d. data (where it is a suitable metric); it cannot be interpreted the regular way. Neglecting the non-i.i.d. nature of the data is likely to lead to false (or at least unreliable) conclusions. Building a time series model is a better alternative as time series models are intended for non-i.i.d. time-dependent data. @StasK proposed a particular model that could be used. If you have not heard much of VAR models before, you may need some time to get going. If you do not have the time, at least be aware that simple correlation is not really applicable to the data you have.
