Extending Enumerable in Rails 3

UPDATE TO QUESTION Here is what I have done based on some research and findings. STEP 1 - I have this module in my Rails 3 project and place it in my lib folder # lib/enumerable.rb module Enumerable def sum return self.inject(0){|acc,i|acc +i} end def average return self.sum/self.length.to_f end def sample_variance avg=self.average sum=self.inject(0){|acc,i|acc +(i-avg)**2} return(1/self.length.to_f*sum) end def standard_deviation return Math.sqrt(self.sample_variance) end end STEP 2 - According to this blog article , in Rails 3 your lib folder will not get loaded automatically. In order to load this module you need to go to your config / application.rb and type this in: config.autoload_paths += %W(#{config.root}/lib) STEP 3 - Then in your model my understanding is you type this in to get the module picked up. class MyModel STEP 4 - I then try restart the rails server and try this out and I get false when I would expect it to be true. MyModel.respond_to?('sample_variance') # false, when it should be true What am I doing wrong? Should I not be getting true?
