There are a few methods on the Session interface which take a Class argument, like createCriteria(Class) and getCurrentLockMode(Class) . I haven't tried this, but you could try passing the class of your object to one of those methods. If you're lucky, then if it's not an entity class, then an exception will be thrown. Not elegant, but it's all I got :)
