Specify apartment state to use when instantiating out of proc COM object

I created a COM object in .NET and registered it as a COM+ server application with Pooling = 1 using regsvcs . I am currently hunting down a bug and therefore need to make sure that this COM object is running in STA, not MTA. How can I specify this? Any of the following will help me: A setting in the Component services snap in A setting / code fragment which makes the COM object to only allow STA and not Both A setting / code fragment in C# on the caller side that tells COM+ that the COM object should be initialized with STA Update: I tried to manually change the ThreadingModel entry in the registry from Both to Apartment . This didn't help either, because when I try to instantiate the COM object, I get an COMException (0x80110802) and the event viewer says: The threading model of the component specified in the registry is inconsistent with the registration database. The faulty component is: MyComponent > Is there any other place I need to change the threading model? For example in that "registration database"? Where can I find it? Thanks!
