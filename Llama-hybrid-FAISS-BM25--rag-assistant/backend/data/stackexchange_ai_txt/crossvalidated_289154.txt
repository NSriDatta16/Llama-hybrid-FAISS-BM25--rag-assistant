What statistical methods should i use to identify segments in a population according to a response variable?

Assuming I have $p$ uncorrelated explanatory variables $(X_i)_{i=1...p}$ and one binary response variable $Y$, such that : $$\log\left(\dfrac{P(Y=0|X)}{1-P(Y=0|X)}\right)=1_{\{X_1>0\}}\sum_{i=2}^p\alpha_iX_i + 1_{\{X_1\leq0\}}\sum_{i=2}^p\beta_iX_i$$ What statistical method should i use in order to detect the partitioning rule $X_1>0$ that is defined in my logistic regression based on the data $(X,Y)$?
