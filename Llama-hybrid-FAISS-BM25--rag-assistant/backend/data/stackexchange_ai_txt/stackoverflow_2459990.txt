It sounds like (making some assumptions about what you're using your array for) most of the entries will be 0. If so, you might consider using a sparse matrix representation. If you really have that many entries (your current array is somewhere over 3 gigabytes already , even assuming no overhead), then you'll have to use some kind of on-disk storage, or a lazy-load/unload system.
