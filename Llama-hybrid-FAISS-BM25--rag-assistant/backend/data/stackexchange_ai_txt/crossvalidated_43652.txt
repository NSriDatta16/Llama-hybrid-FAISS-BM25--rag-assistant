The simplest approach would be an ANOVA, followed by post-hoc t tests. However, this would ignore that students in the same school will be more similar than students from different schools, even if the students from the same school have different teachers. Andrew Gelman would propose a multilevel Bayesian model... but I would recommend a mixed linear model, also known as repeated measurements ANOVA (we are repeating measurements from the different schools and the different teachers), which is easier to understand and to communicate to non-Bayesians. Look into the documentation of your favorite statistics package. Good luck!
