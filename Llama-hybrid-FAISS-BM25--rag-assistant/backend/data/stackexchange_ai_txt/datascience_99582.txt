Deep Learning models try to learn different unique properties of a class from training samples. With enough training samples the model learns which feature corresponds to which class. So without any training samples, there is no chance that a model will learn to classify to that class. But you can use pretrained models that requires little to no training samples as they are trained on huge dataset.
