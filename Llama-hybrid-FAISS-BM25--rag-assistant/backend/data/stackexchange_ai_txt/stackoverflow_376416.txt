I've done a lot of work in hosting the Dynamic Language Runtime (DLR) and allowing scripts to be embedded in XAML. I'm at the point now that I feel like Loose XAML is not a second class citizen as I can handle events, write value converters, run Python/Ruby/JScript to do things like connect to SQL server. See my blog to see if this direction suits you. I dynamically load assemblies using an attached property - once loaded, you can reference the classes in the assembly in the usual manner. So, too answer the question, there are MANY limitations of Loose XAML out of the box (like not being able to route an event to an event handler), but these can be overcome with a bit of work. I've only used XAML/WPF for desktop apps. Hopefully someone else jumps in to answer you browser specific questions. I have a library that I use in commercial work for DLR hosting and embedding DLR scripts in XAML that I've been meaning to turn into a supported product. If this would be of interest to you, be sure to let me know.
