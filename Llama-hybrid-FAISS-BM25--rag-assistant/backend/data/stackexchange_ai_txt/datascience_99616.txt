Unable to train neural network for prediction

My data consists of a time series of values $\pm1$ and I am trying to apply a RBF NN as a function approximator. Essentially, the NN will take as input one data sample and predict the next sample (one step ahead prediction). However, my network is not getting trained. If I use floating point vales as in the data then the same code works. However for $\pm$ data, I am not able to figure out how to train the network Can somebody please help? x = rand(3000,1); Data = 2*(x>=0.5)-1; % Training and Test datasets time_steps=1; % prediction of #time_steps forward value (for this simple architechture time_steps
