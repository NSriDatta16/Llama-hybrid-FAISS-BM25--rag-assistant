Excel layout for hierarchical data

I am working on an excel bulk upload feature which has to be parsed using Java API. My problem is designing its layout. The data is hierarchical with 4 levels and one to many relationship at each level. 1-other data for node 1 -2-other data for node 2 -3-other data for node 3 -4-other data for node 4 And this repeats e.g. - Organisation id - Organisation name - Address etc... - Department id - Department name - etc...(multiple departments for each organisation) - Manager id - Manager name - etc...(multiple managers for each department) - Employee id - Employee name - etc...(multiple employees for each manager) How can this be designed in excel layout so that it's easy for a non technical user to input data as well as for the program to parse and establish parent child relationship?
