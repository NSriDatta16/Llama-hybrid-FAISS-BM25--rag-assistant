Combining correlations

I'm not sure whether this is a question that can be analyzed statistically, but I will present it and be very interested in any feedback, whether it's an answer, or an explanation why the question can't be meaningfully asked. Suppose there some kind of phenomenon, P1, such that standard normal deviates which are under the influence of P1 always, if there are no other influences, have a fixed correlation C1 between each pair of deviates. Now suppose there is another phenomenon, P2, such that standard normal deviates under the influence of P2 always, if there are no other influences, have fixed correlation C2 between each pair. Now suppose there are some pairs of deviates that fall under the influence of both P1 and P2. Is there a way to calculate the correlation, by somehow combining C1 and C2, that would result between those deviates? If so, is there a way to extend it to handle weights for the strength of those influences, and having more than two of them? To me, it seems intuitively sensible that there could be such phenomena, and that they could be combined to end up with specific results. And it seems like simply computing the arithmetic average of the correlations would probably be the answer. But I'm not sure if there would be more to it than that. It is OK if one has to make some extra assumptions for this to be calculable. Just specifying what the assumptions are would be useful for understanding.
