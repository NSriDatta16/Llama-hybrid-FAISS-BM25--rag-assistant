How to resize view in XIB?

I'm trying to follow these instructions with Xcode 4, but am unable to resize the xib. Does anyone know how? ( The width and height cannot be clicked upon ) Also there is no UITableViewController so I just used UIViewController. EDIT - My goal is actually not to use the popover controller, I simply want to create a modal login dialog following the example here: How to resize a UIModalPresentationFormSheet? and am trying to make the view controller 300x400 A popover controller has to have a view controller inside of it. So we need to create a new view controller. Go to File > New File > Cocoa Touch Classes > UIViewController > UITableViewController subclass >> With XIB for UI >> Targeted for iPad. Name it OptionsViewController. Drag your viewcontroller.h and viewcontroller.m files into the classes group and the new XIB into the resources group. Open the XIB and go to the Size inspector. Change the width and height properties to 250 and 300. Save your file and close interface builder.
