Algorithm of the Intelligent Web (H Marmanis, D Babenko, Manning publishing) is an introductory text on the subjet. It also covers Searching concepts but its main focus is with classification, recommendation systems and such. This should be a good primer for your project, allowing you to ask the right questions and to dig deeper where things appear more promising or practical in your situation. The book also includes a "refresher" of relevant math topics (mainly linear algebra), but this refresher is minimal; you'll do better on the web. A pleasant way to discover or get back into linear algebra is to follow Prof. Gilbert Strand's 18.06 lecture series available on MIT OpenCourseWare. Linear algebra is not the only way to salvation ;-) you may find it useful to brush up on basic statistics concepts such as distribution, covariance, Bayesian inference...
