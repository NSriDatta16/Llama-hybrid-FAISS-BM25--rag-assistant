You need to save the timeoutID returned from setTimeout. You can call window.clearTimeout(timeoutID) to remove the timer and stop the event from happening. You'd have to create a new one afterwards in case of "resetting". The mozilla documentation for setTimeout . Check out this question too, it's got a (in my opinion) more elegant solution to I think the same problem you're having.
