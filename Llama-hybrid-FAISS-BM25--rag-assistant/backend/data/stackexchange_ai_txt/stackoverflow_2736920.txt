I think there's a chance that the documentation may have a typo. Plugin goals are specified by plugin-name:goal-name . That XML would bind the goal touch:timestamp to the process-test-resources phase. That fragment doesn't have anything to do with display:time . As far as I know, it is impossible to rename maven goals. (It seems like it would just make things more confusing.) The plugin source code is what defines goals, not the pom. The tag in the pom merely allows you to bind plugin goals to phases, or rebind goals if they already have a default phase. You should be able to run a goal with prefix:goalName . Most often, the prefix is simply whatever is between "maven-" and "-plugin" in the artifactId. e.g. touch:timestamp . This is complicated in a few situations since plugin authors can specify a "goalPrefix" different from the plugin name, but I haven't ever run into problems with this. The best way to find out what goals a plugin defines, and what phases they are bound to by default is to read the plugin documentation.
