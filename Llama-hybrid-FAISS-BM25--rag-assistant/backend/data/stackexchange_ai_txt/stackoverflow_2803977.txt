Warning on missing custom javadoc tags

We create a custom Doclet for our projet to generate a specific documentation for our client. We define some specific tags that are parsed by the doclet when we generate the documentation. Do you know how to ask eclipse to add warning when those special tags are missing in our javadoc comments ? Example of well formed javadoc: /** * @dialogName TECK-01-E-608 * @useVO ServiceVO * @useVO AgentVO */ public class MyDialog extends BaseDialogImpl { ... If @dialogName is missing, the developper should have a warning in eclipse... I look checkstyle a little bit, but I don't understand how to configure it to do such a thing. Thanks in advance for your help.
