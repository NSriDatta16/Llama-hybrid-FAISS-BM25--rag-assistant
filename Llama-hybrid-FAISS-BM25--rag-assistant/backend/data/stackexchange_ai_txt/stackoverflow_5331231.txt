How do I find an image generated by Dragonfly with Cucumber/Capybara?

In the comments to the solution for How do I find an image on a page with Cucumber/Capybara , somebody asked: I can't seem to figure how to get this to work with URLs generated by Dragonfly. They look like this: /media/BAh_some_long_string_AwIw/12_11_52_810_5x5.jpg?s=7e360000, where 5x5.jpg is my file name. I've tried something like: //img[@src="/media/ / #{image}?s=*"] but it doesn't work. Got any tips? â€“ Ramon Tayag Feb 25 at 4:18 I have a similar problem, only worse - in my case, the generated image paths don't even include a (jpg|png|gif) file name, they only have these really long ids: (Using dragonfly with mongo/gridfs) These paths get rendered alright, but I can't figure out how to find them in a Cucumber/Capybara step :P Any ideas? I looked at the Dragonfly's features , but they only test the rendering of the image itself, without detecting it's existence within an html page.
