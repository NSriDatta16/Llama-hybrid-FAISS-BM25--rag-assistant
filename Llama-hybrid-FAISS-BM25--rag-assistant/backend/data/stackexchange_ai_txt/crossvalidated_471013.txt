Downscaling climate data with a random forest model

I want to downscale climate data from CHELSA, which pixels are around 800 m long, to a 500x500 m or 50x50 m grid. I was thinking to perform a random forest model for each variable, in which I could relate the CHELSA values with variables such as elevation, coordinates xy or aspect. If those models were good enough, I would use them to predict in those 500x500 m or 50x50 m grids, in which I have calculated the same topographic variables. Would that be a correct statistical method for downscaling data from CHELSA or do you recommend me another method? The mean reason to downscale is that I'm working on an complex topographic island, and the grid size from CHELSA is too big. Thanks.
