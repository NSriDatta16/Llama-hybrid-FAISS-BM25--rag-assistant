This means that your dataset are very easy to learn, so the CNN was able to get 1.0 validation accuracy because you are saying you are sure that validation data is not in training data. Note that this is only data you have generated yourself, so that their images are "too" clean to learn. If you try to test your model on real samples, I think the accuracy will not be good at all.
