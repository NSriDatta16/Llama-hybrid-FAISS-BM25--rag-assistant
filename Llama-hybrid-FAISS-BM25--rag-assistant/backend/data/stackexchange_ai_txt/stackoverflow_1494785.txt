Is the array sort callback function called many times during the course of the sort? Since this is a comparison sort, given N items, the callback function should be invoked on average (N * Lg N) times for a fast sort like Quicksort . If the algorithm used is something like Bubble Sort , then the callback function will be invoked on average (N * N) times. The minimum number of invocations for a comparison sort is (N-1) and that is only to detect an already sorted list (i.e. early out in Bubble Sort if no swaps occur).
