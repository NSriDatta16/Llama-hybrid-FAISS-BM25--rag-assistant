Is it bad style to not use the loop variable in for-each statements in Java?

Is it considered poor style / discourage to ignore the loop variable in a for-each statement in Java? I have some code looks looks sort of like the following: public void makeChecklist( final List inputSrcs ){ for( File src : inputSrcs ){ System.out.print( src.getName() + "\t" ); } System.out.println(); for( File src : inputSrcs ){ //Not using "src" in this body! System.out.print( "[ ]\t" ); } System.out.println(); } Is this a bad idea? Any reason not todo things this way? It just seems so much cleaner than using a regular for-loop. PS- presume that for the example above I want the checkboxes to appear underneath the names, the example is contrived to ilustrate my question as simply as possible.
