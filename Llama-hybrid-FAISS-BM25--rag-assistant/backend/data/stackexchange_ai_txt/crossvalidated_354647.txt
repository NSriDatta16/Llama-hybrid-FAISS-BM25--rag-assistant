Requesting Intuitive Explanation to Covariance, Correlation and Standard Deviation

First I would like to state that I am not from a mathematical background. I am studying about change in price of products. So I have to understand about Correlation , Covariance and Standard Deviation intuitively. I have read lot of theoretical definitions today and little bit confused. I have taken the following data as example When the price of Product X is Rs. 1,2,3,4,5 , the price of product Y is Rs. 3,6,9,12,15. I use Karl Pearson formula. The Covariance turns out to be 6 . I dont understand what this number 6 is. My understanding is covariance measures how much Y changes when there is a change in X. But here I thought Covariance should be 3. But it is 6 . So please explain what's wrong with my understanding. Here the Units of both X and Y is common only. I read that we divide the Covariance by Product SD of X and Y to arrive at a unit free value between X and Y. My first doubt is , what is the intuitive explanation of dividing the Covariance by Product of the SD of two variables. The correlation turns out to be 1 . My understanding of Correlation is it measures the strength and not the slope. When correlation is 1 it means , when X changes in one direction , Y always changes in the same direction . When Corrrelation is 0.9 it means 90 % of the time the variables move in the same direction. And final doubt is regarding Standard Deviation. I understand SD as average distance of each variable from mean. So why don't we take the absolute value of differences from mean and average it. I heard this wont be accurate if the data's spread is high and I understand it intitively. But I dont get the derivation of formula mathematically. I would be really really grateful if someone could explain the concept with numbers instead of theory ( would love if it is based on my example data) in a simple way to a non-math student like me. !!
