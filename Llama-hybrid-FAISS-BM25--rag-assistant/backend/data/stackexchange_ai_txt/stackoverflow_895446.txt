If the numbers are int's, accumulate the total in a long. If the numbers are long's ... what language are you using? In Java you could accumulate the total in a BigInteger, which is an integer which will grow as large as it needs to be. You could always write your own class to reproduce this functionality. The gist of it is just to make an array of integers to hold each "big number". When you add two numbers, loop through starting with the low-order value. If the result of the addition sets the high order bit, clear this bit and carry the one to the next column. Another option would be to find the average of, say, 1000 numbers at a time. Hold these intermediate results, then when you're done average them all together.
