When you allocate the memory, you have no way to determine, in the memory, where it ends (unless you decide a convention and set a value somewhere, but anyway you would use n ) . In your case you have to use n to limit the array coverage (otherwise it is only limited by your computer capacity, and until it reaches an area where it does not have access: program crash). For instance (be careful not to overwrite n !) int v; int x = n; int *ptr = array; while (x--) { printf("Store:\n"); scanf("%d", &v); *ptr++ = v; } x = n; ptr = array; while (x--) { printf("Print: %d\n",*ptr++); }
