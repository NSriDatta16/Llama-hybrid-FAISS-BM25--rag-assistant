It's important to realize that probability, by its definition/construction as a mathematical concept, is only countably additive and not "uncountably additive." Generally in mathematics there is no such concept as uncountably additive (there are a few contexts where uncountable sums have been defined, but they aren't applicable to interpreting probability as an uncountable sum, and in those contexts an "uncountable sum of zeros" is always zero). Really, addition always only involves a finite number of terms and any infinite sum is defined in more complicated ways (e.g. as a limit of finite sums). It could be problematic that in the shared text the author says first "we cannot assert the probability of an uncountable union of disjoint events is the sum of their probabilities" (which is true) and then says "an uncountable sum of zeros can be any number between 0 and 1." The last statement is a reasonable informal/intuitive way to think about it but an "uncountable sum of zeros" isn't generally a valid mathematical object and definitely isn't valid in this context. Maybe later in the text that is clarified. I would worry that the average reader would see this and just be perplexed, thinking that uncountable sums of zeros are a coherent mathematical thing in other contexts and can be equal to whatever we want (in a mathematically coherent way). The concept of an "uncountable sum of zeros" is simply not defined generally speaking (it is defined in some contexts, but always gives a sum of zero then). It's important to understand that any time we are talking about "uncountable sums of zeros" in this context of probability, we are talking informally and intuitively and not about formally existing mathematical objects. Generally, it is important to distinguish between informal ideas and formal mathematical objects with the latter being described according to established axioms, definitions, etc. In the context of probability (and measure in general), if we are to think of adding up uncountably many zeros to get the probability of an event, then that would result in uncountable sums of zeros giving any number between 0 and 1. So that is an informal intuitive reason why uncountable sums of zeros don't make sense here. There is no formal mathematical object, an "uncountable sum," that we are referring to here (i.e. it's just not defined in this context). Consider the Cantor set $C$ and the set of irrationals $A=[0,1]\cap\mathbb Q^c$ . If we are considering $X$ to be a uniformly distributed random variable in $[0,1]$ , then $P(X\in C)=0$ and $P(X\in A)=1$ (the Lebesgue measure of these sets is firmly established, and that is identical to their probability under the uniform distribution). So these probabilities are not well-defined as uncountable sums of zeros. Similarly we can create an uncountable set of any probability between 0 and 1 that will similarly be thought of as giving an uncountable sum of zeros equal to its probability. E.g. the fat Cantor set $C_{1/4}$ with middle bits of length $1/4^n$ removed at each stage has measure $1/2$ gives $P(X\in C_{1/4})=1/2$ . We can construct fat Cantor sets of any measure between 0 and 1, and each is uncountable.
