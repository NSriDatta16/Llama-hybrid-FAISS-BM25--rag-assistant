Multi-label or multi-class...or both?

I'm having a hard time getting the difference between multi-class and multi-label classification with CNNs. My understanding is that if I want to classify different breeds of dogs, that is a multi-label classification as I have the same class of images and different labels classify dogs and cats, that is a multi-label classification as I have different images to recognise Now, what if my images contain a black/white dog/cat? In this case there are two classes (animal, colour) and two labels for each class. How do I build a classifier for this? I'd like to have as output a prediction for both classes (as I am assuming that any image can be labelled in those classes). I was thinking of training two classifiers, one for each class, but in this way I'd lose the link between classes (that may be important). The second idea is to use a single class containing all the possible permutations of the labels. However, this solution doesn't fully convince me as the number of these labels will increase pretty fast as I add more single labels (i.e., animals and colours). Are my intuitions correct? What is the proper way to tackle such kind of problems? Thanks
