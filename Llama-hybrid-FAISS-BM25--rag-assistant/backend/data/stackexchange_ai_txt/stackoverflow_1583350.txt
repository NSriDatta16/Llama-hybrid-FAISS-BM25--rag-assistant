sqlite3 and cursor.description

When using the sqlite3 module in python, all elements of cursor.description except the column names are set to None, so this tuple cannot be used to find the column types for a query result (unlike other DB-API compliant modules). Is the only way to get the types of the columns to use pragma table_info(table_name).fetchall() to get a description of the table, store it in memory, and then match the column names from cursor.description to that overall table description?
