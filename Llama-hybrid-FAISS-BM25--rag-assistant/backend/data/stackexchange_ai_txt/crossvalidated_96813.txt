How to calculate median absolute deviation in a cross validation scenario?

In a cross validation scenario "leave one out" I want to measure how the estimated continuous variable fits with the observed variable. I learned from Wikipedia that the Median absolute deviation (MAD) could by used. My question: How is the MAD to be calculated in this scenario? I have two ideas. The first is inspired from the definition of MAD where the center is the median of all deviations: Set the deviation $D_i = E_i - O_i$ for each corresponding estimated and observed outcome Calculate the median $M = \underset{i}{arg\;median}({D_i})$ Set $MAD = \underset{i}{arg\;median}({|M-D_i|})$ The second one seems more appropriated to me in the context of cross validation: Set the deviation $D_i = E_i - O_i$ for each corresponding estimated and observed outcome Set $MAD = \underset{i}{arg\;median}{(|D_i|})$. The last is the median of the absolute deviation between estimated and observed value, literally. However, it seems not to confirm to the definition given by Wikipedia. What is the best solution in my scenario? BTW: In the wikipedia article about the Mean absolute error I found an interesting comment about this issue: The mean absolute error is a common measure of forecast error in time series analysis, where the terms "mean absolute deviation" is sometimes used in confusion with the more standard definition of mean absolute deviation. The same confusion exists more generally.
