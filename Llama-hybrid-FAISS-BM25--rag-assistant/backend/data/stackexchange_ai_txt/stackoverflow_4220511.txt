Asp.Net Mvc controller static constructor

I'm trying to create a site, with a master controller.It has two constructors - static and parameterless. By specification the static one should be called first and once, to initialize static members of the class, but it never did, why is that? How can I implement single storage for some staff which should be accessible from the controller? EDIT: I guess I make some mistake when I try to debug it because, today it works like expected, static constructor is called once and before regular one.
