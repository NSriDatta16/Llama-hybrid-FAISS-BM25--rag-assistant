Idiosyncratic volatility forecast using EGARCH (Fu, 2009)

I have a time series of historical volatility observations. I want to use an EGARCH model because I believe it is a good representation of the behaviour of these volatilities. Can I estimate an EGARCH model using the observed volatilities without using the underlying returns? I'm using R and I think in the input the program expects returns instead of volatilities. To be more specific, I'm trying to follow the methodology described in a paper about idiosyncratic volatility. To estimate it, the author runs the following regression: $$ \begin{aligned} r_t − r^f_t &= \alpha_t + b_{1,t}(r^m_t−r^f_t) + b_{2,t}SMB_t + b_{3,t}HML_t + \varepsilon_t \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \text{(1)} \\ \varepsilon_t &∼ N(0,\sigma^2_t) \\ \ln(\sigma^2_t) &= \omega + \Sigma_{i=1}^p\beta_i \ln(\sigma^2_{t−i}) + \Sigma_{i=1}^qc_i \left[\theta(\varepsilon_{t−i}\sigma_{t−i}) + \gamma\left( ∣\varepsilon_{t−i}\sigma_{t−i}∣−\sqrt{2\pi}\right)\right] \end{aligned} $$ Idiosyncratic volatility is defined as the standard error of the residuals of the regression in equation (1). I want to build an EGARCH to have a conditional idiosyncratic volatility. To do this, I run the regression (1) and took the standard error of the residuals; this is the historical idiosyncratic volatility. Then I supply these historical idiosyncratic volatilities as input to my program (I use R and the package "rugarch"). Does this procedure make sense, or should I do something else? The problem is that in all the application that I view of EGARCH, the inputs are the returns; but in my case, if I give returns as input, then I would have an EGARCH for the normal volatility and not the idiosyncratic, which is the one in which I am interested.
