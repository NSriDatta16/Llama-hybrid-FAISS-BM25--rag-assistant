This question was answered over on the KnockoutJS Google Group by a brilliant developer named Green. He demonstrated how to do this using a custom extension library (that he built) for KnockoutJS. His solution allow additional JQueryUI events to be "bindable" (ie. drag & resize). He then posted his solution along with his knockout-ext.js file out on JSFiddle for me to use and learn from it. Thanks again, Green ! :)
