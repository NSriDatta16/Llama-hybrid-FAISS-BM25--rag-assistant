Dijkstra's smoothsort is a great sort on already-sorted data. It's a heapsort variant that runs in O(n lg n) worst-case and O(n) best-case. I wrote an analysis of the algorithm, in case you're curious how it works. Natural mergesort is another really good one for this - it's a bottom-up mergesort variant that works by treating the input as the concatenation of multiple different sorted ranges, then using the merge algorithm to join them together. You repeat this process until all of the input range is sorted. This runs in O(n) time if the data is already sorted and O(n lg n) worst-case. It's very elegant, though in practice it isn't as good as some other adaptive sorts like Timsort or smoothsort.
