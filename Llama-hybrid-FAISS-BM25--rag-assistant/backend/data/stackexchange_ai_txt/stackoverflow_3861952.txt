If the user is dragging from the explorer, then all you get is a list of filenames (with path). A simple and mostly working solution would be to look at the file extensions and if they match a pre-defined list of supported extensions. Something like this (not tested, may not even compile, but hopefully you get the idea) var validExtensions = new [] { ".png", ".jpg", /* etc */ }; var lst = (IEnumerable ) e.Data.GetData(DataFormats.FileDrop); foreach (var ext in lst.Select((f) => System.IO.Path.GetExtension(f))) { if (!validExtensions.Contains(ext)) return false; } return true;
