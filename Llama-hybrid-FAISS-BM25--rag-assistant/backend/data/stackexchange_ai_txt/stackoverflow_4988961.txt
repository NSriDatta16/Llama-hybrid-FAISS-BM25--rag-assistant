look at the last paragraph on this page: http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/docs/event_data/Event_Object/ In addition to the fields above, you may also include your own non-standard fields in each Event Object. FullCalendar will not modify or delete these fields. For example, developers often include a description field for use in callbacks such as eventRender.
