What about using monad transformers? They are more or less standard way to combine monads. Here an simplistic example: type Foo a = StateT String IO a replT :: Foo () replT = do str Below are results of running replT from within ghci. *Main> runStateT replT "Initial state" asd current state: Initial state setting state: asd zxc current state: asd setting state: zxc asdasd There are three monad transformers libs. mtl, transformers and monadLib. I cannot recommend any of them since I don't use them much.
