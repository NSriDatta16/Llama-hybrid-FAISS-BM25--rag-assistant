As far as R programming goes, the formula you offer is equivalent to: s ~ age * treatment The asterisk-operator is overloaded in R. When its arguments are numeric, it is multiplication, and when they are tokens or symbols in an R formula they are interactions that get expanded to all first order and second order ( and higher if there are more than two symbols.) Your representation of that model is also syntactically legal. We would have more to talk about if you had presented the output. I originally thought your were using the 'lung' dataset from pkg:survival, but it has no treatment variable. It's true that SO tries to get interpretation and methodology questions shunted over to CrossValidated.com, but since that may happen anyway, I'll start that process. The interaction model gives you more information. Your question would be answered by a comparison of two models: s ~ age * treatment # three coefficients s ~ age + treatment # two effect coefficients When there is no major difference in the "age effect" there will be no material change in the estimated coefficient for treatment across a comparison of those two models. The estimated "effect" in the "0"-groups will not be reflected in the treatment coefficients, since R uses treatment contrasts. The estimated effects in the older age group will be a combination of two or three coefficients depending on which treatment group is under consideration. The question of whether there is a significant difference in the effect of treatment in the two age groups will be reflected in the magnitude of the age:treatment interaction and the associated p-value in the output from the first of those models. The results from the second of those models will return an treatment-estimate that is essentially a weighted average of the two models you were originally using. The mean of your two treatment estimates should be close to that estimate if the numbers of your cases in the age categories are similar. You should consider looking at the possibility of modeling age as a continuous variable.
