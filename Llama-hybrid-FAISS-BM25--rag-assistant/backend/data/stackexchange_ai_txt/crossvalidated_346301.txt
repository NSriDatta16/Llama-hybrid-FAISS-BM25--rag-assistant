If $\mathbf{x} \sim N(\mathbf{0,I})$ and $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{Ax}$, what does $\mathbf{A}^T \mathbf{A}$ represent?

If $\mathbf{x} \sim N(\mathbf{0,I})$ then $\mathbf{AA}^T$ is the covariance matrix of $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{Ax}$, but what does $\mathbf{A}^T \mathbf{A}$ represent? In some places I have seen statements like "if $\mathbf{X}$ is the data, then $\mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{X}$ is (proportional/related to) the covariance matrix of the data." But here $\mathbf{A}$ is not data, it is a matrix of coefficients. I was dealing with a problem where I had to reduce the size of $\mathbf{y}$ from $n$ to $1$ and it was solved via a PCA for $\mathbf{A}^T \mathbf{A}$ such that the reduce one-dimensional $y^*$ is given by $y^* = \mathbf{b}^T\mathbf{x}$ where $\mathbf{b}$ is the (normalised) eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of $\mathbf{A}^T \mathbf{A}$.
