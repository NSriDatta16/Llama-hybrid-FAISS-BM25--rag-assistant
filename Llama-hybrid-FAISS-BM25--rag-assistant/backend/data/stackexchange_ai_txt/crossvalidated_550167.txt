As @whuber points out, this question is much more naturally answered in a Bayesian context. In that case the distribution you are interested in is known as the posterior predictive distribution . $$ p(x_{n+1}|x_1,\ldots,n) = \int_\theta p(x_{n+1}|\theta,x_1,\ldots,x_n)p(\theta|x_1,\ldots,x_n)d\theta $$ where $\theta = (\mu,\sigma^2)$ . This is about as close as you can get in the general case. If you are willing to accept a particular prior distribution for $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ (Normal for $\mu$ and Inverse-Gamma for $\sigma^2$ ) you can get a closed form distribution (it is a $t$ distribution) which you can look up here
