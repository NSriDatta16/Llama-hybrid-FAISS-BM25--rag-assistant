In short, I think you are doing your steps out of order. Your second routine is perhaps doing too much. It should only determine a collision, and return an identifier for the target of the collision. Then a consuming routine uses that information to adjust projectile trajectory (reflect it back) and finally turn-off the visibility. By the way, collision detection is a popular venue for what is known as " double-dispatch " invocations. Consider using the visitor pattern (ala Gang of Four) as a way to code this up.
