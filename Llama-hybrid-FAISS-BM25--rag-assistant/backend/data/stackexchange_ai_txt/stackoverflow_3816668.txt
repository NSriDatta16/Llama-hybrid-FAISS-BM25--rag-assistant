I recommend a single large table for all jobs. There should be one table for each kind of thing, not one table for each thing. If you make the Job ID the first field in the clustered index, SQL Server will use a b-tree index to determine the physical order of data in the table. In principle, the data will automatically be physically grouped by Job ID due to the physical sort order. This may not stay strictly true forever due to fragmentation, but that would affect a multiple table design as well. The performance impact of making the Job ID the first key field of a large table should be negligible for single-job operations as opposed to having a separate table for each job. Also, a single large table will generally be more space efficient than multiple tables for the same amount of total data. This will improve performance by reducing pressure on the cache.
