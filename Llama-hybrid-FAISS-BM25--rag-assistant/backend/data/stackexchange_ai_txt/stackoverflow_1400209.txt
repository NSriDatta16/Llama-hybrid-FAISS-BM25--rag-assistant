I would suggest to avoid wizards as much as possible. People have a short attention span and you risk that, at the middle of it, they start forgetting what the said, what they are doing there, etc. That being said, i think that it may be viable when performing some shopping (e.g., checkout), first-time configurations, others? When to Develop a Wizard Always try to: Only ask the information really needed Simplify as much as you can, thus avoiding the need to additional explanation When creating a wizard: Clearly show the how many steps are needed and how many are completed Allow the user to revert or cancel it
