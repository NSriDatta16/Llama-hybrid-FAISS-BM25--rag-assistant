New Element in MooTools by UID

Is it possible to instantiate an element on Mootools based on the automatic UID that mootools create? EDIT: To give more info on what is going. I'm using https://github.com/browserstate/history.js to make a history within an ajax page. When I add a DOM element to it (which does not have an id), at some point it passes through a JSON.toString methods and what I have of the element now is just the uid. I need to recreate the element based on this UID, how could I go about doing that? Do I need to first add it to the global storage to retrieve later? If so, how?
