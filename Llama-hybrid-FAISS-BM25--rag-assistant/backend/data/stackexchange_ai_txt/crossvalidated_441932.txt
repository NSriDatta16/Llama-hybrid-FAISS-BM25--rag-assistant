I like @NeilFultz answer, and I more than encourage you to learn, practise and expand your knowledge. However, if time is of the essence for you, I will provide the following solution. I guess if you are not completely comfortable with going beyond OLS-type questions, how about a practical solution of choosing a dataset, in which you can model a continuous response variable (DV)? If you deal with modeling ordinal (ordered categories) or nominal (discreet categories) data you need to use a bit more complicated models. For example, proportional-odds regression or multinominal regression for the ordered and discreet response variable accordingly. Now, practically speaking: How do you go about choosing a dataset with normally distributed continuous DV quickly. Here's a simple R code for you that gives you access to a wealth of datasets, so you can quickly scan through some of them. ### Access all available datasets # check available datasets in all packages datasets.load::datasets() # check datasets within a specific package datasets.load::getDatasetInfo("lattice") datasets.load::getDatasetInfo("dplyr") # Selecting a specific dataset datasets::ChickWeight # type package name::name of dataset One example of a dataset, where you may like to predict a normally-distributed variable (Chicken Weight) based on a few predictors such as type of diet is the datasets::ChickWeight . I know this may sound unexciting but you are more than welcome to browse through all datasets to find the one you like
