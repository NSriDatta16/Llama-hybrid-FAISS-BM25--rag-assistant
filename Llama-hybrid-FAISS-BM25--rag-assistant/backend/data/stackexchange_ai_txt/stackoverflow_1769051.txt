Not very Web 2.0, and also discouraged by the W3C, but you could add this to your HTML header: That will automatically refresh the page for you every 60 seconds without the user having to click refresh. To implement this you would create a CGI script using Python , which gets the result via SNMP and generates the webpage with your message. If this script also outputs the meta refresh above, it will be updated by the browser every minute, generating the new content. The proper way of doing this is probably using AJAX . It all depends on how much time you want to spend on it.
