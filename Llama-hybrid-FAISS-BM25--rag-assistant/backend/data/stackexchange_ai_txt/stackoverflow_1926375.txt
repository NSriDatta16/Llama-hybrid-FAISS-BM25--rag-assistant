buffer_cc[0] and strings[3] (for example) are pointers that reference the same memory location but are of the same type, thus don't violate strict aliasing. buffer[0] is not a pointer, thus doesn't violate strict aliasing. Aliasing optimizations arise when dereferencing pointers, so I wouldn't expect this to cause problems. As you allude to in the code and the last paragraph in your question, the real problem in the sample code arises when pointers and uint32_t are of different sizes. Also, you can always alias a char* to point to another type without violating strict aliasing, though not vice-versa.
