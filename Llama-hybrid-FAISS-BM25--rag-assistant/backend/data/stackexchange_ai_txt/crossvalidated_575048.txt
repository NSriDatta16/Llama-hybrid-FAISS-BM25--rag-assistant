How do I do a logistic regression model in R for an outcome with multiple values?

I want to analyse the association between the outcome "Other CTR-CVD" and the independent variables would be "anthracyclines", "Her2", "VEGF", "TKI, "Prot Inh", RAF/MEK Inh, "ICI" and Fluoropirimidines" (this are the 8 first rows of the table I have with the date of 296 patients)
