If you simply want some "parent" Flex application to embed several instances of this autonomous child application, then you should see Adobe's "Embedding Asset Types" documentation, which describes how to embed one SWF file in another. From the documentation: You typically embed a Flex application when you do not require the embedding application to interact with the embedded application. If the embedding application requires interactivity with the embedded application, you might consider implementing it as a custom component, rather than as a separate application. If you do require interaction between the embedded application and the parent application, you can look into the SWFLoader control.
