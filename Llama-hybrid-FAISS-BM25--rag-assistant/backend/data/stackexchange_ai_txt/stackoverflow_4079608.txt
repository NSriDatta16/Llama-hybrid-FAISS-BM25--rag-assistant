How to keep an SQLite database and UITableView synchronized

I'm new to iPhone development and try to create a simple address book. The contact data is stored in an SQLite database and presented in a UITableView (just like in the Contacts app). When the user taps on a name in the table, a detail view becomes visible. There's a delete button that deletes the contact. The problem is, that I'm not sure how to synchronize the SQLite database with the data source of the table. All contact data is stored in an NSMutableArray that becomes populated when the app starts (using a SELECT query). Now, when I delete a contact, I have to delete both the entry in the array and the row in the database. Is there any other, more 'elegant' way to do this?
