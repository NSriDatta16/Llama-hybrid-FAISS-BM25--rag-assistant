Is it standard to add a 0 and a 1 to the input layer of a neural network?

Is it standard to add a 0 and a 1 to the input layer of a neural network? I haven't seen it done, but my experience of the breadth of neural networks is low. It would seem like not doing this would hinder logical calculations until the second layer – or deeper – when the network was able to reliably generate this input.
