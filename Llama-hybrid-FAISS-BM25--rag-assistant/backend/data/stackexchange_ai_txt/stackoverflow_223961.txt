To link against a library, you can either: List it in Project-> Properties...->Linker, Input->Additional Dependancies (VC++ directories only lets you use just the .lib name rather the full path), Add the library project to your app. solution (On solution, right click -> Add -> Existing Project...), then use Project -> Project Dependancies..., then check your library project (make sure the application project is selected in the drop-down). This is probably the best way to go if you are editting both projects, as VC++ will rebuild the library if it has changed before building your app. If you are sure you will only use VC++, #pragma comment(lib,"C:\\path\\to\\library.lib")` (Thanks @Nils) NB: It seems very odd to have your library solution folder inside an 'include' directory: which are really intended for *.h (or other #include d files).
