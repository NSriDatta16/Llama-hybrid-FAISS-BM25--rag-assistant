Marginalizing versus optimizing the nuisance and hyper parameters

In a Bayesian setting, the classical approach when studying a given variable of interest (here $\theta_0$) consists of marginalizing the full posterior over nuisance and hyper parameters (here $\theta_1$): $$ p(\theta_0|x)=\int p(\theta_0,\theta_1|x) d \theta_1 $$ Nevertheless, an alternative cheaper approach consists in optimizing (e.g. MAP) over the hyperparameters/nuisance and then considering the density: $$ p(\theta_{0},\theta_{1}^{MAP} |x).$$ Question: Are there some well-known limitations for either solution? (Regardless of technical considerations.) For example, are there limitations when looking at the resulting mean or HPD interval?
