Getting a list of actions of an app has nothing to do with credentials. It's a matter of convention how the credentials are named or organized. Actions and credentials are independent. You could have one credential per whole application or define one credential per action. Still, you manage credential separately. If you really want to get list of actions you could parse the routing file. You could also use PHP's Reflection mechanism to get methods out of the action classes. However, sfDoctrineGuardPlugin/sfGuardPlugin offers you sufficient credential management for most of the applications. I'd rather go with this approach. 2n question: There's no setCredential() method but there is an addCredential() .
