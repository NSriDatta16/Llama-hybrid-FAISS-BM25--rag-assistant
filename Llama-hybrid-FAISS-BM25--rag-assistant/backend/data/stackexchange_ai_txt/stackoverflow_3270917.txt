which kinds of constructors may be applied during compile time as optimization, for objects with static storage duration?

take two following classes and their constructors as samples: class One{ public: One(int a,int b):adad1(a),adad2(b){} private: int adad1; int adad2; }; class Two{ public: Two(int input[]){ for (int i=0;i considering objects with static storage duration, I think first constructor can be applied during compile time due to its free function body that allows it to be converted to a constant expression in some cases as an optimization, but I have doubt about second one. anyway is there any rule specifying which kinds of constructors can be applied during compile time ?
