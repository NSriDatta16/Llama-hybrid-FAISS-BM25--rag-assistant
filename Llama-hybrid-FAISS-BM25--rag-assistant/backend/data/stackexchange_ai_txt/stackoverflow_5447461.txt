Running Scapy on Windows with Python 2.7

I like to use Scapy with Python v2.7 under Windows 7. How can I install the required module pypcap for Python 2.7? Will it be possible to make Python scripts depending on Scapy into standalone Windows applications using a distribution tool such as py2exe? The particular Python distribution I am using is Enthought Python distribution 7.02.
