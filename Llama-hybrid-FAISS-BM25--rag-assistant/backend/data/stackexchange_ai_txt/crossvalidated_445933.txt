How do I solve this system of equations?

I am doing something that is commmon practice in economics to uniquely identify matrices. After deriving 3 unrotated factors from PCA, I then want to rotate them to be able to interpret them in economic terms. The usual procedure is to choose an orthogonal matrix $U$ (3x3 in my case) such that $UU'=I$ . Being a 3x3 matrix I need 3 additional restrictions to uniquely identify it. So, first, I compute $UU'$ : $UU' = \begin{bmatrix} u_{11} & u_{12} & u_{13} \\ u_{21} & u_{22} & u_{23}\\ u_{31} & u_{32} & u_{33} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} u_{11} & u_{21} & u_{31} \\ u_{12} & u_{22} & u_{32}\\ u_{13} & u_{23} & u_{33} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$ and I get 6 equations in 9 unkowns: (1) $u_{11}^2 + u_{12}^2 + u_{13}^2 = 1$ , (2) $u_{21}^2 + u_{22}^2 + u_{23}^2 = 1$ , (3) $u_{31}^2 + u_{32}^2 + u_{33}^2 = 1$ , (4) $u_{11}u_{21} + u_{12}u_{22} + u_{13}u_{23} = 0$ , (5) $u_{21}u_{31} + u_{22}u_{23} + u_{23}u_{33} = 0$ , (6) $u_{11}u_{31} + u_{22}u_{23} + u_{23}u_{33} = 0$ Then I add 3 additional restrictions to uniquely identify the matrix: (7) $0.45u_{12} + 0.65u_{22} + 0.88u_{32} = 0$ , (8) $0.45u_{13} + 0.65u_{23} + 0.88u_{33} = 0$ , (9) $VCov(U_3F)' = 0$ (where this is the first derivative of the variance-covariance) and I get a system of 9 equations in 9 unkowns which I can then solve. Now, my silly question is: shall I treat it as a sytem of quadratic equations? I find difficult to see the structure of it. As a result, I find difficult to find the right function in R to solve it. But the most important thing for me is to understand what type of system I am solving and how can I structure it in a way it's clearer to me. Then if anyone has any suggestion on how to solve it in R would be incredibly useful. Thanks a lot for your help!
