Yes, those methods are valid. You can even inject those auxiliary inputs earlier into the network by "tiling them" -- that is, if you have some K-dimensional vector of auxiliary inputs, copy it on the height and width axes until you have a KxHxW tensor, and concatenate it to some intermediate feature map of your CNN. You could use one-hot coding for categorical inputs with possibly missing data (simply set everything to 0 if unknown).
