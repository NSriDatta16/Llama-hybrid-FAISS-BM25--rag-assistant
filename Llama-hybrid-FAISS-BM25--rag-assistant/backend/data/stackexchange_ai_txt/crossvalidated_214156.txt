why are LASSO and LARS model selection methods so popular even though they are basically just variations of step-wise forward selection There is a difference between LASSO and (GETS) subset selection: LASSO shrinks the coefficients towards zero in a data-dependent way while (GETS) subset selection does not. This seems to be an advantage of LASSO over (GETS) subset selection, even if occasionally it might fail (it needs parameter tuning, which is normally done via cross validation, and occasionally we might happen to tune poorly). (GETS) methods do better than LARS/LASSO The performance of GETS seems to be of comparable quality to LASSO when done by impartial (?) researchers (although not necessarily so in the papers where a new version of GETS is proposed - but that is what you would expect); see some references in this thread . Perhaps Sir Hendry & Co are getting good results using GETS due to the specifics of their applications (mostly macroeconomic time series modelling)? But why could that be? This is a separate question .
