Were there alternatives In the 1950s to the logistic function for classification?

I would like to know why logistic function is chosen for classification. After reading the original paper developing logistic regression by David Cox, I can understand the benefits of using the logistic function. However, in the 1950's, were there alternatives to the logistic function could help David Cox? If there was any, what would it be?
