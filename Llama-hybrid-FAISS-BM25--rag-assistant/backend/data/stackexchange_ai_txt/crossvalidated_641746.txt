I don't see any reason to use the harmonic or geometric mean to average ranks. The geometric mean is usually used for rates, and the harmonic mean for values that are on very different scales. There's also median and the trimmed mean. I think a trimmed mean might be good, if you want to exclude judges who are very different from the other judges. The underlying distribution of ranks (if you don't allow ties or skips) is going to be a discrete uniform from 1 to the number of items. However, which alternative is "best" depends on what you want.
