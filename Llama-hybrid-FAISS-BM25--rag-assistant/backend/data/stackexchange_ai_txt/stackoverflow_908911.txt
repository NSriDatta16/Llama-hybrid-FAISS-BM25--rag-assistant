You could try getting the executing process via Process.GetCurrentProcess() , possibly you could check the Process.MainWindowHandle is not IntPtr.Zero , or check the process name, or potentially scan the loaded modules of the Process. This would have an advantage (I would assume) of not requiring your to load assemblies that are not required for your current execution context (e.g. don't load System.Windows.Forms.dll when that app is a web app). However this seems inelegant.
