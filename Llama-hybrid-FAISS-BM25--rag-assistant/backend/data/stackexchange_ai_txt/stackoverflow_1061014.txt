You can mix C++ in with Objectiv-C (Objective C++). Write a C++ method in your Objective C++ class that simply calls [context renderbufferStorage:GL_RENDERBUFFER fromDrawable:(CAEAGLLayer*)self.layer]; and call it from your C++. I haven't tried it before my self, but give it a shot, and share the results with us.
