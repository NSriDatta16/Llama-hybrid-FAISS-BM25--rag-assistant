Simple neural network (conceptual) be used for bounding box prediction?

I am writing a very simple neural network to see whether it can be used for my scoped case of drawing a bounding box around a specific object (barcode) in an image. The layers i am thinking of are: One convolution to detect edges and learn features of the barcode a few dense layers to adjust for predicting the 4 data points (x1,y1,x2,y2) of the specific object in the image. In code, this is the basic schema: // Generate a sequential model const baseModel = tf.sequential(); // Layer 1: Convolutional baseModel.add( tf.layers.conv2d({ inputShape: [224, 224, 1], filters: 64, kernelSize: 4, padding: "same", activation: "relu", }) ); baseModel.add(tf.layers.flatten()) baseModel.add(tf.layers.dense({ units: 128, activation: "relu" })) baseModel.add(tf.layers.dense({ units: 64, activation: "relu" })) baseModel.add(tf.layers.dense({ units: 4, activation: "sigmoid" })) baseModel.compile({ optimizer: tf.train.adam(0.00001), //could be a parameter as well. loss: tf.losses.meanSquaredError, }); Would this steps be reasonable towards my goal of predicting bounding boxes? I have read other posts and models, they normally use huge models with pretrained weights, but I wonder if, for a specific case, this schema could be enough.
