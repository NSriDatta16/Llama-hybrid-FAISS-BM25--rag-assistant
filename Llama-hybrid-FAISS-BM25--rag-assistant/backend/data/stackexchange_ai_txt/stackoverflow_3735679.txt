and good luck on your competition! I'm a little concerned that the first solution proposed can, at best, help you find minimum max flow, which is on track to what you're looking for, but not quite the same. I took a class taught by Robert Tarjan. He happens to have helped develop a method of deriving minimum flows called: "cycle canceling". Here is a great lecture posted by Kevin Wayne, a senior lecturer at Princeton (with Tarjan): http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~wayne/papers/ratio_talk.pdf Min-mean circuit canceling in particular will help you to find min flows. If you look over those two papers and still would like to discuss, please let me know.
