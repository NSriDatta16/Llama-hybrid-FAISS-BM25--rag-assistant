multivariate time series: selecting a predictive model

I have a time series dataset that looks like this x y z t 2017-10-28 00:00:01 0.18 0.01 0.55 2017-10-28 00:00:02 0.20 0.01 0.56 2017-10-28 00:00:03 0.24 0.01 0.57 2017-10-28 00:00:04 0.23 0.02 0.58 2017-10-28 00:00:05 0.26 0.01 0.59 ... ... ... ... 2017-10-28 12:59:08 0.53 -0.03 0.9 2017-10-28 12:59:09 0.56 -0.04 0.89 2017-10-28 01:00:00 0.57 -0.04 ??? give (x) & (y) at time (t) I want a chose a model that will best predict the next value in the sequence (z) notes: â€¢ the time series is stationary - i have detrended, deaseasonlized, and minmax scaled each feature
