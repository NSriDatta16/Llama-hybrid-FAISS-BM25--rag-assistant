The simplest answer, although probably not what you're looking for, would be to write the C code to access the card, compile it, and see the code generated by the compiler. The C code is likely to go through the NIC driver directly, or use a library like winpcap . Built-in support for raw sockets on Windows, for example, was disabled for security reasons. But this isn't the best way to learn how NICs work. For that, pick a datasheet of a popular embedded NIC like LAN91C111 and read how to access it. That will teach you a lot about interfacing Eterthet in the raw way. This still isn't a good enough sandbox to study assembly language in, IMHO. For that, just implement a few small algorithmic programs in assembly - like binary tree search.
