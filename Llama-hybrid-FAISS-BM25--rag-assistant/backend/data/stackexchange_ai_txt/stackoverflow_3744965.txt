Is it possible and How to drag and drop GDI object?

I have found this analog clock tutorial here: http://www.codeproject.com/KB/selection/AnalogClockControl.aspx Now is it possible to drag and drop the hand hour (how to detect the mouse on the hand hour ?) and show this hand hour moving while dragging it ? I mean isn't anything included framework in .NET which allow me to detect that the mouse is ON a shape like for IPHONE sdk ?
