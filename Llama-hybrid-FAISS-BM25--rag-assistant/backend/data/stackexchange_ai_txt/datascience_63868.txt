How to best use Large images in training set for deep learning

I would like to ask you about how I should deal with the images I have. They are really large. They have this shape: (3000, 4000, 3) . I'm working on a multilabel classification model . And I want to know if it's wise to slice the images into equal tiles (using image_slicer ) and to feed them to the model as well as resize the original images to the requisite input size of the model and feed those too. So the training set would be: resized_original_images + tiles_of_original_image Thank you
