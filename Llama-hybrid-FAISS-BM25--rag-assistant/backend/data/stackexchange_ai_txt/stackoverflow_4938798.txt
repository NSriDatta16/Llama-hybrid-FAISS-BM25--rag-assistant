HTML Local Storage parameter replacement escaping

I'm experimenting with a simple HTML5 local storage based app and I'm having trouble with the parameter replacement escaping (maybe) in my code. The SQL line I want to execute is: SELECT name, title FROM testTable WHERE name LIKE '%test%'; so my Javascript line is something like: tx.executeSql( "SELECT name, title FROM testTable WHERE name LIKE '%?%'", [ search_string ], This fails (I think) because the ? is being treated as a literal and so the parser complains about too many parameters ( search_string ). I optimistically tried using ??? and ["'%", search_string, "%'"] but same result. Any suggestions - I imagine it's something really obvious so please be gentle.
