In my experience NULL is a valid value and usually means "don't know". If you don't know then it really is pointless to make up some default value for the column or to try to enforce some NOT NULL constraint. NULL just happens to be a specific case. The real challenge for NULLs is it complicate retrieval a bit. For instance you can not say WHERE column_name IN (NULL,'value1','value2'). Personally if you find lot of your columns, or certain columns contain a lot of NULLs I think you might want to revisit your data model. Maybe those null columns can be put into a child table? For example: a table with phone numbers where it's name, homephone, cellphone, faxno, worknumber, emergencynumber etc... You may only populate one or two of those and it would better normalizing it. What you need to do is step back and see how the data will be accessed. Is this a column that should have a value? Is this a column that only has a value for certain cases? Is this a column that will be queried a lot?
