In sklearn they are presented in a different way as you expected. Linear regression is without any regularization term, if you look for a regularized version as the one you showed you are looking for a Ridge with alpha = 1 . Logistic regression instead has a parameter called penalty{‘l1’, ‘l2’, ‘elasticnet’, ‘none’}, default=’l2’ that lets you choose the desired penalty. I suggest you to spend some time on sklearn documentation, it's complete and very well presented!
