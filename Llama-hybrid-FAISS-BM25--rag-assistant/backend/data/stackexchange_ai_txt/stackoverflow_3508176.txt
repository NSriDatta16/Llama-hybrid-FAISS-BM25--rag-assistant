NEVERMIND snd-maxsamp is computing the absolute value, not snd-avg . snd-avg works just fine. Here's how to squeeze a number ("FLONUM") out of it: (snd-fetch (snd-avg s (round len) (round len) OP-AVERAGE)) This produces a negative number for negative samples and a positive number for positive samples, as it should. Should this question be deleted or left as an example to others?
