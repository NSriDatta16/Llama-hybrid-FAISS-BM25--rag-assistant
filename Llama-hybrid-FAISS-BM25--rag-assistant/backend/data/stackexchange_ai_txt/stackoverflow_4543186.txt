The functions you are calling using the application object are static functions, so they aren't really referencing the application object. setOrganizationName setOrganizationDomain setApplicationName setApplicationVersion Are all static members of QCoreApplication which QApplication derives from. Using the application reference only resolves the name scoping for these functions, but the object isn't actually used.
