If you use l-1 penalty on the weight vector, it does automatic feature selection as the weights corresponding to irrelevant attributes are automatically set to zero. See this paper . The (absolute) magnitude of each non-zero weights can give an idea about the importance of the corresponding attribute. Also look at this paper which uses criteria derived from SVMs to guide the attribute selection.
