It sounds like your problem is analogous to "Predict who will win the lottery based on whether they buy a lottery ticket." Now, whether someone buys lottery tickets is a very significant predictor of whether they'll win the lottery (indeed it's basically the only predictor there is!) By buying a lottery ticket their odds of winning increase from 0% to some small chance (perhaps .001% for a small lottery). However , the fact that this predictor is very significant does not mean you can successfully predict who wins the lottery! All you've done is go from a probability of 0 to a higher, but still very low, probability. In this scenario there is no method that can fix this problem. (If you come up with a way to reliably predict lottery winners in advance, please let me know!) It is still possible that you have a predictor that predicts well even if the overall rate of successes is very low: for instance, "predict who will lose the lottery this week based on who bought a ticket." Imagine 1 million Americans (out of 300 million) buy a ticket for a particular lottery, and only one of them will win. That means that there are 1 million - 1 people who played the lottery and lost (only about .3% of the country, a low proportion). But if you divide it based on who bought a ticket, it turns into "If you bought a ticket, you have a 99.9999% chance of losing the lottery, compared to a 0% chance if you didn't buy one"- quite a good predictor! However, if that kind of predictor does exist in your data, logistic regression would certainly show a large increase in probability predicted. Therefore, it sounds like this is not the case.
