dlm package not forecasting properly with dlmModTrig

I'm having trouble forecasting a time series with a trigonometric component using dlmModTrig. So far I have: buildFun dlmInven 1 ))+dlmModPoly(order=2, dV=exp(x[2]), dW=c(exp(x[3]),exp(x[4]))) return(dlmInven) } And the convergence is 0 after I check (fit However, the predicted graph is very far off. In fact, even the smoothed portion is far off: If I do the dlmModTrig and the dlmModPoly individually. The fits are better. Any idea why this is happening?
