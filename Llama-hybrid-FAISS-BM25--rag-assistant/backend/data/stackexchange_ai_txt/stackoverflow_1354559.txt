What you're asking for is unfortunately not directly supported today. However, with Silverlight 3's release last month, you will find that there is now a FileSaveDialog. Combined with isolated storage, the FileOpenDialog, and FileSaveDialog, you do have some options for creating a system for providing files to your users, and receiving their updates. However, they'll need to initiate the open and save - the actual isolated storage file paths are pretty difficult to discover, and it isn't recommended to allow users direct access to them.
