limit regression prediction to positive (Sklearn)

I have a dependent continuous variable with range 0-100 representing restaurant health violations. Due to the nature of the variable, it does not make sense for a regression equation to predict a restaurant to score negative violations. I would like to limit the prediction interval for many different regression algorithms that I am running in scikit-learn (OLS, Lasso, Ridge, Random Forest). Other responses to this problem ( example ) state that "If your DV is never negative then you can take the log. Then the predicted values on the raw score would never be negative." I used numpy to take the log of my DV and my predictions are still returning negative (I don't know why they would be different). How can I address this issue, specifically with implementation in python?
