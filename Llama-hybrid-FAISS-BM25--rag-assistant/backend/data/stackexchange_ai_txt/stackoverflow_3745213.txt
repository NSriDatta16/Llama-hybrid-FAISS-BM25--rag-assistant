You don't say how your app stops working, but the GWT compiler generates different JS for every user agent specified in your project's gwt.xml. By default there may be 5 or 6 different versions of your program and the right one is decided in at runtime. These versions exist because there is no such thing as W3C compliance in browsers. One browser might get closer than others but all have their quirks that GWT tries to hide you from. The GWT vertical panel at your root usually gets turned into a table with each child being a cell in a row. Note you still need a root element in the XML, but it could be a flow or html panel. Changing from a vertical panel will probably cause the child elements to flow sideways or do other weird things. If you wanted them to stay vertical you could throw a between them, or style the enclosing . The best thing to do for layout issues is to install a tool into your browser which allows you to inspect the DOM. For example, Firefox has Firebug, IE has the IE Developer Toolbar, Opera has a developer console etc. You can select the errant element and see its place in the hierarchy as well as which styles apply to that element. Firebug even let you tweak styles in real time which can be handy for on the spot experimentation.
