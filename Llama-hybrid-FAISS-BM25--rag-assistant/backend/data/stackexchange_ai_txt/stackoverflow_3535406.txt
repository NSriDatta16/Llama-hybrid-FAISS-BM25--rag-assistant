It might be better to let the database sort the array upon retrieval with the users settings. I think that is almost always preferable over sorting in PHP. edit: I forgot that the array is probably stored as a single object so the database just handles it as an object and not an array. To still enable serverside (database server) sorting, arrays could also be expressed as seperate tables: userID : index0 userID : index1 etc... but this might give too much data overhead.
