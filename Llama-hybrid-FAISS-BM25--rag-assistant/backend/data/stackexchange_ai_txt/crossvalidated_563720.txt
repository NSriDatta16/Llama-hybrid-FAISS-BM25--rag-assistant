Can there be such things like supervised learning in bayesian approach?

Whenever I encounter articles on supervised learning examples are things like regression, classification, object detection, which are obviously ones following frequentist approach. I've recently studied generative models, which are basically Bayesian approach since it learns whole distribution, not just a parameter, and found some explanation saying that generative models can be trained using supervised learning (i.e, using labels) Is supervised learning just the concept about the methodology, in which labels are used or not? Are the common examples suggested above just for ease of understanding, but not the concept itself?
