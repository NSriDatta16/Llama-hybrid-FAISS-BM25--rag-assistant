Clustering data with mixed attributes: timeseries and constants?

I have a data set of time series, and each time series has a set of attributes. I know I can cluster time series using dynamic time warping and k-means ( https://github.com/alexminnaar/time-series-classification-and-clustering ), but how can I introduce attributes for each time series that can be clustered on? Each time series would have, say, five attributes that are not time series (i.e. a single attribute for the whole time series). For example, say you have a large group of people and a time series showing their heart rate throughout the day. And then you have demographic information on each person. How can you cluster people based on the time series AND the demographic information?
