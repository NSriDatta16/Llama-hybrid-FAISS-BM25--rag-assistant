I would consider a fractional logit model, which can be implemented as a GLM with binomial family, a logit link, and heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors. This can accommodate 0s and 1s if those occur through the same process as the intermediate proportions. However, that sounds like that is not the case, so you might consider a zero-one inflated beta regression. This is essentially a maximum likelihood estimator with a a logistic regression model for whether or not the proportion equals 0, a logistic regression model for whether or not the proportion equals 1, a beta model for the proportions between 0 and 1. Another option is to transform your outcome, nudging your 0s and 1s toward the middle and to use beta regression. Smithson and Verkuilen (2006) propose using $$pâ€™ = \frac{p \cdot (N - 1) + 0.5}{N}$$
