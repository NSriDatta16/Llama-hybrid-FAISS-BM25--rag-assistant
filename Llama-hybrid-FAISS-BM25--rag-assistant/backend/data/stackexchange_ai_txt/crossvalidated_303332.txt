You dont need to do anything special to work with multiclass problem in LibSVM. Just give the proper label to each instance (1, 2, ..., n). Internally, LibSVM will perform a "one against one" problem for each two class. It means that for each two class, an SVM will be trained. The probs matrix for any new prediction will be of size M = (N (N-1)) / 2, e.g, if you have 7 classes N=7, M = 21 SVM models will be created. Please, keep in mind that Libsvm won't respect the order of your class labels, i.e, the order of the probs matrix comparison depends on the appearance order of your class labels during the training: "Internally class labels are ordered by their first occurrence in the training set. For a k-class data, internally labels are 0, ..., k-1, and each two-class SVM considers pair (i, j) with i http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/faq.html#f430 ======================================================================== In any case, check all the official responses http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/faq
