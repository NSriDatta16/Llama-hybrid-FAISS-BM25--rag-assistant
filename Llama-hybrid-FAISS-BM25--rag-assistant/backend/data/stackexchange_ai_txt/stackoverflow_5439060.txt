Is there some nice description about language features?

I was wondering if there are some nice overviews of the majority language features existing in the current programming languages? I am asking this because when looking at the programming features of some programming languages, such as D Language Feature Comparison Table , I feel like to understand how these features are related to and different from each other, in somehow organized and systematic way instead of a list, and also possibly with examples from specific languages but independent of a specific language. Thanks for your reply and any nice reference (book or link) are also appreciated. Added: I am looking for some short and concise overview, maybe just a reply is enough, not necessarily a monograph (but don't mind if you recommend it here). Details can be pursued if I feel necessary.
