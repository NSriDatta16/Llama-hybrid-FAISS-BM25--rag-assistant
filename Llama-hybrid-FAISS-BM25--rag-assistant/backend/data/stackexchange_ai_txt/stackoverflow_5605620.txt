OpenMP dynamic loop decomposition in chunks

I am using OpenMP to go through a large loop in parallel. Let's say the array I'm working on has N entries in total. I would like one thread to do the first N/2 entries and the other thread the last N/2. I have to avoid that the threads work on entries that are next to each other. The size N is always much bigger than the number of threads, so I don't need to worry about locks if I can get OpenMP to distribute the work the way I outlined above. If the size N is known at compiletime, I can use #pragma omp parallel for schedule(static,N/2) . Unfortunately it isn't. So, how do I define the chunk size dynamically?
