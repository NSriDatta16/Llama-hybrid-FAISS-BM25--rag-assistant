Any AS3 library needs to be compiled with standard mode instead of strict mode?

I see a lot of AS3 libraries are written in strict mode compile fashion. They are all very Java like. I haven't seen any libraries that requires compilation in normal mode. More functional programming like, and probably use a lot of prototype and scoping magic, since ActionScript 3 can be very much JavaScript like if used normal mode compilation. In many cases, functional style programming can be more powerful IF used correctly, and thus produce more elegant code. My question is that is there any library in AS3 that dares to for go the bondage of strict mode, and uses normal mode?
