change the numbers in the 1st column

I know sed or awk can tackle this kind of problem more elegantly perhaps. But I went the python way, so the problem is that I would like to renumber the first column of my data file from 1 to #of lines in the file. Is that a good idea to read the file by readlines? For small files perhaps, but large files not I suppose. So here is what I came up as a first attempt, any comments are appreciated. #!/usr/bin/env python import sys try: infilename = sys.argv[1]; outfilename = sys.argv[2]; except: print "Usage is inFile outFile" ifile = open(infilename,'r') ofile = open(outfilename, 'w') lines = ifile.readlines(); i=1 for line in lines: list = line.split(); list[0] = i i += 1 for val in list: ofile.write("%d " % int(val)) ofile.write('\n') del list ifile.close() ofile.close()
