For base ClearCase dynamic views, the only side-effect you can have when recycling a config spec are private files: Those are store within the dynamic view storage, and not always removed when the config spec is reset. You also need to make sure no files were left checked-out: they also are stored in the view storage, and once the config spec has changed, they may not be visible/reachable any more (but you should still be able to unco them through the 'find co' GUI). You cannot rename (change the tag) of a view (dynamic or snapshot) And, just to be complete, you cannot recycle the config spec of an UCM dynamic view (which reference a stream). You can try to change the foundation baselines of said stream, but again, that is not always possible.
