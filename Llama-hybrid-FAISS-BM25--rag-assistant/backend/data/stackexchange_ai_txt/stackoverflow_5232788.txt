With the module called Organic Group (usually called OG) you can create wiki pages. http://drupal.org/project/og OG is creating the notion of group post which can be standard group post (only the author can edit a page) or the wiki group post (every member of the group can edit the page). Otherwise Drupal is able to use revisions, you can use that to allow your users to edit the content.
