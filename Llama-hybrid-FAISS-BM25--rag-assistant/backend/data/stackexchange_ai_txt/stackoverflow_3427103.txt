get_defined_functions() gives an array listing all functions (user-defined and built-in) that are available to your code, but doesn't tell you whether they are actually used or not. EDIT There are also "Code Coverage" tools including features in PHPUnit and XDebug that can provide this information based on actual execution of the code
