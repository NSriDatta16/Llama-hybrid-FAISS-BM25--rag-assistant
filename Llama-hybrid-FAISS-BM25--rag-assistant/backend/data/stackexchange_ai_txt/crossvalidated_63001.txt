As numerous comments have shown, we are having a hard time understanding what you want here, but it seems to me that Your variables have different units of measurement, so even in principle it makes no sense to ask whether their distributions are the same or different, except in a very loose sense that they might have similar shape (skewness, kurtosis, etc.). Neither variable as presented is categorical. Deep down there is a categorical variable, bruxism attack or not, but that does not affect analysis of the data. You have measured rates that could be fractional. That rules out chi-square testing absolutely, quite apart from the point above. Two simple analyses show that your variables are related, a scatter plot of one against the other and a line plot of both against time. The first suggests a simple correlation or regression. It's possible that looking at logarithmic scales would help. Presumably these are just an illustrative example and you have much more data. If there were zeros in other data, logarithmic scale would be more problematic. (LATER) Your situation is now clearer. I still advise against talking about this as a problem in comparing distributions. It is not what you are seeking and the terminology is just confusing even to statistically-minded people, as this thread and its predecessor show amply. There are at least three aspects to an analysis in addition to points stressed earlier. You have several patients. At some point a serious analysis would have to look at variations between patients as well as means. You can plot your data as time series. I note that in each case the highest mean is immediately before treatment starts. Is this important? Is it suggestive, e.g. that patients are more stressed in anticipation of treatment? Once treatment starts, there seems to be an initial effect which then fades away and fluctuations return. The analysis closest to your focus on parallel lines (or not) is, as already stated, some kind of correlation or regression, but the time series structure would be ignored by such a correlation or regression. In examining e.g. proportionality there is a question of which variable, if any, is to be regarded as response (outcome, dependent variable).
