Yes, of course! You can use the shipment API, to which you can connect using both SOAP and XML-RPC. The call that will be of most interest to you is shipment.create . Here's the sample code from magento's site [php]: $proxy = new SoapClient('http://magentohost/api/soap/?wsdl'); $sessionId = $proxy->login('apiUser', 'apiKey'); $notShipedOrderId = '100000003'; // Create new shipment $newShipmentId = $proxy->call( $sessionId, 'sales_order_shipment.create', array( $notShipedOrderId, array(), 'Shipment Created', true, true ) ); And here are the comments: sales_order_shipment.create Create new shipment for order Return: string - shipment increment id Arguments: string orderIncrementId - order increment id array itemsQty - items qty to ship as associative array (order_item_id â‡’ qty) string comment - shipment comment (optional) boolean email - send e-mail flag (optional) boolean includeComment - include comment in e-mail flag (optional) I can also provide some source code in C# if you will find it helpful...
