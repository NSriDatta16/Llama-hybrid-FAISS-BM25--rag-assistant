Images in load balanced environment

I have a load balanced enviorment with over 10 web servers running IIS. All websites are accessing a single file storage that hosts all the pictures. We currently have 200GB of pictures - we store them in directories of 1000 images per directory. Right now all the images are in a single storage device (RAID 10) connected to a single server that serves as the file server. All web servers are connected to the file server on the same LAN. I am looking to improve the architecture so that we would have no single point of failure. I am considering two alternatives: Replicate the file storage to all of the webservers so that they all access the data locally replicate the file storage to another storage so if something happens to the current storage we would be able to switch to it. Obviously the main operations done on the file storage are read, but there are also a lot of write operations. What do you think is the preferred method? Any other idea? I am currently ruling out use of CDN as it will require an architecture change on the application which we cannot make right now.
