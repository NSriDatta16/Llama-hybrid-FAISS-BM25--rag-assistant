JSF 2.0 Validation messages from database

I am using a database to hold all text values of my web pages so i can switch between different languages. I added JSF 2.0 to my project but failed when i tried to get the validation messages from my database too. Is there a way to write my own validation-messagesource which retrieves the messages from a database? I'd really appreciate any help! Thank you all in advance, best regards, Robert
