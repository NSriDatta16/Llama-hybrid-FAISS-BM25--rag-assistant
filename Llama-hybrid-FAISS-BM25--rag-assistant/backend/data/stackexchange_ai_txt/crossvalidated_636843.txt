How would you argue against the bold statement that stationary is needed for sensible predictions

We talked about a (time series) process generating observations. Somebody gave the bold statement: "Regression or predictions for general processes only make sense (generalize well) when the process is stationary". What methods are there to predict/regress on non-stationary processes? I was thinking about other co-integration, but maybe you have more better arguments.
