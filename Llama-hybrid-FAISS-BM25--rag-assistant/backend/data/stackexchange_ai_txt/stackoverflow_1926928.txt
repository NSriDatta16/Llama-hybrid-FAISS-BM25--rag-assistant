Sounds like you suffer from fragmentation. Do you have lots of updates without running vacuum? Do you update indexed columns so HOT-updates are not used? What's the output of select relpages, reltuples from pg_class where relname='nodelink' . That'll show you how many disk pages your tuples are stored on. @Pavel: PostgreSQL certainly is more flexible wrt. indexes, but an index will not help in this case, since he's selecting everything in the table. Many of the tables have hundreds of thousands of rows, so I need to keep performance in mind. These are not particularly large tables ... Is this what I can expect from PostgreSQL, or is there something I can do to make it better? ... so there's probably something else you're doing wrong.
