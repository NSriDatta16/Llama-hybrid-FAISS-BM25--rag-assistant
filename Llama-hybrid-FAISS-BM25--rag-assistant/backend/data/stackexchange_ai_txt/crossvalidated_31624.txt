Cross validation and prediction for unknown data

How do we build a model, cross validate it and use it to predict for unknown data? Say I have a known dataset of 100 points. Steps for 10 fold cross-validation are- Divide the data randomly into training and test datasets in a ratio of 90:10 Make a model on the training dataset (90 points). (I used libSVM grid.py to optimize C and gamma ) Test the optimized model on the test dataset (10 points) and calculate the error. Repeat steps (1,2,3) 10 times for 10-fold cross validation. Average the error from each repeat to get the average error. Now, after repeating the steps 10 times, I will have 10 different optimized models. To predict for an unknown dataset (200 points), should I use the model which gave me minimum error OR should I do step 2 once again on the full data (run grid.py on full data) and use it as model for prediction of unknowns? Also I would like to know, is the procedure same for other machine-learning methods (like ANN, Random Forest, etc.)
