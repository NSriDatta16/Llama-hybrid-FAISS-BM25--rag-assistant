It sounds as if you're not using MVC with MasterPages (which has a built in method for including such a JavaScript). If you're using web forms, you can put a Literal in the head of your document and assign its text value from the code behind: ... string adminScriptText = "some javascript to format for admins"; string userScriptText = "some javascript to format for knuckledraggers"; this.myTinyMCEScript.Text = (myUserRole == "admin") ? adminScriptText : userScriptText Not terribly elegant, but effective. Edit: To use a file: string adminScript = " "; string userScript = " "; Since you want to store it in a file, and javascript is run in plain text at the browser, you might as well just stick it in a js file and include that js file.
