To me, linebreaks should only be used inside paragraphs to indicate a new line. Adding line-breaks between paragraphs was used back in the day, when HTML looked like Chop Suey and the semantics of the HTML document looked like someone from preschool used Dreamweaver. I personally rely on margins and padding for content separation, if I have to use a it means I've done something wrong. I think lines of an address are a perfect example of proper usage and I would stick to only those scenarios.
