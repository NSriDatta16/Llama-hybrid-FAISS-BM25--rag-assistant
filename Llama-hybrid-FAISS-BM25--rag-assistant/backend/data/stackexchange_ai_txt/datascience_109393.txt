The main difference between the two models is that the first one is a general BERT model without a specific head that simply returns the raw hidden states of the model, whereas the second one has an architecture with a language modelling head on top. You can find some more info in the huggingface documentation, compare for example the explanation of the BertModel versus the BertLMHeadModel .
