Predict best action sequence for dataset of debt observations

I need some suggestions of general predicting practice in the following case: I have a dataset of debt observations; there are ~8 variables defining each debtor situation (debt details and person details), quantitative and qualitative. The Debt Management applied for each person a sequence of actions (there are a few types of actions, each of different cost and different average effectiveness). The results I have in use consist of 2-elem vector: [agreement, success_in_court] agreement is of 1/0 value, stands for reaching an agreement with debtor or not success_in_court is of 1/0 value, stands for reaching success in court in case this action (to sue a debtor) was applied by the Debt Management Logically, no more than one element of a "response vector" may be of value 1. The point is to predict the most profitable sequence of action for future debtors. What methods should I use? It sould be implemented in R .
