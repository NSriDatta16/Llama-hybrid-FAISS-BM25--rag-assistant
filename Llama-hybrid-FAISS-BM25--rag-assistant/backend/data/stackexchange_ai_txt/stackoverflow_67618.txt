in theory an associative container (set, multiset, map, multimap) should be your best solution. In practice it depends by the average number of the elements you are putting in. for less than 100 elements a vector is probably the best solution due to: - avoiding continuous allocation-deallocation - cache friendly due to data locality these advantages probably will outperform nevertheless continuous sorting. Obviously it also depends on how many insertion-deletation you have to do. Are you going to do per-frame insertion/deletation? More generally: are you talking about a performance-critical application? remember to not prematurely optimize...
