Should I trust Dickey–Fuller test?

I have a time series of Micex Index volatility and cannot define whether it is stationary or not. On the one hand, Dickey–Fuller test, performed in Python ( statsmodels adfuller ) gives me a p-value of 0.000003 which is really small. On the other hand, the autocorrelation plot is not random and variance seems to change over time. I would like to use this series to forecast another stationary process. Should I differentiate this series to make it more stationary, or not?
