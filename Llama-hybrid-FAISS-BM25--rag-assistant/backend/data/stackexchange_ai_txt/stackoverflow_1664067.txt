I got it to work by using aliases for the column names and using a result transformer. It's not ideal since it ignores my mapping and requires setting an alias for each column. But it works for now. public class SqlRepository { ... public IList ListEmployees() { using (ISession session = _sessionBuilder.GetSession()) { return session .CreateSQLQuery(@" SELECT No_ AS EmployeeNumber, [E-mail Login] AS Username FROM Employees") .AddScalar("EmployeeNumber", NHibernateUtil.String) .AddScalar("Username", NHibernateUtil.String) .SetResultTransformer(Transformers.AliasToBean ()) .List (); } } } Any better solutions? Could there be a bug in (Fluent) NHibernate causing the original issue?
