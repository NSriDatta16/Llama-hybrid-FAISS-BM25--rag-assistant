MFC has been updated with every release of Visual Studio. It just isn't the headline feature item. As for new development, yes. It is still used and will continue to be so (even though I, like you, prefer not to). Many organizations made the technology decision years ago and have no reason to change. I do think you are talking about well-established shops though, folks with more interest in maintaining / enhancing what has been written rather than stay on the cutting edge.
