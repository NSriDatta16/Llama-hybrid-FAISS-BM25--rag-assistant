Bayesian Linear Regression - Creating a distribution for a new prediction

I'm using MCMC to fit a linear regression model with the end goal of making predictions for new observations. See reproducible example below: library(ggplot2) library(MCMCpack) library(dplyr) data(mpg) attach(mpg) # Variance of hwy for each trans category # Some categories e.g. auto(s5) have a bigger variance # How can I make the distribution for a new prediction reflect this? vars % group_by(trans) %>% summarise(hwy_var=var(hwy)) %>% ungroup() # Fit model bm What I want to capture in predicting hwy for the new_obs is a predictive distribution, taking into account its predictor values. For example, auto(l6) is a category with a larger hwy variance (as seen in vars ) so I'd like the predictive distribution for this point to be wider. Is this possible with Bayesian statistics? Or any other method?
