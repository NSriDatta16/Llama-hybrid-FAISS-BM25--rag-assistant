Git can obviously work with a project as big as yours since, as you pointed, Linux kernel alone is bigger. The challenge (don't know if you manage big files) with Mercurial and Git is that they can't manage big files (so far). I've experience moving a project your size (and around for 15 years too) from CVS/SVN (a mix of the two actually) into Plastic SCM for distributed and centralized (the two workflows happening inside the same organization at the same time) development. The move will never be seamless since it's not only a tech problem but involves a lot of people (a project as big as yours probably involves several hundreds of developers, doesn't it?), but there are importers to automate migration and training can be done very fast too.
