First, if there exists a decent predictive linear model to be found among your variables, then it's unsurprising one model could do about as well as model averaging or boosting. This seems to be the case for your data. Next, if predictors in your dataset don't have too many large correlations among one another, stepwise regression has a high chance of finding a close-to-best predictive model. (You shouldn't trust the p-values for hypothesis testing etc., but for pure prediction it may be fine.) In the correlation matrix you posted, it seems you have mostly small correlations, so it's unsurprising that a stepwise model's performance would be about as good as any other. Finally, cross-validation isn't ideal for model selection if you use a large training:testing ratio, as with 10-fold. If you really want to be sure you chose the "best" model, you'd have to train on smaller splits and test on larger ones, so that the difference between the best and near-best models' performances is measured more precisely. With 10-fold CV, it's unsurprising that all "decent" models show similar estimated performance. In short, I see nothing wrong with stepwise doing about as well as model averaging or boosting in your case.
