Can you apply PCA to part of your dataset?

I am working with kaggle dataset that has over 130 features composed of 116 categorical and 14 continuous features. I plotted the heatmap for the 14 continuous variables and found that most of them are weakly correlated with the response variable but highly correlated with each other. I am trying to apply PCA to this part of the data and glue them back together as columns with the categorical variables. Is it ok to do so? Or should I one-hot-encoding / label encoding the categorical variables and do pca to the entire dataset?
