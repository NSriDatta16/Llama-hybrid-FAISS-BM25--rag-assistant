AS3 - Searching An Array for the items that contains a particular word when each item is a paragraph long

bit new to AS3 so forgive me if this is a bit of a straight forward question. Ive created an array, and each item in the array is a description of something, about 20 words long, I want to search the array, and return each item that contains a particular word. All the other tutorials Ive found are based on looping through to search for an exact match. Thanks!
