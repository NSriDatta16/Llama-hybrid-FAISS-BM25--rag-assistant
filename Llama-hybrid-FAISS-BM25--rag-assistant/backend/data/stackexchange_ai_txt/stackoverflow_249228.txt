I like using separate domains, but there could be no site there now, or just xml schemas and later on could be a combination of docs and schemas. You probably should NOT include any part of the organisation's structure in either the domain name or URL path, those things change, so try to design it for the longer term. Finally there is the inevitable versioning question for which dates (yyyy, yyyy-mm, yyyy-mm-dd) or vN are both fine. You should consider whether you want to have a 'symbolic' url for the latest version, and specific dates for particular releases. You can use HTTP redirects from the latest to the particular so that clients can tell what you are doing.
