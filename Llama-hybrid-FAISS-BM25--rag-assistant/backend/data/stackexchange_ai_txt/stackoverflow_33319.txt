The particular bank I was interested in is Bank of America. I have confirmed that if I only clear my cookies or my LSOs, the site does not require me to re-enter info. If, however, I clear both, I had to go through additional authentication. Thus, that appears to be the answer in my particular case! But thank you all for the heads-up regarding other banks, and possibilities such as including the User-Agent string.
