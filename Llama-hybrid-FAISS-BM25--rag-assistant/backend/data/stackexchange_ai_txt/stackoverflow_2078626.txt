What's the easiest way to exchange row HTML in table via jQuery (not drag and drop)

What's the easiest way in jQuery to take the entire html for a (including the tr itself, not tr innerhtml) and swap it with another one? I'm messing around with replaceWith, but that's swapping the innerHtml and I want to swap the whole TR html. seems like it should be an easy task for jquery. I'm thinking there's gotta be a way to reference the TRs by index and as easy as: temp = table.children[4]; table.children[4] = table.children[7] table.children[7] = temp; of course that's pseudocode, but I'm looking for something as easy as that in jQuery...
