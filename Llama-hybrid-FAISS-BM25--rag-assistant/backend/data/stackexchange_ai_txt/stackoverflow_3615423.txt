After much research (see: cursing) I've found that external.php and blog_external.php do what I want though not quite as elegantly as I would like. So if you want to incorporate forum threads into your web page then external.php is what you need. It appears to be a bit more customizable in that you can have it output in JavaScript, XML, RSS, and RSS Enclosure (podcasting). If you want to incorporate blog posts you appear to be limited to RSS only. Like I said, less than ideal but at least its something.
