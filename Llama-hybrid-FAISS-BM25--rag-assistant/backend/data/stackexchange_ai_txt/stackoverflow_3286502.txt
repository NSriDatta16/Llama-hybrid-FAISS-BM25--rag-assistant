Well, in your code sample: var Result = from(obj1) .as("x") .where("x.id=5") .groupby("x.status") .having(count("x.status") > 5) .select("x.status"); The only problem I see (other than select used as an identifier) is that you embed a predicate as a function argument. You'd have to make it a function instead: .having(function(x){ return x.status > 5; }) JavaScript has closures and dynamic typing, so you can do some really nifty and elegant things in it. Just letting you know.
