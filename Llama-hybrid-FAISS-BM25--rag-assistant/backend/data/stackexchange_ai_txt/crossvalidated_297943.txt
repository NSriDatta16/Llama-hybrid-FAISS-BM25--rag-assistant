Don't forget, there is a vast field of research that use LMs, GLM, multilevel modelling. Lately Bayesian techniques and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo(the STAN community is really at the forefront of this) have come of age and a number of problems that are solved by STAN really easily and don't really need NNs or deep nets. Social Science research, Microeconomics are two(large) examples of such fields adopting Stan rapidly. Stan models are very "readable". The coefficients actually have a posterior distributional interpretation and so do the predictions. The priors are part of the data generating process and don't need to be conjugate to be performant(like gibbs). The model fitting in stan is a delight, it actually tunes the pesky MCMC params automatically pretty darn well and warns you when the exploration is stuck with really nice visualizations. If you haven't tried it already see awesome stan demos here ). At the end of the day I think people don't talk about this stuff so much because the research in this field and the problems are not so "sexy"/"cool" as with NNs.
