To answer your first question: Yes, the unconditional growth model should offer a better fit than the unconditional means model, and if not, one should not proceed with further analyses. Here is why. A multilevel model tests two types of variance: between- and within-person variance. The unconditional means model, in essence, exclusively tests between-person variance. Each person has a person-centered mean : in your case, it's the average of the participant's drug use across all three time points (let's assume it's three for the time being for explanatory purposes). For instance, if participant 1 used drugs nine times at time point 1 (T1), 12 at time point 2 (T2), and six at time point 3 (T3), her person-centered mean would be 9 (the average of nine, 12, and six). Now let's say participant 2 had a score of 12 at T1, six at T2, and three at T3. His person-centered mean would be 7 (the average of 12, six, and three). Person-centered means are calculated like so for all participants. The only purpose of the unconditional means model is to test whether there is sufficient variance in the outcome (i.e., drugs) for participants 1-i (with i denoting the final participant). If your subjects do not vary in this regard, there is no variance to be explained, period, so further tests are useless. Now we get to the unconditional growth model. The unconditional growth model tests whether there is sufficient variability in the trajectories of change over time among subjects - that is, within-person variance . In other words, do participants 1-i show different evolutions in their attitudes towards drugs? You found that the unconditional growth model did not offer a better fit than the unconditional means model. Thus, a model constraining each participant's scores to be equal to his or her person-centered mean did not fit more poorly than a model allowing them to differ. Going back to our example, for Participant 1, the deviation of her T1 score (9) from her person-centered mean (9) was 0. At T2, that deviation would be -3 (9-12); at T3, 3 (9-6). If the unconditional growth model does not explain additional variance, then these deviations are negligible, and there is no change over time to account for. Thus, Singer and Willett are correct to argue that further analyses are inappropriate because, in essence, there is nothing else to analyze. To answer your second question, two time points are insufficient for a longitudinal analysis. There is only one difference score, and therefore true change cannot be distinguished from measurement error.
