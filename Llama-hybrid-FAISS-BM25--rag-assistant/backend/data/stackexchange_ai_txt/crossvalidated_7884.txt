Fast ways in R to get the first row of a data frame grouped by an identifier

Sometimes I need to get only the first row of a data set grouped by an identifier, as when retrieving age and gender when there are multiple observations per individual. What's a fast (or the fastest) way to do this in R? I used aggregate() below and suspect there are better ways. Before posting this question I searched a bit on google, found and tried ddply, and was surprised that it was extremely slow and gave me memory errors on my dataset (400,000 rows x 16 cols, 7,000 unique IDs), whereas the aggregate() version was reasonably fast. (dx UPDATE: See Chase's answer and Matt Parker's comment for what I consider to be the most elegant approach. See @Matthew Dowle's answer for the fastest solution which uses the data.table package.
