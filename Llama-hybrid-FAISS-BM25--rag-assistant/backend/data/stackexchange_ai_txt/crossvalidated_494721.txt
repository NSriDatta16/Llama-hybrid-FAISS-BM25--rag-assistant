PCA should only be applied to continuous variables, as it decomposes their variance-covariance structure. These measures (variance and covariance) are not defined for binary or other categorical variables. After converting categorical variables (binary or not) to dummy variables, it becomes possible mathematically to calculate (co)variances and execute PCA. Yet this is meaningless, since 1) The 0-1 coding convention is arbitrary, and so are their resulting (co)variances 2) Dummy variables of categorical variables with more than two levels are negatively correlated by design, which distorts the variance-covariance matrix 3) It implicitly assumes the dummies are continuous. In your case I would recommend limiting the variance reduction to the binary variables only, and e.g perform correspondence analysis.
