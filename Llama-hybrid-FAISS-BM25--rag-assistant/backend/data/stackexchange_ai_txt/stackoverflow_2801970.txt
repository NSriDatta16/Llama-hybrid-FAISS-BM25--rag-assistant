Replacing strings with regex in JavaScript

A particular regular expression is bugging me right now. I simply want to replace the range=100 in a string like var string = '...commonstringblabla &range=100& stringandsoon...'; with ...commonstringblabla &range=400& stringandsoon... I successfully matched the "range=100"-part with alert( string.match(/range=100/) ); But when I try to replace it, string.replace(/range=100/, 'range=400'); nothing happens. The string still has the range=100 in it. How can I make it work?
