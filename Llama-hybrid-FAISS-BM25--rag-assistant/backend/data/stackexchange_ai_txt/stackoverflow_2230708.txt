Symfony: Write Content to Head

Is there a reasonably elegant means of writing a simple block of JS to the head of a Symfony layout? I have a Page module whose showSuccess template is aware of how many widgets it has to display. I need to communicate that number to an external JS file included via use_javascript() . The only way I know to do it with any simplicity is to set a global JS variable in the rendered content that can be read by the external source file. I've used the same technique for other path values that are knowable by the layout, but in this case only the page itself knows that value. I can't find a way to write a simple line of JS to the head. I've tried this: var c_widgets = Unfortunately, it writes directly to the page content and I'd like to avoid doing that. I can do this quite easily with CakePHP and Rails, but I haven't been able to find an analogous solution for Symfony. UPDATE In accordance with TheGrandWazoo's answer below, here's what I finally did: # showSuccess.php var c_widgets = # layout.php So far it's working beautifully.
