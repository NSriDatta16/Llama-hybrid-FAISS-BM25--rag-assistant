I've tried Zend_Mail for IMAP and have some highs and lows. I could connect and read, move emails but it is quite buggy. You can check for subject or sender, parse headers, reach attachment by parsing different parts. Zend_Mail_Protocol_Imap is not using any of the PHP imap/ext function. ( Why? ) Reading folders with thousands of emails is slow. The internal order of a folder is not actually chronological, which is so strange. Probably depends on how the storage was implemented (I parsed a google.pro account). Sometimes the connection closes unexpectedly and debugging it is quite heavy. There is also a Pear_IMAPv2 , which is beta and I could not even succeed in installing. The alternative will be to install imap/ext and do everything by yourself. Good luck.
