Problem linking when using stl in VS2005

I just added STL usage to some code, and I'm getting this link error: error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol "public: __thiscall std::_Lockit::~_Lockit(void)" I must be missing something in the link, I've done this before - and googling has not helped so far. hmm...... Here's the code snippet: #pragma once #include "Observer.h" #include class NGE_Observable { public: Observable(void); virtual ~Observable(void); void RegisterObserver(Observer *pObserver, void *user); void UnRegisterObserver(Observer *pObserver); void NotifyObservers(); private: std::list observers; }; Answered!: Operator error - duh. I had set the project properties to ignore all default libraries, so the stl library was not being linked. I was confused since I only got one error message, but as I added stl calls, the link errors increased.
