Estimation issues for OLS with bounded response variable

Suppose we have a first differences regression with a bounded response variable, $$\Delta y_{i} = \beta_1 \Delta X_{i}+\Delta\epsilon_i.$$ For example, suppose $y_{it} \in [0,1]$ where $y_{it}$ could represent participation of a population on a given survey, or the pass rates of students on a standardized test in a given school $i$ for a given year $t$. $X_{it}$ is some variable that changes over time, for example if $y_{it}$ is pass rates in a given school, $X_{it}$ can be average class size. Our goal is to get a unbiased estimate for $\beta_1.$ If we estimate the above model by using OLS, the following problem could occur. For simplicity suppose we have two periods, $t =1, 2.$ Then if $y_{i1} = 1$ then $\Delta y_{i} \in [-1,0],$ whereas if $y_{i1} = 0$ then $\Delta y_{i} \in [0,1].$ Therefore if $y_{i1}$ is close to $1$, it can only increase by little. Whereas if $y_{i1}$ is close to $0$, it can increase by a lot. But realistically this can lead to biased results. This is because if the $y_{it}$ was not bounded, an increase in $X_i$ in the second period may increase $y_i$ in second period, but this is impossible in our case with bounded response when $y_{i1} = 1.$ The issue is similar if increasing $X_i$ leads to a decrease in $y_i$ when $y_{i1} = 0.$ Hence I suspect OLS might not be a appropriate estimator in this case, but under other circumstances it may work? The idea I have to fix this problem is to take into consideration in the model the following. Realistically given a low initially $y_{i1}$ (less than 0.5) it is easier to have a higher $y_{i2}$ due to change in $X_i$, then to increase $y_i$ given initially $y_{i1}$ high (more than 0.5). I am not sure how we would exactly do this, I suspect using a indicator variable might work. Would this type of approach work? Any other ideas to fix this capping issue?
