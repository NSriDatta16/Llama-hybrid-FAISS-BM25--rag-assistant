Reducing height of html document

I have this situation: I made 2 div's, both should be at the exact same spot. By JavaScript, I can activate one if I want and hide the other. That's how I did it: This works pretty well. But I noticed that the place where you would expect the second div (without the top:-100px) is used by blank space. What is the most elegant way to get rid of that space again? I don't want that my webusers think they can scroll down more but there is just white space left. Thanks for your tips! I hope my description is clear enough, it's not that easy to describe. ;)
