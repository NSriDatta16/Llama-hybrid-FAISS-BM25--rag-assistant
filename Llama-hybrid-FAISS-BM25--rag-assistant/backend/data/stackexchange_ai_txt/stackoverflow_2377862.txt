Embedding WinForms Graph in WPF Window

I've tried to embed a .NET WinForms graph (Stephan Zimmermann's Graph Display) in a WPF window, under a WindowsFormsHost (I've referenced both System.Windows.Forms and WindowsFormsIntegration). However, I can see the form panel but not the graph. I've ran the demo application on a windows form and it worked, but when I transfered the same code to the WPF window, I saw that the data is updated but not shown on the graph. Thank everyone in advance, Yaron.
