Load a div once image is loaded using jquery

On page load, my image slider takes a second or two to load, and the shading image below it appears immediately(very small file size as compared to the slider image). You can see it here: homepage I would like the shading image to load only after the slider image has completed it's load. It would be even nicer to apply a nice elegant fade in effect once the first slider image completes it load. I can't seem to figure out how to write this in jquery. Any help? Thanks!
