Sockets and COBOL

I have received a job at a hospital which still uses COBOL for all organizational work, the whole (now 20 Terabyte) database (Which was a homebrew in, guess what, COBOL) is filled with the data of every patient since the last 45 (or so) years. So that was my story. Now to my question: Currently, all sockets were (from what I've seen) implemented by COBOL programs writing their data into files. These files then were read out by C++ programs (That was an additional module added in the late 1980s) and using C++ sockets sent to the database. Now this solution has stopped working as they are moving the database from COBOL to COBOL, yes - they didn't use MySQL or so - they implemented a new database - again in COBOL. I asked the guy that worked there before me (hes around 70 now) why the hell someone would do that and he told me that he is so good at COBOL that he doesn't want to write it in any other language. So far so good now my question: How can I implement socket connections in COBOL? I need to create an interface to the external COBOL database located at, for example, 192.168.1.23:283 .
