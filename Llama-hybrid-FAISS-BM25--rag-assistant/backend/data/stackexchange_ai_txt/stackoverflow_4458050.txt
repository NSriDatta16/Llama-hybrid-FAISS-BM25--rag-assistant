A CGI program will have its environment set by the web server. HOME may or not be set depending on how your web server is set up, and if it is set it will probably point to the home directory of the user that the web server is running as, not your home directory. You can print the value of $ENV{HOME} from the CGI program, or even better, print the entire %ENV hash to see what's really happening. In my experience its better to either hardcode the full path to extra libraries or set the path externally (eg using PERL5LIB). If you're setting it from inside the program, use the "lib" pragma rather than modifying @INC directly: use lib '/home/user/www/cgi-bin/siteSpecific';
