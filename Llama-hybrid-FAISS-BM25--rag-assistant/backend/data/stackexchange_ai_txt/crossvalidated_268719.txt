Let's say you initially have $p$ features but this is too many so you want to actually fit your model on $d As for why we restrict ourselves to linear transformations of the predictors, the whole point in this use-case is computation time. If we could do fancy non-linear dimension reduction on $X$ we could probably just fit the model on all of $X$ too. So PCA sits perfectly at the intersection of fast-to-compute and effective.
