Discrete white noise

I have a binary time series $\{X(n), n= 0,1,2,\cdots\}$, $X(n)\in \{0,1\}$ that can be written as: $$X(n)=S(n)+\epsilon(n)$$ Where $S(n)$ is a random stationary binary signal and $\epsilon(n)$ is a zero-mean binary white noise process (uncorrelated with $S(n)$). My question is what is the definition of a binary (or discrete) white noise?
