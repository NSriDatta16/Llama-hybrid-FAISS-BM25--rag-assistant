I am also experiencing issues with the axis The only external plot formatting widget seems to be color . And of course, from within the (scatter) plot there is the obvious option to control things like jitter, data point shape, data point size, data point labels, and values to color by as well as add grid and regression lines. Orange was primarily developed for generating machine learning classifiers, and thus is less concerned about formatting and probably intentionally sparse. Fortunately, as it's opensource one can always fork/edit source code, or since Orange offers a python script module that allows you to feed your visual data to the the underlying python & orange plot functions.
