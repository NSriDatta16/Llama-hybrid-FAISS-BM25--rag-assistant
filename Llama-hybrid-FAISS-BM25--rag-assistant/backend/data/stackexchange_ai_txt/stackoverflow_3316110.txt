Is oscommerce outdated?

Is OSCommerce outdated? I recently started working for a web development company that uses it a lot and I noticed the code base is really messy and has a lot of older php code in there. Being used to something nice like cakePHP or drupal I wasn't too impressed with it. Is it worth using any more? Is there a decent port of OSC that is updated and easy to transfer existing stores to? bonus points if it has a plug in system that isn't a hack fest. Right now I'm looking at Zen-cart, Ubercart and Magento as alternatives. Would you recommend anything else? ThankYou
