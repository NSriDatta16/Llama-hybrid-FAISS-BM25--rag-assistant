You you use storage on the SD card like Michael Cramer stated ( Let the user know you are storing data :-) ). The data on the SD card is not deleted when the app is removed. You could on the other hand use a server which stores all the details which can be downloaded as and when required and instead of using a user name use the IMEI of the phone which is unique. That way even if the user reinstalls the OS he will still be able to refetch the settings. for getting the IMEI you may refer : How to get the device's IMEI/ESN programmatically in android?
