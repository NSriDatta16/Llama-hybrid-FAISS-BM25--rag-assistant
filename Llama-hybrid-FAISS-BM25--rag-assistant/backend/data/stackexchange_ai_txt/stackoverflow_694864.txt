Fujitsu COBOL 3.0

I'm new to Fujitsu COBOL 3.0 software. I tried executing a simple program. The code and errors are as follows. Everything in program appears to be correct. Can anyone help me out? Any prestandards are to be followed in this software? The sample cobol program is: IDENTIFICATION DIVISION. PROGRAM-ID. ShortestProgram. PROCEDURE DIVISION. DisplayPrompt. DISPLAY "I did it". STOP RUN. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ** DIAGNOSTIC MESSAGE ** (NOPRGMID) C:\FSC\PCOBOL32\samples\SAMPLE6\SAMPLE7.COB 0: JMN1102I-S IDENTIFICATION DIVISION HEADER IS MISSING.
