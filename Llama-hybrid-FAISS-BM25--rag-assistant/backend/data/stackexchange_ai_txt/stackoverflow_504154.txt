Its working for me. The HTML Inspector in Firebug 1.2.1 clearly shows the element being removed. Perhaps you're not using the latest JQuery? My test code is as follows: $(document).ready(function(){ $("p").click(function () { $("p").fadeOut("slow", function() { $(this).remove(); }); }); }); p { font-size:150%; cursor:pointer; } If you click on this paragraph you'll see it just fade away.
