It doesn’t seem like you should be restricting answers to only SPSS users as this is a broad misunderstanding of statistics and interpreting a model and not anything specific about implementing SPSS software. With that being said, it doesn’t seem like your stress variable is being treated as ordinal. An ordinal categorical factor would have orthogonal polynomial contrasts, with the number of comparisons being the number of levels of the ordinal factor minus 1. So if you have 4 levels of stress you’d have a linear, a quadratic, and a cubic comparison. But that doesn’t seem to be what’s depicted as it’s being reported as stress(1), stress(2), stress(3) which reads to me like it’s being coded as a dummy coded categorical factor which means all levels are compared to level 0, the reference level. This is probably not the right way to code this factor especially if you want to model and interpret it as ordinal. In terms of interpreting logistic regression, coefficients are reported as log odds which is borderline uninterpretable so you may want to refer to the later column with exp(B) which is the odds ratio. Also, you said there are 10 levels to your stress ordinal variable but it appears your frequencies are only 7 8 9 most. did people only respond for those 4 levels? I am guessing your current model is comparing 8 9 Most to 7 and is dummy coded
