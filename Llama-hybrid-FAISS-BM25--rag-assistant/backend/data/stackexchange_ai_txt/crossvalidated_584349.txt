Mixed model does not converge

I have a question regarding a mixed model I am using: In a study, participants have been presented with 40 different news article headlines and indicated for each headline whether they would share the headline or not (Yes coded as 1, No coded as 0). There are the two binary within-subjects factors “Accuracy” (true vs. false) and “Strategy” (attacks outgroup vs. praises ingroup). Further, there is a binary between-subjects factor “Condition” (threat vs. neutral). I wanted to run a generalized mixed model with crossed random effects for participants (id) and headlines (Headline) that includes sharing decision as a dependent variable and Accuracy, Strategy and Condition as independent variables. I have the following issue with that: When I try to use a multilevel logistic regression with the following command, I am running into convergence issues: mreg_P3_g I receive the following warning message: Warning message: In checkConv(attr(opt, "derivs"), opt $par, ctrl = control$ checkConv, : Model failed to converge with max|grad| = 0.00577471 (tol = 0.002, component 1) I have looked at some posts with similar issues but haven't encountered this warning message so far. It would be great if I could get some help with interpreting the warning message and the limitations it imposes, and perhaps some advice on how to handle the issue (I am far from an expert). Thank you so much in advance!
