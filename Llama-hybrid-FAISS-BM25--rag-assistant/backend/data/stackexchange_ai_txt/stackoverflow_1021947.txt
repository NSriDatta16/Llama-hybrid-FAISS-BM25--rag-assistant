How can I make an average of dates in MySQL?

How can I make an average between dates in MySQL? I am more interested in the time values, hours and minutes. On a table with: | date_one | datetime | | date_two | datetime | Doing a query like: SELECT AVG(date_one-date_two) FROM some_table WHERE some-restriction-applies; Edit: The AVG(date1-date2) works but I have no clue what data it is returning.
