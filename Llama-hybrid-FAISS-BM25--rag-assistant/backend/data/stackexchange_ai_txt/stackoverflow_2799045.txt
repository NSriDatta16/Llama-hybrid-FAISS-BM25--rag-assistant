(My guess is that Silverlight will be a tough port for much of the functionality due to it's 'lightweight' nature. You may want to consider using a Click-once WPF application instead of Silverlight, especially since you're already relying on a rich installed Windows application). You'll need to do something like this in the constructor for your Silverlight user control, this.Drop += new DragEventHandler(MainPage_Drop); Then add a method void MainPage_Drop(object sender, DragEventArgs e) { IDataObject drop = e.Data; if (drop.GetDataPresent(System.Windows.DataFormats.FileDrop)) { FileInfo[] files = (FileInfo[])e.Data.GetData(System.Windows.DataFormats.FileDrop); foreach (FileInfo file in files) { // do something with each file here } } } Then -- see what happens. You'll need to use a library for adding TIFF support possibly something like suggested on Stackoverflow, here .
