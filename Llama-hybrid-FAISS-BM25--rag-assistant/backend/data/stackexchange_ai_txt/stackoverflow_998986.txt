I have seen the query optimizer in MySQL do some strange things with index selection, and often the only way to find a fix was by trial and error. A couple things to try (without any guarantee that they might help): Remove one of the redundant indexes ( i_online_* ); keep the one where the first column has higher specificity (probably the one with last as the first column). Try to see whether making the last column NOT NULL makes a difference (use a minimum date instead of null ). I second Robert Munteanu's suggestion of trying to replace the now() ... expression. Try to use a variable there that you have set before. It would also help to see the entire schema of your table; maybe there are some weird side-effects to spot?
