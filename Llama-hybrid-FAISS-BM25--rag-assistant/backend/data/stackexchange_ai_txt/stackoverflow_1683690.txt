What about setting the p tag to display: inline as well? Is that an option? p { display: inline; } As for the p tag issue... I don't believe the W3C specifications allow an unordered list tag within a paragraph tag. From http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/text.html#h-9.3.1 : The P element represents a paragraph. It cannot contain block-level elements (including P itself).
