Remember to set connection encoding to utf8 as well. In ext\mysqli do $mysqli->set_charset("utf8") In ext\mysql do mysql_set_charset("utf8") With other db extensions you might have to run query like SET NAMES 'utf8' Some more details about connection encoding in MySQL As others point out, making sure your source code is utf-8 encoded also helps. Pay special attention to not having BOM (Byte Order Mark) - it would be sent to browser before any code is executed, so using headers or sessions would become impossible.
