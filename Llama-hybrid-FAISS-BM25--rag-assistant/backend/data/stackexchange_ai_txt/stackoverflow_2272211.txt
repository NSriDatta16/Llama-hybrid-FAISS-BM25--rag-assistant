Check if machine is UP/ALIVE

I want to check if a remote machine is already up (after a reboot/reimage) using C#. Right now, All I can think of is run a PING command and check if the machine will reply. Are there any elegant ways? Thanks! EDIT One of my concern is that PING usually respond ONCE the machine has started Windows. Some of the services may not have been started by then. See Anders Lindahl answer.
