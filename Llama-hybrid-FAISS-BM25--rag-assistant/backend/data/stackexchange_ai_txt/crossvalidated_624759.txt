You wrote: When using all of these variables in a multiple regression (with ridge restriction) I get many IVs with coefficient equal to zero, but I wouldn't want that. Mick Jagger et al said it best: You can't always get what you want. The fact that the ridge regression is making some coefficients 0 is telling you something. Also, the way you have your disagregated data is not the usual way. I don't know how you are reading it in, but the usual way is to have each row be a subject and each column be a variable. Also, you have multiple row 1's which can't be a good thing. Finally, I do not understand your aggregation scheme at all. You can, in some circumstances, combine variables (e.g. by adding them, or factor analysis, or PCA) but I don't know what these categories are, or how they are being used.
