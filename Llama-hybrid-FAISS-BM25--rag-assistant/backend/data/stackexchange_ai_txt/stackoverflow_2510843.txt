You've just run into the biggest problem with A*: its memory requirement is proportional to the size of the state space. You have a few options here. The first would be to change your search algorithm from A* to IDA* , and add in search enhancements like a memory cache to remember as many previously-searched node costs as possible. Another alternative is to keep A* but move to hierarchical search. This will likely require you to do some preprocessing on your image files, however. You'll find several good resources (downloadable papers) on this subject here: http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~holte/CMPUT651/readinglist.html
