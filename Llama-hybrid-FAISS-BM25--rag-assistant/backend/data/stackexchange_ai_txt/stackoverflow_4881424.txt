embedding a dynamic 3d object to your website

im sorry if i keep asking the same question but i really really need to figure this one out. the problems i currently have are: 1. a python library that will allow me to create a custom dynamic 3d model ---> i tried vpython (extremely good) but found that images I make there cannot exactly be embedded in a site a method to embed the said dynamic 3d model in a website such that said object moves in (almost) "real time" upon user input
