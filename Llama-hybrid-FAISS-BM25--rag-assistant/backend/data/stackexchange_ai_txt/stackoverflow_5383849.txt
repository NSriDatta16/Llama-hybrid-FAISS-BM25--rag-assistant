Parameterized Tests While we aren't doing buffer overrun test at my work we do have the notion of template tests. These tests are parameterized to require the specific data for the case we want to test. We then use metaprogramming to dynamically create the real tests by applying the parameters for each case to the template. This has the benefit of being deterministic, and runs as part of our automated test suite. My TDD Practice We do Acceptance Test Driven Development at my work. Most of our tests happen to be close to full stack functional tests. The reason is we found it was more valuable to test and assure the behavior of user driven actions. We use techniques like dynamic test generation from parameterized tests to provide us more coverage with a minimum of work. We do this for ASCII vs UTF8, API conventions, and well known variant tests.
