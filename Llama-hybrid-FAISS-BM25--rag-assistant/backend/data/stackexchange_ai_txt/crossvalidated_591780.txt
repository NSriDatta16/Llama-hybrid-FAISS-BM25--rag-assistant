Please help me to understand the Taylorâ€™s theorem when transiting from Gradient Boost to XGboost

I am reading this article , which explains how the algorithm replaces the actual loss function with so-called 2nd order Taylor expansion. I can understand til Step 4, and can't understand step 5. I understand this, this is from step 4: But when it is going to step 5, I can't understand it: Where does the 2 under the ''(a) come from? or How does the substitution/transformation happen?
