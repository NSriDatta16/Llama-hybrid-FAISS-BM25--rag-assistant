What can you do to a legacy codebase that will have the greatest impact on improving the quality?

As you work in a legacy codebase what will have the greatest impact over time that will improve the quality of the codebase? Remove unused code Remove duplicated code Add unit tests to improve test coverage where coverage is low Create consistent formatting across files Update 3rd party software Reduce warnings generated by static analysis tools (i.e.Findbugs) The codebase has been written by many developers with varying levels of expertise over many years, with a lot of areas untested and some untestable without spending a significant time on writing tests.
