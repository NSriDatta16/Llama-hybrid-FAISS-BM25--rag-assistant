Organizing .xhtml files in subfolders

I have a JSF 2.0 project wiht lots of .xhtml files. Due to a security filter I want to put some of the files in a /secure folder to then aply the filter on. I tried simply moving the files to a folder. But then I get an exception "/selectRole.xhtml Not Found in ExternalContext as a Resource" Do I need to add something to the faces-config or web.xml?
