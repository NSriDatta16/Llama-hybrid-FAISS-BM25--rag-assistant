What location parameter is modelled by robust regression?

There is quite some number of ways how to robustly fit a linear regression model, e.g. using M-estimation based on Tukey's biweight loss or on Huber's loss, see e.g. Wikipedia . I got two questions about the two mentioned cases: Is it correct that these are modelling the mean (more precisely the center ) of the conditional response distribution as long as the error distribution is symmetric? What location parameter are they modelling in general? Is it a specially weighted average of the response variable?
