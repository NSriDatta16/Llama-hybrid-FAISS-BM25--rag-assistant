To solve this purely with machine learning is a bad idea. The reason being this is a deterministic problem, and other forms of AI are better suited for this. But, if your only option is machine learning I would look into reinforcement learning using a least-square error Gradient to Optimize with. It is one of the easier ways to understand machine learning, and applies to your problem, since it is deterministic. If at all possible use other algorithms to supplement the machine learning.
