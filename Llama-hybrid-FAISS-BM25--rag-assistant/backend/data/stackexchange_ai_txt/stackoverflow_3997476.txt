howto spec not all models

I know rake spec:models to spec all models. Is there a way to spec only one model, or only a given collection of models? Something like this would be desirable: rake spec:model user or with a collection of models rake spec:model user role order BTW: Brian Hogan wrote created something similar ( see here ) but maybe there is something built-in in rspec2
