Although not the most rigorous statistical procedure, I would suggest using a linear regression. You can fit a linear model of the form percentage of injuries = $a$ * year + $b$ And check whether $a$ is significantly positive (or negative), in which case you can say your time series is significantly increasing (or decreasing). The linear regression itself and the significance testing of the coefficients are common statistical operations, and there are implementations available in most stats software packages (e.g. R, Matlab, etc). I would also recommend you to do some web-searching to get a bit more familiar with linear regressions and this sort of tests if you don't know about them. PS: I have to agree with Zahava Kor in the comment above -- with only three years it will be pretty hard to get a strong significance. I suspect $a$ will come out slightly positive, but perhaps not above significance threshold.
