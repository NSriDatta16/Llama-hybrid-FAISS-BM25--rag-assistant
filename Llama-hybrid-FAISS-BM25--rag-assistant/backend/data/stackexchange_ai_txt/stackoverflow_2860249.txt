Are you saying you are loading the entire database into memory and then manipulating it? If that is the case, why don't you instead simply use the database as a storage device, and do lookups and manipulation as necessary (using Hibernate if you like, or something else if you don't)? The key there is to make sure that you are using connection pooling, as that will reduce the connection time. If this is what you are doing, then you could be running into memory issues as well - first, by not caching the entire database in memory, you will reduce memory and will spread out the network load from the beginning/end to the times when it needs to happen.
