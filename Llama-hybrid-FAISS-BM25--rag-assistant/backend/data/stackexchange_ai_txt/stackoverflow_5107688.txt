The reason name is null is that it really is... null. Please refer to the Android manifest documentation: android:name The fully qualified name of an Application subclass implemented for the application. When the application process is started, this class is instantiated before any of the application's components. The subclass is optional; most applications won't need one. In the absence of a subclass, Android uses an instance of the base Application class. What you want is the name of the application, which is set in the label attribute of the application tag, and which Ragunath explained how to get.
