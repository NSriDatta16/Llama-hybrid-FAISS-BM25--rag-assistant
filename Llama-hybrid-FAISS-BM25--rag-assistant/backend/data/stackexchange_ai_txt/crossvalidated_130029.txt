Questions 1, 2 and 3 are linked. I like to think that yes, introducing a Ridge penalty in a linear regression model can be interpreted as a shrinkage on the eigen-values of $X$. In order to make this interpretation, one has first to make the assumption that $X$ is centered. This interpretation is based on the following equivalence: $$ \lambda x + y = \kappa \left( \alpha x + (1-\alpha) y\right), $$ with $\alpha=\frac{\lambda}{1+\lambda}$ and $\kappa = 1+\lambda$. If $0 \leq \lambda The technique you describe as "attack[ing] only the singular or near singular values" is also known as Singular Spectrum Analysis (for the purpose of linear regression) (see Eq. 19), if by "attacking", you mean "removing". The cross-covariance is unchanged. Removing low singular values is also done by Principal Component Regression . In PCR, a PCA is performed on $X$ and a linear regression is applied on a selection of the obtained components. The difference with SSA is that it has an impact on the cross-covariance.
