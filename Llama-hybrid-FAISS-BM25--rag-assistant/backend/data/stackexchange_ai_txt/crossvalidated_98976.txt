Comparing networks of groups of unequal size

I want to compare some network properties such as entropy, connectivity, etc., between 2 groups. I have time series fMRI data on patients (n = 80) and controls (n = 30) for certain regions of the brain. My question is how should I correctly control for age and gender within my patient group before doing any further analyses? In addition to the unbalanced exposure groups, I have 3 times more females than males. How can I best control for age and gender of the subjects? Can I take 30 patients (randomly chosen if ties exist) whose means, variances / coefficients of variation match closely with those of the group overall, so that they represent the group well?
