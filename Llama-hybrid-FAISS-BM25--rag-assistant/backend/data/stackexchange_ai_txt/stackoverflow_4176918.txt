This question does not make sense as such. XMI is a storage format for UML (and as pointed out above for any MOF-based language) models. Therefore a XMI file will contain the class diagram, sequence diagram, ... of your UML project. Therefore, any tool able to load such UML diagram will be able to show the sequence diagram contained in it. What may happen though is that the XMI file does not include the graphical layout information of your diagrams. So, you may import the model information but the tool may not display them graphically. You may need to browse the model, and one by one, take the model elements and reposition them in the canvas.
