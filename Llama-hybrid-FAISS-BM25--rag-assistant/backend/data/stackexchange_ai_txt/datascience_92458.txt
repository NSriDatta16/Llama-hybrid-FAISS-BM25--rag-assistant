It really depends on how other models behave on your particular dataset, but generally, you should check 2 things: Predictions from ensembled models are not highly correlated and other models also perform well on your dataset. It's better to use a model from another family . So if you are using XGboost, its better to add some model like SVM than a catboost (because you want a model with different approach in solving the data, rather then a model with similar approach). I think this article may give you additional insights about the topic https://machinelearningmastery.com/stacking-ensemble-machine-learning-with-python/
