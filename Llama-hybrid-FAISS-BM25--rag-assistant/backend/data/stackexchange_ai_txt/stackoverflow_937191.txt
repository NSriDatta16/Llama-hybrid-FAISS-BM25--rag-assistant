While I agree with HLGEMs first paragraph I respectfully disagree with HLGEMs second paragraph. There are quirks you need to know about of which I'm somewhat ignorant. Such as changing boolean fields to LittleInt. But otherwise it's a lot of tedious work to recreate the database schema. And it'll be error prone such as missing indexes or relationships. There is a tool from the SQL Server group which is a lot better than the Upsizing Wizard especially the Access 97 version. SQL Server Migration Assistant for Access (SSMA Access) http://www.microsoft.com/sql/solutions/migration/access/default.mspx As you discover these quirks you can change the scripts to recreate the database with the appropriate changes.
