Django database query - return the most recent three objects

This can't be hard, but... I just need to get the most recent three objects added to my database field. So, query with reverse ID ordering, maximum three objects. Been fiddling round with Records.objects.order_by(-id)[:3] Records.objects.all[:3] and including an if clause to check whether there are actually three objects: num_maps = Records.objects.count() if (num_maps > 3): # etc... and using reverse() and filter() for a while... But just can't figure it out! Nothing I do gives the right result and using num_maps feels pretty inelegant. Not getting much joy from the documentation. Can anyone help?!
