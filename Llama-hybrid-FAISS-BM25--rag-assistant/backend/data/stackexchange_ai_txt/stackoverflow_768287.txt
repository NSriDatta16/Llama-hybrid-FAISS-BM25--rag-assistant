While there are JS implementations of the MD5 algorithm, older browsers are generally unable to read files from the local filesystem . I wrote that in 2009. So what about new browsers? With a browser that supports the FileAPI , you can read the contents of a file - the user has to have selected it, either with an element or drag-and-drop. As of Jan 2013, here's how the major browsers stack up: FF 3.6 supports FileReader , FF4 supports even more file based functionality Chrome has supported the FileAPI since version 7.0.517.41 Internet Explorer 10 has partial FileAPI support Opera 11.10 has partial support for FileAPI Safari - I couldn't find a good official source for this, but this site suggests partial support from 5.1, full support for 6.0 . Another article reports some inconsistencies with the older Safari versions How? See the answer below by Benny Neugebauer which uses the MD5 function of CryptoJS
