C# - How does DataFormats.GetDataFormat work?

I am trying to figure out Drag And Drop using the features in the FluidKit. I downloaded the Demo app and both the drag and drop have this line of code in it: private static DataFormat SupportedFormat = DataFormats.GetDataFormat("FluidKit"); What is this doing? I don't see anywhere that the format that is being gotten is set. How does it know what it being gotten? Any help would be nice.
