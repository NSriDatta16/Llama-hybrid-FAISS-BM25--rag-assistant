Apparently SetMaxAttachmentSize web service was not leveraged on TFS 2010 therefore you need to do this programmatically, try running the following code: TeamFoundationServer tfs = TeamFoundationServerFactory.GetServer(@"http://yourtfsserver:8080/tfs/DefaultCollection"); ITeamFoundationRegistry rw = tfs.GetService (); RegistryEntryCollection rc = rw.ReadEntries(@"/Service/WorkItemTracking/Settings/MaxAttachmentSize"); RegistryEntry re = new RegistryEntry(@"/Service/WorkItemTracking/Settings/MaxAttachmentSize", "20971520"); //20MB if (rc.Count != 0) { re = rc.First(); re.Value = "20971520"; } rw.WriteEntries(new List () { re }); I hope it works for you Regards, Randall Rosales
