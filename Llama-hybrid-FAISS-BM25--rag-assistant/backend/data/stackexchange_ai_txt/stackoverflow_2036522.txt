What exactly to you mean when you say that the property is returning a null value? Is it actually null, or is your MessageBox simple showing empty? I quickly duplicated your code and it behaves exactly as expected - the MessageBox shows, but it is empty because the default value of the Text property of the TextBox control is an empty string. Also, the way you are approaching this is a little unusual. Firstly, the line: UserControl1 Usc = new UserControl1(); You do not generally need to instantiate a user control like this. Instead you can drag the control from the toolbox onto the design surface of your form. This will then take care of instantiating and initialising your control for you. I think that this is actually your problem - when you include the line of code above, you are creating a new instance of the user control, and this is is no way realted to the user control that you have dragged onto the designer. If you go to the designer view of your form and click on the user control, you should see a properties window somehere. If you do no, then either select it from the View menu, or press F4. In the list of properties, there should be one "Name" this is the programatic name generated for your user control. You can change this here if you want, but when you refer to this control in the rest of the form, this is what you must use. Secondly, the next two lines: string Make = Usc.rtnTxtMake; MessageBox.Show(Make) You can access the property rtnTxtMake directly. Unless you later need to access the Make string in the rest of your code, then directly accessing the property would usually be considered better style. MessageBox.Show(userControl.rtnTxtMake);
