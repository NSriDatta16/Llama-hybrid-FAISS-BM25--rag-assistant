I have been using JavaBayes with great success for my master thesis final project. Check it out under http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~javabayes/ It has a great set of examples, very decent documentation, a graphical designer and very useful API. I remember I did a little research regarding available Bayesian Networks implementations in Java and I was pleasantly surprised when I found this library. I can strongly recommend it.
