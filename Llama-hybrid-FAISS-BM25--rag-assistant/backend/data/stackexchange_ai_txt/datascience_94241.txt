It has never been tried as far as I know. And the reason is that, IMHO, it would give you inconsistent results. I am talking in particular about unwanted arithmetic properties of such vector. Do you want to represent an a , b , c vector of letters {1,2,3} knowing that a ? This makes sens with ints, not with char/tokens. The good news is you can still use 2d conv, once you assembled embedding vectors into larger phrase vectors.
