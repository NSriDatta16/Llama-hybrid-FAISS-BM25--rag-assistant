I have a ListFragment which depends on the hosting Activity to properly initialize. That may be your difficulty right there. From the stack trace I can see it isn't me trying to add the Fragment prematurely, rather Android is trying to restore the Fragment. Correct. Any ideas? I would focus on handling configuration changes properly. Between onSaveInstanceState() in the fragment and the combination of onRetainNonConfigurationInstance() , getLastNonConfigurationInstance() (both on Activity ) and onAttach() (on your Fragment ), you should be able to pass whatever stuff is in the old fragment to the new one without crashing. For configuration changes, do not rely upon "the hosting Activity to properly initialize".
