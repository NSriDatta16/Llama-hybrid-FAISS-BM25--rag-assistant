"Likert scale" has two different meanings. The more technical meaning is that it refers to a set of say 10 different questions, each measured on a five-point scale, where you sum together the answers from all of these questions. As far as I know, these are almost always analyzed by computing an average. If you mean that you have a five-point rating measuring agreement, which is commonly called a likert scale as well, then you need to split apart how you present the difference versus how you test for differences. When dealing with presentation, the norm is to either compare the averages, as you have done, or, to compute the percentgage of people who chose the two highest options on the scale (e.g., Somewhat agree + Strongly agree), and then compare these percentages. Depending on the data there can be other ways as well (e.g., just compared Strongly Disagree, or compare Strongly Agree - Strongly Disagree). In terms of testing, an ANOVA may well be fine, but it would be more orthodox to use either an ordered logit model or a nonparametric test (e.g., Mann-Whitney).
