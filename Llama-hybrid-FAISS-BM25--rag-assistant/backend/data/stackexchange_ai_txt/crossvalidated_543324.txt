Word Embeddings with nn.Embedding except glove

I'm not an expert in nlp but I know we usually use glove, word2vec or fasttext ect to get embedding vectors so what is nn.Embedding and what does it do? I mean shouldn't it be specialized for each language (dictionary of use) btw are glove and others specialized for an specific dictionary? if it is so how an general embedding (nn.Embedding) useful?
