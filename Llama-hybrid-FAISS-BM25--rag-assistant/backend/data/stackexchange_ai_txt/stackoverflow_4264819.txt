The means that you used to install the application in the first place generally gives you a way of notifying the user of the availability of an update, however with one exception they have to choose to install the update - you can't force it. If the application came from the android market, that has a scheme for checking for updates which the use will have the option of installing. If you emailed the apk to the user as an attachment, or called their attention to its availability on a website, you can do the same with the replacement. Same story if you had them install it from their PC via the sdk or "sideload wonder machine". (The only "mandatory" sort of upgrade I know of is for the mobile carrier to trigger an OTA update as is used to update the android system itself, and include a new apk as part (or all) of the payload. Even this may be able to be deferred for a while)
