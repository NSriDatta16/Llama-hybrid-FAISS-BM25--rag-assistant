Should I use LingPipe or NLTK for extracting names and places?

I'm looking to extract names and places from very short bursts of text example "cardinals vs jays in toronto" " Daniel Nestor and Nenad Zimonjic play Jonas Bjorkman w/ Kevin Ullyett, paris time to be announced" "jenson button - pole position, brawn-mercedes - monaco". This data is currently in a MySQL database, and I (pretty much) have a separate record for each athlete, though names are sometimes spelled wrong, etc. I would like to extract the athletes and locations. I usually work in PHP, but haven't been able to find a library for entity extraction (and I may want to get deeper into some NLP and ML in the future). From what I've found, LingPipe and NLTK seem to be the most recommended, but I can't figure out if either will really suit my purpose, or if something else would be better. I haven't programmed in either Java or Python, so before I start learning new languages, I'm hoping to get some advice on what route I should follow, or other recommendations.
