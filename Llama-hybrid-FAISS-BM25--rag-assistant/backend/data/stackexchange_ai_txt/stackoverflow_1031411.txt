New functional languages

Functional programming has been around since at least 1958 (creation of Lisp), but is experiencing a renaissance now with old functional languages being dusted off and new functional languages being created. Which functional languages are there that are newly developed or are in the making? I realize that you can write purely functional programs in most high level languages, so with functional languages I imply languages that are specifically designed for functional programming such as F#. If you have links to tutorials, wikis or code examples I encourage you to add them to your answer!
