Implementing a model for a language to another

I have a dataset of sentences of language X and Y (2 columns, for example, "abc def lang" ==> "xyz pqrt mno uages"). I want to have a output as a table that translates word by word (abc => xyz, def => pqrt mno, lang => uages). I think we should use deep learning but idk how to implement and what to use. Can you give me some ideas? Thanks all
