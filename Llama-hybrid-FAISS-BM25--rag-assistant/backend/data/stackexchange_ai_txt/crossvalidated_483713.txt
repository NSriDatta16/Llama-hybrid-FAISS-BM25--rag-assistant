How does scaled conjugate gradient work in neural network training? Comparison with gradient descent

I am very new and beginner in the machine learning world, and I would like to ask if someone could simply explain to me how does the scaled conjugate gradient method work in neural network training ? Especially in comparison with the gradient descent method, because I already understand that one. I know exactly the steps on how to train a neural network with gradient descent, but in relation to scaled gradient I can only find far too advanced explanations that I can't yet understand.
