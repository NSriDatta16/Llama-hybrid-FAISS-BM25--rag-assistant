When you add a bit column to your table it will occupy a whole byte in each record, not just a single bit. When you add a second bit column it will be stored in the same byte. The ninth bit column will require a second byte of storage. Tables with 1 bit column will not gain any storage benefit. Tinyint and bit can both be made to work, I have used both successfully and have no strong preference.
