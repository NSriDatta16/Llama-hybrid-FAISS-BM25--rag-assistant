First bit of advice, take your time! Sounds like you have quite a large project ahead of you, and it definitely takes a lot of time to do it right. You'll need to do some research to find out what exactly your users are looking for from your site, and how you will provide it to them. Analyze your current traffic to see what is most popular, and reach out to some of your customers to see what they feel is missing. You'll need to organize everything your site will have into a small set of sections, which will be your main areas of the site. Then you can break those down further from there. You don't want to go too deep so everything is accessible within a few clicks. But you don't want to have 20 links on your homepage either. Get some input from users outside your business to tell you what is important to them and what should be most accessible. It's hard sometimes to view your company from the outside looking in. You may be well off hiring a consultant to at least help you get started to give you a fresh perspective. And finally, I will say you won't please everybody so don't even try. Get input from the various departments in your company that need a web presence, but then once you decide how to lay it out, that's it, don't go back to them to make sure it's ok. I know this isn't always possible depending who has how much pull in the company, but if you can get away with it, it will save you many headaches in the long run. Sorry to ramble on, I recently went through a similar situation at my current company and it is definitely a huge undertaking. Good luck!
