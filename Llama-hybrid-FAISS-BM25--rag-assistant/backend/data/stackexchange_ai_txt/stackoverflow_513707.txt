Ill quote from the documentation . 10.8.4.4.1. Introduction The FlashMessenger helper allows you to pass messages that the user may need to see on the next request. To accomplish this, FlashMessenger uses Zend_Session_Namespace to store messages for future or next request retrieval. Basically, this means that yes you have to refresh the page to see the messages. Edit for PartialLoop: You could try this: foreach ($array as $message) { $newArray[]['message'] = $message; } But you dont have to use PartialLoop. You could send it to Partial and loop it there. Or even loop it right there in your view.
