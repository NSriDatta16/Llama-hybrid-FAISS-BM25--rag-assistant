I'm currently writing a book about Data Science in Higher Education, and the following methodologies are the ones I am including: For regression , we have: Simple Linear Regression Multiple Linear Regression For classification , we have: Naive Bayes Classifier Decision Tree Induction K-Nearest Neighbor These are some of the more elementary topics in statistical analysis (which you could argue is predictive analytics which you could argue is data science), and thus I would suspect they are also the more common.
