If the hyperlink isn't going to wrap to more than one line, then embedding another TextBlock can work: R 2 This will give a solid hyperlink under the Hyperlink's child, which means an unbroken hyperlink: However, if the embedded TextBlock needs to wrap to multiple lines, you'll only get one underline under the entire wrapped paragraph, rather than underlining each line of text: (source: excastle.com ) If you can put a TextBlock only around a short bit of content that needs superscripts -- e.g., around just the R^2 in the above example -- and leave the rest of the text parented to the hyperlink, then you get underlining as normal. But sometimes that's not practical, so it's something to watch out for.
