If you can work in 10.5+, the easiest way is to store the NSImageRep s for the image in "Transformable" attribute. By default, the transformable attributes use NSCoding to archive their values on set and unarchive on access. This saves you from having to write custom getters/setters. If you want to get fancy, you could write a custom NSValueTransformer that converts an image to an acrhived version of its representations and visa versa on get. If you're using 10.4, then you have to write custom getters/setters (see Apple's docs on creating Non-standard persistent attributes . You can get the image's image reps by sending the NSImage a -representations message. If you want to display the images in a UI via bindings, you should also read the Displaying Images Using Bindings section of the Cocoa Bindings Programming Topics.
