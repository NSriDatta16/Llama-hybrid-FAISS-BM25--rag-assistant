There's no such API function. You need to count the items yourself. On the other hand, you seem to be filling an array in C and I guess you have a Lua table like say {10,20,30} and you assume that you'll get the items in the order I've listed. This is not so with lua_next . See the second paragraph in http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#pdf-next .
