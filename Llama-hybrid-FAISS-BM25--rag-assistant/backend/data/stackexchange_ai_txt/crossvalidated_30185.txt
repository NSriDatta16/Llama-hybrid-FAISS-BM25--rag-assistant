What software (paid or free) exists for learning large datasets?

Is there available software (or even just relevant papers) that can perform multiclass learning on datasets of 200m+ samples with 50+ classes and 1000+ features? What are the limits on dataset sizes for neural networks? Decision tree ensembles? SVM? As an example: Microsoft has developed code that can build decision trees on a 1kilonode cluster of 600m samples per tree over 32 classes with 2000 features. It takes a day to do the training of 3 trees. Are there publicly available programs that can do this for ANY of the above learning algorithms?
