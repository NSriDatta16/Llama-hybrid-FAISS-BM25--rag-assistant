Which is faster for a small amount of information, java file i/o or derby?

I'm writing a small agent in java that will play a game against other agents. I want to keep a small amount of state (probably approx. 1kb at most) around between runs of the program so that I can try to tweak the performance of the agent based upon past successes. Essentially, I will be reading a small amount of data at the beginning of each game and writing a small amount at the end. It seems like I have 2 options, file I/O or derby. Is there a speed advantage to either? Or does it not really matter for such a small amount of data?
