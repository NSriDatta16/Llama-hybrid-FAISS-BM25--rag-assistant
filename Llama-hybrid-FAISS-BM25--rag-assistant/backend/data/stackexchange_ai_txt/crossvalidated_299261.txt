In kernel SVM you map your data points into a possibly infinite dimension Hilbert space $\mathcal H$. It turns out that $w$, the normal vector to the separating hyperplane (which completely characterizes the decision boundary), has the form $$ w = \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i y_i \phi(x_i) $$ where $\phi$ is the map from input data space to feature space and the $\alpha_i$ are from the dual formation (and if $i$ is not a support vector then $\alpha_i = 0$). One of the things that makes SVM practical is that $w$ is a finite linear combination of the $\{\phi(x_i)\}$ which is due to the representer theorem . We classify a point $x$ via $$ \text{sgn}(b + \langle w, x\rangle) = \text{sgn}\left(b + \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i y_i K(x_i, x)\right) $$ where $K$ is the kernel function. This is just determining which side of the hyperplane $x$ is on, and note how we never actually need any $\phi(x)$, we instead only need inner products which are provided by $K$. There is no way around computing this, but for certain kernels there may be tricks to compute it faster (note how the code for "other Non-linear kernels" is exactly computing what I've described here). In particular, for $$ K(x, x') = \exp\left(-\gamma ||x - x'||^2\right) $$ we have $$ ||x - x'||^2 = ||x||^2 + ||x'||^2 - 2 x^T x' $$ so you can work with vectors rather than doing a double for loop which may be much faster. I don't know Matlab, but in their code, it looks like X1 computes the squared norms of each test point, and X2 computes the squared norm of each training point. Then they compute the sum of these minus 2 times the inner products of the data points, which is exactly the (or at least a) vectorized way to compute all pairwise $||x - x'||^2$. I'm guessing the part with model.kernelFunction(1, 0) is how you go from $||x - x'||^2$ to $\exp\left(-\hat \gamma ||x-x'||^2\right)$, and then the rest is just element-wise multiplication by $\vec \alpha$ and $\vec y$, before summing to get the single signed distance per test point.
