Rails: setting column alias attribute with find_by_sql

When I use a column alias in a query with find_by_sql, it doesn't appear to be set in the result objects, even when I add an attr_accessor for the property. class Country I would expect to be able to do this: countries = Country.sorted_by_average_score.first.average_score ...but it always returns nil, even though a value is definitely returned from the query. Can anyone explain to me why the attribute isn't set in the object?
