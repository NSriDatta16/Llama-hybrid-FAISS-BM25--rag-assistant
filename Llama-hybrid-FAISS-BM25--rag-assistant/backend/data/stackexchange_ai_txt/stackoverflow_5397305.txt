Here's a solution if you really want to keep the number of tag minimal in your html and still be able to have your IDE highlight javascript. It's really useful with jquery if you want only one $(document).ready() call in your html or with facebook js api to call js when the api is loaded, etc... layout_helper.rb : def javascript_jquery_ready(script) content_for(:javascript_jquery_ready) { script .gsub(/( | )/, "") } end application.html.erb : $(document).ready(function(){ }); any view file: $('#share_access_link').click(function(){ $('#share_access_form').slideToggle(); }); This solution enable me to keep my code organise and readable in my IDE since I don't need to create partial for every js code. Even if it change nothing for the end user the html result is cleaner.
