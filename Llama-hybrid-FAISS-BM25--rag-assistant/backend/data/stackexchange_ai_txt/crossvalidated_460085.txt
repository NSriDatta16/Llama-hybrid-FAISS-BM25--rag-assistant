Equivalence between directed and undirected graph?

I am confused over something that may have an obvious explanation I am missing. In Koller's Probablistic Graphical models textbook, page 945, it is said that a Markov network $A-B-C$ is equivalent to a Bayesian network $A\rightarrow B\rightarrow C$ , and that both have equivalent expressive power. However, I find this confusing because in the latter, $P(B|A,C) = P(B|A)$ due to the assumption in directed graphs where a variable is conditionally independent of others given its ancestor. Isn't this independence missing in the undirected version of the model? I'd appreciate any input, thanks!
