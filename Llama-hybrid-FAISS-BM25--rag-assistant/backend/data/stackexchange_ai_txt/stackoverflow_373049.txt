You could use FULLTEXT indexes if you are using MyISAM as the storage engine. However, MySQL in general is not very good with text search. A much better option would be to go with a dedicated text indexing solution such as Lucene or Sphinx . Personally I'd recommend Sphinx - it has great integration with PHP and MySQL and is very, very fast (can be used to speed up even ordinary queries - performs very fast grouping and ordering). Wikipedia has a nice list of different indexing engines - here .
