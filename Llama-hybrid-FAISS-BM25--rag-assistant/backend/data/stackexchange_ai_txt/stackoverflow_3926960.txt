The following snippet will prevent your div from receiving dragged content: jQuery('div').bind('dragover drop', function(event){ event.preventDefault(); return false; }); I ( and several others ) find this api to be strange and counter-intuitive, but it does prevent a contenteditable from receiving dragged content in all browsers except IE8 (including IE9 beta). As of yet, I cannot prevent IE8 from accepting contenteditable. I'll update this answer if I find a way to do so.
