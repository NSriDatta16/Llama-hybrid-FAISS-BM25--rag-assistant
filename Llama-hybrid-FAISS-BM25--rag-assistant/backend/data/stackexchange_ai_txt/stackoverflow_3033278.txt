If they are all owned by the same element: blah slfk You can do $('#lol').click(function(e){ alert( $(e.target).text() ); }); You can apply it to the document too. This way you set the click on 1 element and grab the target . You can add logic to make sure its a paragraph and whatnot too. This will only use the one function literal and no other functions. Less overhead than .delegate because it does it on the spot instead of internally.
