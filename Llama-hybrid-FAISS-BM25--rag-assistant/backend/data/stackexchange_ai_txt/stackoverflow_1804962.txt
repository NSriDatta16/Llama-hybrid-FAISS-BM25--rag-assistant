I use : 1- Rename - to correct better method name 2- Move - to organize my package in better ways, like when I start my project, it was so small so no need of a io package, but now yes. 3- Generate Comments -when I create a .class avoid me to re-copy the GPL license, etc 4- Correct Indentation - to keep my code readable.
