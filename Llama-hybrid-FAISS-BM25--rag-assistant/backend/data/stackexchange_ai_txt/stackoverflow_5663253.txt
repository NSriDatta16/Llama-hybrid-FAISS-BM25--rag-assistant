Java inner class / closure

So I have the following: Object a = data.getA(); Object b = data.getB(); Object c = data.getC(); // and so on These objects are retrieved from API calls and may be null. I want to put these objects into a List, but only if they are not null. I could write a bunch of lines: if(a!=null) {myList.add(a} and so on. But I have the feeling that there is a more elegant way that would avoid having to do the null check each time (aside from creating a helper method to do this). With javascript, for instance, I could create a closure. Any ideas for Java?
