Custom eCommerce Site - ASP.Net or PHP?

I currently have a very functional customised online ordering website written from scratch in ASP. This was built approx 4 years ago, and works exceptionally well. I need to build a similar one for another company. Do I simply upgrade and get a like product developed in ASP.Net 2.0, or do I need to do some homework on other options such as PHP, Rails, Django, Magento etc? The new site will need to use Ajax (or something similar) and other Web 2.0 features in which I know ASP.Net can handle. Are there other simple frameworks available to create a customised online ordering type of application? As an example, I have heard that Rails and Magento are very difficult to customise etc. Do I use the devil I know?
