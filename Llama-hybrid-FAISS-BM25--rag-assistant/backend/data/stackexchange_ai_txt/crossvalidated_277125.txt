How to interpret this regression outcome

Hello I hope someone can give me some valuable insight. Prior to my analysis/regression, I checked the average market shares over a six year time period over different (countries) regions. Region A: highest share Region B: 2nd highest share Region C: 3rd highest share Region D: 4th highest share Region E: 5th highest share Region F: 6th highest share In my regression I use the regions as dummies, and take Region A with the highest share as base and the shares (dependent variable) are transformed (log). Now to my understanding I thought that Region B, which is the closest to Region A in terms of shares, would have the smallest negative coefficient and then followed by C, D, E, F. But this is not the case it goes from: B, E, C, F and D. Is my understanding wrong? *btw: the number of countries in the regions are not equal, example Region D has 4 countries in my analysis and Region F has 11 countries for example.
