If you have access to the server logs, try comparing the request from the browser with the one from Ruby and see if that tells you anything. If this isn't practical, fire up Webrick as a mock of the file server. Don't worry about the results, just compare the requests to see what they are doing differently. As for Ruby style, you could move the headers inline, like so: httpcall = Net::HTTP.new(@address, @port) resp, data = httpcall.get2(@path, 'Range' => 'bytes=1000-') Also, note that in Ruby 1.8+, what you are almost certainly running, Net::HTTP#get2 returns a single HTTPResponse object, not a resp, data pair.
