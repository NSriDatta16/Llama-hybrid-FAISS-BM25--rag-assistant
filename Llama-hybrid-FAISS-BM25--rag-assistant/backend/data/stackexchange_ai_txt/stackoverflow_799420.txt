How to use regex to extract groups of question-answer data from html files?

How can I use a regular expression to extract groups of html that will be formatted like this: . . .irrelevant html... Question 6 lots of text lots of text Answer 6 lots of text lots of text lots of text more text caption text There can be a variable amount of Question-Answer pairs. And the image code can be anywhere (either between Question and Answer, or after the answer)... The only info I want to extract is the Question #, the text sans paragraph html code, the Img src and alt and caption.
