QLabel inside QGraphicsView is not a good idea indeed. QGraphicsView was designed to host QGraphicsItems, to display an image you should use QGraphicsPixmapItem. Embedding QWidget into QGraphicsView has some overhead and was really designed for complex widgets that can't be easily reimplemented in terms of QGraphicItems.
