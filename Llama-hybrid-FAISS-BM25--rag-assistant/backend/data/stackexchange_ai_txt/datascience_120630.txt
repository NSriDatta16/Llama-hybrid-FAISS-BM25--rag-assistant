Fine-tune GPT on sketch data (stroke-3)

These past days I have started a personal project where I would like to build a model that, given an uncompleted sketch, it can finish it. I was planning on using some pretrained models that are available in HuggingFace and fine-tune them with my sketch data for my task. The sketch data I have is in stoke-3 format, like the following example: [ [10, 20, 1], [20, 30, 1], [30, 40, 1], [40, 50, 0], [50, 60, 1], [60, 70, 0] ] The first value of each triple is the X-coordinate, the second value the Y-coordinate and the last value is a binary value indicating whether the pen is down (1) or up (0). I was wondering if you guys could give me some instruction/tips about how should I approach this problem? How should I prepare/preprocess the data so I can fit it into the pre-trained models like BERT, GPT, etc. Since it's stroke-3 data and not text or a sequence of numbers, I don't really know how should I treat/process the data. Thanks a lot! :)
