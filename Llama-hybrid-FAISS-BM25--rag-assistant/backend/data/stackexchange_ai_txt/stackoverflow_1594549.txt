Local commits pushing to a central server

At work we use perforce and are encouraged to make regular commits to it (something I am fine with). However, I'd like to run something like mercurial so I can locally commit stuff that is work in progress and doesn't necessarily compile/run and then from this do my regular commits to the central perforce server. My question here is kind of two-fold, first off, does anyone know how well Visual Studio would cope with multiple source control bindings (ideally I want everything to be as autonomous as possible - hey, I'm lazy:)) And secondly, are there any tools available that would allow me to do something as simple as "Check current head of mercurial repository in to perforce". I seem to recall GIT allows you to do something similar to this, and I'm not entirely against trying it out. If I've missed out anything obvious or am thinking about this in entirely the wrong way, please feel free to berate me ;) Cheers
