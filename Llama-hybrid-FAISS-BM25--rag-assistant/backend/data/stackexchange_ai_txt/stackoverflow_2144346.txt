You could setup a message board on one of the free message board servers so that players can find each other. You'll probably want to encourage them to use private messages to exchange IP addresses. Then, use a protocol that connects using IP addresses. Good luck with that. Firewalls make it a pain. Then, of course, one machine of the pair would need to act as server, the other as client. Your software must contain both sets of code. I've written such a game and can tell you that the communication code gets a little confusing. I can tell you right now that you'd be much happier in life if you wrote a web service to facilitate communication. But, then, you'd need a server for that. Good luck. You're going to need it. OR, you could just write a game for an IM client, like Microsoft Messenger. I've seen games for that one, so I know it can be done.
