From looking at a graph of your time series, there is a clear upward trend present in the data, which suggests non-stationarity. I decided to run some tests on the data you provided (Dickey-Fuller, Phillips-Perron, and KPSS), where the time series variable is given the name ts . Here are the results: > library(lmtest) > library(tseries) > library(orcutt) > #install.packages("egcm") > library(egcm) > > #ADF Tests > adf.test(ts) Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test data: ts Dickey-Fuller = -0.4225, Lag order = 3, p-value = 0.9793 alternative hypothesis: stationary > > #Phillips-Perron Test > pp.test(ts) Phillips-Perron Unit Root Test data: ts Dickey-Fuller Z(alpha) = -7.3396, Truncation lag parameter = 3, p-value = 0.6608 alternative hypothesis: stationary > > #KPSS Tests > k1 k1 KPSS Test for Trend Stationarity data: ts KPSS Trend = 0.17321, Truncation lag parameter = 3, p-value = 0.02733 > k1 $statistic KPSS Trend 0.1732075 > > k1$ method [1] "KPSS Test for Trend Stationarity" We can see that the null hypothesis for the Dickey-Fuller and Phillips-Perron tests cannot be rejected at the 5% level - implying non-stationarity as we expect. However, in my case, the KPSS showed a p-value below 0.05, which means we reject the null hypothesis of stationarity - consistent with the results from the other two tests. I note that you specified a lag of 4 time periods - you mention this is to account for non-seasonality. However, as this other answer explains , ADF and KPSS are designed for detecting nonstationarity from the presence of a unit root. However, these tests are not designed to detect other forms of nonstationarity, which includes seasonal nonstationarity. In this regard, the tests conducted have indicated nonstationarity - which is evidenced by the fact that a clear trend is present in the data. In further modelling the data, you may wish to consider how stable the seasonal pattern is. If there are significant differences from one season to another, this can contribute to non-stationarity, while stable seasonal patterns represent more of a stationary pattern. It might be an idea to decompose a portion of your time series, e.g. 1 year, to examine the seasonal patterns in more detail. It might be the case that the data is more representative of stationarity when analyzed over a shorter period of time.
