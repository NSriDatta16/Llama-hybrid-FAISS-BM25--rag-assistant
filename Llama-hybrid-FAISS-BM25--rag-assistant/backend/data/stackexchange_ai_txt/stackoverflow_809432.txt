For simple syntax highlighting for C-like languages, try Textpad. You can define the operators, braces, comment delimiters and keywords for your languages in a few minutes. The editors Komodo Edit, Emacs, VIM and Epsilon give you the power to define almost any kind of syntax highlighting. If you know the syntax highlighting model of these editors very well (takes hours or more to learn), usually you have to spend at least an hour, but usually a day to create your custom syntax highlighting, VIM being the easiest to program the syntax highlighting. I use the editor Joe on Linux, which also lets the user define custom syntax highlighting, but its state machine-based model is not so powerful as the editors mentioned in the previous paragraph.
