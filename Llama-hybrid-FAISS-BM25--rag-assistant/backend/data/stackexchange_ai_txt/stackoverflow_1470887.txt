Escaping JavaScript string literals in views

Is there a utility function for escaping JavaScript in ASP.NET MVC views? I often need to init a little snippet of JavaScript using some values from the view; for instance I may have something like: var page = new Page({ currentUser: " " }); page.init(); I would expect something like: var page = new Page({ currentUser: " " }); page.init(); I could, of course, write the function myself. But since there are already built-in utilities form HTML encoding, and since one of the selling points of ASP.NET MVC is that the is the default rendering mode, and since what I'm trying to achieve is quite common, it makes me wonder why I cannot find anything like that already built-in. Is there, for instance, an easy and elegant way to serialize an object to JSON in views? Or am doing something against ASP.NET MVC principles? When I hit a problem like this, it usually makes it think that either Iâ€™m doing something wrong since I assume that the framework designers spent some time thinking about real world scenarios.
