You can't get there from here, in my view. If there are very few prefer-not-to-say's, you can omit them without much bias. However, if you have lots in that category (say 5% or more), then I think you need a different design. Like ... don't even ask them if they "prefer not to say"! There are ways of asking sensitive questions. In one method, people are told to answer truthfully or to lie, according as some random process (hidden to the interviewer) directs them. Using the known probability of a lie, you can infer the proportion with a particular characteristic without knowing the actual characteristics of any individual. This works for binary questions. I like your idea of going Bayesian on this if you have prior information about the "prefer not to says".
