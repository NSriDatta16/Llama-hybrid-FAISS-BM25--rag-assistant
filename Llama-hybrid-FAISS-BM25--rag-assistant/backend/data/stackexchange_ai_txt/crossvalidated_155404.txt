How do I combine various factors/variables to a single factor/variable

I have various products and for each product I have 5 types of cost(not just monetary cost) variables associated with it, the value of each variable for any product is a positive integer. I want to combine all these together to come with a composite score (which will be derived by combining the individual scores of 6 fields for each application) giving function, use it to assign a composite score to each product and then use that score to compare the products over a period of time. I am a newbie to data science problem, I have a deadline coming so I can't study everything and then come up with a solution, can structural equation modelling be applied here? A sample case (one month's data) suppose I have 5 products A,B,C,D,E and 6 factors F1,F2,...F5 I want to compare these products and want to combine the individual score of every factor for each product to come up with a total score and then use that score to compare the products relative to each other at this time instant. Please suggest me if there is some standard way of approaching the problem.
