The vendors have one set of best practices. You, however, voice concerns with that. Years ago I supported a Major Software Product . Major. They said "The database is relational storage. Nothing more." Every user conference people would ask about stored procedure, triggers, and all that malarkey. Their architect was firm. As soon as you get away from plain-old-SQL, you've got a support and maintenance nightmare. They did object-relational mapping from the DB into their product, and everything else was in their product. This scales well. Multiple application servers can easily share a single database server.
