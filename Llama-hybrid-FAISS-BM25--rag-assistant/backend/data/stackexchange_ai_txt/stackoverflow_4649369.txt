For mine i was follow guide to create cert via makecert.exe and make it as trusted publisher through IE then populate through clickonce trust problem will not come out again and notice that need to find a full trust hosting service provider like arvixe... When developing your ASP .NET applications. You may run into some dlls that require your application to have full trust on the server. Many web hosts do not allow your applications to run in full trust. At Arvixe, by leveraging the power of Windows 2008, we will enable full trust for your applications per request. XBAP full trust deployment create your own certificate and deploy full trust.afterward, user install automatically for my case =D also can prompt to install or notify user click the button beside the address bar ^^
