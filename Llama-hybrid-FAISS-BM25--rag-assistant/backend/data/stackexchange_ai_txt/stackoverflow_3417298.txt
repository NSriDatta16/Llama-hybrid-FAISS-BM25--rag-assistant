Regexp for parsing words from sentence

I need a regular expression to parse words from a sentence or a paragraph. Some separaters that should be used are: spaces, and dots. So in: My name is Bob.I'm 104 yrs old. Bob and I'm are seperated even though there isn't any space between them, but a dot. Any other regular seperaters of words should also be included.
