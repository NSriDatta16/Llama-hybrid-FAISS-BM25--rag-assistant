If you want to predict the price 1 step ahead it does what you want. But is the price of the electricity market stationary? my guess is not so you will have to work with returns and because you are working with time series you should use a model of time series like an ARMA(p,q) or a GARCH or a mix of both to control for the volatility. There is ton of information about time series models in R.
