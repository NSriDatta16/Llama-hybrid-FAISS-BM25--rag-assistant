Path coverage measurement is a tricky subject. First you have to define what you mean by a path in the first place. Is a loop executed three times a different path than a loop executed four times? If so, you have an infinite number of paths. If not, there are test cases missed even if all paths are covered. It might be that the better next step is branch coverage: measuring whether every conditional is executed both true and false. This can be accomplished by recording sequences of line numbers.
