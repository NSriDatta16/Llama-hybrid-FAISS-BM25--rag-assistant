How to find a Windows Forms Application's Product Code?

I need my application to uninstall itself. Reason: It's come to my attention that my app is destroying its own files (my bad), but the user of my app doesn't understand why he needs to uninstall it and refuses to uninstall it. However, he still complains about the constant problems. And in the Terms Of Use, there is a line that says "...we reserve the right to remove the application from your computer and temporarily or permanently discontinue your use of the software." So, I did some searching on how to uninstall a program, (which will be replaced by a new version), and came across Uninstall C# windows application from self and the accepted answer says you need a 'product code'. What exactly is that, and where can I find/get it from? I have searched for this but can't find anything. Thank you
