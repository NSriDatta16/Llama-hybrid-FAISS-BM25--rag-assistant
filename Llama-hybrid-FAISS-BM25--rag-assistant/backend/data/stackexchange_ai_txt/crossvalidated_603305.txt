Why is my Weighted Average = Simple Average

Problem is as follows: I have a dataset as follows: #. Category Value Item A, 1 Item B, 2 Item B, 2 If I do a simple average of value, it is 1.67. If I do a weighted Average as follows, then the answer is the same. (1/3) x 1 + (2/3) x 2 = 1.67. So would you call this a simple or a weighted average?
