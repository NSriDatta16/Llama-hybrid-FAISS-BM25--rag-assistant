Neither the onSelect() nor onClick() events are supported by the tag. The former refers to selecting text (i.e. by clicking + dragging across a text field) so can only be used with the and tags. The onClick() event can be used with tags - however, you probably are looking for functionality where it would be best to use the onChange() event, not onClick() . Furthermore, by the look of your tags, you are also trying to use JSP syntax in a plain HTML document. That's just... incorrect. In response to your comment to this answer - I can barely understand it. However, it sounds like what you want to do is get the value of the tag that the user has just selected whenever they select one. In that case, you want to have something like: function changeFunc() { var selectBox = document.getElementById("selectBox"); var selectedValue = selectBox.options[selectBox.selectedIndex].value; alert(selectedValue); } Option #1 Option #2
