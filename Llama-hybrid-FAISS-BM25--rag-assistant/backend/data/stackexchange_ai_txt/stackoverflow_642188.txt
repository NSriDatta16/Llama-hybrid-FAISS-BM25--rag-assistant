iPhone app rejected upon section 3.3.3 (but what does it mean?)

I made an iPhone application that displays a couple of pictures from the internet where you can comment on (iPhone sms bubble style ) My app was rejected because of: We cannot post this version of your iPhone application to the App Store because it violates section 3.3.3 of the iPhone SDK Agreement; "Without Apple's prior written approval, an Application may not provide, unlock or enable additional features or functionality through distribution mechanisms other than the iTunes Store." If you would like to provide an invitation-only pre-release version of your application to a group of friends, then we encourage you to use the Ad Hoc application distribution method. Please go to the Distribution Tab in the iPhone Developer Portal for complete information on Ad Hoc distribution. But what does it mean? I surfed a little on the internet and found out that this covers applications that have similarity to applications by Apple? Does anyone have experience with that? And know how to solve this issue?
