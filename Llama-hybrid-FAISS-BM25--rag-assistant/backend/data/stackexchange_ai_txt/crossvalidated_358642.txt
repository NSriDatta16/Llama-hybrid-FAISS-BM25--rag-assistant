Mean differences using t-test

Is there a way I can use the t-test application if I only have the average of the two compare? For example, I have an internal average which is 81% and an overall average number that is 82%, I was task to use these two numbers to see if there is a real difference in the two. The overall average number that is 82% includes the internal data also. Can someone help me please? THanks
