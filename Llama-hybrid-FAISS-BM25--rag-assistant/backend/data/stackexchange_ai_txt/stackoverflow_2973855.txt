It's possible to do what you want, but it falls well outside of the quickest path to get to the desired result. If you're a newbie I'd stick with the easy paths for now, because Cocoa Touch is enough of a learning curve already. So. The quickest path would be to have your main view subclass the PickerController class. Then you can create your IB file, use your main view class as the file's owner, and connect up the data sources and delegates. I'm guessing from your StackOverflow score that you're an experienced developer who is starting on iPhone dev. The above quickest approach will probably smell funny, because subclassing doesn't really feel right. It feels like you should be able to combine controllers, mixing them together to build a UI. And that is possible, but ends up being a lot of work and a bit of a headache if you're just starting out. I've found that the aesthetic payoff of doing a more elegant approach isn't worth the extra effort in most cases.
