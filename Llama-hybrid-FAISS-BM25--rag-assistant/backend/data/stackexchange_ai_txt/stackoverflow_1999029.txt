Anti piracy and app identification. iPhone SDK

How easy is it to determine whether an iPhone application is cracked and report that device ID to a server rather than block it / or turning the app into a lite version? Would patching remove these methods to the server? It is mainly a losing battle preventing an app being cracked, but i want a system not dissimilar to product keys / or identifying a binary. Is it possible to have every app downloaded from the app store to have a unique identifier hard coded into it? Thanks and sorry for barrage of questions!
