Regex help, works on rubular not on production? Possible \n issue?

Given this: Come Find me please. This is paragraph one.\n\nThis is paragraph two. Capture everything before me as this is the last sentence.\n\n\n\n From: XXX XXX \nDate: Mon, 17 May 2010 10:59:40 -0700\n To: \"xxx, xxx\" \nSubject: Re: XXXXXXXX\n\ndone Lots of other junk here What I want back is: Come Find me please. This is paragraph one.\n\nThis is paragraph two. Capture everything before me as this is the last sentence. I'm using the following regex which works fine on rubular but fails in rails. Ideas why? split(/(From:.*Date.*To:.*Subject:.*?)\n/m).first Thank you!
