The main difference is that Gant is a build tool, while Gradle is a project management tool (from the dev/ops standpoint). So Gradle, compared to Gant, comes " battery included ", because it allows you to easily use plugins, manage dependencies, has a complete, hookable, lifecycle, etc... It is a bit like comparing Ant and Maven, stricly looking on the Java side.
