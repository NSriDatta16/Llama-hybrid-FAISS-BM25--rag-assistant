The most likely answer is that it really is just gzipped JSON. There is no other standard meaning to this phrase. Re-organizing a homogenous array of JSON objects into a pair of arrays is a very useful technique to make the payload smaller and to speed up encoding and decoding, it is not commonly called "compressed JSON". I haven't run across it ever in open source or any open API, but we use this technique internally and call it "jsontable".
