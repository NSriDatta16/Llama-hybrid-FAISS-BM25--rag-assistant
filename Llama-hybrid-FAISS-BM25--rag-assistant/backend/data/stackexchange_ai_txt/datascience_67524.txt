Are there any methods to detect whole multivariate time-series as anomalous from a set of multivariate time-series?

Consider a scenario with Dataset D as { T 1 , T 2 , ..., T n } and T i is a multivariate time-series of length m i as { X 1 , X 2 , ..., X m i }. Here each record of the time-series X i is a vector of attribute values { X i 1 , X i 2 , ..., X i a } where X i j is the value of j th attribute of i th record of a time series. Given this scenario is there a method to detect the anomalous time-series(or a set of anomalous time series, i.e the T 's which are anomalous) from the set D ?
