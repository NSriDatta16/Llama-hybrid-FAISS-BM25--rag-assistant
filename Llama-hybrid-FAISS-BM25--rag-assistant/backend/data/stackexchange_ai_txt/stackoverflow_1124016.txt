Cufon provides javascript based text replacement - it works quite well but can slow down the computer on some fonts if you overuse it though. sIFR does something similar but uses Flash - but I have always had problems with it so I wouldn't advise it. The font-face css selector also provides inline font embedding, but unfortunatley since the majority of browsers do not use it it may not be worth using - at least for a while yet.
