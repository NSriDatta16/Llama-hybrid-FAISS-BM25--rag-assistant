I kinda think this is almost more like a religious problem, than a real technical issue. For almost every programming language you can find a big website that's using it. .NET -> Microsoft Ruby -> Twitter (yes, they have a few issues, but still) PHP -> Facebook Java -> Lots of finance companies Don't know about Phyton, but I'm sure there is. More important is a good scalable architecture. That is where Twitter kinda screwed it up it seems. Personally I use ASP.NET. Works fine, is somewhat easy and has a nice IDE. And the market is not so fragmented. Before I used Java with Websphere. Was running on a Sergenti Sun Box, so could definitely handle a lot. I would more see into what you can get yourself into the quickest. If you know C++ C# or Java are easy to learn.
