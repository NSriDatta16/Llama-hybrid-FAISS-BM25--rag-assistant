The tool is making use improvements in hardware which can optimise multiple read and write requests much better. When copying one file at a time the hardware isn't going to know that the block of data that currently is passing under the read head (or near by) will be needed of a subsquent read since the software hasn't queued that request yet. A single file copy these days is not very taxing task for modern disk sub-systems. By giving these hardware systems more work to do at once the tool is leveraging its improved optimising features.
