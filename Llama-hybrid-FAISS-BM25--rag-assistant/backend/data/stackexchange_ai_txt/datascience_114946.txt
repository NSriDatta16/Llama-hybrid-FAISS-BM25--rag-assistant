Building a Time Series Model

I am working on building a time series model, but the dataset I have only has date features for the year; the month and date are not available. What would be a suitable model to use and is it even possible? The dataset is an Excel file from different years I have merged into a single sheet with records for each year arranged in alphabetical order.
