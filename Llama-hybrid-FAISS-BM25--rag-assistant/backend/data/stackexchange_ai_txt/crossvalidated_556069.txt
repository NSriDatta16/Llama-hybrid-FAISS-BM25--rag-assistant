Forecasting future trends on electric vehicles

I'm new to forecasting and time series though I'm working on a dataset with the aim to calculate future trends of electric vehicles ownership. Based on this data: # A tibble: 11 Ã— 4 year AT BE DE 1 2010 0.0341 0.00979 0.00414 2 2011 0.177 0.0487 0.0534 3 2012 0.127 0.115 2.26 4 2013 0.205 0.102 0.206 5 2014 0.423 0.240 0.285 6 2015 0.544 0.269 0.389 7 2016 1.16 0.377 0.346 8 2017 1.54 0.494 0.734 9 2018 1.98 0.659 1.07 10 2019 2.81 1.60 1.78 11 2020 5.47 3.46 6.86 Where AT, BE, DE are country codes for Austria, Belgium and Denmark. I want to forecast a trend from 2020-2035 on the ownership for these vehicles. The values represent the total percentage of electric cars relative to all registered vehicles in that country for the years 2010-2020. I have computed the following: 1. elec I find that the Point Forecast column does not change in value and remains the same. Why does this occur and how can I get forecasted predictions? #Note The repeating values occur when I multiply the values by 100 as they are in the table below. When I do not do this, I get trendy forecasts for Belgium and Denmark but not for Austria. Reproducible code: structure(list(year = c(2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020), AT = c(0.0341191917407185, 0.177356295024186, 0.127228737604882, 0.204599086207762, 0.42276111521808, 0.543739212810963, 1.16198904826841, 1.53940747121226, 1.98389862357307, 2.81032012338881, 5.47327860613168), BE = c(0.00979351995429691, 0.0487309151700553, 0.114773516317445, 0.102218821729151, 0.240434141236, 0.269493566735431, 0.377480566775425, 0.493710525499866, 0.659186638148145, 1.59745743473326, 3.46300304401671), DE = c(0.0041416240526035, 0.0533995678931518, 2.26046458794798, 0.20565270250581, 0.284837134480026, 0.389384919074261, 0.345819796962729, 0.734310566915347, 1.06911161030285, 1.78033474340805, 6.85903263419716)), row.names = c(NA, -11L), class = c("tbl_df", "tbl", "data.frame"))
