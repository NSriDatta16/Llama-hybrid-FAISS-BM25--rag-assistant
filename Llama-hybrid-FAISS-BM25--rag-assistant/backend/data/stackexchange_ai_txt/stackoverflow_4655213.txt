As far as I know, Wireshark exports only the currently displayed columns. By default, the "Packet length" column is hidden. You can show this column by the following steps: Right-click on a column Choose Column Preferences... from the context menu Click Add from the Preferences dialog In the Field Type drop-down, select Packet length (bytes) . In the column list, click the title of your new column (default is "New Column") to edit. Change it to "Len" for example. If you wish, you can drag and drop list entries to change the column order (which will be reflected in the exported CSV as well as the GUI). Click OK . Now, your exported CSV ( File > Export > as "CSV" file... ) should include packet length.
