Metropolis Hastings Algorithm and Breaking Reversibility in MCMC

If the goal is to sample from a distribution $\pi$ it is common to build a Markov Chain with stationary distribution $\pi$ . Solving this problem using Markov Chain Monte Carlo is essentially simulating the Markov chain, and taking the values it achieves as (an approximation of) samples from $\pi$ . Consider the overdamped Langevin equation, for which it is well-known that $\pi$ is stationary (infact reversible). $$ dX_t=\nabla \log \pi(X_t) dt+\sqrt{2}dW_t, $$ A common choice of Markov chain is a discretisation of $X_t$ . Recently there has been huge amount of literature (e.g. https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10955-016-1565-1 ) showing that it is favourable to use non-reversible dynamics like the perturbed underdamped Langevin equation $$ dX_t=\nabla \log \pi(X_t) dt+b(X_t)dt+\sqrt{2}dW_t,~~~\text{with}~~~\text{div}(\pi(x) b(x))=0. $$ For which $\pi$ is stationary (not reversible). However a discretisation of $X$ will not have $\pi$ as its stationary distribution. To fix this people use Metropolis Hastings algorithm https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis%E2%80%93Hastings_algorithm . But the Metropolis Hastings algorithm constructs a reversible process (by definition), so my $\textbf{question :}$ are the benefits gained from using non-reversible dynamics completely lost when we use the Metropolis Hasting algorithm?
