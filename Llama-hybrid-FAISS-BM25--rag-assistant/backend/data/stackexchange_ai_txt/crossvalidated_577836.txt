Difference between Gini Importance vs Mutual Information

I am tackling a regression problem. I have used XGBoost as my model and implemented feature_importances_ , which by default scores the importance of a feature using Gini importance. I have also done some feature selection to reduce the number of features and see how it affects the RMSE score. This is done using SelectKBest and using a scoring metric of mutual information . I want to generally ask what is the difference between Gini importance and mutual information?
