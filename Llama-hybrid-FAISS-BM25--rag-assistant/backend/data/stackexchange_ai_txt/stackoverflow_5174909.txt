How to depict use cases shared by actors and how to document differences within those use cases

i have 2 questions: while creating a use case diagram, how do i depict use cases shared by multiple actors? how can i use'actor generalization' in this case? can i create a 'generic user' and reference the individual actors to this user? Can use cases be used to depict differences in the same use case across multiple actors? Eg. An Agent and Manager can both Edit prospect information but the agent can only edit 3 fields as opposed to the manager who can edit 5 fields. am guessing such differences will be documented in a separate requirements section?
