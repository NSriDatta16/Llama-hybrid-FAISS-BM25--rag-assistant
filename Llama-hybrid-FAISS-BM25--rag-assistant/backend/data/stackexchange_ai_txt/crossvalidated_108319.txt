How to compare difference between two time series?

I am working on my thesis where I'm examining how strong emotion people show to different events. My problem is (1) that I have VERY little experience with statistics and math, so I'm kind of lost with all different methods and would be really happy if a 'easy' answer could be given (without lots of algorithms and stuff). So the main question: In the graphs below I want to check if the yellow line is significant different in the second graph compared to the first, and also how different. How is this done in the easiest way? I have searched for an answer for two days, but not being able to find something that could help me. So I hope that someone can help me on the right way!
