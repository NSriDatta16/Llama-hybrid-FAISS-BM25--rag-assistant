In fact, every user can create a new SQL Server Agent job. What you have control on is their rights on your Database objects. I just tried it and a user with no rights at all (denydatareader and denydatawriter on all databases) can still create a new SQL Server Agent job but he can't do anything inside it. Hope this helps!
