Are there any generic statistical board software?

I was thinking about monitoring the evolution of a single value (nope, this is not the SO rep :-p), and I'd like to have some nice histograms about it. My needs are simple: daily / weekly / monthly / yearly evolution histograms; daily / weekly / monthly / yearly calculation for max, min and average value. Ideally the product should be scriptable so I can feed it with the result of the script. Something simple like: set it up, set cron (or, if it has a daemon, even better), set input, enjoy output. If it does not exist, do you feel like you would be interested in such a tool. Because I could end up coding it eventually. EDIT : I am not looking for a lib or a language but an app.
