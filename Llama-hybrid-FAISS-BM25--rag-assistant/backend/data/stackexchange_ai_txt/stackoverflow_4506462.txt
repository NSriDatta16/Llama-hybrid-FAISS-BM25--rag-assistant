Many C/C++ purists discourage exceptions altogether. The main criticisms are: It's slow - Of course it isn't really "slow". However, compared to pure c/c++, there is quite a bit of overhead. It introduces bugs - If you don't handle exceptions properly, you can miss the clean-up code in the function that throws the exception. Instead, check the return value / error code every time you call a function.
