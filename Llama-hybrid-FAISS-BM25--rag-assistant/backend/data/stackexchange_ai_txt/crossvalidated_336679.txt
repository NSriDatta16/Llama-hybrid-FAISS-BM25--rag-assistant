Regression: fixed effects vs. random effects vs. first differences?

I'm learning econometrics and I'm stumped with a textbook problem. Use the JTRAIN dataset (which provides information on manufacturing plants in Michigan from the years: 1987, 1988 and 1989) to determine the effect of the job training grant on hours of job training per employee. I'm estimating the model using three methods (FE, FD, and RE) The estimation results are the following: Fixed Effects: Random Effects: First Differences: How would I go about knowing which of the three methods is the best one to use (in this case)? Any help is appreciated.
