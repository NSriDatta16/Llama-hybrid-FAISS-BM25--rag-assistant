Prior for covariance matrix?

Given a set of data $\{(x_i\pm e_{x,i},\,y_i\pm e_{y,i})\}_i$ (with uncorrelated uncertainties), I want to model it as a multivariate Gaussian function with an unknown mean $\boldsymbol{\mu} $ and a covariance matrix $\boldsymbol{\Sigma} $ . What is the correct prior for them? What happens if I assume that mean of both variables are 0? Context : I've tried MCMC without giving any prior by assuming the likelihood for each pair of points to be a Gaussian with covariance of $$ \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_i = \boldsymbol{\Sigma} + \pmatrix{{e_{x,i}}^2& 0\\0 &{e_{y,i}}^2} $$ but it lead to the correlation coefficient of $\pm$ 1, so I thought it was the problem of incorrect prior.
