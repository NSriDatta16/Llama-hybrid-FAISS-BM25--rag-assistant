Do all the work in Access VBA. See the following URLs for some sample code Modules: Sample Excel Automation Modules: Transferring Records to Excel with Automation Also note that if you are dealing with multiple versions of Excel late binding becomes a necessity. Late binding means you can safely remove the reference and only have an error when the app executes lines of code in question. Rather than erroring out while starting up the app and not allowing the users in the app at all. Or when hitting a mid, left or trim function call. This also is very useful when you don't know version of the external application will reside on the target system. Or if your organization is in the middle of moving from one version to another. For more information including additional text and some detailed links see the Late Binding in Microsoft Access page. As far as emailing goes there are a number of options at the Microsoft Access Email FAQ
