finding elements by attribute with lxml

I need to parse a xml file to extract some data. I only need some elements with certain attributes, here's an example of document: some text some text some text Here I would like to get only the article with the type "news". What's the most efficient and elegant way to do it with lxml? I tried with the find method but it's not very nice: from lxml import etree f = etree.parse("myfile") root = f.getroot() articles = root.getchildren()[0] article_list = articles.findall('article') for article in article_list: if "type" in article.keys(): if article.attrib['type'] == 'news': content = article.find('content') content = content.text
