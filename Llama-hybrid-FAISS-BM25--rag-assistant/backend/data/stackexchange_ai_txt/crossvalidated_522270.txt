Choosing clusters that are closest to the mean of all data?

So the problem is like this; Assume there are 5 bridges spread out in a city. We counted the number of cyclists passing through each of them on random days. Now we want to install sensors on the bridges to estimate the average traffic in the city, however, we can only choose 4 bridges out of the 5. I believe we have to eliminate the bridge that changes the mean by the least amount. However, I couldn't think of a good way to formulate this. Do I just remove them one by one and observe how much does the mean change, or is there a better method to achieve this (like some kind of a reverse PCA that instead of removing features removes classes)?
