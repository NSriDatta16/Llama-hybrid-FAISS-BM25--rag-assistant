Oren, it is useful to define what aspects of finance you intend to tackle. Statistics is a tool when seen from the econometrics perspective (in terms of assessing the plausibility of a proposed model / theory) or can be the first or primary line of attack when seen from the machine learning side - that is you go low on the domain knowledge and rely more on constructing a feature space and applying algorithms. (However, the task of constructing a useful feature space is dependent on deep domain knowledge). To get a handle on the theoretical aspects of finance - I'd recommend say: Investment Science by Luenberger Mathematical Techniques in Finance: Tools for Incomplete Markets by Ales Cerny (perhaps a later read) Asset Pricing by Cochrane To learn how to apply statistics / econometrics coupled with the theory: Introductory Econometrics for Finance by Chris Brooks Asset Price Dynamics, Volatility, and Prediction by Stephen Taylor Econometrics of Financial Markets by Campbell, MacKinlay and Lo The books recommended above, ones by David Ruppert, Eric Zivot, Ruey Tsay are useful, however, I would recommend Chris Brooks' & Ruppert's texts first, followed by Taylor's. Paul Soderlind 's notes, and Kevin Sheppard 's notes (both available online) are quite good.
