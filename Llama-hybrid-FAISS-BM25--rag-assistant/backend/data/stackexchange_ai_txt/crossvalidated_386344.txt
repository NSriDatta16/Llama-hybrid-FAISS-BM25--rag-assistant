Index accuracy based on sample size out of population size

Suppose I have people who work at different companies and I am interested in seeing their view on some topic. In order to do this, I decide to conduct interviews on people from each of the different companies and from these interviews I come up with an index that ranges from -100 to 100 that measures each person’s view on the topic (-100 being negative, 100 being positive). After getting an index for each person, I decide to average indexes of people who work at the same company to get a “company index”. Suppose the distribution of people who work at each of the companies is the following: Company # of People in Company A 1 B 6 C 10 D 8 E 15 F 4 In the end, I want to end up with something like: Company # of People in Company Index for Company A 1 40.3 B 6 0.5 C 10 -30 … … … My question is: how many people should I interview from each company so that the index calculated for the company is accurate/valid? I presume this would be based on the company size, as well as the desired confidence band size for the index. What would be an example for each of these if I wanted a confidence band of say +-20? What would be the confidence level if, for example, only 1 person was interviewed from company B (out of 6)? Or 2 people with variance of X?
