The organisation I work for has ported its GUI application to Qt several years ago. I think there are several aspects that are worth mentioning: Working with Qt Designer, at least at that point, was not a realistic option: there were too many features that couldn't be done with Qt Designer; Conventions and structure that had to be preserved prevented the use of Qt Designer; Once you've started without Designer, it is probably difficult to return to it; the most important aspect, though, was that the programmers were very much used to programming using vi or emacs, rather than using a GUI IDE. My own experience, which goes back approx. 4 years, using Qt3.3, is that dynamic behavior in dialogs was not possible to realise in Designer.
