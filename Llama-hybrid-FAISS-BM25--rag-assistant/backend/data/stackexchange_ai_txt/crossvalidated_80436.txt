Cross-Correlation for non stationary data

I am using cross correlation to find the correlation between two time series data say X and Y. I have read this somewhere that : " If X or Y contains auto-correlation or is not stationary about mean , the cross- correlation will not reflect the true relationship between X and Y. What to do in this case? Thanks in advance
