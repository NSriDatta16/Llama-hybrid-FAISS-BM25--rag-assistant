Based on the comment from Robert Kern, I have removed my previous answer. Here are the constraints as continuous functions: b1 = lambda x: x[4]-x[0] if x[4] Note: Python 2.5 or greater is required for this syntax. 1 To get the constraint a , note that 1.2*a is the halfway point between a and 1.4*a . Below this point, that is, all e , we use the continuous function e-a . Thus the overall constraint function is negative when e , handling the lower out-of-bounds condition, zero on the lower boundary e==a , and then positive for e>a up to the halfway point. Above the halfway point, that is, all e>1.2*a , we use instead the continuous function 1.4*a-e . This means the overall constraint function is is negative when e>1.4*a , handling the upper out-of-bounds condition, zero on the upper boundary e==1.4*a , and then positive when e , down to the halfway point. At the halfway point, where e==1.2*a , both functions have the same value. This means that the overall function is continuous. Reference: documentation for ieqcons . 1 - Here is pre-Python 2.5 syntax: b1 = lambda x: (1.4*x[0]-x[4], x[4]-x[0])[x[4]
