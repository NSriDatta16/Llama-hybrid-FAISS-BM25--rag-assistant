What you want is something like Google Analytics with in AS3 mode. Use this mode if you control the Adobe Flash ActionScript 3 code, but you do not control the hosting environment of your Adobe Flash application. For example, if you are developing Flash content for distribution across many sites, then you would use AS3 mode. AS3 mode is completely independent from the ga.js tracking code and contains all the Analytics tracking functionality. There is no need for a separate ga.js tracking installation with this mode. In addition, AS3 mode uses the Flash storage mechanism to track session information for the visitor. http://code.google.com/apis/analytics/docs/tracking/flashTrackingIntro.html#trackingModes I've used something similar with Omniture SiteCatalyst to track embedded video players.
