Anchor not scrolling correctly

I have a layout something along the lines of : My banner has position:fixed; and is roughly 200px high. The problem is that when I click a link with a fragment identifier, the page scrolls and the anchor (with the identifier) sits at the top of the page, behind the banner instead of under the banner where it can be seen. Is there something (CSS or jQuery) that I am missing ?
