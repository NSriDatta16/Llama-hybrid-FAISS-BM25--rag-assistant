How do you add a navigationBar when you're not using a navigationController?

Is there a way of doing this other than dragging one onto the view in IB? I see in IB that you can specify that a view has a naviationBar but that only seems to work when I am using a navigationController. The app I'm working on isn't a good fit for navigationController. Thanks in advance.
