It really depends on what you mean by 'trust'. If the assumptions hold, the chance of a type I error is just your significance level - it's not a function of sample size (power sure is - but that's not an issue for you). Your power analysis shows that you don't have a high power ... but nevertheless you did reject. Small sample size doesn't increase the chance that you'll wrongly reject - on average it decreases it.
