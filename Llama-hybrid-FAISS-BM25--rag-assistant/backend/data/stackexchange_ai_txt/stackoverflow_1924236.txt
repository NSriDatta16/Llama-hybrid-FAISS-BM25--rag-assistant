I believe the key settings you should look at are key_buffer_size , myisam_max_sort_file_size and myisam_sort_buffer_size . key_buffer_size is one of the most important settings overall for MyISAM, but the other two might need some explanation. From http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/server-system-variables.html : myisam_max_sort_file_size The maximum size of the temporary file that MySQL is allowed to use while re-creating a MyISAM index (during REPAIR TABLE, ALTER TABLE, or LOAD DATA INFILE). If the file size would be larger than this value, the index is created using the key cache instead, which is slower. The value is given in bytes. The default value is 2GB. If MyISAM index files exceed this size and disk space is available, increasing the value may help performance. myisam_sort_buffer_size The size of the buffer that is allocated when sorting MyISAM indexes during a REPAIR TABLE or when creating indexes with CREATE INDEX or ALTER TABLE. The maximum allowable setting for myisam_sort_buffer_size is 4GB. So basically, if you expect your indexes to be larger than myisam_max_sort_file_size , you might want to look at tweaking that up. If not, the myisam_sort_buffer_size might warrant some attention. Keep in mind that creating indexes on a MyISAM table locks the entire table. If you're doing this constantly on large tables, you could have some serious performance issues, no matter how many settings you tweak.
