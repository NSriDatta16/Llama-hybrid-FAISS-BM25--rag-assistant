Which options can you pass as the third parameter of Mage::run()?

Magento is started by running Mage::run() in index.php. Mage::run has three parameters: $code, $type, and $options. The first two are well-documented but I can't find anything about the third: $options. I did read somewhere that you can move your etc directory to another place, but what other options can I set? I hope I can set the theme package; that's what I have been looking for.
