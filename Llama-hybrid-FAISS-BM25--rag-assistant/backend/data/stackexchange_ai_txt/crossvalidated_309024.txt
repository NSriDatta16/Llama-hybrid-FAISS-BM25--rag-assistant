Mark White's intuition is incorrect. The BESD is not actually modeling a median split. A median split is associated with real statistical information loss--it systematically attenuates relations (see http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1990-24322-001 ), which is why the median split values show a smaller accuracy than the BESD. The BESD is demonstrating classification accuracy as though the variables were truly dichotomous, not artificially dichotomized through a median split. To see this, compute the correlation on the median split data. You will see that it is smaller than the correlation for the original variables. If the variables were originally binary, the two methods would agree. By its nature, the BESD is displaying variables as though they were truly binary. When it is used for continuous variables, this necessarily represents an abstraction--there aren't really "success" and "failure" or "treatment" and "control" groups, but it is practically useful to show results in this way because it can be easier to understand two binary variables than two continuous variables. The BESD is not biased. It accurately reflects the impact of a particular treatment on classification accuracy if we were working with two binary variables. It is a useful display for demonstrating the potential practical value of a measure or treatment, and, yes, it does demonstrate that even effects with small variance accounted for statistics can be meaningfully important. The BESD is widely used in applied psychological and organizational practice, and it agrees strongly with other practical effect size displays (e.g., that top-down selecting a group using a measure with a validity correlation of r=.25 will lead to a .25 SD increase in outcome performance among the selected group versus an unselected group). Variance accounted for statistics consistently lead to misunderstandings and underestimates about the size of variable relations because the squaring operation is nonlinear. Many applied methodologists (e.g., https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/methods-of-meta-analysis/book240589 ) strongly discourage their use in favor of their square roots (which more accurately convey the size of effects).
