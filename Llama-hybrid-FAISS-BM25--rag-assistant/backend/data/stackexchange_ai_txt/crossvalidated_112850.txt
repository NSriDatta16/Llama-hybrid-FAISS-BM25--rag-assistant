I've been looking for recommendations on whether it's better to use the sample standard deviation (SD) for a binomial distribution or use the analytic SD (or variance). If it was an iid sample actually from a binomial distribution ... the MLE would be the usual analytic one; as such, at least in large samples, that's going to be a very good choice. The problem is, the claim of being binomial isn't always as true as people might hope. Summing 0-1 variables is not of itself sufficient to establish that something is binomial, since the binomial relies on independence and constant $p$, and frequently one or the other or both don't quite hold. Do you know for certain that $p$ is constant, for example? This is a query for descriptive purposes only. I could use a multi-level logistic regression to model but I'm just looking for simple descriptives. If you're fitting a multilevel logistic model, that would suggest that $p$ isn't constant across all cases, in which case you shouldn't use the binomial to work out the standard deviation, and such a model would also suggest that independence (unconditionally) could be suspect. If there's any doubt on constant $p$, make sure to quote the sample SD. If there's doubt on independence, it may be that neither measure is very meaningful, though it depends on what you're trying to achieve by quoting it. Example: Each subject gets 20 tries at the task and there are 6 subjects with accuracy 0.95, 0.80, 0.80, 0.65, 0.90, 0.70. The mean accuracy would be 0.8 and therefore the analytic SD of that accuracy is sqrt(0.8 * 0.2 / 20) = 0.089. However, the SD of those six numbers calculated on the sample is 0.114. Which is the better SD estimate to use? In these circumstances, I'd suggest you quote the sample SD (within-subject you might quote the analytic one, but beware of the possible effect of dependence within subjects). [The overall variance might be expected to be close to the sum of the within- and between- components.]
