storing order in drag and drop interfaces

I guess this is less a direct problem but more of an implementation question. For drag and drop interfaces. How do people store the order of the elements that are being re-arranged. Since a user expects the order to be preserved when the user refreshes the page, how do you store that kinda information in a relational database or other persistent layer? A number system seems extraneous requiring multiple updates anytime anybody arranged anything and I couldn't think of a nicer system for storing that information especially if the user doesn't have to click "Done" or any other button after re-ordering. (IE Facebook Photos) Any help would be appreciated.
