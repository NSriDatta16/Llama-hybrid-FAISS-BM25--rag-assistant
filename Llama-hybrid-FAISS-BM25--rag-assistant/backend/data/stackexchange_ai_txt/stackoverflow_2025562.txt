Inherit docstrings in Python class inheritance

I'm trying to do some class inheritance in Python. I'd like each class and inherited class to have good docstrings. So I think for the inherited class, I'd like it to: inherit the base class docstring maybe append relevant extra documentation to the docstring Is there any (possibly elegant or pythonic) way of doing this sort of docstring manipulation in a class inheritance situation? How about for multiple inheritance?
