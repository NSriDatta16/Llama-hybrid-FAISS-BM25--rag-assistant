Removing the Apache TomCat runtime from a project in Eclipse?

I've got a project I've been building on Eclipse Ganymede targetted at tomcat 6.0, I've imported it into Europa and I need it to run on apache Tomcat 5.5 I can't find the reference to where the runtime is set to 6.0 to remove it. I've tried going to Windows > preferences > Server and I've installed the 5.5 runtime. I can't however seem to find where the reference is to runtime 6.0 to remove it. Any help would be appreciated. Update: I cant find any reference to Tomcat v6.0 in my build path, there is a reference to the servlet-api.jar of tomcat 5.5 though...
