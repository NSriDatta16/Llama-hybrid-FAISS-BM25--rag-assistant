It's doing that because your top level unordered list ( the one with Items 1 - X) has the same class as the tables unordered list. If you change the top level , to a different class name it should stop double dropping the draggable. I hope I'm understanding your problem correctly, here is my change. New code EDIT: Actually that won't help either because then you wont be able to drop into your upper lists. I think the issue is that as you are dragging and dropping jquery doesn't know which ul you actually want to drop into. You could try making all the elements a little bigger so the user would not have to finesse the draggable into the right spot.
