If you want to handle 80% of the cases, you can start with "New Folder". As I guess you're in an enterprise environment, you can get the folder names back into a storage, then after a week (or any time) you get through the names; update your app; release the new version which will please the users. (then later publish the results here) You can preemptively test your app on a range of platform you're suspecting the users to use. to get a first series of folders names. This will avoid the problem of dealing with code specific with each of the platform you're looking at. EDIT Well I get a second thought about that, I guess you might want to warn the user about that "New Folder" if it wasn't rename after some time (say a minute)? then I guess you would need to add a list and a timer ...
