USB Debugging setting keeps "unchecking"

I'm doing Android development with Eclipse 3.6.2, OS X 10.6.7 and a Samsung Galaxy Tab. Everything is working great, except every 15 or 20 minutes, the Settings | Applications | Development | USB debugging checkbox "unchecks" itself. Which means I need to unplug the USB cable and go back into the setting, re-select the checkbox, plug the cable back in and I'm good to go. What I would like to know is if there is some way to make that checkbox "sticky" (I asssume it probably is supposed to be - but I haven't been able to figure out under what circumstances cause the "uncheck" to occur). I've tried a number of variations of USB / sdcard / Development settings and haven't found the "sticky bit" yet. I'm new to Android, so I'm hoping there is some "you forgot to also do X" here... EDIT: Maybe it has to do with a USB Mass Storage message that pops up after 10 min or so? I just noticed a message "USB Connected: You have connected your phone to your computer via USB. Select Mount if you want to copy files between your computer and your phones SD card".
