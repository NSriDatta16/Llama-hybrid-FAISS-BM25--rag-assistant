Drawing Java 2D Charts span across multiple views or panels or horizontal-scrolling

I'm drawing a graph using Java 2d graphics (i.e. drawing and filling rectangles) straightaway on a JFrame from a set of values stored in an Arraylist. But when the ArrayList has very large number of values (can even go upto 3500 in size), the drawing is compressed - where the graph seems less informative and even the labels on the X-axis are not displayed. Is there a way I can make the graph displayable in several page-wise manner (i.e. say limiting so that a page can show upto 100 values - the remaining in different pages where the user can navigate page-wise). How can I approach this type of a situation? Are there any stacked-layouts I can use? Can I use panels? But then can I draw half way in panels (since the graph is drawn inside a loop - until the elements of arraylist are read)? Or can I have a scrollable panel? I have currently drawn everything manually without using drag-and-drop GUI in NetBeans. Greatly appreciate any insight, suggestions and ideas. Many thanks in advance
