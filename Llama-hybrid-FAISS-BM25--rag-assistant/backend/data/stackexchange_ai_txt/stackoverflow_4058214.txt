From: http://pys60.garage.maemo.org/doc/s60/scriptext.html Note: The service is available from 'S60 third edition FP2 and later'. N95 is a 3rd edition FP1 device. You can adapt your app at runtime according to the availability of this module by putting the import in a try..except block: try: import scriptext except ImportError: # Module could not be imported, tell the user to update to a newer device # or continue without it if having scriptext is not crucial to your app.
