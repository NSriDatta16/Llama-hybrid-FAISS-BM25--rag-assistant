MLE for Poisson distribution is undefined with all-zero observations

Suppose $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$ are observed values of IID random variables $X_1, X2, ..., X_n$ from Poisson distribution, i.e., $P(x)=e^{-\lambda} \frac{\lambda^x}{x!}$. The MLE for $\lambda$ is only defined (as the average of observed values) when there is at least one value of $x_i$ greater than zero; otherwise the log likelihood function is $l(\lambda)=-\lambda n$ and the MLE is undefined ($?$). So, I am confused when computing the bias of this estimator, since the case of all-zero valued observations actually has non-zero probability, how to account this when finding the average of $\hat{\lambda}$. Any answer is appreciated.
