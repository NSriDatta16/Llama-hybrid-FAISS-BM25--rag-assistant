Entropy is not the same as probability . Entropy measures the "information" or "uncertainty" of a random variable. When you are using base 2, it is measured in bits; and there can be more than one bit of information in a variable. In this example, one sample "contains" about 1.15 bits of information. In other words, if you were able to compress a series of samples perfectly, you would need that many bits per sample, on average.
