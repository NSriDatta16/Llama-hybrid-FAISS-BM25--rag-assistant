App crashed because of syntax error in an helper utf-8 encoded

I'm using heroku to deploy my app (rails 3). Ok so I do the usual, which is a git commit , a git push heroku master => deployment is ok, gems are installed, etc... When running my app in the web browser, I get an heroku error : app crashed. In the ouput of heroku logs, this got my attention : ==> dyno-2625316.log (crash) It seems that there's a syntaxt error in my string_helper module. This file is encoded in utf-8 (I precise it because it can be important). This file contains the following lines (empty) : module StringHelper end Note : I had a groups_helper file with methods in it, and the app crashed because of that. I deleted it and now the error points to this stringhelper. What I will do now : delete this file an redeploy. Edit I did delete string_helper. Now the error is on events_controller.rb, the very same error ==> dyno-2625316.log (crash) line 104 is the last end of the class class EventsController This file is also in utf-8
