One rule in database design is (in general): do not store information that can also be retrieved easily. In your case I would not create a computed column, but do the multiplication during retrieval. Either by directly selecting price * quantity or by creating a view that contains this computation. The view has the added benefit, that you can easily change the formula (e.g. including VAT) without the need to change all statements in your application.
