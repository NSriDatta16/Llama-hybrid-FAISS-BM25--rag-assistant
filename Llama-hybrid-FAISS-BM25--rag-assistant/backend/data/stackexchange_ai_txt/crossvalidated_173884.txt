I have successfully used a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) in the past for this task. It is a kind of Neural Network with some relation to Clustering, with significant advantages over them for some specific tasks. The main advantage (to me) is that it is an unsupervised method, meaning that you can apply it even with unknown classes in your data. If you know your classes, you could use this information to color the distinctive clusters/regions obtained in the output map. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-organizing_map
