How to achieve high availability and scalability using relational databases is well known and there is a vast body of knowledge out there on how to do this! Google is a special case which does not apply to most sites, very very high volumes of queries, very very large amounts of data, and, most importantly no Service Level Agreements with most of its users. There is no correct answer to a Web search only better answers, for the average user Google is good enough, if Google misses a vital page from a search list you as a user cannot complain. E-Bay is a rather different case, somehow they have persuaded there users and customers to accept poor service in exchange for theoretically lower prices -- good on them but this is not an option for every business.
