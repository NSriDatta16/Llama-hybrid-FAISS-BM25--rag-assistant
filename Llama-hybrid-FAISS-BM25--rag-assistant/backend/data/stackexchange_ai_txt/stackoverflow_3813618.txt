The javax.xml.transform interface is the standard means in Java for performing an XSLT transform on an XML document. Since it does not appear that your transform will be XSLT based, this is not the correct API for you. Programmers occassionally implement their own versions of Source and Result to hook into standard javax.xml.transform transformers, but this is not your use case. Is there a particular API you are hoping to integrate with? If not you will be better off desigining your own API.
