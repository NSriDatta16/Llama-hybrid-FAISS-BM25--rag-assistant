Wonderful answers given above up to McNemar's test. In the below is to add notes for the rest of the calculations. ==================== Sensitivity : 0.8824 Specificity : 0.4955 Pos Pred Value : 0.8199 Neg Pred Value : 0.6180 Prevalence : 0.7225 Detection Rate : 0.6375 Detection Prevalence : 0.7775 Balanced Accuracy : 0.6889 'Positive' Class : B ==================== Caret's ConfusionMatrix function prints the above type of output. The predicted classes are rows and actual cases are columns. So the ACTUAL Negative cases are (55+56) 111, and ACTUAL Positive cases are (34+255) 289. The PREDICTED Negative cases are (55+34) 89, and PREDICTED Positive cases are (56+255) 311. Sensitivity = Rate of True Positives captured by the algorithm (255/289) is 0.882353 (0.8824) Specificity = Rate of True Negatives captured by the algorithm (55/111) is 0.495495 (0.4955) In the above we used actual marginal totals for calculating the rates. In the below we will use predicted marginal totals for calculating the rates, for Positive Predictive Value (Pos Pred Value) and Negative Predictive Value(Neg Pred Value). Pos Pred Value = Rate of Positives captured among the total Pos Predicted, is 255/311 = 0.8199 Neg Pred Value = 55/89 = 0.6180 Prevalence is the the rate of "All ACTUAL Postives" in the whole population = 289/GrandTotal, 289/400 = 0.7225 Detection rate is among total population, how much is detected = 255/400 = 0.6375 Detection prevalence is rate of "All PREDICTED Positives" in the whole population = 311/400 = 0.7775 Balanced Accuracy is the average of Sensitivity and Specificity = (0.882352+0.495495)/2 = 0.6889 Additional notes which are not printed by the Caret's ConfusionMatrix function, but are commonly used are: Precision is useful in actual targeting plan; we can only act on predicted and so this is useful: Same as Pos Predicted Value = 0.8199 Recall is useful to make judgements about the model and we want to see how much the model is able to recall correctly: Same as Sensitivity = 0.8824 F1: Equally weighted average of Precision and Recall; because these are rates, we have to use harmonic mean. Harmonic mean of Precision and Recall, 2*[Precision+Recall)/(Precision*Recall)] = 2[(0.8199 x 0.8824)/(0.8199 + 0.8824)] = 0.8500
