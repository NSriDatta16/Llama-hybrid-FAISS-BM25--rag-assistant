"decreased", "same", "increased" outcomes : ordinal logistic vs multinomial logistic?

I am conducting a study where I have ordinal categorical outcome variables representing frequency for two distinct periods. My goal is to consolidate the responses from these periods into a single outcome with three categories: decreased , unchanged , and increased . Given the ordinal nature of this new three-level outcome (or is it not ordinal perhaps?), would it be appropriate to use ordinal logistic regression instead of multinomial logistic regression? Or alternatively, are there other methods suitable for this type of analysis that do not require overly complex specifications uncommon in econometric literature?
