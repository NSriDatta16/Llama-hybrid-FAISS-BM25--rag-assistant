Transfer learning: As simple as running trained models on new data?

So there's a domain of interest where the machine learning models are all specific to one entity. Let's call it a building. So there's a model made for every building. The literature in the domain all revolves around studies showing how they tailor a NN or other ML model to make a prediction for the building in question, be it an SVM, NN, or linear regression. Now assume there are many buildings with each one having a model and each building having the same set of features. Running models trained on one building (say A) on another building (say B) sometimes produces a better result that the same type of model that was trained on the original building (B). Is this an example of transfer learning?
