Machine learning for pattern recognition in realtime sensor data

I'm working on a project where we need to detect patterns in a sensor's output to find out if a given event occurred. Given my limited experience with machine learning, I was wondering if someone could point me in the right direction. Bellow is a picture of how the data looks like over 11 days and we want to detect the positive events in realtime (before the event is over). We initially had a slope-change based detection but we need something more robust (the overall sensor behavior is slightly different for each sensor but the event profile is the same) Long term sensor data: Close look at event: I understand this is pretty broad question but it would be great if someone could point me the right machine learning concepts to detect the events. Merci beaucoup!
