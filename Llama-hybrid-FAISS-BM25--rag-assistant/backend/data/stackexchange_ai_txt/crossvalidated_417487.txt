Object detection : is deep learning the only way to go?

It seems that deep learning based approaches are currently more superior to the more "traditional" methods in the domain of object detection. Methods like YOLO, for example, seem to be doing something magical that can't be replicated by the other methods. However, these deep neural networks are trained on hundreds of classes and require a huge amount of computational power. So I have been wondering if we limit the object detection algorithm to a single class of objects (cats or a bicycle for example) can methods based on feature detectors(SIFT, SURF...) and machine learning algorithms (SVM, ANN...) perform similarly to deep learning algorithms?
