Polling vs averaging in Random Forest models

Why is it that for Random Forest we take the average vote from each classifier in the ensemble rather than the average probability from each classifier in the ensemble? Is there theory behind why polling is preferred, or is it simply that it seems to work better empirically? Using the probabilities seems like it would eliminate the need for tuning the cutoff.
