In the answer from gui11aume it is stated that The fiducial argument is to interpret likelihood as a probability. However, there is a subtle difference between the fiducial distribution and the likelihood function. If $F(\hat\theta; \theta)$ is the cumulative distribution function of some parameter estimate $\hat\theta$ given the true parameter $\theta$ then the fiducial/confidence distribution is $\frac{d}{d\theta}F(\hat\theta,\theta)$ whereas the likelihood function is $\frac{d}{d\hat\theta}F(\hat\theta,\theta)$ .* The fiducial argument is to inverse the interpretation of the probability statement described by the cumulative distribution function. An example is described in this question The basic logic of constructing a confidence interval The way of constructing the confidence interval in that question, by using the cumulative distribution function, is equivalent to constructing a fiducial distribution. So this specific** type of confidence interval and related confidence distribution is what is meant by the fiducial distribution and fiducial probability. And, it is much more around then we think; it is only not named fiducial interval and overtaken by the more general confidence interval. Another reason why 'fiducial' is less popular is because of the difference in the philosophical interpretation and attempts to have a more Bayesian interpretation than frequentist interpretation. The fiducial intervals were supposed to contain the parameter 95% of the time but they only do so from a specific point of view: Why does a 95% Confidence Interval (CI) not imply a 95% chance of containing the mean? * For some types of cases like a rate parameter or a location parameter, the fiducial distribution coincides with the likelihood distribution because in those cases $\frac{d}{d\theta}F(\hat\theta,\theta) \propto \frac{d}{d\hat\theta}F(\hat\theta,\theta)$ . But the fiducial distribution does not transform in the same way when we re-express the parameters (it scales more like a probability distribution function). For instance, the fiducial distribution for estimating $\sigma$ in a normal distribution is not the same as the likelihood function. ** Note 'specific'. The fiducial distribution is a confidence distribution, but not every confidence distribution is a fiducial distribution.
