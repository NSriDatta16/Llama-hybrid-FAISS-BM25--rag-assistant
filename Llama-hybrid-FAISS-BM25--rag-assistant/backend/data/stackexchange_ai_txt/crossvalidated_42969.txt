Why doesn't the method of moments work when calculating the variance of the inverse gamma distribution?

I'm trying to calculate the variance of the inverse gamma distribution using the method of movements. According to wikipedia the variance should be: $$\sigma^2 =\frac{\beta^2}{(\alpha-1)^2(\alpha-2)}$$ Where $\alpha$ is the shape and $\beta$ is the scale of the inverse gamma distribution. When trying this out in R it works reasonably well when $\alpha$ is not to close to 2. For example: library(MCMCpack) # for the rinvgamma function a But when $\alpha$ gets close to 2 the method of movements doesn't seem to work anymore. In the following example the sample variance is much smaller than the method of movements variance: a Why doesn't the method of movements work? Am I doing something wrong that can be fixed or is there some other way that I can calculate the variance of an inverse gamma distribution?
