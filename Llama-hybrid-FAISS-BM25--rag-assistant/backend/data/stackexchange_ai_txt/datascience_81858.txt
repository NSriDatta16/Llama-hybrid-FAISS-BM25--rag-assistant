Very likely no! Machine learning algorithms aren't magic, they cannot see or find stuff that is not there. We know for a fact that some trends and hints exist that link a companies exterior communication to it's industry e.g. social media companies like blue logos (think Twitter, Facebook, linkedin, etc.). However for the most part logos, brand names, etc. do not have a structured way that ties them to such a specific information such as website-url, products and services. Practically you will also have a huge problem gathering training material. This is a supervised image recognition problem which means that you would need hundreds/thousands of examples were images are correctly tagged with the information to train your model. Given that a lot of industries do not even have that many brand names this will be near impossible. Alternatives? If all you want to do is identify the proper information about a company you could use ML to systematically crawl and gather that information from wikipedia or a companies website. However that time and money is properly better spend on buying access to one of many, many company databases that already exist.
