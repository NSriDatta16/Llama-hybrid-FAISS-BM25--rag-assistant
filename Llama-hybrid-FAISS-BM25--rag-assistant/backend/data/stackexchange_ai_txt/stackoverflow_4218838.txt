If this CSV list is large, I would recommend loading your file into a temp table, put an index on it and do a left join where null select tbl.* from table tbl left join #tmpTable tmp on tbl.primarykey = tmp.primarykey where tmp.primary key is null edit: a Primary Key should not be a varchar. It should almost always be a incremented int/bigint. This would've been a lot easier. select * from table where primarykey > @lastknownkey Smack the DB programmer who designed this.. :p This design would also cause index fragmentation because rows won't be inserted in a linear fashion.
