If by "converted" you mean compiled, and by that you mean compiled to machine code, yes, absolutely. Every bit of code that runs on any box is running as machine code. For any particular language the answer varies based on whether tools exist to create a stand-alone executable that does not need the language's run-time libraries. If by "converted" you mean manually coding it in Assembly, see the other answers. We don't do that because it takes a very long time to write the code. As for obfuscation, the conversion/compilation I mention in the first paragraph does not really work for this. When you "compile" something like Java or C# the source is translated into a lot of pointers into the run-time libraries. Those pointers can easily be reverse engineered and the original code re-generated.
