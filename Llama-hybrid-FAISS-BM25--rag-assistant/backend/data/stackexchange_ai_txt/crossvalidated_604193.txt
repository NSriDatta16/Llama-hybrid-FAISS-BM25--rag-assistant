The leftmost Boxplot says: There has been 602 days(data points) for which the market value on the previous day decreased. For those observations, we measure the percentage change in market value on the subsequent day, and we plot it (Blue boxplot). As you can see, although for all such observations the market change on the day before was negative, on the subsequent day, their average percentage return was positive (box plot mean is above zero). The analogous logic is applied for the 643 days(data points) for which the market value on the previous day increased (Red Boxplot).
