I had such problems with DevExpress GridControl. I think, that this situation caused by GridView( http://documentation.devexpress.com/#WindowsForms/clsDevExpressXtraGridViewsGridGridViewtopic ), which creates automaticly for each GridControl. This is part of GridControl responsible for visualization of DataSource. If you need to change DataSource try: GridView.Columns.Clear(); GridControl.DataSource = You_New_DataSource; GridView.RefreshData(); GridControl.RefreshDataSource();
