Eclipse does not move any of the jars in your classpath into the bin folder of your project. You need to copy the util jar into the bin folder. If you move it to the root of the bin folder, you might be able to get away without any classpath entries but it's not the recommended solution. See @BalusC's answer for good coverage of that.
