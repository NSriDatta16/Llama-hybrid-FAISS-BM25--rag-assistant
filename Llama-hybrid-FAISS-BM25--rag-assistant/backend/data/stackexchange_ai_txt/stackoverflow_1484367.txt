I think the way Uservoice combines username+password with OpenID is elegant. That said, I disagree with the argument of not using OpenID merely because few people have heard of it. If you offer a few login buttons like "Login with Google" and "Login with Yahoo" alongside your "or, create a new username and password for yourself", then you don't even have to mention OpenID, and yet most users will likely pick the more convenient (OpenID) option without even realizing what they're using (and that's good!)
