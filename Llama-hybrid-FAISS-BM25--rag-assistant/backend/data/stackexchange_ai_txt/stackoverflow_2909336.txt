Call Contact list on non-standard Android phones

I am creating a widget that you can assign a contact to onClick. I used the method that is described here . This works great on standard Android phones such as the Motorola Droid, HTC Nexus One and HTC G1. The problem is for users who are using devices such as the HTC Incredible or HTC Droid Eris (Both running Sense UI) and I imagine on other phones who's OS deviates from the vanilla flavor of Android. Using my current method I thought that the device's OS would hook into whatever that manufacture chose to use for their Contact system however users are being sent to a random list of numbers, not their Contact list. Does anyone have a suggestion on how to get those Contacts or is this just another example of the Android fragmentation issue? Any help or insight is greatly appreciated.
