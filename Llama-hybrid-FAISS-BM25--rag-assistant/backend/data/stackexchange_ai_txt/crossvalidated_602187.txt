Find a projection that minizimizes residuals on multivariate regression

The problem I'm working on is from neuroscience. We've got multiple electrodes with weakly correlated noise all sampling the same system. What are using these to do autoregression on a latent 1D system. However, there are driving functions too. So we need a way to combine autoregression and latent factor discovery. X ˙ σ = X Ξ Where: X is the N-D system timeseries (the electrode signals) X ˙ is the 1st derivatve of the N-D system timeseries (the electrode signals). Ξ is the coefficient matrix. σ Projects to one dimension and is chosen to minimize the regression residuals. What are the ways that we can find σ? If we do PCA on the residuals will one of the columns from the projection matrix (loading matrix) be σ? The method will need to generalize to classic multiple regression where Y = X Ξ, and the dimensionality of X is much greater than Y.
