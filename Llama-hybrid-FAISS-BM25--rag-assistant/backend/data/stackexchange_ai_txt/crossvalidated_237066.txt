Your idea of averaging regression coefficients is ill-defined, and your new idea in the second edit is not good because it repeats datapoints in the dataset and will have underestimated uncertainties (edit: unless b1 , b2 , and b3 are supposed to be independent observations at the same q values, as @whuber ponders, though I get the impression otherwise). Your problem is that you don't know what effect you are trying to measure. Your question contains four explanatory variables q1 , q2 , q3 , and q4 , with three simultaneous boolean outcomes b1 , b2 , and b3 . The only valid statistical questions you can answer with binomial regression are of the form "what is the probability of y as a function of q1 through q4 , where y is a well-defined event or outcome that is related to b1 , b2 , and b3 ?" For example, y could be b1 || b2 || b3 , b1 && b2 && b3 , b1 && (b2 || !b3) , etc. Performing different regressions for the outcomes b1, b2, and b3 using the same input data is fine, but there is no meaningful way to combine them. If you're not trying to the predict the probability of some y that can be written with b1 , b2 , and b3 using boolean algebra, then what are you trying to predict? Until you can answer this you have a answer in search of a question.
