Yes, this is a universal issue; related to how typography works in general. There is little to be done for it; but with margins and paddings and all manner of other hoopy stuff you might be able to defeat the effect. Another (exceptionally) dirty hack is to add some invisible character sub/superscripted on each line, staggering the lines so that the effect becomes less visible. Also; Would anyone know how to have all text in a line (regardless of line-height, subscript, superscript, etc) printed on the bottom of that line? That bit doesn't make sense: If you want them on the bottom of the line, don't superscript them! Alternative: Don't use sub/super; use real characters: 10²⁴; these are available from U+2070 outwards; to U+2094, as well as U+B2; U+B3, but depending on the font they can look rather wonky. Alternative Expanded: If you can get away with computer notation (E+24-style) for the exponents; there are single-character stuff for things like ㎢, ㎨, and the like (Volume and Average Gravitational Acceleration, respectively), these composites begin at U+3380; but again, they might look kind of wonky (or not be present at all).
