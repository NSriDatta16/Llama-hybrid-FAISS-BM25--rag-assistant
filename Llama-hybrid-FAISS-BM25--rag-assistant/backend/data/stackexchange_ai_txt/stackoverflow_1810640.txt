CSS WTF : form button not horizontally aligned (screwed up in FF but OK in Chrome)

OK here is what I found out, when I assign height to all my form elements, they will not be aligned horizontally, when they actually should . Chrome rendered this OK, FF pushed the form button too far up. Is there an elegant solution to this? 0 1
