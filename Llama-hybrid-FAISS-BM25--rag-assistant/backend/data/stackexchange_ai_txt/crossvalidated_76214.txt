I am currently in the process of doing this (sort of), and think I have had moderate to great success. I have relied solely on primary literature and experience without any textbooks. Here is what I found most helpful: 1) Learn R. I don't see how anyone can get an intuitive understanding without running many, many simulations. Perhaps with a strong math background this is not as necessary. 2) Learn the history of statistics and the source of various controversies, for example bayesian vs frequentist (Neyman Pearson, Error Statistics) vs fisher (inductivist) vs likelihoodist vs the NHST (Null Hypothesis Significance Testing) hybrid. There may even be more! Especially learn about the history of the NHST hybrid controversy, I had no idea how bad it was and was taught that as "Statistics". 3) Get data of the type you think you will analyze (timeseries, comparing groups, etc) and analyze it in many different ways to learn the strength and weaknesses of different approaches.
