I'd use Random Forests for your scenario because RF is well known for determining the importance of different features; the methods are implemented in many Machine Learning frameworks, and it's very simple to understand. While neural network are powerful, the methods for extracting the importance of individual features are less clear. Neural networks are more appropriate if you are more focused on just results.
