Document what level of exception safety a function guarantees. As Steve Jessop pointed in his answer, there is number of levels. Ideally if they are documented for interfaces all, or at least necessary minimum: a) never throws or b) may throw Read about Abrahams exception safety guarantees explained by Herb Sutter . I strongly doubt it would be practical in a big codebase. Regarding far away from the throw and it's hard to figure out what to do concerns, a good rule is to catch only in places where you want deal with exception, otherwise let it bubble up. It is not a good idea to catch and extinguish exceptions as soon as they appear, just because...they are exceptions, so you feel you have to do something with it. In complex systems, it's good to have a logging mechanism, so it's easier to trace a problem. Don't do it. Read Herb Sutter's A Pragmatic Look at Exception Specifications and related articles.
