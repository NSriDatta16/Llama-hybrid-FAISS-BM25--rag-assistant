In interviews, questions designed to test your familiarity with data structures (and often with algorithmic complexity) are NOT about relational databases. Questions about system design may well involve a database design part. The data structures you mentioned are all important. The one that's most obviously missing and very important is hash tables (or unordered maps, and the basis for data structures in many scripting languages, such as dicts in python and objects/maps in javascript). You should also read up on btrees , which are usually used to implement relational databases (and have properties like binary search trees, but are better suited to disk storage).
