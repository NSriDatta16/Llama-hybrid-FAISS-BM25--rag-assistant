Is it possible to let linq to sql auto submit my new records back to database?

I am using linq to sql , and I return a queryable result from linq to sql : var qry = from p in table select p; Then I use this to bind to a xtragrid: GridControl.DataSource = qry; Then If I edit the records in xtraGrid, I just need to call dataContext.submitChanges() to submit the changes back to database. My question is : Am I possible to just add new records into the qry result, and after that I only need to call dataContext.submitChanges() , then linq can create new records on database automatically ? Is that possible ? Can someone point me the right direction ? Thanks in advance !
