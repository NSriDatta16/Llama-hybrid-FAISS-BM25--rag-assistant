I am not familiar with SPSS syntax, however it seems that your model 1) does not include an intercept, and 2) does not include 'income' as a predictor, just as an interaction term. There may be good reason for this, but at first glance it seems that including the intercept and 'income' as a predictor will make interpreting the interaction coefficients easier for you. ( Edit : I see now that you did include an intercept. I misunderstood the SPSS output at first). To demonstrate the impact of including and not including 1) and 2) on standard output of linear regressions, I have three examples below. I use R, but the syntax should be understandable enough to follow along even if you are not familiar with R. In the examples, died is a binary outcome, and sex and age are exposures. In these examples, age will be equivalent to income in your example, as far as interpretation goes. ## First, we load in example data from the MASS package to make a ## reproducible example require(MASS) dat |t|) # sexF 0.2994329 0.1236565 2.421 0.01552 * # sexM 0.5530537 0.0366979 15.070 |t|) # sexF 0.299433 0.123656 2.421 0.01552 * # sexM 0.553054 0.036698 15.070 |t|) # (Intercept) 0.299433 0.123656 2.421 0.01552 * # sexM 0.253621 0.128987 1.966 0.04937 * # age 0.007743 0.002941 2.633 0.00852 ** # sexM:age -0.005947 0.003091 -1.924 0.05444 . Note in the examples how the reported coefficients change depending on the terms included. I believe that Example C is probably the model you are interested in, unless you have good reason otherwise. We will ignore questions of statistical or practical significance and causation for the sake of clarity, focusing on interaction coefficient interpretation instead. The risk of death is 0.254 greater for males compared to females. The risk of death increases 0.008 per year of age. The increase in risk of death is 0.006 less per year of age among males compared to females. (Also note that the intercept is rather meaningless here. It is, I believe, the risk of death among females at age 0.) In more lay terms, age increases the risk of death among females more so than among males. However, on average, males are at higher risk of death compared to females. Update Just to round out the coefficient interpretations for Examples A and B: Example A: The risk of death among females at age 0 is 0.299 The risk of death among males at age 0 is 0.553 Each additional year of age increases risk by 0.008 among females Each additional year of age increases risk by 0.002 among males While the first two coefficients are rather meaningless, due to the extrapolation of age to 0, the difference between 0.553 and 0.299 is 0.254, which is the sexM coefficient in Example C. Also, 0.002 - 0.008 is -0.006, which is the sexM:age interaction coefficient in Examples B and C. Example B: The risk of death among females at age 0 is 0.299 The risk of death among males at age 0 is 0.553 The risk of death increases 0.008 per year of age. The increase in risk of death is 0.006 less per year of age among males compared to females. Further update To bring this back to your original question: Intercept: .724 [Gender = 1.00]: .140 [Gender = 2.00]: 0 [Gender = 1.00] * Income: .620 [Gender = 2.00] * Income: .690 The risk of purchasing among females at income 0 is 0.724 The risk of purchasing among males is 0.140 greater than females Each additional unit income increases risk of purchase by 0.620 among males Each additional unit income increases risk of purchase by 0.690 among females Thus: The increase in risk of purchasing per unit income is 0.690 - 0.620 = 0.070 greater among females compared to males Note As whuber notes in comments above, proper interpretation of the coefficients assumes you have looked into proper regression diagnostics, you can defend your model, and that the data are from a valid study. For example, instead of linear regression, logistic or poisson regression (with standard errors calculated with a sandwich estimator) would be much better, as the outcome is binary.
