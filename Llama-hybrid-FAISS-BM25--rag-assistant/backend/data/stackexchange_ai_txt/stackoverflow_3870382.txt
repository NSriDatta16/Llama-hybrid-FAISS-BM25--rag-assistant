It really does depend on the file format. Ideally, you find some documentation on how the file works, and use that. This is easy if the file uses a public format, so for HTML files or PNG files you can easily find that information. Proprietary formats often have published spec's too, or at least a publicly available API for manipulating them, depending on the company's policy on actively encouraging this sort of extension. Next best is using examples of working code (whether published source or reverse engineered in itself) that deal with the file as a reference implementation. Otherwise, reverse engineering is as good as you can do. Opening it in notepad and a hex editor (even with a binary format, looking at it parsed as text can tell you something; even with a text-based format, looking at it in a hex editor can tell you if they are making use of non-printable characters) is indeed the way to go. It's a detective job and while sometimes easy, often very hard, esp. since you may miss ways they deal with edge-cases that aren't hit in the samples you use.
