AFAIK facebook's API does not allow this. The only approach that I know of at the moment would be to write a screen scraper to do these posts using the format described by tam7t's answer. If you use the mobile version of facebook's site (m.facebook.com) it makes it much easier. NOTE: This might be a violation of Facebook's Application TOS. Edit: Here is some ruby code that will do the trick, using the Mechanize Gem require 'mechanize' agent = Mechanize.new agent.user_agent_alias = 'Mac Safari' page = agent.get('http://m.facebook.com') form = page.forms.first # enter credentials form.pass = 'user password' form.email = 'user@example.com' page = agent.submit form # go straight to page to post on page = agent.get("http://m.facebook.com/wall.php?id=PAGE_ID_NUM") form = page.forms.first form.message = "@[139730900025:PhotoGrabber] is awesome" page = agent.submit form NOTE: Obviously (as tiagoboldt kindly pointed out) it would be wrong to store / utilise the credentials of other people in your application. This approach would only be appropriate for making posts from a facebook account that you controlled. That said, back to the original question of putting an @mention in a wall post, I have noticed that whilst the post and @mention go up on the wall fine, this method does not propagate the post to the mentioned user/page's wall. Not sure if that is important to you.
