Statistical test for multiple time measures, categorical dependent variable, percentages

What test would fit for the following research question? Data: measured in 5 subsequent years, is within design Dependent variable = A is categorical and ordinal Independent variables = B, C, D and E, where D and E are categorical and ordinal and B and C are both numerical. I would like to test whether a change in B or a change in C over two or multiple time measurements is more responsible for a change in A. Hypothesis = when B increases by x, this gives a stronger rise in A than when C increases by x. Hereby controlling on D and E and keeping these variables constant so that they don't create noise. First I thought about a logistic regression, and that the b√®ta-coefficients can explain whether the effect of B or C is stronger on A. However, I would like to compare 2 years with each other. So how can this be done?
