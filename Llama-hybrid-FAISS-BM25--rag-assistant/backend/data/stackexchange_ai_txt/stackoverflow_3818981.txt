If you are just using the fields for incremental value, you can use the master table. But if you wish to save extra parameters to a vote or view, you should use a secundary table. e.g. You want to save which user voted which value on which date. Than you should add a table 'votes' with the fields: voteId, userId, rating, date. Afterwards you can use the AVG function to calculate the avarage vote.
