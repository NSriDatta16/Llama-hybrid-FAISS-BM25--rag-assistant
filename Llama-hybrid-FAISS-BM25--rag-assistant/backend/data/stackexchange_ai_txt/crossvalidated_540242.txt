Difference between decision tree and logistic regression for multi-class classification

What's the difference (Advantages and Disadvantages) between decision tree and logistic regression for multi-class classification? I referenced some answers of decision tree ( not sure all right and complete ): Advantages: easy for understanding and interpretation; more suitable to deal with samples with missing feature values. Disadvantages: easy for Overfitting; easy to ignore the correlation of features in the data set. I don't much understand: Overfitting: logistic regression is also easy for overfitting, therefore we will use regularization. For tree, the techniques like pruning, bagging e.t.c are also used to avoid overfitting. How could we say that tree is easy for overfitting compared with regression? Correlation: How to understand that the tree ignores the correlation between features? In regression, we also want to reduce the collinearity between features, does the linear model capture the correlation between features? Are there any other important differences missed?
