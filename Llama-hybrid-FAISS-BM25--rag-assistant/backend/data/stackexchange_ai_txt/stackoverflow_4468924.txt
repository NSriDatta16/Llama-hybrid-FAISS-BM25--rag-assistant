I'm not sure I understand your question, but it seems like you want to add all the rows returned by each proc to a collection, without any duplicates. If so, I suppose you could use a Set Set rowResults = [] as Set Sql sql = // instantiate using a Connection, DataSource, or whatever List spCallStrings = [] // add the SQL strings that calls each proc to this List spCallStrings.each { spCallString -> rowResults.addAll(sql.rows(spCallString)) }
