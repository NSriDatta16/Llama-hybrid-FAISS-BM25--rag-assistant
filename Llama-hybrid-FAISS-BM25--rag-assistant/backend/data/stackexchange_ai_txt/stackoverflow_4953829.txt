http://docs.python.org/library/urlparse.html edit: It returns a tuple of the url parameters. If you absolutely need to have it be in a dictionnary looks like you will have to implement it yourself. (get the tuple then assign it to dict) string = "addressing scheme network location path query fragment_identifier".split() url = urlparse.urlsplit("url") dictionary = dict(zip(string,url)) Not sure if that dictionary line is valid, but it's something like that.
