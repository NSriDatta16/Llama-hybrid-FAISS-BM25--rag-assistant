iOS 4 with MDM features how to implement it?

Can any one help me to give me some answers on the below mention Queries: (i) Do we need to enroll for Enterprise Developer Program to implement MDM for iOS4.0. We also have some client agent . But I found some applications like "MobileIron" in AppStore which provides the MDM service. (ii) I have used the iPhone Configuration utility and tried to install the MDM payloads, it gives out error in installation. So i tried hosting the file in the secure web server and hit the link in the safari browser, but it gives out a error like "Safari Could not install the profile due to unknown error". (iii) I have checked and couldn't find any information on pushing the Configuration profile from server to device through Push Notification. But in your blog under iPhone MDM topic , it has been mentioned that through push notification service, remote commands and querying the device is possible. So can you give any format that we have to follow in order to push the configuration profiles to the device so that the MDM service running in the background does the rest without user intervention. I am looking forward to hear from any one and I will be highly obliged if anyone can guide me with answers for the above. Thanks.
