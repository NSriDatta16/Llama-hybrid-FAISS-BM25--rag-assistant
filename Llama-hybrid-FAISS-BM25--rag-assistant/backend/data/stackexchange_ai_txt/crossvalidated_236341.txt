I would use MySQL to organize the data and then access it through R or Python (see RMySQL package for R or MySQLdb for Python). MySQL allows you to structure and manage your complex data, and for the actual statistical analysis you can fetch only the data you need. To complete the answer (thanks to @Ian_Fin for the observation): For data extraction I think you need to create a php/java program to parse your different files and then save them to the database.
