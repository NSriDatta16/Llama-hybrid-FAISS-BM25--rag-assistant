For MVC2 you need Futures. Get the dll, add reference to it and in Global.asax add (Application_Start): ValueProviderFactories.Factories.Add(new JsonValueProviderFactory()); Don't know about MVC3 - I'm waiting for an RTM. But I do encourage you to give it a go, as sending JSON up to Actions is a pure bliss ;-)
