You can use the CTE s (which can be nested and reused): WITH sub AS ( SELECT *, LastName + ', ' + FirstName AS FullName FROM Employees ), moresub AS ( SELECT *, Title + ' ' + FullName AS TitledName FROM sub ) SELECT FullName FROM moresub WHERE moresub.TitledName = 'Mr. Bertrand, Aaron' UNION ALL SELECT FullName FROM moresub WHERE moresub.FullName = 'Doe, John' Update: Seems I misunderstood your question. In MySQL , you can use the SELECT list aliases in ORDER BY , GROUP BY and HAVING clauses: SELECT id + 1 AS myalias FROM ( SELECT 1 AS id UNION ALL SELECT 2 AS id ) q GROUP BY myalias HAVING myalias , but MySQL is known for poor handling of the nested queries, so this ability is vital for performance. Most probably that the other systems (which handle the nested queries and the CTE s quite well) just decided that they have more important things to implement.
