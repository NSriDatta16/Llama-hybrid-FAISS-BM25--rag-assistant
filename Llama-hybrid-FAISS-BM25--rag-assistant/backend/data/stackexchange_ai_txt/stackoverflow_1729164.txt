Fastest Algorithm to scale down 32Bit RGB IMAGE

which algorithm to use to scale down 32Bit RGB IMAGE to custom resolution? Algorithm should average pixels. for example If I have 100x100 image and I want new Image of size 20x50. Avg of first five pixels of first source row will give first pixel of dest, And avg of first two pixels of first source column will give first dest column pixel. Currently what I do is first scale down in X resolution, and after that I scale down in Y resolution. I need one temp buffer in this method. Is there any optimized method that you know?
