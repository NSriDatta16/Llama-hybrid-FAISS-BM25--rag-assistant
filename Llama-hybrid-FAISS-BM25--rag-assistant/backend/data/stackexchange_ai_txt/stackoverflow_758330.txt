Definitive dot.net Single Sign-On Solution - Develop, Steal, or Buy?

The problem: We have several dozen one off applications in our environment scattered across a dozen servers. Some apps are secured with one-off form/db based logins. Some apps have permissions defined in web.config. Some apps have folder level NTFS permissions set (some with domain user accounts, some with local user accounts for external users). Needless to say, this is an absolute mess. An SSO solution is definitely in order, but should I build one, leverage an existing FOSS one, or buy one (and if so, which ones?) I need to be able to authenticate once via form login and naturally the login token would carry from server to server mix-and-match domain accounts (preferred) and create db table accounts for external users have centralized role/permission management in situations where users authenticate with an AD/domain account, use this same account to allow whatever application they're using to connect to a database via integrated authentication a portal would be nice If someone would provide some direction I'd be much obliged.
