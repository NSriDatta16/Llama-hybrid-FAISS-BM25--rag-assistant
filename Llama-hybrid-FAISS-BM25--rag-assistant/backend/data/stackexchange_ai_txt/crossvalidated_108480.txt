What is max-sum / max-product variant of loopy BP computing?

In (Nowazin and Lampert, Structured Learning and Prediction in Computer Vision , p. 29.), they say that in the max-sum variant of loopy belief propagation, the "variable max-beliefs are no longer interpretable as marginals but instead $\mu_i(y_i)$ describes the maximum negative energy achievable when fixing the variable $Y_i = y_i$." I understand that to mean that if we set $Y_i = y_i$, the maximum negative energy that the MRF can achieve across all variable assignments to other nodes (with $Y_i = y_i$ being fixed) is $\mu_i(y_i)$. Is that correct? In the next paragraph, they say: to recover a joint minimum energy labeling, we select for each variable $Y_i$ the state $y_i \in \mathcal{Y}_i$ with the maximum max-belief, $y_i^* = \text{argmax}_{y_i \in \mathcal{Y}_i} \mu_i(y_i) \text{ } \forall i \in V$. How is this a joint minimum energy labelling? I don't see how this chooses the $y_i$ such that their pair-wise interaction terms are considered. It looks like it considers each on its own, selecting the $y_i$ such that the selection of the other variables could result in a maximum given that selection of $y_i$, but then it goes on to select the other $y$ locally as well, without consideration of this $y_i$. Is this "joint minimum energy labelling" not a global minimum energy labelling? If not what is meant by "joint"?
