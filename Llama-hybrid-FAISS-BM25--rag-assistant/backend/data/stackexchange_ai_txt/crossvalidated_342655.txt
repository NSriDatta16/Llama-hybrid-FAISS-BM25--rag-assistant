The problem is not in the methods to answer, but in the question: telling if the effect is different from 0 The effect or the coefficient or whatever have a distribution density. But given, that 0 is a point on a real scale, it has a probability of zero to begin with. There is an infinite number of points on the real scale and if each of them had a probability $P > 0$, than the sum of their probabilites would be larger then one, which cannot be. The coefficient or the effect being in any given interval, has a probability, the coefficent or the effect being one exact value is zero. Please read about the concept of "Region of Practical Equivalence (ROPE)" and you will find good answers how to proceed. vs. the probabiltiy that the effect is null or opposite The probability of the effect being null or opposite is identical with the probability of it being opposite. Still, this is a valid way to proceed. E D I T: After I posted my answer, you edited the question from "different from 0" to "different (in the common sense)". Now this is a mathematical question and it needs a precise definition of different. "different in the common sense" is not precise. You can compute with numbers, not with senses. You will have to define, what difference is "different enough", and that is what you do, when you define the ROPE (which I advised to look up above). Trying to test, whether a true real value is really different from a point (e.g., zero) is one of the oddities of Frequentism, that brings people to Bayesian methods.
