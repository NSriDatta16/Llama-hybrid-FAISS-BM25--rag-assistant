Which accuracy is called the accuracy of a deep learning model?

I have developed a deep learning model, to predict whether an image is affected by a certain disease or not. Accuracies of 99.8%, 88.8%, and 89% have been achieved on the training set, testing set, and validation set respectfully. Iâ€™m going to publish my research work in a journal, therefore, whichever accuracy will be the accuracy of my deep model? If I say the accuracy of 99.8% is the accuracy of my model, is it justified?
