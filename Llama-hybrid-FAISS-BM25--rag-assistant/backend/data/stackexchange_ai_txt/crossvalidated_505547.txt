Point estimate and confidence interval for the difference in $x_1$ between two groups for which a particular $y$ is achieved

I have two variables (continuous $x_1$ , control/treatment $x_2$ ) that I want to use to predict a probability. Domain knowledge suggests that the relationship is roughly linear in the log-odds, so I am going with a logistic regression on the two variables and their interaction. $$ \log\Bigg( \dfrac{p}{1-p} \Bigg) = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \beta_3 x_1x_2 $$ Unlike for my previous work with GLM inference, we are interested in a particular probability $p_0$ and by how much the two groups differ in their $x_1$ value when $p_0$ is reached. For a model of each group individually, this is easy. Just fit the model for that group and calculate the $x_1$ for which $p_0$ is achieved. For the two-variable model, however, I am stumped. Worse, I would like a confidence interval, and my na√Øve approach of considering the upper and lower confidence limits of the parameters $^{\dagger}$ is giving me confidence intervals that are too wide ( $95\%$ confidence interval has $100\%$ coverage in $500,000$ Monte Carlo iterations). How can I estimate the difference in $x_1$ for which $p_0$ is achieved and give a corresponding confidence interval? $^{\dagger}$ A reference my boss sent my way calculates the confidence interval by taking the lower confidence limits for each parameter, writing a model with those as the parameter estimates, finding $x_1$ that gives $p_0$ , and then doing it all again for the upper confidence limits. I had a feeling that this method would be inadequate for a confidence interval of $x_1$ giving $p_0$ .
