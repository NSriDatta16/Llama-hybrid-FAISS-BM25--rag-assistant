Why beta regression?

According to http://r-statistics.co/Beta-Regression-With-R.html , the topline remark is: Beta regression is used when you want to model Y that are probabilities themselves Grammar aside, one may assume that using the default specification, the beta-regression will provide log-odds ratios for response. But why should this method be preferred over quasibinomial regression? Suppose I generate the Y according to the following probability model: $$ \text{logit} (p) = -2 + 0.5 x$$ with the design so that $x = [-3.0, -2.9, \ldots, 2.9, 3.0]$ and represent $Y$ according to fractions of 10 independent Bernoulli replications. `%in%` r[1]& x In this simulated example, even with small replications, the coverage of the quasibinomial model is much closer to the nominal 80% CI limit whereas the beta regression is anticonservative, achieving approximately 70% coverage. Is this not the correct way to construct CIs for a betareg model? Or is this not the appropriate interpretation of covariate values? > rowMeans(out) cover1 cover2 0.787 0.699
