Jquery address: unable to handle incoming deeplinks?

I am using this plugin with AJAX based loading on my page, which handles everything pretty well to be honest, except when i try to catch incoming links that do not have a hash fragment in them. Address Bar incoming link-> hostname.com/path/ user navigates to another ajax state-> hostname.com /path/ #hash Here i am expecting the plugin not to include the path into the address bar because the hash is representing this. AJAX GET incoming link-> hostname.com/path/ user navigates to another ajax state-> hostname.com/path/ The actual request does load the correct state. is there any way to have it not add the path to the address bar? e.g hostname/#web-development instead of: hostname/web-development/#web-development Click handling $('a.internalLink').live('click', function(event) { event.preventDefault(); clickedLink = $(this); $.address.value(clickedLink.attr('href').replace(base,'')); });
