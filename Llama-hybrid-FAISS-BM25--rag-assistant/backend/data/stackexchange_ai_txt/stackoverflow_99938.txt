When you use a dynamic text field, you have two options - either you embed (part of) the font into your SWF, or you use device fonts. If you embed, then the actual character shapes will be built into your SWF; if you don't, then you're including only the font's name - and if the OS doesn't have any fonts of that name, it will choose a default instead. From your issues with the field you copied from another file, it sounds like you may have missed the "Embed" settings. Look for the button labeled "Embed settings" or similar in the Property Inspector. If you choose to Embed, then you are guaranteed that your text will render in Arial on all platforms. However, this only holds true for the characters you embed. If you embed only the capital letters, and then set the text to "Hello", on the screen all you'll see is "H". (Be careful of embedding the entire font - for full unicode fonts that will be several megabytes, since they include Japanese and Chinese and so on.) If you choose not to embed, then to avoid the problems you're having you should probably use one of the "device" fonts listed first in your font menu: _sans, _serif, _typewriter . In nearly all cases, these will translate to Arial, Times, and Courier on the PC, and similar fonts on the Mac.
