How do I force Firefox to redraw a video element?

I'm developing a dynamic html pop-up window (an absolute positioned div) using jQuery that automatically centers itself on the screen. It can also accommodate content that fits or exceeds the dimensions of the window screen. The idea is that our customer clicks a "read more" link next to our product listing and then this pop-up window comes up and displays its sales letter. Each sales letter also contains a video that further describes the product. The pop-up window will remain at the center of the screen until it is dismissed by either clicking the close button in the window or clicking outside of it. It remains in the center by adjusting its absolute positioning based upon where the user scrolls and if they resize the window. My problem is in the video element. In all other browsers except Firefox (of all things) the video is rendered perfectly within the pop-up window as the user scrolls around the document or resizes the video. However, in Firefox, when the user scrolls/resizes and the pop-up window adjusts its absolute positioning the video looks like it smudges from where it was originally to where it is now or the video screen goes transparent. I thought maybe what needed to be done is force Firefox to redraw the video screen. I tried a few different ways to accomplish this. Simply making the element disappear and reappear quickly didn't seem to do the job. However, if I quickly adjusted its margins or position back and forth, it seemed to work. At first, I was going to go with this solution. But then, as I began to test it across other browsers, this "wiggling" motion seemed to slow down the browser, specifically I noticed it in Chrome (I haven't tested it on the other browsers yet). I thought about limiting this fix to Firefox, but the browser data field in jQuery was deprecated in 1.3. I could always make the javascript myself to identify the browser, but I was wondering if there was a better way to go about forcing the browser to redraw the video element. Or maybe I'm on the wrong track and it doesn't need to be redrawn. I'm using FireFox 3.0.1, Chrome 1.0.154.48, Internet Explorer 7 and Safari 3. Any input would be appreciated :) Here's the code for the wiggleVids function: **Update: I changed the code so that way embeded elements are wiggled only when the popup box's position has changed, instead of binding it to the window scroll function. This has sped up chrome's execution a little, but its still not there quite yet. Its still a noticeable lag. **Update 2: Following Lee's suggestion, I changed the code so that the embeded videos in the popup window are stored in an array. This way, when this function gets executed the browser won't have to search the DOM again and again for the embeded objects. myVids is globally declared and cleared when the popup closes. function wiggleVids3() { if ( myVids.length 0 ) { for( var ctr = 0; ctr
