Joella, what proportion of study subjects have a zero health care cost? If the proportion is sizeable, you could consider a so-called two-stage model . In the first stage, you can use a binary logistic regression, for example, to model the log odds (hence the probability) of having a non-zero cost (i.e., a positive health care cost) as a function of various relevant factors (e.g., treatment, age, gender). This first stage would use the data from all of your study subjects. In the second stage, you can use either a linear model or a generalized linear model to model the expected value of health care costs among those who had a positive health care cost as a function of relevant factors. This second stage would use the data from just those study subjects with a positive health care cost. See: https://www.herc.research.va.gov/include/page.asp?id=analyzing-cost-data
