DTO is an acronym for Data Transfer Object, a design pattern used in transferring data through internal or external interfaces. A DTO protects the application's internal data by acting as dummy storages, the whole logic is implemented only in actual Domain Objects (DO). Pros: Fewer remote calls (typically one, getDto() vs. individual getId() , getName() , etc.) Improved data capsulation (Remote systems need only to know the details of the DTO, not DO internals) Cons: class explosion conversions needed between DTOs and DOs
