What model should I choose for Jobs recommender system?

Now, I have enormous number of resumes of someone who search for next jobs. There are infomation about how old they are, what schools they graduated,and what jobs they experienced.etc... I want to make a recommender system using those data. In the system, if I get new resume, I want to recommend certain jobs for him. I have some idea what models will I use, for example, collaborative filtering, recurrent neural network, word2vec etc... But I couldn't find best method for this problem. If someone Knows good idea, please tell me that. This is an example of one data, [age,education,skills,past_job1,job1's occupational category, past_job2,job2's occupational category, ...,] All data is stored in string.
