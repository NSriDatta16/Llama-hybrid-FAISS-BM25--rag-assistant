How to organize your Controllers to get the best structure (MVC)

Whats the best way to organize controllers. Lets say I have a user controller and a register action, should I have a process_registration action as well where I validate and process the data, or just do all processing within the register action itself. Should I have a validation/processing action for every action that requires it (register, process_registration.. etc.) I also notice that a lot of people have modules and controllers solely for validating and processing information, ( I guess to keep all validation logic and rules in one spot maybe?) I guess my question is, how far apart do things have to be separated? This question goes for Models and Views as Well.
