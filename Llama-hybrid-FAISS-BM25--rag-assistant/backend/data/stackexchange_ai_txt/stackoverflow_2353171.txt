Instead of div.thedialog , give div#thedialog . the . is used with class names and # is used when you are working with ids. ( Also, if this is the actual code you used, there was a missing bracket :) ) The working code: $(document).ready(function() { $('div#thedialog').dialog({ autoOpen: false }) $('#thelink').click(function(){ $('div#thedialog').dialog('open'); }); }) Your files have downloaded successfully into the My Downloads folder.
