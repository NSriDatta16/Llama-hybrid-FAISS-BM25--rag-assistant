"Not working" is very generic. What is it that you expect and what is actually happening? You may want to turn error reporting on and see if any error is reported. In (X)HTML, nothing should be printed before the doctype. Are you trying to add something to the HTTP response? Typically, the browser shouldn't effect how PHP outputs your code unless you've added some code to respond to the user agent which is not always wise. Perhaps, when you tried your code in another directory it wasn't able to find the offending script as it is included by a relative path. Try removing the include in the original file and see if it "works".
