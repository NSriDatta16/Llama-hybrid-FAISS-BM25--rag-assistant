From the MySQL 5.0 Manual : Values in VARCHAR columns are variable-length strings. The length can be specified as a value from 0 to 255 before MySQL 5.0.3, and 0 to 65,535 in 5.0.3 and later versions. The effective maximum length of a VARCHAR in MySQL 5.0.3 and later is subject to the maximum row size (65,535 bytes, which is shared among all columns) and the character set used. I only use VARCHAR when I'm certain that the data the column needs to hold will never exceed a certain length, and even then I'm cautious. If I'm storing a text string I tend to use one of the TEXT types. Check out the MySQL Storage Requirements for more information on how the bytes are used.
