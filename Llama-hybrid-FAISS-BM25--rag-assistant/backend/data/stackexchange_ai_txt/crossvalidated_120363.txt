random forest variables importance with continuous and categorical variables and unbalanced output

I am a bit lost in the literature regarding the random forest importance. I am aware that there are different methods. I have a binary output variables where elements labelled with 0 are much more than the ones labelled with 1. 5 variables are used as input. Some of them are continuous and some others are categorical. Given a dataset of this type I am wondering what is the best method to asses variables importance with Random Forest and if this is available in any R or python library. I know that the standard approach based the Gini impurity index is not suitable for this case due the presence of continuous and categorical input variables
