No, these tests cannot be applied on residuals. Same set of critical values cannot be used for residuals as for X and Y. But in many websites and YouTube tutorials they have wrongly used the same critical values. Although the test statistic are constructed in the same way. When the tests are applied to the residuals from a spurious regression, the critical values that are used to interpret test statistic are different from those employed in case of x and y. The critical values found in MacKinnon (1991) or Engle and Yoo (1987) should be used . Here's the link for MacKinnon (1991): https://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=http://qed.econ.queensu.ca/working_papers/papers/qed_wp_1227.pdf&ved=0ahUKEwig9rCm1qTYAhUIOY8KHZhyDQ4QFggmMAA&usg=AOvVaw2y5Z4Hz4SvjxOUvYnWioVc . Here the critical values for Co integrating tests are calculated. Currently there is no package in R which has this. So you would be required to manually calculate these values using the number of observations and the type of test: "no constant", "no trend" or "with trend". Now your second question, if residuals are stationary, can I ignore the non-stationarity of X any Y variables in this model? Is it possible only due to cointegration? First of all before checking Cointegration you should make sure that they are I(1). According to the definition of Cointegrated series in Time series Analysis by Hamilton, "An nx1 vector time series yt is said to be Cointegrated if each of the series taken individually is I(1) while some linear combination of the series is stationary or I(0)." If they are Cointegrated then you can use a Cointegration model to estimate their relationship. Or you can fit a dynamic regression using auto.arima() function in R where in the residuals are an ARIMA process. See: https://www.otexts.org/fpp/9/1 So yeah, in dynamic regression you ignore their non-stationarity if they are Cointegrated. I will soon edit this answer and add a solid answer to "what is the way forward when Cointegration is not detected?"
