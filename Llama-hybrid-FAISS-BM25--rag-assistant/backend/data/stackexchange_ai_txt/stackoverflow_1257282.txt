URL Checker in Clojure?

I have a URL checker that I use in Perl. I was wondering how something like this would be done in Clojure. I have a file with thousands of URLs and I'd like the output file to contain the URL (minus http://, https://) and a simple :1 for valid and :0 for false. Ideally, I could check each site concurrently, considering that this is one of Clojure's strengths. Input http://www.google.com http://www.cnn.com http://www.msnbc.com http://www.abadurlisnotgood.com Output www.google.com:1 www.cnn.com:1 www.msnbc.com:1 www.abadurlisnotgood.com:0
