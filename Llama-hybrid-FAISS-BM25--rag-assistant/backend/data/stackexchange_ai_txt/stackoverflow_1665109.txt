jQuery is the most popular (especially but not exclusively on Stack Overflow), but I don't have much personal experience with it. Dojo is the second most popular (measuring by search hits on the web for "X javascript" for various framework names as X) and my personal favorite (highly modular, clean "pythonic architecture", rich, always in the vanguard providing browser-independent access to new features such as [[in the recent past]] browser-local storage &c).
