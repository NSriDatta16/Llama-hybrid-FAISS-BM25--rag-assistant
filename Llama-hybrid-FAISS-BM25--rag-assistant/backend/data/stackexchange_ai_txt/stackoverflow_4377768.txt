Every time you alloc a new memory gets allocated for the new instance. to prevent memory leaks you should release before creating a new instance. svm=[[SubView alloc] initWithNib:@"SubView" bundle:nil] //Show svm here [svm release]; svm=[[SubView alloc] initWithNib:@"SubView" bundle:nil] //Show svm here [svm release]; svm=[[SubView alloc] initWithNib:@"SubView" bundle:nil] //Show svm here [svm release]; BTW when you add your svm as a subview into another view it gets retained by it's super view and you can safely release if it's no longer needed to be accessed directly by your code.
