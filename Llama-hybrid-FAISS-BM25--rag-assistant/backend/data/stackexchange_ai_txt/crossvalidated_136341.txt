This is the key passage in the Wikipedia entry for the t test : It can be used to determine if two sets of data are significantly different from each other. As @whuber notes, this is actually wrong in a way that may seem like nitpicking: a t test actually assesses whether the means of two data sets differ significantly. For instance, you might have two samples of Daphnia , which you collected from two different puddles. You have collected a heart rate from each individual. You can then use a t test to test whether the average heart rates differ significantly between the two samples (e.g., because of pollution, nutrients or something else). To expand on the difference between "testing whether two sets of data are significantly different from each other" and "testing whether two sets differ significantly on their means ", assume that one set of heart rates is normally distributed around a mean of 100 with a standard deviation of 1, while the other is normally distributed around 100 with a standard deviation of 10. The t test will tell you truthfully that the means do not differ significantly ... although the variances are quite different. In R: set.seed(1) foo This may illustrate why people are asking for more information. It's really hard to answer a statistical question without knowing what the question is.
