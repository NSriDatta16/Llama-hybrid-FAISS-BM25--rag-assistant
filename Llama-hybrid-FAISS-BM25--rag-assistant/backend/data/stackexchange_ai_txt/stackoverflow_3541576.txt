Checking for every possible scenario is not very good strategy. A file that exists on line 39 could easily be gone by line 45. Large object heap fragmentation is also something that is quite hard to spot and a very common reason to get a OOM exception. IMHO you should just try to do whatever you want with the file and handle the exceptions thrown by the IO layer.
