NameError: uninitialized constant Nokogiri::HTML::DocumentFragment

About three hours ago I started seeing the above error in my production server. It comes from a call to the sanitize gem: vendor/rails/activerecord/lib/../../activesupport/lib/active_support/dependencies.rb:276:in 'load_missing_constant' vendor/rails/activerecord/lib/../../activesupport/lib/active_support/dependencies.rb:468:in `const_missing' vendor/gems/sanitize-1.2.0/lib/sanitize.rb:91:in `clean!' vendor/gems/sanitize-1.2.0/lib/sanitize.rb:84:in `clean' vendor/gems/sanitize-1.2.0/lib/sanitize.rb:49:in `clean' app/helpers/application_helper.rb:28:in `display_none' app/views/main/_blogs.html.erb:13:in `_run_erb_47app47views47main47_blogs46html46erb' The error only occurs on the production server (linux), not my development machine (windows) I tried rolling back my latest deployment but it didn't fix it. I've updated to sanitize 1.2.0 (which was the latest version brought down by gem update sanitize , though I note my host is running 1.3.6. Can anyone provide any clues to help fix this?
