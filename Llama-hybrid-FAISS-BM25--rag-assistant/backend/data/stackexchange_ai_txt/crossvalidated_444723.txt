Linear model and confidence level issues in R

Please again accept my apologies for my little knowledge in R. I', trying to get better! you help me so much, but im a biologist and my statisc knowledge is sadly low I have the following data set: Perc_Reacting,Pulses,IndMutant,Proportion 93,1,1,0.93 81,2,1,0.81 73,3,1,0.73 64,4,1,0.64 73,5,1,0.73 68,6,1,0.68 64,7,1,0.64 65,8,1,0.65 50,9,1,0.5 68,10,1,0.68 57,11,1,0.57 50,12,1,0.5 62,13,1,0.62 44,14,1,0.44 54,15,1,0.54 56,16,1,0.56 50,17,1,0.5 42,18,1,0.42 42,19,1,0.42 29,20,1,0.29 96,1,0,0.96 100,2,0,1 92,3,0,0.92 96,4,0,0.96 92,5,0,0.92 92,6,0,0.92 84,7,0,0.84 96,8,0,0.96 91,9,0,0.91 82,10,0,0.82 86,11,0,0.86 82,12,0,0.82 91,13,0,0.91 85,14,0,0.85 83,15,0,0.83 70,16,0,0.7 74,17,0,0.74 64,18,0,0.64 68,19,0,0.68 78,20,0,0.78 Propose a linear model to study the association of the percentage response variable reaction (without any transformation) with the Pulses variable and the IndMutant factor. I'm a bit lost because the Lm() functions gives a very weak model. any help would be nice Then, i need to Find the 95% confidence interval for the average percentage of mutants that react to 10 pulses of light in similar experimental conditions. I'm a bit lost on how to approach this in R, I know is easy but IÂ´m a bit stuck.. If anyone could help thanks and kind regards
