Everywhere I've seen the term used, LRU has referred to the last access (read or write) rather than the last store. This article confirms it: The LRU algorithm ensures that the object that is removed is one that is either no longer in active use or that was used so long ago that itâ€™s data is potentially out of date or of little value. It goes on to talk about items which are in "active use" - which to me strongly implies that it's access rather than storage... you wouldn't talk about something "actively being stored" unless you're halfway through actually writing it.
