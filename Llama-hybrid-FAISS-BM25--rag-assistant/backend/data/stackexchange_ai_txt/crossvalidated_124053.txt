null and alternative hypotheses

A group of 50 complete a national fitness test and get a mean score of 80 out of 100. The national average is 72 with standard deviation 6. Can we conclude the group of 50 is fitter than the national average. Let ${\mu}$ be the national average score. What are the null and alternative hypothesis? I'm really confused on this on. Its almost as if I should be using a difference of means test.
