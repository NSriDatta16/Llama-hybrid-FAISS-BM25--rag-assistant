The data needs to be seasonally differenced in Stata using the S. operator. As seen in Page 4 of tsset manual entry of Stata: https://www.stata.com/manuals13/tstsset.pdf The seasonal differencing operator needs to be used with the lag specified. The lag number is based on the type of time series data (quarterly, annual etc). As this is a quarterly data we use lag = 4 so the command is : gen d_lnoil = d.oil // differencing for trend gen d2_lnoil = s4.d_lnoil // seasonal differencing with lag = 4
