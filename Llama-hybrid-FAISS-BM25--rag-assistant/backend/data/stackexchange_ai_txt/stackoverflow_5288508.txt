it does sound like you code somewhere defines _ATL_FREE_THREADED. You could sprinkle... #ifdef _ATL_FREE_THREADED #pragma message ("hi") #endif ... between various include files to see if you can find the one that defines that macro. Before you do that though, have you checked to make sure it's not defined in the project properties (both at project and at cpp file levels)?
