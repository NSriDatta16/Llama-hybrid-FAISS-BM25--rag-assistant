When visualizing graph nodes, should I use apply PCA to node2vec embedding?

I am trying to visualize graph nodes using node2vec embedding. The node2vec embeddings has lengths of 50~100 dimensions. I have two plans: use umap to project node2vec embeddings to 2D space use PCA to project node2vec embeddings to a slightly lower-D space (~30-50 dimensions), and then use umap for 2D space outputs. Which plan is better?
