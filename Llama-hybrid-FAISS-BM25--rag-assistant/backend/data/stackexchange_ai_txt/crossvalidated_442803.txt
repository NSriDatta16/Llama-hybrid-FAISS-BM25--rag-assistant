Have log returns series almost always conditional mean zero? I presume no

I'm analyzing S&P500 stocks daily log-returns on the 505 time series of the biggest companies in the USA between 2014-01-01 and 2019-12-01. My task was to identify the ARMA-GARCH model of them. Fistly i ran Ljung-Box test, and only 44 of them seem to have some kind of (very weak) autocorrelation. For the remaining 461 I fitted an ARMA(0,0)+GARCH(p,q) and this seems to be ok, I can predict reasonably well volatility. Considering the 44 autocorrelated ts' ARMA component, I can see that ~40 of log-returns doesn't seem to fit in any relevant ARMA(p,q) + $\mu$ (I tried with auto.arima in R but also checked ACF and PACF before), meanwhile GARCH fit with ARMA(0,0)+GARCH(1,1) is great. Is this possible? No ARMA effect (zero conditional mean, no correlation with the return of the day before, only i.i.d shocks everyday) in daily returns for S&P500? I presume I'm doing something wrong, but the ACF and PACF don't lie: i can see zero autocorrelation almost everywhere. I really can't explain this.
