If you want to learn Machine Learning I strongly advise you enroll in the free online ML course in the winter taught by Prof. Andrew Ng . I did the previous one in the autumn and all learning material is of exceptional quality and geared toward practical applications, and a lot easier to grok that struggling alone with a book. It's also made a pretty low hanging fruit with good intuitive explanations and the minimum amount of math.
