VAR model ValueError: x already contains a constant

I'm using VAR model for multivariate time series. The structure is that although each variable is a linear function of past lags of itself and past lags of the other variables, one and/or two of the variables MAY NOT alter within the period under investigation. Out of 10 variables. Below is a similar dataframe to the one I'm working on. The actual dataset has 190 rows. x0 = [0,0,0,0,0] x1 = [0.011866,0.013380,0.015357,0.024451,0.030889] x2 = [0,2,2,3,3] x3 = [1,1,2,3,3] x4 = [0,0,0,0,0] T = ['2000-01-01', '2000-01-02', '2000-01-03', '2000-01-04', '2000-01-05'] TDT = pd.to_datetime(T) df = pd.DataFrame({'X0': x0, 'X1': x1, 'X2': x2, 'X3': x3, 'X4': x4}) df.index = TDT df model = VAR(df) result = model.fit(1) **ValueError: x already contains a constant** Is there a way to fix this?
