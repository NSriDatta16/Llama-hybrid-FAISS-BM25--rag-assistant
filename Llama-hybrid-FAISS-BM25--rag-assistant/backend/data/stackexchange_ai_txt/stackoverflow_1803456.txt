Windows Management Instrumentation offers event subscription. The nice thing with WMI is that it works remote too, using DCOM and SOAP. WMI offers the capability to notify a subscriber for any event it is interested in. WMI uses the WMI Query Language (WQL) to submit WQL event queries and defines the type of events to be returned. The eventing mechanism, with all related callbacks, is part of the WMI COM/DCOM and automation interfaces. A free WMI client implementation for Delphi is available online (not sure if it supports event callbacks): Magenta Systems WMI and SMART Component
