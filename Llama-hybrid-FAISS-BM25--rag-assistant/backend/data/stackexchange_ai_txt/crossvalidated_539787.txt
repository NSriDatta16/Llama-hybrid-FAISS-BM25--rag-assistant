How can I obtain a confidence interval for the difference between two probabilities from a binary logistic regression model?

I saw this question here , but it doesn't have a clear answer. Suppose I have a simple logistic regression model with binary $x:$ $$\log(p/(1-p)) = \beta_0 + \beta_1x$$ Then I know: $$p/(1-p) = e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1x}$$ and $$p = e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1x}/(1 + e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1x})$$ So if $x=0,$ then the model becomes: $$\log(p/(1-p)) = \beta_0$$ and if $x=1,$ then the model becomes: $$\log(p/(1-p)) = \beta_0 + \beta_1$$ To obtain a confidence interval for $p$ when $x=0,$ I did this: model The confidence interval is (p_L, p_U). Then a confidence interval for p when x=1: sig_x1 = sqrt(Bigma[1,1] + Bigma[2,2] + 2*Bigma[1,2]) logit_p_x1 = coef(model)[1][[1]] + coef(model)[2][[1]] #beta_0 + beta_1 theta_L_x1 = logit_p_x1 - 1.96*sig_x1 theta_U_x1 = logit_p_x1 + 1.96*sig_x1 p_L_x1 = plogis(theta_L_x1) p_U_x1 = plogis(theta_U_x1) The confidence interval is (p_L_x1, p_U_x1). Now I would like a confidence interval for the difference in probability of success when $x=0$ and $x=1.$ I can obtain the point estimate of the difference: $$p_{x_1} - p_{x_0} = [e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1} - e^{\beta_0}]/[(1+e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1})(1+e^{\beta_0})]$$ I know the next step is to compute the standard error of the difference, but I don't know how to do this. Question : What is the formula and R code for a confidence interval for the difference in the two probabilities when $x=0$ and when $x=1?$
