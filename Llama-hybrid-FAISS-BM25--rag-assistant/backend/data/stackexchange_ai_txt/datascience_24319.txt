Are there free cloud services to train machine learning models?

I want to train a deep model with a large amount of training data, but my desktop does not have that power to train such a deep model with these abundant data. I'd like to know whether there are any free cloud services that can be used for training machine learning and deep learning models? I also would like to know if there is a cloud service, where I would be able to track the training results, and the training would continue even if I am not connected to the cloud.
