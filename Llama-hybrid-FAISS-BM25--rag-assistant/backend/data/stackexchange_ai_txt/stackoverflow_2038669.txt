You can handle the Silverlight 4 clipboard events and then check if focus on the RichTextBox and then simply add the content as a paragraph or other such elements. Have a quick search for Silverlight 4+Clipboard on Google for some good examples. You would need to handle checking the format of the clipboard text in your handler and then converting if necessary (e.g. plain text, text copied from another RichTextBox, HTML formnatted text etc). Hope that helps,
