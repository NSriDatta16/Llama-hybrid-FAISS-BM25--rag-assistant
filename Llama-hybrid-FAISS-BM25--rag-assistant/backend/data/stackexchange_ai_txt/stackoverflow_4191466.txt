There are several problems here. First of all, id s must be unique - they cannot repeat as you have done in the code you have here. Secondly, the display: none property is set on div.white_content , not li , so your selector should be li:eq(n) div.white_content . Even then this code should be easily rewritable to something neater, like this: $('div[id^=act]').click(function(){ var n = parseInt(this.id.substring(3), 10); $('li').eq(n-1).find('.white_content').fadeIn(400); }); Given your HTML, I think this is what you need: // For the two buttons $('div[id^=act]').click(function(){ var n = parseInt(this.id.substring(3), 10); $('li').eq(n-1).find('.white_content').fadeToggle(400); }); // For the close button $('.close').click(function(){ $(this).closest('.tos').fadeOut(400); }); You're using duplicate id s, which is invalid HTML. I've taken the liberty of changing them to classes, which is the correct way to do this. The closest function looks for the nearest ancestor that matches the selector, in this case the div that contains the elements. On a side note, since li are block level elements, you can skip the div and put all your contents in the li element directly, eliminating one layer of HTML.
