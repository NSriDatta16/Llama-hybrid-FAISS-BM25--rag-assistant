compute 95% confidence interval for predictions using a pooled model after multiple imputation?

I am conducting multiple imputation by chained equations in R using the MICE package, followed by a logistic regression on the imputed dataset. I need to compute a 95% confidence interval about the predictions for use in creating a plot—that is, the grey shading in the image below. I followed the approach described in the answer to this question... How are the standard errors computed for the fitted values from a logistic regression? ...which uses the following lines of code to yield the std.er of prediction for any specific value of the predictor: o But of course I need to adapt this code to the fact that I am using a model resulting from multiple imputation . In that context, I am not sure which variance-covariance matrix (corresponding to “vcov(o)” in the above example) I should be using in my equation to produce the "std.er". Based on the documentation for MICE I see three candidate matrices: ubar - The average of the variance-covariance matrix of the complete data estimates. b - The between imputation variance-covariance matrix. t - The total variance-covariance matrix. http://www.inside-r.org/packages/cran/mice/docs/is.mipo Based on trying all three, the b matrix seems patently wrong, but both the t and the ubar matrices seem plausible. Can anybody confirm which one is appropriate? Thank you.
