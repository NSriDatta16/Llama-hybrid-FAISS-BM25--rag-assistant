OWASP has a great selection of guides, example projects and test applications on the subject web application security. My personal favourite is the backend security project , which I used to prove to my manager that our internal systems needed a lot of attention, and just because backend security wasn't a user-perceived benefit, didn't mean it could be ignored. This project in particular gives some good advice for data validation, error handling, cryptography etc.
