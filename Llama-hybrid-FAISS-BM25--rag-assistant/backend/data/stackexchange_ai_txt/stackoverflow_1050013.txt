I can't think of a particularly elegant way to achieve this using only JavaScript. If that's all that's available to you, then I'd at least recommend you use a switch statement or (preferably) a hash table implementation to reference your functions. If I had to do something like this, given my development environment is fully under my control, I'd break up the JavaScript into individual files and then, having determined the request, I would use server side code to build a custom bundled JavaScript file and serve that. You can create cache copies of these files on the server and send client side caching headers too. This article , which covers this technique as part of a series may be of interest to you.
