How would you propose to diff and patch images? Figure that out and we can get right on it. Does this even make sense? Is someone ever editing the upper left corner of an image while someone else is editing the lower right? If you just want to see different "versions" of images with the same filename, that's trivial. Would get rather expensive on storage though.
