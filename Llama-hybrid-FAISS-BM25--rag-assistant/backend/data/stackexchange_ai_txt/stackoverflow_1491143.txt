Eclipse plugin not working in Ganymede but working in Galileo

i made a plugin in eclipse Galileo. my plugin has folowing dependencies: Require-Bundle: org.eclipse.ui;bundle-version="3.5.0", org.eclipse.core.runtime;bundle-version="3.5.0", org.eclipse.core.resources;bundle-version="3.5.0", org.eclipse.jdt.core;bundle-version="3.5.0", org.eclipse.jdt.ui;bundle-version="3.5.0" but since Ganymede has different versions of the above namely : Require-Bundle: org.eclipse.ui;bundle-version="3.4.2", org.eclipse.core.runtime;bundle-version="3.4.0", org.eclipse.core.resources;bundle-version="3.4.2", org.eclipse.jdt.core;bundle-version="3.4.2", org.eclipse.jdt.ui;bundle-version="3.4.2" The same plugin does not work in both. I have made two plugins for the time being one for Galileo and one for Ganymede with the above difference in manifest.mf Is it possible to make a plugin independent of type of eclipse because in future when newer version of eclipse would be made my plugin will be rendered useless. even though the tweaking needed is low ... is it possible to somehow make it independent I thought of putting the required plugins bundles (like org.eclipse.core.runtime;bundle-version="3.5.0") along with the plugin and instruct people to paste them along with my plugin jar in their plugin directory.is there a possibility that they might conflict with already existing lower version of plugins bundles?
