Why am I getting an 'explosive' GARCH on this series?

I am fairly new to time series econometrics and I am working with a series I want to model the in-sample second moments. I am not super sure that this is stationary, but I rely on the ADF saying that it is. This would imply that the variance shocks are explosive, and I don't see that in the data at all. How can I make sense of this?
