how to customize the pattern of a field in iReport?

Hi StackOverflow experts, I've darag n' droped a field into the iReport. This field holds the java.lang.BigDecimal expression class data returned by Query of the Report. In the MSSQL DataBase table this field has been defined as money. I've defined the pattern of this field as #,###0.00 separate the digits by comma from Right to Left order at each 3 digits(eg. 12,332,324.20).But I want the digits to be separated by comma in same order but at 3 digit interval for first time and at 2 digit interval for remaining digits(For eg.1,23,32,324.20). Please, suggest me.
