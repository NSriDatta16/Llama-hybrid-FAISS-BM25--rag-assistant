Deal with jQuery.ajax empty content response

I have following "jquery/javascript" code: $.ajax({ url: "PpbData", data: {RaidId: raidId}, success: function(text) { $('input#PpbData').val(text); }, dataType: 'text' }); code updates a textbox from server using AJAX. It works. But when the response is empty string - I get 'no element found' in firefox console. Not a big deal, but I'd like to get rid of the warning. Using asp.net mvc I generate response as follows: return Content(""); What would be a simple and elegant way to fix it? (I came up with few hacks, but I don't want a hack)
