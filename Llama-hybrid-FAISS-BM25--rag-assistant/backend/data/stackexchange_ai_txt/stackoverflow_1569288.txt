Properly-registered bots do not have to complete the captcha forms on Wikipedia. The user group rights page says that bots can, among other things: Perform captcha triggering actions without having to go through the captcha (skipcaptcha) You will need to get your bot account added to the bot group by a bureaucrat , and this usually takes place after acceptance by the Bot Approvals Group . Good luck!
