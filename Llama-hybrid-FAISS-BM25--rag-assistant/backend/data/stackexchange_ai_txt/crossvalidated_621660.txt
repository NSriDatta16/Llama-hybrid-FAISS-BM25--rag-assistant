Should I use a t-test or logistic regression in this scenario? Perhaps both are valid?

I am proposing a cross-sectional study that measures two variables. Variable A is measured using a questionnaire that returns a value at an interval scale. Variable B is measured as a dichotomous yes/no response (i.e. it is nominal). Suppose that literature suggests that A is a predictor of B (say, increased A is conceptually expected to affect the response to B being "yes"). Since this would imply that the conceptual framework considers A, a continuous numeric variable, as predicting B, a dichotomous outcome, it seems that logistic regression would be the appropriate test to be used. My question is: Are there conceptual grounds for choosing to utilize an independent samples t-test utilizing B as a grouping variable and comparing the means of A between the groups? Would the conceptual framework of A being the independent variable and B being the dependent variable still hold if a t-test were to be performed? For example, if I conclude that "A is significantly different between the groups B(yes) and B(no)," is it valid to claim that an association exists between them that is consistent with literature? The conflict here is that there seems to be an assertion (from what I've read) that independent samples t-tests should only be done if the grouping variable is the independent variable. However, I can say that reversing the framework into one that claims B as independent would not conceptually make sense. Perhaps this is all trivial and ultimately based on convention/argumentation/justification of the test to be used?
