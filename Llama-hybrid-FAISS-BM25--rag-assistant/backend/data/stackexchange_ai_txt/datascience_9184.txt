pandas is a python library for PAN-el DA-ta manipulation and analysis, i.e. multidimensional time series and cross-sectional data sets commonly found in statistics, experimental science results, econometrics, or finance. pandas is implemented primarily using numpy and Cython ; it is intended to be able to integrate very easily with other numpy -based scientific libraries, such as statsmodels . Main Features: Data structures: for 1, 2, and 3 dimensional labeled data sets (respectively Series , DataFrames and Panels ). Some of their main features include: Automatically aligning data and interpolation Handling missing observations in calculations Convenient slicing and reshaping ("reindexing") functions Categorical data types Provide 'group by' aggregation or transformation functionality Tools for merging / joining together data sets Simple matplotlib integration for plotting Date tools: objects for expressing date offsets or generating date ranges; some functionality similar to scikits.timeseries. Dates can be aligned to a specific timezone and converted / compared at-will Statistical models: convenient ordinary least squares and panel OLS implementations for in-sample or rolling time series / cross-sectional regressions. These will hopefully be the starting point for implementing other models Intelligent Cython offloading; complex computations are performed rapidly due to these optimizations. Static and moving statistical tools: mean, standard deviation, correlation, covariance Rich User Documentation , using Sphinx Resources: Docs Github Homepage Books: Python for Data Analysis Learning IPython for Interactive Computing and Data Visualization Mastering pandas for Finance
