I'm not sure you can compute a confidence interval for a single prediction, but you can indeed compute a confidence interval for error rate of the whole dataset (you can generalize for accuracy and whatever other measure you are assessing). If $e$ is your error rate while classifying some data $S$ of size $n$, a 95% confidence interval for your error rate is given by: $$ e \pm 1.96\sqrt{\frac{e\,(1-e)}{n}}$$. (see "Machine Learning" book from Tom Mitchell, chapter 5.) EDIT Guess I should state a more general case, which is: $$ e \pm z_N\sqrt{\frac{e\,(1-e)}{n}},$$ where common choices for $z_N$ are listed in the following table: confidence level 80% 90% 95% 98% 99% values of zN 1.28 1.64 1.96 2.33 2.58
