What is a good non cryptographic Hash for string feature translation?

What would be a good non cryptographic Hash function to use for converting string features to a numerical representation for feeding into machine learning algorithms? To explain the scenario my feature set has both categorical data (e.g.: Country ) and non categorical data (e.g.: IP Address , Email address ). I have used MurMur3 Hash function so far, is there some better algorithm?
