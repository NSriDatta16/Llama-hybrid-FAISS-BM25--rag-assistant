Speech recognition isn't as complex of an example as you think. First, imagine creating a Markov Chain (MC) that does text recognition. Your program reads a bunch of (perfect, without errors) text and calculate states (words) and state changes (next words). Sounds like you've gotten this down. You could now generate text, or given some text predict the next word using the states and transition probabilities of your MC. Now imagine that you want to use your MC with speech. You'll simply have people read text that's similar to your MC and you're set, right? Well... Except that they're going to pronounce the words differently: where the written text says "potato", you'll actually hear "po-TAY-toh" and "po-TAH-toh" and "pu-TAY-to", etc. And vice-versa: the text "ate" and "eight" represent two different states, but are (usually) pronounced the same. Your algorithm no longer sees the underlying states (words), it sees a probabilistic distribution of pronunciations for each word. Your original MC is hidden behind the pronunciations, and now your model needs to be two-layered. So you could get lots of people to read aloud the text that you used for your original training, you could get a distribution for the pronunciations for each word, and then combine your original model with the pronunciation model and you have a Hidden Markov Model (an HMM). Most real-world problems will be like this, since the real world tends to be noisy. You won't actually know what state something is in. Instead, you'll get a variety of indicators for each state: sometimes the same indicator for different states ("ate" and "eight") and sometimes different indicators for the same state ("pu-TAY-toe" and "pah-tah-TOE"). Hence, HMMs are more suitable for real-world problems. [Two side notes: 1) actual speech recognition works at the phoneme level, not word level, and 2) I believe that HMMs were the king of the hill for speech recognition, but have recently been dethroned by deep neural networks.]
