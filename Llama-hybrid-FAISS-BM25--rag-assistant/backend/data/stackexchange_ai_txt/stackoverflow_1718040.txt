If you want to use SOAP, a good place to start would be with Apache Axis which is a Java-based SOAP/WSDL framework - Axis also has the advantage of supporting RESTful services, which is perhaps more what you want. To get started you want to: Define your playlist data structures that will be passed around by your services and stored in your system Define the service interface - what are the list of operations you want the service to be able to do? What would be the inputs and outputs to each operation? Decide what your storage is going to be - flat file, DB, etc, and what is going to be stored & how. Implement it! If you're doing SOAP you'll want WSDL, XML schemas and service and client implementations. If you want your user interface to be Web browser based, but still must use SOAP, then you will need to create an HTML presentation layer that contains a SOAP client, that itself calls your SOAP service. For the HTML/SOAP client layer, you could use use one of the SOAP libraries for PHP or Javascript or something like Java servlets or JSPs.
