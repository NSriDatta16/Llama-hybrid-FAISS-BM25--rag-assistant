Type of statistical test for categorical variables?

What test am I supposed to use in this case: Categorical outcome [correct, partially incorrect, incorrect] Categorical predictors: Condition [2, 5 and 10 presentations of an image]. Time in which they were tested after the presentation [1 hour, 1 week, 1 month]. Condition was between subjects and time within subjects. Each participant was tested for 6 images (so I have 6 correct/incorrect/partially correct responses every time I tested them). What I want to know is if they will have less correct after a month compared to the first test (1 hour after the presentation), and if the number of presentations makes a difference. I though I needed to do a chi-squared test because all my variables are categorical, but my outcome is not yes/no or correct/incorrect. It has three levels instead. And I don't know if I should average the 0s, 1s and 2s OR add them up and treat it as a continuous variable ranging from 0 to 12 per time of test, and use an ANOVA. Since I'm measuring the same people three times, could I also use linear mixed models? I am using R, in case that's relevant. Thank you very much!
