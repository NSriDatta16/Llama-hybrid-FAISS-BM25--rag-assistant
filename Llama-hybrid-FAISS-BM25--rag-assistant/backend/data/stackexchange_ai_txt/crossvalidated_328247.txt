Error propagation of this sort is easy in MCMC-based Bayesian statistics. Instead of multiplying summary statistics of the posterior (like the means or medians), multiply the ACTUAL MCMC samples from the posterior chains. Since each iteration of the chain is a valid sample from the joint posterior distribution, you can do the multiplication at each iteration of the chain to get a new chain that represents samples from the posterior distribution of the derived parameter. Then, simply conduct your inference on this new chain (e.g. find the median, mode, credible interval, or whatever feature of the posterior you are interested in).
