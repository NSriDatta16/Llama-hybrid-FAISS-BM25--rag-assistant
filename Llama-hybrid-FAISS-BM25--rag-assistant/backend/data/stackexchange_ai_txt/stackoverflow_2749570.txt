See SD C++ Test Coverage . This is a family of (branch) test coverage tools for a variety of dialects of C++ (ANSI, GNU, MS...) that plays nicely even in actual embedded systems hardware by virtue of having a very small footprint, and having an easy way to export collected test coverage data. There's a GUI coverage display that isn't dependent on your actual embedded hardware, that will also produce a complete coverage report summary. [I'm a principal in the company that provides these tools.]
