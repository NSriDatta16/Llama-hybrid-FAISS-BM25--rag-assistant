How to measure / evaluate / report about the learning effect of repeated time measurements?

I conducted an experiment with 80 subjects, each of them performing 50 trials. I measured the time (in seconds) needed to accomplish each trial. Trial-after-trial, every subject has the tendency to get faster in accomplishing his task. I can clearly see that there is a kind of "learning effect". By watching at some plots (x=trial_number, y=time), I can see a descending curve that looks like stabilizing towards an asymptotic minimum after the 20th trial. I am looking for a statistical test that helps me stating, for example: "We observed that after an initial learning phase, from 28th trial the time to perform the task stabilizes on an average of 4.6 sec (sd=2.8)". What kind of numerical analysis can I use to formally report on this effect? How do I "measure" the learning effect? Such test should be useful also in comparing the learning effect between two conditions, where the average time will be anyway on a different scale. Following, an example of the behavior of a single subject. Time is measured with 1 second precision: And here a progressive boxplot considering the trials of every user (sorry, temporary labeling). One can see a trend in diminishing the average time needed to accomplish a trial:
