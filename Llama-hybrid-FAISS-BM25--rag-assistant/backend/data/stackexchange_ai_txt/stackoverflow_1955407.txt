Custom JavaScript as DOM node attribute to perform when it's ready

Can I add a custom JavaScript as some DOM node attribute to perform when it's ready like JavaScript added as "onClick" attribute performed when you click on it ? Suppose i need to process a div element with some funcMyTransform function. I think it'll be more elegant to write smth like this ... Instead of ... $(document).ready(function(){$("#MyElement").funcMyTransform()}); Is there such "onReady" attribute or something?
