SQL Query Count on Column Information

Using MySQL 5 with table "abrechnung" id datum title betrag wal jon al ben 7 2010-02-08 Essen 1362 0 0 1 0 8 2010-02-15 Essen 324 0 0 1 2 9 2010-02-15 Essen 5732 0 0 1 2 10 2010-02-15 Essen 3245 0 2 1 2 What I want in the end is: Each rows "betrag" is divided through a number and then added to the final result. The number that is divided through is 4 - the amount of 2 in the current row . My current approach is as follows: SELECT SUM(betrag) AS "W->A" FROM abrechnung WHERE (wal = "0" and al = "1"); This basically selects the entrys that I want to have added to the final result. Result in this case: 10663. Actually the final result shall be: 1362 / 4 (no number 2 in that row for wal, jon, al or ben) + 324 / 3 (there is one 2 in that row for ben) + 5732 / 3 (same) + 3245 / 2 (there are 2 2's in that row) ----------- 3 981.66 I hope this is clear to understand. Thank you.
