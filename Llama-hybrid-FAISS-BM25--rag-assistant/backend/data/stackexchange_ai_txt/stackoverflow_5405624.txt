Note that by using shared memory, texture memory, etc., it is sometimes possible to exceed theoretical bandwidth. That often means you're tapping into some dedicated hardware supported functions (such as built-in bilinear texture interpolation, etc.), perhaps unintentionally. Besides the reasons that Robert Harvey mentioned, there's also potentially factory overclock of cards by vendors (albeit more common for GeForce than Quadros). Overall, I'd say that you're doing well if you get close to or exceed the theoretical bandwidth (either in memory or compute).
