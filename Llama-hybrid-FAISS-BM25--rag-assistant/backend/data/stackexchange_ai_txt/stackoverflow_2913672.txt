Rapid Web Application Development ASP.net vs. Open Source Platforms

Good morning - I'm an intermediate-level developer who wants to build on online data-driven app (CRUD with a few calculations and basic HTML form inputs, nothing fancy) that keeps track of user sessions, and looks "professional" (or at least not "homemade"). I'm looking to develop something with the look-and-feel that users get from sites like: http://www.datamasher.org/ http://www.thisweknow.org/ (About page says it was made with Ruby on Rails, which I'm unfamiliar with) (stackoverflow.com) Any pointers on whether I should just go the Miscrosoft route, and develop in ASP.net with WebForms, or if there's a quick way to do this kind of development (with a WYSIWYG environment) on an open-source platform? If so, I'm willing to learn, if it's somethat intuitive, and I can use to quickly drag/drop, add code, and publish online. Templates would be a plus, too - I'm not a heavy HTML/CSS developer. I apologize is the question seems a bit vague.
