A model underfits when it is too simple with regards to the data it is trying to model. One way to detect such situation is to use the biasâ€“variance approach , which can represented like this: Your model is underfitted when you have a high bias. To know whether you have a too high bias or a too high variance, you view the phenomenon in terms of training and test errors: High bias: This learning curve shows high error on both the training and test sets, so the algorithm is suffering from high bias: High variance: This learning curve shows a large gap between training and test set errors, so the algorithm is suffering from high variance. If an algorithm is suffering from high variance: more data will probably help otherwise reduce the model complexity If an algorithm is suffering from high bias: increase the model complexity I would advise to watch Coursera' Machine Learning course , section "10: Advice for applying Machine Learning", from which I took the above graphs.
