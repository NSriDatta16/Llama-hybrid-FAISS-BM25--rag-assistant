No, but since the assignment itself is an expression, you can use the assignment as the conditional expression for the if statement. if (($value = md5(..)) == $somemd5) { ... } In general, though, you'll want to avoid embedding assignments into conditional expressions: The code is denser and therefore harder to read, with more nested parentheses. Mixing = and == in the same expression is just asking for them to get mixed up.
