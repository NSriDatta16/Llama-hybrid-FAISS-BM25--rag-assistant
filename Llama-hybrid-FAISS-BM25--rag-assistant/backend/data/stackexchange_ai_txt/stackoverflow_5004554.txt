You should use GIN, not deferred binding. Deferred binding is "is a technique used by the GWT compiler to create and select a specific implementation of a class based on a set of parameters. In essence, deferred binding is the Google Web Toolkit answer to Java reflection." (from Coding Basics ) In your scenario, you aren't trying to provide an implementation based on a set of parameters at compile time, but rather runtime. You can use GIN here in a number of ways. I would suggest having your Widget take via it's constructor the DataSource instance. See the GinTutorial on ways to do that. It does a much better job of explaining it than I can in a few paragraphs.
