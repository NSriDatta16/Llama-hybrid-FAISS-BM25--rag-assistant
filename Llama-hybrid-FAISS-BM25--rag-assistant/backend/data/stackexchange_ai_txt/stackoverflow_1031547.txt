Intermittent ADO Recordset object error in Classic ASP script

I'm very infrequently seeing the following error logged on a website I manage: Arguments are of the wrong type, are out of acceptable range, or are in conflict with one another When I access the classic ASP page myself, I cannot duplicate the problem. Notably, the user agent is nearly always: ia_archiver (+ http://www.alexa.com/site/help/webmasters ; crawler@alexa.com) The script is a product search page, which uses rather standard ASP paging. The relevant code looks like this: ... Set rs=Server.CreateObject("ADODB.Recordset") rs.CacheSize = iPageSize rs.PageSize = iPageSize rs.Open mySQL, Conntemp, adOpenStatic, adLockReadOnly, adCmdText ... I'm fairly sure that the cursor and lock type are correct. Obviously if they were wrong, I would expect the script not to work at all. The only thing I can think of, is that is is something to do with the recordset object still being open (and the connection pooled), while the Alexa spider hits the site again, causing the conflict. Does anyone have any ideas as to how to solve this? The error happens rarely (1 per month on 500,000 page views), but still, I like to make sure there are no bugs if possible. The only thing I can think of as a workaround is to use the robots.txt to exclude robots from this page. Regards Junto
