Seems like you are doing something the wrong way here... Do you want to get access to Spring beans from object not managed by Spring? How about WebApplicationContextUtils : WebApplicationContextUtils.getRequiredWebApplicationContext(servletContext); But WebApplicationContextUtils should always be treated as a last resort because this is not a Spring way . Are you sure you cannot integrate web services with Spring somehow? For instance with Apache CXF one can simply implement WS endpoint as a Spring bean or inject client proxy to other beans... Using static fields is always asking yourself for trouble. I am sure you can achieve your goals in a more elegant fashion.
