In the proposed regex the dot might appear only once. I'd assume that abc.def.gh is a valid hostname as well, isn't it. The dot MAY appear more than once. Test the regular expression here and you will see that it matches. Relevant fragment of the regular expression (first part is): ([a-zA-Z0-9]|[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9\-]*[a-zA-Z0-9])\.)* On windows computers/networks names like 1abcd are allowed (verified on our local network) From wikipedia : The original specification of hostnames in RFC 952 , mandated that labels could not start with a digit or with a hyphen, and must not end with a hyphen. However, a subsequent specification ( RFC 1123 ) permitted hostname labels to start with digits. I referred to RFC 952 . I will try to update the regular expression for hostnames to be compliant with RFC 1123 .
