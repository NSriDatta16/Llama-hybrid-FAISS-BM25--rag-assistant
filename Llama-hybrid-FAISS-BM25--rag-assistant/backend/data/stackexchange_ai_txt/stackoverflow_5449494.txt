I dont think that this would be very cunning and more of a lazy way to do this. Lazy solutions are usually better than "cunning" ones, because they tend to be more simple and straightforward. They're therefore easier to implement, document, understand and maintain. Indeed, laziness is arguably one of the greatest virtues a programmer can have. As long as the program produces correct results at acceptable speeds, nobody should care how elegantly you solved the problem (including you).
