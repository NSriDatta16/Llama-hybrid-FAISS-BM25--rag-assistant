Filtering a product collection by null/empty attributes has two possible solutions. Magento uses an INNER JOIN to grab the values of the attributes to filter. BUT if the product attribute is not assigned a value the join will fail, as a database table / relationship is missing. Solution #1: Use addAttributeToFilter() and change the join type from "inner" (the default) to "left": $collection = Mage::getModel('catalog/product')->getCollection(); $collection->addAttributeToFilter('custom_attribute', array( ... condition options ..), 'left'); Solution #2: Make sure your custom attribute has a default value. Magento is conservative in this regard. Magento will only create the relationship between an attribute and a product if a value is given for the attribute. So in the absence of user-specified value or a default value the attribute will not be accessible for filtering a product even if the attribute appears in the product detail view under the admin panel.
