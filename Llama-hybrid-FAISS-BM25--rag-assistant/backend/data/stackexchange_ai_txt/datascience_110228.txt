This is commonly time-series anomaly detection which is a complex field of study. Understanding whether a spike has occurred or not typically starts with hard-coded thresholding and later, learned patterns. Common techniques to learn patterns include STL (seasonal-trend decomposition), Isolation Forest, and time series clustering. Granger causality is one way to compare different time-series data to see if one time series is useful in forecasting another.
