Are there other trusted download sources for Eclipse Ganymede 3.4.2? It's no longer available on eclipse.org!

Eclipse.org took it off for some reason. When trying to download Ganymede, the server says the files are not there. I need it for Mac OS X Cocoa 32 bit. J2EE or the lightweight version. Eclipse downloads - file unavailable The selected file is invalid, or it is no longer available for download. This happens when the file is part of a nightly or development build. If so, please return to the project's home page and download a newer version. Go back. Now the problem is, it seems no one thought it would be useful to offer eclipse for download, since eclipse.org already does. But they don't. That sucks. You know any other?
