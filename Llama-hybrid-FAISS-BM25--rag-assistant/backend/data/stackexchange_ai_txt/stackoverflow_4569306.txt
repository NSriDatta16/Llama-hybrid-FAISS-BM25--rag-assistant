get user group from facebook graph api

I have a problem with facebook graph api in accessing user's group. If i access directly with this: https://graph.facebook.com/fb_id/groups?access_token=token I can access and retrieve group. However, using php sdk, it returns null. May I know what went wrong? $info = $facebook->api('https://graph.facebook.com/'.$memberfb.'/groups?access_token='.$membertoken); $ct = count($info[data]); $ct return 0. May I know what went wrong here?
