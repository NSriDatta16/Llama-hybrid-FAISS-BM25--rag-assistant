jQuery ui draggable elements not 'draggable' outside of scrolling div

I have many elements (floating href tags) in a div with a set height/width, with scroll set to overflow: auto in the CSS. This is the structure of the divs: the parent div's, 'tf_div_tagsReturn' and 'tf_div_tagsDrop' will ultimately float next to each other. Here is the jQuery which is run after all of the 'draggable' elements have been created with class name 'tag_cell', : $(function() { $(".tag_cell").draggable({ revert: 'invalid', scroll: false, containment: '#tagFun_div_main' }); $("#tf_dropBox").droppable({ accept: '.tag_cell', hoverClass: 'tf_dropBox_hover', activeClass: 'tf_dropBox_active', drop: function(event, ui) { GLOBAL_ary_tf_tags.push(ui.draggable.html()); tagFun_reload(); } }); }); as I stated above, the draggable elements are draggable within div 'tf_div_tagsReturn', but they do not visually drag outside of that parent div. worthy to note, if I am dragging one of the draggable elements, and move the mouse over the droppable div, with id 'tf_dropBox', then the hoverclass is fired, I just can't see the draggable element any more. This is my first run at using jQuery, so hopefully I am just missing something super obvious. I've been reading the documentation and searching forums thus far to no prevail :( UPDATE: many thanks to Jabes88 for providing the solution which allowed me to achieve the functionality I was looking for. Here is what my jQuery ended up looking like: $(function() { $(".tag_cell").draggable({ revert: 'invalid', scroll: false, containment: '#tagFun_div_main', helper: 'clone', start : function() { this.style.display="none"; }, stop: function() { this.style.display=""; } }); $(".tf_dropBox").droppable({ accept: '.tag_cell', hoverClass: 'tf_dropBox_hover', activeClass: 'tf_dropBox_active', drop: function(event, ui) { GLOBAL_ary_tf_tags.push(ui.draggable.html()); tagFun_reload(); } }); });
