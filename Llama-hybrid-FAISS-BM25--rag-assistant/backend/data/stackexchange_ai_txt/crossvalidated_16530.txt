There are two ways of dealing with circular variables, one hacky method would be to manually duplicate your data set on either side of the boundary conditions but the more elegant solution I think would be to use the built-in spline basis functions with periodic boundary conditions ! For example: bs="cc" specifies a cyclic cubic regression splines (see cyclic.cubic.spline ). i.e. a penalized cubic regression splines whose ends match, up to second derivative. Splines on the sphere bs="sos" . These are two dimensional splines on a sphere. Arguments are latitude and longitude, and they are the analogue of thin plate splines for the sphere. Useful for data sampled over a large portion of the globe, when isotropy is appropriate. See Spherical.Spline for details. bs="cp" gives a cyclic version of a P-spline
