Fail to decompose and make stationary time series

I am looking for some suggestions for my time series. I am dealing with the column "Temperature (C)" from this dataset. I am trying to make it stationary in order to do some forecasting on it. Here's what I did until now: I uploaded the dataset and set date&hour as index I pruned by dataset: I kept only records which have 12:00:00 as hour I tried to compute the adf test to understand if the data is stationary or not. It told me it was non-stationary. Therefore, I tried two things: Differenciate the data --> adf resulted "non-stationary" Decomposed the data --> again I got "non-stationary" What should I do? I am stuck... Here's my code of this last part: # adf test part adftest = adfuller(ts, autolag='AIC') output = pd.Series(adftest[0:4], index=['Statistic', 'p-value', '# Lags Used', '#Observations Used']) for key, value in adftest[4].items(): output['Critical Value (%s)' % key] = value # result: # Statistic -2.685398 # p-value 0.076599 # #Lags Used 14.000000 # #Observations Used 1813.000000 # Critical Value (1%) -3.433962 # Critical Value (5%) -2.863136 # Critical Value (10%) -2.567619 I think this indicates that I have non-stationary data, as p-value > critical value (any). Is this correct? I then tried to differenciate: one_diff = ts.diff(periods=1) But, again, calculating the adf test told me this result is non-stationary (even differenciating like 6 times). Looking online, I read about decomposition. Therefore, I tried it here: result = seasonal_decompose(ts, model='additive') Here's the result: I think nothing's working, but I don't know how to do it properly. Can you help me please? What am I doing wrong? Thank you in advance.
