Not balancing the validation and test set gives me a very bad dev set result

Here is the resulting heatmap for train, val, test set. I also apply PCA to train,val,and test set. Because from the train set, there are a lot of features that has high correlation with each other. According to what i searched online here and here , we should not balance the validation and test set as its better to make it more like real life situation. But with that approach, my model perform really poorly on val set as you can see, my model perform very very poorly on the dev test I mainly suspect the imbalanced and PCA part because other preprocess that i have done was filling missing data. and the missing data does not account for even 0.1% of my data Is there something that i did that is just fundamentally wrong or what?
