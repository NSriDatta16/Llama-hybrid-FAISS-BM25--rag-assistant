How can I combine two normal distributions functions?

Imagine that I take two separate measures and I get two separate normal distributions $\mathcal{N}_1(m_1, s_1^2)$ and $\mathcal{N}_2(m_2, s_2^2)$ How can I find a single normal distribution $\mathcal{N}_3$ which is a type of average of these two normal curves? As an extension, how could I find a distribution which represents both normals? Meaning, it would be a single distribution and it would have two peaks and would be centered at $\frac{m_1 + m_2}{2}$?
