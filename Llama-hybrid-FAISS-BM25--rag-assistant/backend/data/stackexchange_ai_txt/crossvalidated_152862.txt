The model you describe is simple univariate linear regression and what you want to do is to test wether your intercept is greater then zero. You can use MCMC obtaining posterior distribution of such model and then you can check what is the proportion of cases where $B > 0$: $$ \Pr(B > 0) = \frac{1}N \sum^N_{i=1} \mathbf{1}(B_i) $$ where $$ \mathbf{1}(B_i) = \begin{cases} 1 &\text{if } & B_i > 0, \\ 0 &\text{if } & B_i \leq 0. \end{cases} $$ for all $B_i$ values from $i = 1,...,N$ MCMC replications. This gives you posterior probability of $B > 0$. Since $B$ is continuous checking whether it is exactly zero does not make sense. Examples of using such approach could be found in possibly any handbook on Bayesian statistics . If you restrict the range of $B$'s by choosing some prior that is only positive, then there is no point in checking if there are posterior $B$ values less then zero. In Bayesian approach you choose some priors for your parameters and every prior brings some information in your model ("noninformative" is a misleading term ), however in many cases you do not want to use prior to restrict range of your values, but rather you use prior that enables "improbable" values with lower probability (example here ). On the other hand, if values of $B$ simply cannot be less then zero, then you can restrict your prior but you should describe this approach and its rationale in your report.
