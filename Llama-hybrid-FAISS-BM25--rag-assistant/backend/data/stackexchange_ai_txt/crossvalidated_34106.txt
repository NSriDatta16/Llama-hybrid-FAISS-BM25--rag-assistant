Forecasting with arimax model including xtransf

I am trying to forecast with an arimax model including the xtransf argument. I used the example given in chapter 11 of the book Time Series Analysis With Applications in R , Jonathan D. Cryer & Kung-Sik Chan, 2nd ed. So this is basically an intervention Model. I just did not include the xreg argument, so the Additive outliers are not included for the moment. Here are the codes and the Error I got. >library(TSA) >data(airmiles) >air.m1=arimax(log(airmiles),order=c(0,1,1),seasonal=list(order=c(0,1,1),period=12),xtransf=data.frame(I911=1*(seq(airmiles)==69), I911=1*(seq(airmiles)==69)),transfer=list(c(0,0),c(1,0)),method="ML") > air.m1 Call: arimax(x = log(airmiles), order = c(0, 1, 1), seasonal = list(order = c(0, 1, 1), period = 12), method = "ML", xtransf = data.frame(I911 = 1 * (seq(airmiles) == 69), I911 = 1 * (seq(airmiles) == 69)), transfer = list(c(0, 0), c(1, 0))) Coefficients: ma1 sma1 I911-MA0 I911.1-AR1 I911.1-MA0 -0.5379 -0.7644 -0.1290 0.8901 -0.2419 s.e. 0.0854 0.1532 0.0606 0.1239 0.0513 sigma^2 estimated as 0.0009739: log likelihood = 199.42, aic = -388.84 >predict(air.m1,n.ahead=20) Error in dim(data) Any idea where my mistake is?
