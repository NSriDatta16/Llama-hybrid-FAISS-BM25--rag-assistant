Would time series input work in multiple polynomial regression model?

I am trying to do a side project to get a better understanding of the whole data science after completing my online course. Am now in an early stage of just laying out the project in general and was wondering if you can put time series data and just variable (normalized if necessary) in a multivariable polynomial regression model?
