I don't know it for a fact but I always assumed that the Total duration adds all the NHibernate overhead of constructing the SQL query, and upon data retrieval constructing the entities with the raw data. Perhaps the construction process with your entities is very slow? Do you have some extensive processing in your entities constructors? any IO operations, logging, additional DB access, network usage... Good luck
