Using a cursor it is possible to read sequentially through a set of data, programmatically, so it behaves in a similar manner to conventional file access, rather than the set-based behaviour characteristic of SQL. There are a couple of situations where this may be of use: Where it is necessary to simulate file-based record access behaviour - for example, where a relational database is being used as the data storage mechanism for a piece of code that was previously written to use indexed files for data storage. Where it is necessary to process data sequentially - a simple example might be to calculate a running total balance for a specific customer. (A number of relational databases, such as Oracle and SQLServer, now have analytical extensions to SQL that should greatly reduce the need for this.) Inevitably, wikipedia has more: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_cursor
