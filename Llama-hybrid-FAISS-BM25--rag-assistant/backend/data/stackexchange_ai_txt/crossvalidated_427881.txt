In your question you have been comparing the red-blue value (173 cm) from the second experiment with the minimal one eye blue and minimal one eye red from the first experiment (177 cm and 164 cm). In that case it goes like part 1 and is a simple matter of averaging with incorporating weights. If however you are comparing the values 180, 173, 160 from the second experiment with each other, then your case is like part 2. Part one Your two different experiments are not contradicting. Let's put the data in a table: bb rb rr number 30 20 50 mean height 180 173 160 When you add those groups together for instance bb+rb for at least one blue eye or rb+rr for at least one red eye then the means for those composite groups become: $$\frac{180 \times 30+173 \times 20}{50} = 177.2 \approx 177$$ and $$\frac{160 \times 50+173 \times20}{70} = 163.7143 \approx 164 $$ where you should note that you need to incorporate the number of each category. For instance the mean of a group with 1 women of height 160 cm and 9 women of height 170 cm should be 169 cm, and not $\frac{160+170}{2}\,cm = 165 \, cm$ See also: two ways to compute average prices Part two If you are comparing the values 180, 173, 160 from the second experiment with each other, then you might do this based on some model. For instance you could imagine that the mean height of women is something like a base value plus some additional value for each blue eye (and some error term for random variation among the women with the same colour of eyes). $$\text{Women height} = a + c \times n_{\text{blue eyes}} + \epsilon $$ or $$\text{Women height} = \begin{cases} a & + &\epsilon \quad \quad \text{if $0$ blue eyes} \\ a + c& +& \epsilon \quad \quad \text{if $1$ blue eyes} \\ a + 2c & +& \epsilon \quad \quad\text{if $2$ blue eyes} \\ \end{cases}$$ this you could compare with a model in which the second blue eye will add a different value to the mean height than twice the value for the case of 1 blue eye. $$\text{Women height} = \begin{cases} a & + &\epsilon \quad \quad \text{if $0$ blue eyes} \\ a + c_1& +& \epsilon \quad \quad \text{if $1$ blue eyes} \\ a + c_2 & +& \epsilon \quad \quad\text{if $2$ blue eyes} \\ \end{cases}$$ This can be compared with GLM/ANOVA or other modeling and it requires you to incorporate the error distribution and your data needs to capture not only the mean value of the groups but also the individual values of the women.
