GUIs for git Git GUI Included with git — Run git gui from the command line, and the Windows msysgit installer adds it to the Start menu. Git GUI can do a majority of what you'd need to do with git. Including stage changes, configure git and repositories, push changes, create/checkout/delete branches, merge, and many other things. One of my favourite features is the "stage line" and "stage hunk" shortcuts in the right-click menu, which lets you commit specific parts of a file. You can achieve the same via git add -i , but I find it easier to use. It isn't the prettiest application, but it works on almost all platforms (being based upon Tcl/Tk) Screenshots | a screencast GitK Also included with git. It is a git history viewer, and lets you visualise a repository's history (including branches, when they are created, and merged). You can view and search commits. Goes together nicely with git-gui. Gitnub Mac OS X application. Mainly an equivalent of git log , but has some integration with github (like the "Network view"). Looks pretty, and fits with Mac OS X. You can search repositories. The biggest critisism of Gitnub is that it shows history in a linear fashion (a single branch at a time) - it doesn't visualise branching and merging, which can be important with git, although this is a planned improvement. Download links, change log and screenshots | git repository GitX Intends to be a "gitk clone for OS X". It can visualise non-linear branching history, perform commits, view and search commits, and it has some other nice features like being able to "Quicklook" any file in any revision (press space in the file-list view), export any file (via drag and drop). It is far better integrated into OS X than git-gui / gitk , and is fast and stable even with exceptionally large repositories. The original git repository pieter has not updated recently (over a year at time of writing). A more actively maintained branch is available at brotherbard/gitx - it adds "sidebar, fetch, pull, push, add remote, merge, cherry-pick, rebase, clone, clone to" Download | Screenshots | git repository | brotherbard fork | laullon fork SmartGit From the homepage: SmartGit is a front-end for the distributed version control system Git and runs on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.
