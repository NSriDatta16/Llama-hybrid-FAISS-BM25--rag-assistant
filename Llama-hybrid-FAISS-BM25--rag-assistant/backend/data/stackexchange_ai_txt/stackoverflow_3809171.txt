string/text storage limits in a sqlite3 database

I have a note field of string type in one of my models in my sqlite3 database, but I realized that I needed to store more text than string would allow. I just ran a migration changing the type of the field from string to text. Looking at my database, it says that the type is now text(255) , whereas before it was varchar(255) . What does the 255 mean? Is that a character limit? If so, would I have the same storage problems as before? How would I fix this? Here is the migration I used to change the field type change_column(:posts, :note, :text)
