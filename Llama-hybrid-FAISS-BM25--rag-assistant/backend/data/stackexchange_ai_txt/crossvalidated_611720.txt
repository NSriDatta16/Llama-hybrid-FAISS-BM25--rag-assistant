Why is my predictor variable being split up in a logistic regression?

I am running a logistic regression. Treatment is a factor with 3 levels. I am assuming that intercept is one of these 3 levels (negative control in this case). Is there a reason the equation is splitting the predictor variable like this? Call: glm(formula = propgfp ~ treatment, family = quasibinomial, data = frass4glm) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -2.7631 -0.0001 0.6031 0.6964 0.8529 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) -19.87 3390.23 -0.006 0.995 treatmentFrass 22.64 3390.23 0.007 0.995 treatmentPositive 22.64 3390.23 0.007 0.995 (Dispersion parameter for quasibinomial family taken to be 1.324805) Null deviance: 100.322 on 34 degrees of freedom Residual deviance: 25.863 on 32 degrees of freedom AIC: NA ```
