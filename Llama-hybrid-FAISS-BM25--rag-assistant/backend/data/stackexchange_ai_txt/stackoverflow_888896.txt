Setting the focus to a MsgBox object

In my application, a user clicks a "save" button and is then presented with a MsgBox confirmation simply stating "Are you sure you want to save?", or something along those lines. It's been hit or miss, but occasionally, this MsgBox will load behind the browser rather than be the center of attention with focus. How can I stop this from happening? Thanks in advance :)
