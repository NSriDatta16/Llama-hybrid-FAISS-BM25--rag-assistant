To build a machine learning model to classify objects based on their properties. There are a few steps you can follow to achieve this: Preprocess the data: You can use the LabelEncoder class to convert the categorical property and object names to numerical values. Alternatively, you can then use the OneHotEncoder class to create a binary representation of the properties, with each column corresponding to a different property. This will create a large, sparse matrix, but this is not necessarily a problem for most machine-learning algorithms. Alternatively, you can consult the business team/domain expert (if available) for any higher-level mappings of the available features, so that we can reduce cardinality to some extent. Split the data into training and testing sets: You can use scikit-learn's train_test_split function to split the data into a training set and a testing set. The training set will be used to train the model, and the testing set will be used to evaluate the model's performance. Train the model: You can use the BernoulliNB class to train a Bernoulli naive Bayes model on the training data. This model takes a binary array of shape (n_samples, n_features) as input, where each sample represents an object and each feature represents a property. You will need to reshape your data into this format before training the model. Evaluate the model: You can use scikit-learn's classification_report function to evaluate the model's performance on the testing data. This will give you a measure of the model's accuracy, as well as precision, recall, and f1-score for each class. Save and load the model: You can use Python's joblib module to save the trained model to a file and load it later. Use the model on new data: To use the model on new data, you will need to preprocess the data in the same way you did for the training data, using the same LabelEncoder and OneHotEncoder objects. You can then use the predict method of the trained model to classify the new data. Get the top 10 closest matching objects: To get the top 10 closest matching objects, you can use the predict_proba method of the trained model to get the probability of each object for the given properties. You can then sort the objects by their probabilities and take the top 10. I suggest to use sklearn Pipeline s to setup a robust way doing things. Hope this helps.
