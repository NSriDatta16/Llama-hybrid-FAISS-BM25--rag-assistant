Facility booking system

We are planning to implement a facility booking system wherein the user would be able to check the availability of a hall/room at a particular date and time. The user would also be able to book a facility if it is available. However, I am having issues in creating two components for the system: Calendar - The calendar needs to be dynamic, such that the user can book the room with a mouse click after specifying the duration through mouse drag. Also, the mouseover should display the event info, so that I do not need to put the event details in some other static page/link. Lastly, the calendar needs to be flexible enough to display availability of the rooms/halls sorted by day, week, and month. Booking through SMS - Whenever a room is booked, an SMS is to be sent to a specific user (selected). The user can then reply to the SMS to book the room (mentioning the unique request ID in SMS response). However, I have never created an SMS server, so I wanted to know how to begin, and whether it is feasible to make an SMS-based response system. Please share your views or any source code you know is available which takes care of any of these requirements.
