You can find this very simply via PHP $country = $_POST['fb_sig_country'] Developers who use custom tabs can leverage our new *fb_sig_country* request header to display different content based on a user’s locale. For example, if your application uses a custom tab to show the latest World Cup standings, you can use fb_sig_country to present highlights for a user’s country. (Note: if you use fb_sig_country, you must also handle the case where the field is blank, because you might not have content for every country in the world.) via http://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/394
