Need recommendation for a Content Management System (.NET)

I am searching for a CMS that meets the following requirements: Based on .NET Works with a tree structure for content items User-defined content types (content templates) Manage external tables Extensible with my own management applications Support for versioning .NET API for content retrieval Note that i am looking for a system that does just content management, i don't need it to handle rendering or supply me with a templating engine. I just want to be able to manage my content and custom applications from one system without writing it myself. Curious to what you guys would recommend! /Ruud
