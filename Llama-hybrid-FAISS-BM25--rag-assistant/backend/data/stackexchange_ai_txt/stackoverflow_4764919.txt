MySQL supports user-defined partitioning for large tables. As for whether or not you need it, it depends on your application and what queries you make. Have a look at the advantages of partitioning and see if any of them apply to your situation: Partitioning makes it possible to store more data in one table than can be held on a single disk or file system partition. Data that loses its usefulness can often be easily removed from a partitioned table by dropping the partition (or partitions) containing only that data. Conversely, the process of adding new data can in some cases be greatly facilitated by adding one or more new partitions for storing specifically that data. Some queries can be greatly optimized in virtue of the fact that data satisfying a given WHERE clause can be stored only on one or more partitions, which automatically excluding any remaining partitions from the search. Because partitions can be altered after a partitioned table has been created, you can reorganize your data to enhance frequent queries that may not have been often used when the partitioning scheme was first set up. This ability to exclude non-matching partitions (and thus any rows they contain) is often referred to as partition pruning, and was implemented in MySQL 5.1.6. For more information, see Section 18.4, “Partition Pruning”.
