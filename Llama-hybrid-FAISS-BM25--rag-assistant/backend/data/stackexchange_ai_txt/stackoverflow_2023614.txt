System.ExecutionEngineException PropertyChanged

If anyone can provide some help for this one, I'd be very grateful! We are using: Silverlight 3 / MVVM / Blacklight DragDock Control / ComponentOne Silverlight Controls I have a Silverlight application that relies heavily on the MVVM pattern. The application has seemingly been running fine, until recently. I have started to notice semi-random (semi-random = over a long enough period of time ~2 - 5 mins) I can reproduce a System.ExecutionEngineException coming from the PropertyChanged event being raised. The property name which the notification is being raised for is not always the same property name (the firing of the property change event happens in a base ViewModel class). The code basically looks like this: if (PropertyChanged != null) Application.Current.RootVisual.Dispatcher.BeginInvoke( () => PropertyChanged(this, new PropertyChangedEventArgs(propertyName))); The code works for everything else in the application. Basically everything that throws off a property changed event goes through this. I'm not sure why this is failing all of a sudden. Please throw some thoughts my way. I've been knee deep in windbg trying to get some grasp on what is going on, and still have very little. I'd by happy provide a dump or any other information that might be helpful. Obviously, there is very little information given from this particular error... Thank you ahead of time, David Justice
