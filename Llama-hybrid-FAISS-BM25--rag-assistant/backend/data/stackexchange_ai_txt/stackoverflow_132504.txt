How to reformat multi-line comments in Eclipse PDT?

In Eclipse PDT , Ctrl-Shift-F reformats code. However, it doesn't modify comments at all. Is there some way to reformat ragged multi-line comments to 80 characters per line (or whatever)? i.e. convert // We took a breezy excursion and // gathered Jonquils from the river slopes. Sweet Marjoram grew // in luxuriant // profusion by the window that overlooked the Aztec city. to // We took a breezy excursion and gathered Jonquils // from the river slopes. Sweet Marjoram grew in // luxuriant profusion by the window that overlooked // the Aztec city. (I think this applies to regular Eclipse as well.) Update Turns out that Eclipse in Java mode will reformat the lines above, but only if they're /* */-style comments. It will shorten // lines that are too long, but it won't join lines that are too short together.
