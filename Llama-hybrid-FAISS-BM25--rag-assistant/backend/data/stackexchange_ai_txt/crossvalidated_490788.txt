Interpretation of Simple Logistic Regression with Categorical Variables

I'm currently trying to interpret simple logistic regression with a categorical variable. Description of variables: "region" = the beneficiaryâ€™s residential area in the US; a factor with levels northeast , southeast , southwest , northwest . "charges_cat" = which takes the value 0 (low) when charges are less than 10000 dollars and the value 1 (high) in all other cases. > logm2 My interpretation for b1 = regionnorthwest is: > exp(-0.17888) [1] 0.8362062 If the beneficiary is living in the northwest region of the US, the odds of charges being more than 10000 dollars is 16.38% lower than the odds of charges being more than 10000 dollars for a beneficiary who lives in the northeast region of the US, with southeast and southwest regions are fixed. My question is; in a single logistic regression should I state the factor levels of the "region" are fixed, such as "with southeast and southwest regions are fixed." or there is no need to state the dummy variables of the "region" fixed?
