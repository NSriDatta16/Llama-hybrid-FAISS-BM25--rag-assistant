There is no best forecasting package in R. For one thing, R is open source so there are often multiple packages that do similar things and you can choose which one seems to be the most up-to-date and works to your taste. More importantly, though, is: how you forecast depends on how you model. Do you have a univariate time series and nothing but that data? Or do you have a univariate time series with several predictor variables? Do you have a multivariate time series? Are you even using a time series at all? ("Forecasting" implies time series, but that's not necessarily the case.) So the first question would probably be: what data do you have, and what kind of model are you trying to make? Modeling options and forecasting options will then be easier.
