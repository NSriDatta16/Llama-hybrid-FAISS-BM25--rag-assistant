$M$ and $A$ are two expressions for microarray fluorescence readouts, specifically the ratio of intensity between two colour channels and the average of both intensities - usually in the log scale. Wikipedia has a lot of details. To answer the specific question on the contour, yes, they likely converted a scatter plot into a density. You can see they did the same with more axis annotations in figure 2d, and in both cases the intensity scatter plot (in original scale) is right above the MA contour.
