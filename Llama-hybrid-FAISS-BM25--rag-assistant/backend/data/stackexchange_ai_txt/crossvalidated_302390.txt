The following figures are taken from this blog post , which illustrates an important practical application of these ideas. Standardization provides a powerful device for comparing 2 distributions. The following 3 figures compare heights of 130-month-old boys and girls from England's National Child Measurement Programme (NCMP). (This was the modal age in this data set; I selected it simply to get the most data, and therefore the smoothest plots, within a single age cohort.) Figure 1: Heights of boys and girls aged 130 months, from England’s National Child Measurement Programme (NCMP) Figure 2: Percentiles of height for boys and girls aged 130 months. Source: English NCMP Figure 3: Distribution of heights of 130-month-old girls relative to boys of the same age. In the last of these figures, the height comparison has been standardized according to boys' heights. Thus, reading along the dotted gray lines in Figure 3, you can make statements such as: The median (i.e., 50th-percentile) height for boys is just about 45th percentile for girls. Thus, 100% – 45%=55% of girls were taller than the median boy. The top-quartile height (75th percentile) for girls hits the top quintile (80th percentile) for boys. Thus, among children aged 130 mos, a girl who is taller than 3 out of 4 girls is also taller than 4 out of 5 boys. One point of possible confusion in this plot does deserve mention. Although the boys' 45° line is 'higher' on the plot than the girls' magenta curve, this observation nevertheless corresponds to the well-known fact that at this age (these are 6th graders), the girls are typically taller than the boys. Note that this tallerness is properly reflected in the fact that the magenta curve is shifted to the right relative to the blue line. This approach is quite generic . Under such a comparison, one of the groups — the one to which you standardize — becomes the 45° line. The other group may in general be any monotone increasing curve drawn from lower left to top right. Provided that the underlying distributions are continuous (the densities lack point masses), the compared curve will be continuous. If the underlying densities share the same support , the curve must run from $(0,0)$ to $(1,1)$. Your original question can now be recast in geometrical terms, as a question about whether you could draw the magenta curve of Figure 3 so as to achieve simultaneously (a) the postulated relation between the medians and (b) the slightly elusive relation that @Glen_b elucidated (correctly, I believe) in his answer. I wonder if distributional discontinuities (point masses in the densities) might enable a 'pathological' case to be provided. I conjecture that any such pathological case will be the 'exception that proves the rule'. If one makes the most straightforward, logical translation of your quiz question into more formal language amenable to analysis, then (using the setting of childrens' heights from above) we might like to say an individual $x$ has the property TMB if $x$ is t aller than m ost b oys. Then your quiz question asked simply whether most girls have the TMB property . If one defines 'most' to mean more than half , then having the TMB property means being taller than the median-height boy. Asking whether most girls have the TMB property then amounts to asking whether the median girl has this property. On this account, the answer to the quiz question would be yes . On the other hand, if the actual intent of 'most' was ">50%", one might expect the more precise phrase "a majority of" to have been employed. If somebody tells me something "probably" will happen, I would think a subjective probability of 60% or more is being alluded to. Likewise, "most" to me means something a bit more like 70–80%. Clearly, from the plot above, if 'most' is taken as a criterion any more stringent than 52.5%, then you can't say "most girls [have the property that they] are taller than most boys." I wonder if part of the rationale for the quiz question was to stimulate an examination of words as they relate to numerical notions. (If you think this is all a bit silly, consider these graphs , showing how people tend to interpret different probabilistic words and phrases.) Perhaps the intent also was to underscore the point that a lot of variation is present in real-world distributions, and that a single statistic (median, mean, what-have-you) will rarely support broad, sweeping statements.
