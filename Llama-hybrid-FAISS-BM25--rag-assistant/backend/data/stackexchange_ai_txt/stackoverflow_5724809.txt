php echo from database with break lines

This is a simple question I believe, but can't figure it out yet. I have a text area that after submit goes to a database, and then I echo this text on a page, but here is the problem, say the person writes on the textarea: Hi Robert, This is just a test!. Jason. And the message goes to the database just like that, but when I echo that, I get: Hi Robert, This is just a test!. Jason. This is the form: This is the code I use to display the text: "; } ?> This is what I use to insert the code: if(isset($_POST['submit'])){ $check4LB = $_POST['newMessage']; while($letter = mysql_fetch_assoc($check4LB)){ if($letter=' '){ $letter=' '; } } /////I know this is not write bu is the idea i thgouht at least $query = mysql_query("SELECT (ifnull(max(idRegistro),0) + 1) as id FROM messages"); $row = mysql_fetch_array($query); $idMax = $row['id']; $insertMessage = "INSERT INTO messages(idRegistro, mensaje) VALUES ('".$idMax."','".$letter."')"; mysql_query($insertMessage) or die(mysql_error()); echo " "; }
