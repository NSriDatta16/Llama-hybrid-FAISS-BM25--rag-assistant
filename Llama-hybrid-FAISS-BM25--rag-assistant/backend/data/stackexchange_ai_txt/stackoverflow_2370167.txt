You could fill the array in sequence and then shuffle it. That would prevent having to ever do more than 20 random number generations. Fisher-Yates shuffle : can be done in O(n) time. From wikipedia: Properly implemented, the Fisherâ€“Yates shuffle is unbiased, so that every permutation is equally likely. The modern version of the algorithm is also rather efficient, requiring only time proportional to the number of items being shuffled and no additional storage space.
