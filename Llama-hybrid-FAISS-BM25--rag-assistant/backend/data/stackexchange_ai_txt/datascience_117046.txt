Excessive features in an Neural Network model

I am modeling a quality parameter of a chemical process product. I have a list of circa 400 process parameters sampled throughout the process. Most of them should have no meaningful impact on the modeled property. I am looking for an intuitive explanation of the impact these non-relevant parameters may have on the precision of the prediction. Should I try to map what is relevant technologically and exclude the rest from the model? Thanks in advance
