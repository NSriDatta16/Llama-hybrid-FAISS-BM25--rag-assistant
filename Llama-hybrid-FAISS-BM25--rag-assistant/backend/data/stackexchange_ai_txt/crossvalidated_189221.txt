An illustrating (and funny) article ( http://www.jsur.org/ar/jsur_ben102010.pdf ) about the need to correct for multiple testing in some practical study evolving many variables e.g. functional MRI (fMRI). This short citation contains most of the message: "[...] we completed an fMRI scanning session with a post-mortem Atlantic Salmon as the subject. The salmon was shown the same social perspective-taking task that was later administered to a group of human subjects." that is, in my experience, a terrific argument to encourage users to use multiple testing corrections.
