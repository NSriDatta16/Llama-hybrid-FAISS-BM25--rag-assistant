So I have to put my localized ressource files into English.lproj, Italian.lproj (etc.) folders?

I'm confused because this isn't done through xcode. I must find the project folder in finder and then really move files into those *.lproj folders. Is that correct? Or is there a way to see those *.lproj folders in Xcode like Groups and then just drag&drop the files in there?
