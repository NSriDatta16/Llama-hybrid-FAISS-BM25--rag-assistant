Is the zero a valid kernel?

It seems to me that if $c\geq0$ then $k(x,y)=c$ is a valid kernel since no rules are broken. However, one of the rules of constructing a kernel disagrees with this. The rule is $k(x,y)=ck'(x,y)$, where it must be true that $c>0$ (this rule is taken from Bishop, Pattern Recognition And Machine Learning). Why can't $c$ be 0? The zero matrix is symmetric and positive semidefinite, so isn't it true that $k(x,y)=0$ should be a valid kernel?
