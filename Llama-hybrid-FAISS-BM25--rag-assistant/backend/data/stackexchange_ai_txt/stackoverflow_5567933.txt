After looking into this on and off, I'm discovered there doesn't seem to be a lot of 'white label ecommerce' offerings under that title. However, there are applications like Magento that support multisite with theme's. Presumably you can create a full sub domain and skin it to brand it. This approach may or may not be a good fit though. One particular functionality that seems to be missing is the ability to allow self registration and create of a site. This to me is the holy grail of white lableing. The closest I've come to that functionality is Aegir in the Drupal ecosystem or Drupal Commons with it's organic groups. However, the situation is different for white label social networking. This seems like a much more mature industry. Perhaps the approach is to use social networking white labeling with an ecommerce plug in. Bottom line is that I haven't found a turn key platform that allows a power user level of functionality. Hopefully it will come about soon!
