In the generality stated, your problem is completely hopeless. You need to make strong assumptions or have good prior knowledge both on the underlying population distribution and the possible selection algorithm. However, even under these restrictive conditions deciding about 10 out of 1000 will often be hard or impossible. Hopeless in general To see why this cannot work in general, just do a thought experiment. If someone presents you a pick of ten items out of 1000, they may have been picked uniform at random or picked according to the very deterministic and biased algorithm "always pick exactly those ten". Since the resulting sample is the same in both cases, you have no way to distinguish between the two algorithms. Using prior knowledge The thing you are looking for are tests for randomness or (more likely) tests for specific distributions. Look up "randomness tests" or "normality tests". These tests work typically by defining a test statistic, which is simply a specific function of your sample. Under strong assumptions on the features of the underlying population (such as normality) you can derive a distribution of the test statistic. Using this distribution you then derive an interval such that, for example, 90% of all possible subsets of 10 are within this interval. If the sample you want to test is outside this interval, you are "90% sure" it was not picked randomly according to the distribution. This is still very hard in general, since you need to come up with a test statistic which puts the "bad" samples at the ends of its distribution. It obviously helps a lot to come up with a good test statistic and the interval you need, if you have a prior idea about the bias and its strength as well. Other ideas As described above you have no chance with just a single trial (i.e. picking 10 items once). But maybe you can convince your adversary to do repeat experiments. An ad-hoc approach which may work, is to provide repeated subsamples to choose from. Give your adversary a randomly selected subsample of size 500, say. Let him choose 10 items and record the items. Repeat this a large number of times (maybe up to a few million times) and keep a tally of how often each item was picked. If the small samples are chosen uniform at random, every item of your large sample will have been picked on average the same number of times. If there is preference for certain items, these will be picked more often. With this approach you can easily reveal the "always pick those 10 items" algorithm. With other selection strategies your mileage may vary.
