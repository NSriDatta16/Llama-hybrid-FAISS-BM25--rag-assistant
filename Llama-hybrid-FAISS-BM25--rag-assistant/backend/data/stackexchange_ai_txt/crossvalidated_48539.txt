Selecting an "appropriate" number of components in PCA can be performed elegantly with Horn's Parallel Analysis (PA). Papers show that this criterion consistently outperforms rules of thumb such as the elbow criterion or Kaiser's rule. The R package "paran" has an implementation of PA that requires only a couple of mouse clicks. Of course, how many components you retain depends on the goals of the data reduction. If you only wish to retain variance that is "meaningful", PA will give an optimal reduction. If you wish to minimize the information loss of the original data, however, you should retain enough components to cover 95% explained variance. This will obviously keep many more components than PA, although for high-dimensional datasets, the dimensionality reduction will still be considerable. One final note about PCA as a "model selection" problem. I don't fully agree with Peter's reply. There have been a number of papers that reformulated PCA as a regression-type problem, such as Sparse PCA, Sparse Probabilistic PCA, or ScotLASS. In these "model-based" PCA solutions, loadings are parameters that can be set to 0 with appropriate penalty terms. Presumably, in this context, it would also be possible to calculate AIC or BIC type statistics for the model under consideration. This approach could theoretically include a model where, for example, two PCs are unrestricted (all loadings non-zero), versus a model where PC1 is unrestricted and PC2 has all loadings set to 0. This would be equivalent to inferring whether PC2 is redundant on the whole. References (PA) : Dinno, A. (2012). paran: Horn's Test of Principal Components/Factors.
