How do I prepare time-series data to predict the change in a response variable, rather than the value of the response variable itself?

I am forecasting solar irradiance using different time series models. Rather than predict the irradiance from $t=0 \text{ min}$ to $t=120 \text{ min}$ , I would like to predict the change in irradiance relative to $t=0$ such that for each prediction, the prediction would be $\text{Relative Irradiance}_{t+30} = \text{Irradiance}_{t+30} - \text{Irradiance}_{t}$ . Right now, I have all my data in a pandas dataframe. TLDR: How can I format data for ML prediction of a new relative response variable: the change in the variable from time of prediction.
