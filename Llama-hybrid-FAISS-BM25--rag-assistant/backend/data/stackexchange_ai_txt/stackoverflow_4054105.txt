Firstly, your design is not really normalised - that would involve having all the answers in one column, probably with user and question number as a composite primary key. That organisation would make this a lot easier. As it is, your query needs to look like: update responses set answer_2 = -1 * answer_2, answer_3 = -1 * answer_3, answer_4 = -1 * answer_5, answer_7 = -1 * answer_7; Where those column names are the columns you need to negate. Given that there need to be thirty assignment lines in the query, i suggest you make use of copy and paste, or a couple of lines of shell script. Thirty isn't enough to turn to anything more complicated than that, though.
