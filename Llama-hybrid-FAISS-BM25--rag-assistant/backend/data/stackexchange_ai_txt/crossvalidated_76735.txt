Quick and easy way to remove outliers

I have a set of data of locations and associated rent prices. Now there seem to be several outliers which I would like to get rid of so that a plot of my original data gains more meaning. In the "world" of statistics, would it be acceptable if I did this by eliminating any prices that who deviate from the mean by more than twice the standard deviation? The aim of what I'm working on is to test out several machine learning techniques. I don't have to be extremely accurate but I wouldn't like to do something that is totally unacceptable.
