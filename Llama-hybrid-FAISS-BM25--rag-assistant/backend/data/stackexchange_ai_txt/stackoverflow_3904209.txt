Tricky filling an Array with values from JSON

Before I begin, this is my JSON: (The structure is rigid, and cant be changed) [ {"_id":{"country":"au", "industry":"foo"}, "value":{"count":2}}, {"_id":{"country":"au", "industry":"bar"}, "value":{"count":1}}, {"_id":{"country":"be", "industry":"baz"}, "value":{"count":2}}, .. ] I cant have duplicate country names, and industry names. I have an array that is to be filled with values as array[au][foo] = 2 array[au][bar] = 1 array[be][baz] = 2 the values are unsorted in the JSON, and all countries might not have the same industries. How do i go about doing that? This is my current code: for (int i = 0; i Im adding the country and industry to a set, to remove the duplicates. thats what causing the issue about the count. I dont care for it to be elegant, a hackjob will also do. Thanks.
