This isn't a typical Bayesian update setup - what is the sequence $B_i$? Usually these are the observed variables, while $A_i$ is a sequence of latent variables, the ones we wish to estimate. In that case, we predict, based on the $B_1,...,B_{n-1}$, using $$ P(A_n|\{B_1,...,B_{n-1}\}) = \int P(A_n|A_{n-1})P(A_{n-1}|\{B_1,...,B_{n-1}\})dA_{n-1}, $$ then update our bad prediction when $B_n$ arrives by $$ P(A_n|\{B_1,...,B_n\}) = \frac{P(B_n|A_n)P(A_n|\{B_1,...,B_{n-1}\})}{P(B_n|B_{n-1})}, $$ So the prior you speak of here is $P(A_n|\{B_1,...,B_{n-1}\})$, the previous estimate of the "posterior" (it is not strictly a posterior) which is used from the update step. This follows the general principle in Bayesian forecasting - the current estimate of the prior contains everything we know about that density. It should be used in the next step. Sorry for using integrals instead of summations - that's how I wrote it up.
