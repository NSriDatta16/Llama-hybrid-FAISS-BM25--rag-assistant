Get Database Table Name from Entity Framework MetaData

I'm trying to figure out a way to get the underlying SQL table name for a given entity type. I've experimented around with the MetadataWorkspace queries and while I can get lots of information from the object or the storage space, I can't seem to figure out how to map between the two. So say I have a type in the object model called Lookup - how do I find the tablename (wws_lookups) in the database? I can query all the EntityType objects for CSpace and SSpace and I can see both listed correctly but I can't figure out how to get SSpace from CSpace. Is there any way to do this?
