Linear model or component analysis on timecourse data

I have some timecourse data which plotted looks like the figure below. I want to better describe the difference between the two conditions. My adviser advised :D me to use a linear model and observe a time effect (interesting!) a main condition effect (probably none) and a condition*time effect (most interesting). Now, I am wondering what this information would look like - the time course isn't gradual, and I have run similar tests with R's lme4::lmer and nlme:lme and for continuous variables (in my case time) they just output one value as if the progression is linear. Obviously in my case it is not :-/ I have previously worked with such data and used PCA (which indeed, does not give me just-linear progressions) - would it be a good substitute for a linear model in my case? Also, the problem with PCA is that I have no idea how to reap the added information one would get from single participants (with mixed models, I can just add the participant IDs as random variables and feed it the raw data) - is there any way to pass the entire (un-meaned) per-participant data to, say Python's mdp.pca() and get something reasonable out of that?
