Turning R scripts into a "data science tool"

I have R scripts that process a client's datasets (make figures, summary tables, etc). I'd like to package these scripts into a standalone program, aka data science tool, that I can give to the client and that requires no interaction with code on their part . Ideally they will open the tool, load data, click run, and be given reports. How can I accomplish this?
