For me as a decision scientists this means that if 100 individuals repeat the same bernoulli experiment 10 times, then the majority of individuals will (on average) see the event less often than expected if p .5. This is not true. Let $n=100$ and $p=.3$ . Then $X$ (the number of individuals seeing the event) is $\mathcal{Bin}(100,.3)$ with expectation $n\cdot p=30$ so the expected number of individuals seeing the event is correct. The expectation of a binomial variable in general is $n p$ so what you say will never be true. (And this really has little to do with binomial distributions, it has to do with the law of large numbers.) So you are misinterpreting skewness. What does the skewness of the binomial distribution mean? Skewness is simply a standardized third moment. For the binomial it is $\frac{1-2p}{\sqrt{np(1-p)}}$ . Below a histogram of the binomial distribution for $n=100,p=.3)$ : The expected value bar (30) in red. Positive (small) skewness. Compare the bars on each side of 30: The bars above is lower that the bars below. Skewness means that when the observed value is larger than expected, it tends to be further above than when it is below. This is then matched by lower probabilities. But in the long run it averages out, by the law of large numbers. Another way of looking at this is by partitioning the variance: $$ \sigma^2 = \sum_{k=0}^{100} p_k (k-30)^2 = 21 $$ Let us take the sums above and below 30 separately: $$\begin{align} \sigma^2_{lower} &= \sum_{k=0}^{30} p_k (k-30)^2 = 10.25587 \\ \sigma^2_{upper} &= \sum_{k=30}^{100} p_k (k-30)^2 = 10.74413 \end{align}$$ confirming the slightly larger spread on the upside. That is the meaning of skewness. As for your question about other distributions, multinomial, the answer is the same.
