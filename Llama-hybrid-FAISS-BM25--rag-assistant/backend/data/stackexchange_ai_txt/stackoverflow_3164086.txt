How can I manage these subprocesses efficiently?

I've got a script that downloads and then converts videos. I'm trying to do all of the downloads at once(a lot of wgets) and then when they're done, convert them. Right now I have to wait while each file downloads individually and then convert when done. I want all the download requests to run concurrently. Here's the part in my 'download' script that is holding everything up. for id in ids: subprocess.Popen(cmd, shell=True).wait() I have my 'convert' script waiting on the download script to finish. (which is necessary, because i'm using sets of downloads to organize everything.) I could use a queue but this I've already made this a big enough mess and I'm hoping there is a simpler solution. Thanks
