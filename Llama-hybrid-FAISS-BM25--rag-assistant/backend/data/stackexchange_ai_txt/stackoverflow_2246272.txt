It sounds like your unit tests are fragile and overlapping. A single code change, ideally, should affect just one unit test - with a one-to-one match of tests to features, other tests don't depend on a given feature. That may be a little too idealistic; in practice many of our tests do re-exercise the same code, but it's something to keep in mind. When one code change affects many tests, it's a smell. Also, with respect to your specific example of renaming: find a tool that will automate these refactorings for you. I believe Resharper and CodeRush both support such automated refactorings; it's a much quicker, easier, and more reliable way to go about refactoring than the manual approach. To better learn your IDE, nothing beats pairing with someone else. You'll both learn; you'll both develop new skills - and it doesn't take long. A few hours will dramatically increase your comfort with the tool.
