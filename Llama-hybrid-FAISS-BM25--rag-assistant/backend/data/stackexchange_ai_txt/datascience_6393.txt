Modules on Python which are useful for missing Word/Letter prediction in text paragraphs from a coprpus

Can someone please recommend me some Python packages which I can use for missing word prediction in a paragraph of text. The missing words are a part of existing semantic list of words.( List of missing words are a common set of words like was ,were etc). If there are better packages in R which can help me with this it would be very useful if you post it here. Thank you.
