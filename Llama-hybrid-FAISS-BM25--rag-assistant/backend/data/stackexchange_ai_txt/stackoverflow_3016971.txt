The problem with the solution suggested is that it can break some performance features built into the SessionState if you are using an out-of-process session storage. (either "State Server Mode" or "SQL Server Mode"). In oop modes the session data needs to be serialized at the end of the page request and deserialized at the beginning of the page request, which can be costly. To improve the performance the SessionState attempts to only deserialize what is needed by only deserialize variable when it is accessed the first time, and it only re-serializes and replaces variable which were changed. If you have alot of session variable and shove them all into one class essentially everything in your session will be deserialized on every page request that uses session and everything will need to be serialized again even if only 1 property changed becuase the class changed. Just something to consider if your using alot of session and an oop mode.
