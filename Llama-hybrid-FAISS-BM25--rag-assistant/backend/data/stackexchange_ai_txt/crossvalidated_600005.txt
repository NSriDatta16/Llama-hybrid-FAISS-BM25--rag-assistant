If both are applicable they give the same p-values as the F test used in anova is equivalent to the t-test -- see this , this or this for mathematical proof -- a commenter mentioned that this equality is only strictly true if the t test is performed under the equal variances assumption by using the var.equal=TRUE t.test argument although the p values are still the same to several digits even if not in the examples below. We show both unpaired and paired examples. Using the sleep data that comes with R we see that in the first (unpaired) example below they both give a p-value of 0.07919 . t.test(extra ~ group, sleep, var.equal = TRUE) ## ## Two Sample t-test ## ## data: extra by group ## t = -1.8608, df = 18, p-value = 0.07919 ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group 1 and ## group 2 is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -3.363874 0.203874 ## sample estimates: ## mean in group 1 mean in group 2 ## 0.75 2.33 fm F) ## group 1 12.482 12.4820 3.4626 0.07919 . ## Residuals 18 64.886 3.6048 ## --- ## Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 And for a paired test we see that the p-values are both 0.002833 for the t-test and anova F test. We used a vector, ones , for the intercept since the R anova software does not produce F tests for an intercept only model otherwise. t.test(extra ~ group, sleep, paired = TRUE, var.equal = TRUE) ## ## Paired t-test ## ## data: extra by group ## t = -4.0621, df = 9, p-value = 0.002833 ## alternative hypothesis: true mean difference is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -2.4598858 -0.7001142 ## sample estimates: ## mean difference ## -1.58 ones F) ## ones 1 24.964 24.9640 16.501 0.002833 ** ## Residuals 9 13.616 1.5129 ## --- ## Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 Peter Dalgaard suggested this more elegant equivalent R code for the paired case which also gets around the fact that the anova function in R does not automatically produce F tests for the intercept. fit1 F) ## 1 10 38.580 ## 2 9 13.616 1 24.964 16.501 0.002833 ** ## --- ## Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1
