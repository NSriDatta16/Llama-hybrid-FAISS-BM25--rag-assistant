Jerome Spanier and Ely M. Gelbard wrote a book many years ago called "Monte Carlo Principles and Neutron Transport Problems," which has been released for ~$12 in the last year or so. Jun Liu wrote a good book several years ago, but it's more of a statistician approach to use MC and MCMC. Lots of good material in there though with some advanced applications. I have a paperback version that I picked up for ~$30.
