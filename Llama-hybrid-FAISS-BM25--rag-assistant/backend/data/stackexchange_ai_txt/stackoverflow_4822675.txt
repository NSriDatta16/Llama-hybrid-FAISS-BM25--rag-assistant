Number of Buckets in Amazon Free Tier

I am trying out Amazon S3 for my file uploads and would like to store different buckets for development, test and production environments. In amazon documentation it was mentioned the following statement As part of the AWS Free Usage Tier, you can get started with Amazon S3 for free. Upon sign-up, new AWS customers receive 5 GB of Amazon S3 storage, 20,000 Get Requests, 2,000 Put Requests, 15GB of data transfer in, and 15GB of data transfer out each month for one year. Is there any limitation about the number of buckets. I mean if I have three buckets and If I use within the overall storage limit, will I be charged.
