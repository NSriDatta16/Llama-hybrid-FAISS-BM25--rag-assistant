wx Python is not properly drawing customtree items

I am currently using wx.CustomTree, to use to display a series of configuration settings. I generally fill them with wx.TextCtrl / wx.Combobox, to allow the user to edit / enter stuff. Here is my code: class ConfigTree(CT.CustomTreeCtrl): """ Holds all non gui drawing panel stuff """ def __init__(self, parent): CT.CustomTreeCtrl.__init__(self, parent, id = common.ID_CONTROL_SETTINGS, style = wx.TR_DEFAULT_STYLE | wx.TR_HAS_BUTTONS | wx.TR_HAS_VARIABLE_ROW_HEIGHT | wx.TR_SINGLE) #self.HideWindows() #self.RefreshSubtree(self.root) self.population_size_ctrl = None self.SetSizeHints(350, common.FRAME_SIZE[1]) self.root = self.AddRoot("Configuration Settings") child = self.AppendItem(self.root, "Foo", wnd=wx.TextCtrl(self, wx.ID_ANY, "Lots Of Muffins")) The problem is, any children nodes, the data for these nodes is not filled in. When i basically expand the configuration settings tree node. I see the "Foo" node, however the textbox is empty. This is the same for both text node, Until i actually click on the child node. I've looked tried every form of update / etc. Does anyone have any ideas? To: Anurag Uniyal Firstly sorry for not giving the rest of the code. I've gotten around this problem by simply resizing the window everytime i demo the application. So i tried the code on my Macbook Pro running Mac OS X, with newest wx and python 2.6. I still have the same problem, however i noticed resizing the window, or even touching the scrollbar fixes the issue. I also noticed however, there is absolutely NO problems running on Windows Vista / Windows 7. So trying this on another macbook running an older version of wx + python. Results in the same problem :( Is there anyway to force the panel to redraw it self? Which i am pretty sure happens when i resize the window. If you don't have any ideas then i'll strip it down and make a demo example, im home and won't be at work until later tommorow.
