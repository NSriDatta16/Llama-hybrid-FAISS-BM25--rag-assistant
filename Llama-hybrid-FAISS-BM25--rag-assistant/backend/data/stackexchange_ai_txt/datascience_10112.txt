Which machine learning approach/algorithm do I choose for path validation?

I apologize for lack of terminology, I'm no computer scientist. I have a problem of validating paths in a directed graph with complex nodes. The full description is the following: I have a decent set (about 1K) of directed graphs; Each node contains a complex data structure (it is a hierarchical data structure, not a picture or sound); I have some of paths in those graphs known as "correct" paths (based mostly on data in nodes); And I have some of paths in those graphs known as "incorrect" paths (with classification why it is incorrect). I'd like to predict given a graph with those complex nodes and a path, is this path "correct". Which machine learning algorithm will suit me best? In general, what approach I should use? Edit: Each full graph is either have app paths processed (correct/incorrect) or completely blank (no path is processed); Correctness depends on both position of node in a graph AND data in the node; Humans would need heuristics to decide or guess which paths are correct; Most of the paths are "correct"; I hope to convert human heuristics to some kind of "correctness" recognition.
