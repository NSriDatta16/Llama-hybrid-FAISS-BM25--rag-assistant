Predict probability of outcome from continuous variables

We have a model which predicts the start time of an event (lets call it predicted_start ). We also have a default start time for an event (lets call it default_start ), but it's usually not correct and that's why we made the model to predict a more correct start time. The model is doing great, but sometimes it's wrong and predicted_start differs greatly from the actual start (lets call it actual_start ). Also, sometimes it's right and predicted_start can differ greatly from default_start and still be correct. It would be nice to know the probability of prediction_start being correct and close to actual_start . It's not a random guess and there has to be a probability distribution somewhere ... right? This validation would also probably be dependant on offset from defualt_start and maybe previous event's offset from defualt_start , not sure, maybe this doesn't need to be that complicated? Can't really wrap my head around this and would greatly appreciate any pointers. EDIT: I have considered logistic regression of some sort, but was hoping someone knew a better solution.
