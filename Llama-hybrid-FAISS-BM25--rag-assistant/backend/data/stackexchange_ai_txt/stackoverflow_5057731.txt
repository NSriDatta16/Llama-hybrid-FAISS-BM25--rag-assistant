Also it could solve any code organisation problems if you are to wrap the JQuery statement in this $(document).ready(function() { $('input#search').quicksearch('table tbody tr', { selector: 'th' }); }); Also the table quick search plugin i use is JQuery table search plugin , it works well and if you just take a quick look at the demo it is rather easy to implement and does not clash with most other JQuery table plugins.
