Building Predictive Parser and parsing table

I'm trying to build a parser for the following grammar (dragon book ex. 4.4.1 pg. 231): S -> 0 S 1 | 0 1 So first I left factored the grammar and got: S -> 0 S' S' -> S 1 | 1 And constructing the parsing table yielded: +-----------+---------+--------+ | 0 | 1 | $ | -----+-----------+---------+--------+ S | S -> 0 S' | | | -----+-----------+---------+--------+ S' | S' -> S 1 | S' -> 1 | | -----+---------------------+--------+ Is it OK not to have any entries for the $ (end of the input) symbol? How is parsing performed by the predictive parser in that case?
