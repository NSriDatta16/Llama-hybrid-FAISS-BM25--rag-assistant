I hesitate to ask, but normally you would not want 800 or columns in a database, so why did you do this? Given how databases store information you are possibly creating many problems for yourself with a design like that in terms of data retrieval and storage. How many bytes of data woudl a full row have? You know there is a limit to the number of bytes of data that can be stored in a row. You could be setting yourself up for issues entering data when a row exceeds those limits. It might be best to break into separate tables even if there is a one-to-one relationship. Read in BOL about data pages and how data is stored to understand why this concerns me.
