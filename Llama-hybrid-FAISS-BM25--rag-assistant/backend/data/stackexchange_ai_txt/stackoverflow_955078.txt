My understanding is that your call to ImportParameters in SaveKeyToContainer is not affecting the key in the store. Your implementation of SaveKeyToContainer is initializing an instance of RSACryptoServiceProvider using the key in the store (generating a new key pair when the container does not exist) and then importing the parameters, which affects the instance and not the store. When you retrieve publicKeyContainer later, you are given the new key pair that was generated when you attempted to save it and not the imported public fragment. Sorry, I can't help with any details about importing the key into the store with the Cryptography API. I believe the store only supports key pairs, i.e. don't expect to be able to import just the public key.
