How to add more inputs to a CNN?

What would be the correct approach to add additional inputs that aren't images, e.g. time, to the CNN. I initially thought of adding more inputs to one of the densely connected layers at the end of the CNN architecture, but I am note sure how this would affect the backprop. Does anyone know how to implement this using Keras or something similar?
