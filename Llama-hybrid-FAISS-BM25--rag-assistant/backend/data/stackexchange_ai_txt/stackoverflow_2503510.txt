Does a version control database storage engine exist?

I was just wondering if a storage engine type existed that allowed you to do version control on row level contents. For instance, if I have a simple table with ID, name, value, and ID is the PK, I could see that row 354 started as (354, "zak", "test")v1 then was updated to be (354, "zak", "this is version 2 of the value")v2 , and could see a change history on the row with something like select history (value) where ID = 354. It's kind of an esoteric thing, but it would beat having to keep writing these separate history tables and functions every time a change is made...
