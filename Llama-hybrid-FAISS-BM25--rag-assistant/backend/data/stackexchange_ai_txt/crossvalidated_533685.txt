As you stated if you just put everything through a regression then the most 'efficient' thing would be to put all money in the 'best' input. So you will have to do transformations like log or 1/x and feature engineering for any possible interactions. Still a regression but interpretations would change. Then you just optimize that equation. I think an issue you will run across is that any linear model will produce unreliable results when you 'optimize' your inputs since it will allow it to exceed the bounds they were fit on and put you in extrapolation land. You could put constraints on that optimization to keep it in bounds. For example, if you don't have any data where you spent more than 5000 on facebook ads then don't allow it to exceed that. In terms of other models you could try out a GAM or decision tree although I wouldn't know the best way to achieve what you want with a tree.
