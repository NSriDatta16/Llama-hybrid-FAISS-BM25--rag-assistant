converting tanh activation output to a probability

I am trying to implement $PPO$ for continuous action spaces so need probability of taking actions from a neural network with a tanh activation in the output layer since the action space ranges from $[-2, 2]$ . I multiply the tanh output in the $[-1,1]$ range by $2$ to get this action. I saw this: tanh converted to probability but there is conflicting answers in the answer and comments: The answer: 0.5(a(x)+1) converts tanh to a probability. Comments: says it is $0.5(a(2x) + 1)$ ...which I don't really understand if $a(x)$ is the $\tanh$ output then am I supposed to feed $2x$ to the network rather than $1x$ just for the purposes of this conversion from $\tanh$ to probability? I do not have enough rep to comment so I posted a new question here.
