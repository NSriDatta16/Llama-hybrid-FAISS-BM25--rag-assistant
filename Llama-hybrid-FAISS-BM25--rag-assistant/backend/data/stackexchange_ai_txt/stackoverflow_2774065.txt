How can I use Tier Pricing with Configurable Products? (Magento 1.4+)

How can I use/setup Tier Pricing with Configurable Products? (Magento 1.4+) There was an extension to do this but I think it is only for Magento 1.3. Tried to setup tiers in my Simple Products, but those do not show up, or do not activate when I add to cart from my Config Product page. Any help is appreciated! Thanks. Edit: In my case, I would like to use the Tier Pricing FROM the Simple Product. and not use the Tier Pricing from the Config. Product
