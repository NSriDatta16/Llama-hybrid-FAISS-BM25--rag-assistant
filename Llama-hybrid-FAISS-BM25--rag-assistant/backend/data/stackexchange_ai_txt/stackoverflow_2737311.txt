Get attached file content with XmlHttpRequest and Internet Explorer

I'm using XmlHttpRequest to perform a text file download, and here is the response header I have got from the server : Connection: keep-alive Transfer-Encoding: chunked Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="template" Content-Length: 244 Pragma: no-cache Cache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate Expires: 0 Content-Encoding: deflate Content-Type: application/force-download; name="template" With Firefox or another browser, all is fine: response.responseText contains the text file and I can put it in a text area, but with IE8, responseText is empty. How to get the response with IE?
