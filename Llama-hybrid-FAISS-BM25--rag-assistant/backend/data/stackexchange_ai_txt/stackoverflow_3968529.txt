How to Prevent Sql Server Jobs to Run simultaneously

I have some scheduled jobs in my SQL Agent: Job1, executing every 2 minutes Job2, executing every 10 minutes Job3, executing every 15 minutes As you can see, multiple jobs can run simultaneously. When these jobs do run simultaneously, it is causing the CPU usage to go to 100%. Is there a solution? Is there a way to control the number of jobs running concurrently? Note: I need these jobs to run approximately in their appropriate period.
