You can't do this with plain HTML 5, as it doesn't have any mechanism to deal with local files (that would imply a security risk anyway).

You can only use cookies or the localStorage capabilities of a browser. Nor can you do this using Flash. Both system work the same: they store information in a place specified by the browser/Flash. Moreover, in both cases space is limited (the limit varies between platforms and even individual settings). The only way to do this is to post the data to the server, e.g., using a hidden form, and let the server respond with header Content-Disposition: attachment and sending the file back to the client.
