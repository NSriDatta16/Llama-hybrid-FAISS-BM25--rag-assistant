The pyplot interface is meant for easy interactive use, but for embedding in an application the object-oriented API is better. For example, pyplot keeps track of all figures you have created. Your plot.close(figure) should get rid of them, but maybe it doesn't get executed -- try putting it inside finally or reusing the same figure object. See this example of embedding matplotlib in a PyQt4 application using the object-oriented API. It's more work, but since everything is explicit, you shouldn't get memory leaks from the behind-the-scenes automation that pyplot does.
