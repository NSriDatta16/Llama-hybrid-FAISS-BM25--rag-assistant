The best way to learn a new language is to immerse yourself in it and try not to compare it to any other language you already know. IMO you would be better off taking good examples of VB code and trying to understand them, using a conversion tool to convert to C# if you get lost in the syntax. Trying to write code in C# and convert it VB will always produce substandard code and will slow your progress to learning a new language. Languages are just tools we use to get the job done, some are easier to understand than others, some produce more elegant code, some have a higher perceived status than others. These days the framework is more important than the syntax of the language you're using. Iif you stick around in programming for long enough your toolset will change and you will either have to change with it or get stuck doing the same old thing day after day. IME people who are language evangelists are not as smart as those that are language neutral, and regardless of how popular a toolset is now, you don't know what is going to be popular in the future so having the ability to learn a new tool is very important if you wish to persue a career in programming.
