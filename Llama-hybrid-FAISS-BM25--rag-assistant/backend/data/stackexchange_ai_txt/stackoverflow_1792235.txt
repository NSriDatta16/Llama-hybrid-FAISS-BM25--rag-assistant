I would disagree with the DBA in this case. I would not like the idea of moving my "good" data out of the physical structure into a temp table and then back into the newly created structure once it is recreated, just to try to reduce index fragmentation. The solution is to delete the data with the Delete statment, and if fragmentation becomes a problem, reindex at that point.
