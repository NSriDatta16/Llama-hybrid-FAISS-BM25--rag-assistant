You can look into GANs with LSTM decoders. However without any additional prior information it will not improve your downstream task by a lot because you did not feed it any more information, which means it has to hallucinate more data. Another approach is to think about the generating process. For example with a fridge, I imagine that there is not a lot of dependency on the time a day before. Maybe if it is less efficient (by looking at the mean). You could try to take segments of different appliances and mix and match them to simulate new samples. Here you introduce a prior bias by assuming some kind of independence.
