Advice for Deep Learning on a laptop without a dedicated GPU

My laptop has a 16gb ram, ryzen 7 processor, ssd etc. But it doesn't have an nvidia gpu. It is said that one can train models on the cloud but for 'inference' the physical laptop should have at least a gtx 1050, so I want to know if the 'inferencing' work is possible say for tensorflow utilizing only the ryzen 7 cpu? If not, is there any alternative to this?
