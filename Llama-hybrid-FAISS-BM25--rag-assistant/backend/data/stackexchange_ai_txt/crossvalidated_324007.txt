Choosing parameter ranges for classification problems

How do I choose good values of my param_grid in GridSearchCV() ? I see many different methods, but wonder if there is some theory behind choosing reasonable values for the model parameters, so that I don't waste computational power by choosing too many alternatives in my hyperparameter tuning. The primary goal is to predict well on classification problems, using for example KNN, random forest, decision trees and SVM.
