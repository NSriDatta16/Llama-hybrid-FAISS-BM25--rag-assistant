2 suggestions here: First, if you are working on embedded system using language like C. Simply work out a coding convention to use a #define for any string or constant. All the #define should be categorized in a .h file. That should be enough - not too complex but enough for maintainability. You don't need to mangle all the constant between the code line. Second, if you are working on a application with access to DB. It is simple just to keep all the constant values in the database. You just need a very simple interface API to do the retrieval. With simple tricks, both methods can be extended to support multi-language feature.
