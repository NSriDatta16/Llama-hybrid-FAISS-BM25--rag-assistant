The ViewStack and States actually aren't really related. Can you rephrase to make your question more specific? The ViewStack is a component that is used to display different views (normally of different data, but not necessarily), one at a time. States are related views of a single set of data. For example, you may want to have a 'normal' view and an 'advanced' view of, say, a user's profile - where the advanced view displays more options, or a larger picture, etc. States work with Transitions, which are coordinated animations that elegantly switch between states. That's a real brief explanation. Hope it's useful.
