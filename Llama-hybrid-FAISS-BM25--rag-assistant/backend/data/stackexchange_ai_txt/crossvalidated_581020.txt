Not sure this will answer your question, but to my understanding I would do this: If I want to find the relationship between variables and target/response, then following are the methods I am aware of Sequential Forward Selection - Finds top n variables/columns/features that gives best result by starting from 1 variable to n variable Sequential Backward Selection - Finds top n variables/columns/features that gives best result by starting from all variable to n variable (number of variables that you want to keep/use) Finding certainty that so and so variable is proving more important consistently do the bootstrapping (suppose) 100 times I assume that you are using logistic regression for this train the model, fit the data, find the coefficients (also called feature importance), store them do the above step for all bootstraps Now you have coefficients (100) for every variable / feature. Find the confidence interval of these 100 coefficients the less the variance is the more certain this coefficient is in predicting the response make a separate list of these features/variables make new model and use only these features to make predictions. Why? because we observed that the coefficients of these features have very less variance. Now if you use different model to train (suppose you decided DecisionTree next) then this might give you different significant features. Why? DT will give features that are significant deemed by DT for prediction.
