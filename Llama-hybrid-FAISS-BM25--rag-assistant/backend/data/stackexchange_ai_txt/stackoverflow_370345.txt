What makes this problem annoying are the fencepost cases among first and last elements. The problem can be elegantly solved by changing IFS and using an array, but I don't know how to re-introduce the colon once the path is converted to array form. Here is a slightly less elegant version that removes one directory from $PATH using string manipulation only. I have tested it. #!/bin/bash # # remove_from_path dirname # # removes $1 from user's $PATH if [ $# -ne 1 ]; then echo "Usage: $0 pathname" 1>&2; exit 1; fi delendum="$1" NEWPATH= xxx="$IFS" IFS=":" for i in $PATH ; do IFS="$xxx" case "$i" in "$delendum") ;; # do nothing *) [ -z "$NEWPATH" ] && NEWPATH="$i" || NEWPATH="$NEWPATH:$i" ;; esac done PATH="$NEWPATH" echo "$PATH"
