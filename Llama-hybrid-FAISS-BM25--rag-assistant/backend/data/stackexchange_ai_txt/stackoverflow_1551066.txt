Based on the responses it appears that Salesforce does not have a system object that can tell me if my Apex code is running in production or a sandbox environment. I am going to proceed based on the following assumptions: I can read the organisation id of the current environment The organisation id of my production system will always remain constant. The organisation id of a sandbox will always be different to production (as they are unique) The current organization ID can be found with System.getOrganizationId() My solution is to have my code compare the current org id to the constant value representing production.
