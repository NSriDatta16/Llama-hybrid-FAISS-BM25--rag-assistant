The biggest difference between BinaryFormatter and xml serialization is portability; BinaryFormatter is hard to guarantee between versions, so is only really suitable for shortterm storage or transfer. However, you can get the best of both, and have it smaller and have it quicker, by using bespoke binary serialization - and you don't even have to do it yourself ;-p protobuf-net is a .NET implementation of Google's protocol buffers binary serialization spec; it is smaller than either XmlSerializer or BinaryFormatter , fully portable (not just between versions - you can load a pb stream in, for example, java, etc), extensible, and fast. It is also pretty comprehensively tested, with a fair number of users. A full breakdown of size and speed, covering XmlSerializer , BinaryFormatter , DataContractSerializer and protobuf-net is here .
