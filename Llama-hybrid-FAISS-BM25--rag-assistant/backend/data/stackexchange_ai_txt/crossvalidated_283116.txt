Predicting sales over time given independent variable

I am trying to predict the sales of a product whose past 5 years data is available to me and some independent variable are also available (like the target market size, marketing budget, price, etc.). So now I can't use ARIMA or some time series model nor can I simply use regression to predict the sales. How should I go forward with this?
