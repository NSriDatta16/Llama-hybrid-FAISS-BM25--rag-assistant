Optimizing cumulative lift in classification

Suppose I have a business problem where I can reach out to 10% of my customers to prevent them from churning. I want to capture as much of the high risk customers I can. Let's say I'm tuning a random forest or GBM, then I can run a grid search and pick the model that has the highest (cross-validated) lift at the first decile. I'm wondering if there's a more direct/better way to achieve this. (Equivalently, I think I want to maximize AUC at the left portion of the ROC)
