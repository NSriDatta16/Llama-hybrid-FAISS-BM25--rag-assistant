For contemporaneous correlation I'd go with PCA. You look at the eigen vectors which have some components dominating the others in absolute values. However, this will not be able to catch the phase shifted correlations well. For instance, if you have a sine and cosine waves of the same frequency then correlation is going to be near zero, despite cosine being a sine with a phase shift. Still, if the phase shift is not too close to $\pi/2$, then this should catch the correlations to some degree. To handle the phase shifted (lagged) correlations the first thing that comes to my mind is coherence measure (related to cross-correlation and cross-spectra density). So, for the above example of sine and cosine waves, coherence will show you perfect 1, it'll see that it's the same wave. You can additionally get the phase shift. This is not the most efficient way because it requires pair wise analysis, i.e. the number of calculations grows as $n^2$ with $n$ number of series. It's certainly a brute force type of approach. Another way is by running FFT on series, then comparing the spectral densities. This is a bit tricky because you need to come up with a measure of similarity of densities. You could go for the biggest peaks and see whether they're close to each other to some degree. Suppose, you have two series with both having the biggest peaks in terms amplitudes in spectra at 10 days cycle, then they're correlated with some lag, that can also be obtained by looking at the phase component of FFT
