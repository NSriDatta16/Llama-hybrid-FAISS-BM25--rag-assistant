What's the right statistical analysis for temperature effects on turtle hibernation over time?

I have an assignment in which I am supposed to create a theoretical study design within a biological field. Currently, I have data from a group of seven turtles. For the assignment, I thought it would be interesting to study the effect that temperature has on the hibernation cycle of box turtles; however, Iâ€™m not sure what statistical analysis is best My null hypothesis is that temperature does not have a significant effect on the duration of the hibernation cycle of box turtles in my area from 2015-2020. However, I do not have enough experience with statistics to know how best to analyze the data. For the data themselves, each of the seven turtles was tracked roughly once a week for each of the years that I am examining. The start of hibernation is considered two consecutive weeks (two data points) in which the turtle did not move. The end of hibernation is marked as the week in which the turtle begins moving again in the spring. I also have the air and ground temperatures for each day that the turtles were successfully tracked. So, below is a simplified chart of what my data looks like for each turtle. There is some variation in the start and end dates of hibernation for individual turtles between years. Turtle A Date 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 Day 1 Ground Temp, Air Temp Ground Temp, Air Temp Ground Temp, Air Temp Ground Temp, Air Temp Ground Temp, Air Temp Ground Temp, Air Temp Day 2 Ground Temp, Air Temp Ground Temp, Air Temp Ground Temp, Air Temp Ground Temp, Air Temp Ground Temp, Air Temp Ground Temp, Air Temp Etc.. My question is, what is the best way that should analyze this data, given my hypothesis? I considered a regression of average temperature against hibernation duration, as well as an ANOVA (binning temperatures) because I have so few data points. However, because the same turtles are tracked for multiple years, I am concerned that the lack of independence between turtles will cause problems for these basic statistics.
