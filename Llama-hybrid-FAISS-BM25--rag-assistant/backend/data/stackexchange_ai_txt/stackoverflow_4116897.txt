see: $(DEVELOPER_ROOT)/Applications/Utilities/Accessibility Tools/Accessibility Inspector.app just open Accessibility Inspector.app and move the cursor over the views you're interested in for details (you may need to enable accessibility options in system preferences.app). it's also helpful to press cmd+F7 to lock onto a view and then to inspect its children. so... 3 primary options: 1) if you want drag & drop convenience, you can simulate it with a Gradient Button 2) or you can use the button with a custom image in the button to achieve something closer 3) or just create a new view subclass and render it using a CGGradient or NSGradient
