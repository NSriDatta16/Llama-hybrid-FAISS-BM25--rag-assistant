I personally don't understand transfer functions, but I think you got the xtransf and xreg reversed. At least in R's base arima it is xreg that contains your exogenous variables. It's my impression that a transfer function describes how (lagged data affects future values) rather than what . I'd try using xreg for your exogenous variables, perhaps using arima if arimax demands a transfer function. The problem is that your model is daily, but your data has both daily and yearly seasonality, and I'm not sure right now if a first difference (the order=(*, 1, *) ) will take care of that or not. (You certainly won't get magical year-round forecasts out of a model that only considers daily seasonality.) P.S. What is the time that you use in your lm ? Literal clock time or a 1-up observation number? I think you could get something by using a mixed-effect model ( lmer in the lme4 package), though I haven't figured out whether doing that correctly accounts for the autocorrelation that will occur in a time series. If not accounted for, which an lm does not, you might get an interesting fit, but your concept of how precise your prediction is will be way too optimistic.
