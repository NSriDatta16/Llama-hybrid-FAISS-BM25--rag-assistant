<?PHP, REGEX and me. A tragedy in three acts

long time listener. First time caller... Not strictly a PHP question as it involves regular expressions but this one has got me tearing my hair out. I have 3 regular expressions that I want to create, and only one is working correctly. Now I am not sure whether this is due to the fact that: I don't understand preg_match and ereg and their return codes as I haven't worked in PHP for about 7 years. My regular expressions are just plain wrong. I am mentally disabled. Either way here are the expressions and my feeble attempts in making them work. 1) Match any number starting with 2,3,4 or 5 then followed by 5 digits. (This one I think works) code: if (!ereg('/[2-5]\d{5}/', $_POST['packageNumber' ) { echo "The package number is not the correct format."; } 2) Match any number starting with 2,3,4 or 5 then followed by 5 digits then a period then a 1 or a 2. if (!ereg("/[2-5]\d{5}\.[1-2]/", $_POST['packageModifier' ) { echo "The package modifier is not the correct format."; } 3) Match any combination of alphanumerics, spaces,periods and hypens up to 50 characters. if (!ereg("/[0-9a-zA-Z\s\-\.]{0,50}/", $_POST['customerNumber' ) { echo "The customer number is not the correct format."; } If anyone can please tell me what I am doing wrong I'll give them my first born.
