direct_mail uses wrong templavoila template

No matter what I do doesntwork.com uses the templavoila template of work.com. I want doesntwork.com to use its own templavoila template, but dunno how. I use directmail with multiple domains in one typo3 tree. E.g. the domains: works.com and doesntwork.com. Directmail works with the first domain (works.com), but not with the second domain (doesntwork.com). works.com has its own sysfolder for directmail (named WorkNewsletters) doesntwork.com has its own sysfolder for directmail (named DoesntWorkNewsletters) works.com has its own sysfolder for templavoila (named WorkStorage) doesntwork.com has its own sysfolder for templavoila (named DoesntWorkStorage) The WorkNewsletters folder uses a green templavoila template for all it's subpages. This template is located in the WorkStorage folder. The DoesntWorkNewsletters folder uses a red templavoila template for all it's subpages. This template is located in the DoesntWorkStorage folder. I create a new directmail with the wizard, by choosing the directmail sysfolder for doesntwork.com selecting Internal Pages selecting Click here to create a new page that you can later send as a direct mail. typing in some dummy text and create the page still via the wizard, select the page created in the previous step I send it as a test email to to my own mailadress Details about the installation: typo3 version 4.4.6 direct_mail version 2.6.9 Realurl is not used. Cronjob runs every 2 minute. In the root template of DoesntWork I have added this to the setup config.baseURL = http://doesntwork.com/ In the root template of Work I have added this to the setup config.baseURL = http://work.com/ On the WorkNewsletter folder I have added a template with this is the setup field plugin.tx_directmail_pi1.siteUrl = http://work.com/ On the DoesntWorkNewsletter folder I have added a template with this is the setup field plugin.tx_directmail_pi1.siteUrl = http://doesntwork.com/ I have tried to send mails by using the backend when logged in at http://doesntwork.com/typo3/ but it didn't make any difference. Anything obvious I have done wrong? What can I do to debug it?
