Android TextView Linkify problem with phone numbers and application version number

I have a problem with TextView and autoLink feature. I have an about screen in my application with some information like support phone number, email address, website URL and application version in form like 01.01.01 After setting autoLink="all" on the textView, all values are linked fine - except that version number 01.01.01 is linked as the phone number as well. Is there some way to exclude this text fragment from linkifing?
