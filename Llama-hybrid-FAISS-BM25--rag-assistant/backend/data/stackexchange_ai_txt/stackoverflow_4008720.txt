What is wrong with this script? Yeah, pretty much everything. From the missing parentheses on the if statement, to the old-school language attribute, to the potentially-navigation-breaking JavaScript-redirect, to the whole idea of redirecting based on crude user-agent sniffing. Your strategy will fail for Windows Mobile (contains “Windows CE”), Windows Phone, iPhone/iPad (contains the string “like Mac OS X”), and Android devices (contains “Linux”). That's a pretty good coverage of major mobile OSes to fail on, not to mention the desktop browsers that might not include any of those tokens. You might be able to improve this by sniffing for particular cases you want to detect. See this list for an overview of what exists. Treating all “mobile” devices as the same is unlikely to make sense when that category encompasses everything from barely-internet-capable featurephones to large-screen tablets. Modern mobile browsers are quite capable of rendering normal HTML pages, especially if you encourage accessibility by using liquid layout, and handheld-stylesheets to reduce necessary content width.
