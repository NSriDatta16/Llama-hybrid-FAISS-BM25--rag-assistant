OP points out in an edit that s/he was not using the same loss function as was used in the reference code. Because OP’s code didn’t match the reference, it’s not surprising that the RL agent found a different result. Incidentally, this is why I recommend unit tests and careful debugging as a core part of building neural networks specifically and programming generally.
