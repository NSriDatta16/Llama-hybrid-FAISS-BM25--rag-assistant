Is it safe to unset PHP super-globals if this behavior is documented?

I'm building a PHP framework, and in it I have a request object that parses the url as well as the $_GET , $_POST and $_FILE superglobals. I want to encourage safe web habits, so I'm protecting the data against SQL injection, etc. In order to ensure users of this framework are accessing the safe, clean data through the request object, I plan to use unset($_GET, $_POST, $_REQUEST); after parsing those variables. I will document this in the method comments, and explain in the framework documentation that this is happening. My question is: Would this be desirable behavior? What are the potential pitfalls that I have not foreseen?
