Interpreting partial dependence plots (marginal effects) using plotmo

I'm computing partial dependence plots to visualize the relationship between predictors (including interactions) and outcome. I study patients with brain tumours and mortality is very high (90%). I use random forest (randomForest package) to perform binary classification (dead yes/no). Moreover, I use the plotmo package, which appears to be outstanding for visualizing such relationships, to visualize the variable relationships. Below is the output from plotmo, where the interaction between age and metastasis is visualized: My questions are actually noted on the image. Using the built-in partial dependence plots in the randomForest package does not help to clarify these things). Reading the package tutorials on CRAN did not help as well. Please refer to the image above to see what is unclear regarding this. I'm deeply grateful for any thoughts you guys may offer.
