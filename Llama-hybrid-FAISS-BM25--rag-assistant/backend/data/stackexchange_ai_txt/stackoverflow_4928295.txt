MySQL Query Questions (number of queries sent to the server.)?

The website I am currently developing is handled by a variety of classes that I have developed to ensure the best of my sites needs to run in tip-top shape. The only thing I can think of right now is, how many questions(queries) should a user sending per page load? This page does include the following: Announcement - 5PER PAGE USER LOGIN/VERIFICATION - EACH PAGE VIDEO BLOG - CHECKS IF IT'S ENABLED OR OFF 8 queries on average are sent at a maximum of 3KB's per page. Should I be worried or encouraged to keep continuing? :)
