You need .filter() to search elements at the same level, like this: $(pj).filter("p"); $("p",pj) translates to $(pj).find("p") under the covers, that's why it's not finding anything, because the elements are descendants of pj , they're members. To be clear, jQuery doesn't need them to be contained in anything, it's a descendant vs non-descendant issue. The alternative approach is to add them to a temporary fragment and always use .find() , like this: var p = " my div 1 para1 para2 para3 my div 2 " var pj = $(' ').html(p); Then $("p",pj) would work.
