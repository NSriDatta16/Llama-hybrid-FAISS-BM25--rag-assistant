Advice on stopping donation fraud

I work for a non-profit organisation and have created and online donations page. Recently this donations page has been used to validate stolen credit card details via the process known as Carding . The way it works is that a slacker get hold of a whole bunch of credit details but doesn't know which numbers are good or not. So they go to a donations page and attempt a small donation ($5 or less) with the stolen card number. If the donations goes through then they can use the number for bigger purchases. Carding can cost a non-profit a lot of money as most these "donations" will end being reversed and in some cases a charge back fee will be charged by the bank. Has anyone else had experience with this? Also, what are some ways that I could stop it?
