Is this a valid way to construct a confidence interval?

The rule of three states that, if we observe $Y\sim \text{Bin}(n,p)$ to be 0, then $[0,3/n]$ is a 95% confidence interval for $p$. I'm confused about the derivation for this rule on Wikipedia and elsewhere. Wikipedia equates finding a 95% confidence interval to finding all $p$ such that $P_p(Y=0)\geq 0.05$. I'm struggling to reconcile this with my own understanding that a 95% confidence interval is a random region $C(Y)$ such that $P_p(C(Y)\text{ covers }p)=0.95$ for all $p$. Edit: I realized that my question was vague (and I've deleted a mistaken guess about Wikipedia's underlying logic). My main question is: how is the Wikipedia argument justified? My other, related question is: How do you verify the coverage probability for the interval, given that it's only defined for one possible value of $Y$?
