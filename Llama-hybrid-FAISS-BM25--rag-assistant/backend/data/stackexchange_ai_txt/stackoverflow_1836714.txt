It will be helpful to make all the changes you can beforehand, but if there is a question, you might save some time to waiting until after the conversion. You will have a few changes to make afterward, but you can go ahead and make the .net conversion,then clean up what is left behind. For example, you might convert the variant here to a string before the .net conversion, only to find out the the .net listview DragEventArgs.data is something different. (I'm not sure what it is, but it would be easier to find out after you did the conversion.)
