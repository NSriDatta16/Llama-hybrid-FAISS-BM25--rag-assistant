You could of course use the variance as an indicator of "spread", however I don't think this is the right approach. (Especially if you look at the first n results only.) Relevance is a big thing in information retrieval. It depends on the ranking method and also on the probability of a search term to occur as well as on the relevance of other search terms. Something you could do: Calculate the expected occurences (mean-count) of a search term in a random document. Then compare the number of occurences in the returned result. Your ranking will then be counts-in-my-doc / mean-count. A document is relevant if the result of this is significantly higher than 1.
