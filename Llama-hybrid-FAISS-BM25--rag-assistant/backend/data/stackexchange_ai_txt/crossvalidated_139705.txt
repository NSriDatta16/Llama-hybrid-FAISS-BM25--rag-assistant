You could use time series outlier detection to detect changes in time series. Tsay's or Chen and Liu's procedures are popular time series outlier detection methods . See my earlier question on this site. R's tsoutlier package uses Chen and Liu's method for detection outliers. SAS/SPSS/Autobox can also do this. See below for the R code to detect changes in time series. library("tsoutliers") dat.ts tso function in tsoultlier package identifies following outliers. You can read documentation to find out the type of outliers. Outliers: type ind time coefhat tstat 1 TC 42 42 -2.9462 -10.068 2 AO 43 43 1.0733 4.322 3 AO 45 45 -1.2113 -4.849 4 TC 47 47 1.0143 3.387 5 AO 51 51 0.9002 3.433 6 AO 52 52 -1.3455 -5.165 7 AO 56 56 0.9074 3.710 8 LS 62 62 1.1284 3.717 9 AO 67 67 -1.3503 -5.502 the package also provides nice plots. see below. The plot shows where the outliers are and also what would have happened if there were no outliers. I have also used R package called strucchange to detect level shifts. As an example on your data library("strucchange") breakpoints(dat.ts~1) The program correctly identifies breakpoints or structural changes. Optimal 4-segment partition: Call: breakpoints.formula(formula = dat.ts ~ 1) Breakpoints at observation number: 17 41 87 Corresponding to breakdates: 17 41 87 Hope this helps
