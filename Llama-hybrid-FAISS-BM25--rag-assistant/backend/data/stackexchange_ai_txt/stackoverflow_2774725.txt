Do you have an index on the column ProductGroupID? If so are your indexes fragmented? Are your statistics up to date? Have you reviewed the Query Plans produced? Are they the same? When you are performance tuning a query you should strive to ensure that you are comparing like for like, that is that each query is retrieving the result set from disk and not the buffer cache. You can clear the buffer cache using the command DBCC DROPCLEANBUFFERS however this is NOT often an option for a production database. You will also want to ensure that the statistics are up to date for the columns that form part of your WHERE clause predicates. This will ensure that SQL Server determines the most optimal query plan to use based on the selectivity of your data.
