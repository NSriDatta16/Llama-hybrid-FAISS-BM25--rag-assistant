some discretized version of the Cauchy distribution Yes, if you take $p(n)$ as being the average value of the Cauchy distribution in the interval around $n$, then clearly its zeroth moment is the same as that of the Cauchy distribution, and its first moment asymptotically approaches the first moment of the Cauchy distribution. As far as "the interval around $n$", it doesn't really matter how you define that; take $(n-1,n]$, $[n,n+1)$, $[n-.5,n+.5)$, vel cetera , and it will work. For positive integers, you can also take $p(n) =\frac6{(n\pi)^2}$. The zeroth moment sums to one, and the first moment is the sum of $\frac6{n\pi^2}$, which diverges. And in fact for any polynomial $p(n)$, there is some $c$ such that $\frac c {p(n)}$ sums to 1. If we then take the $k$th moment, where $k$ is the order of $p(n)$, that will diverge.
