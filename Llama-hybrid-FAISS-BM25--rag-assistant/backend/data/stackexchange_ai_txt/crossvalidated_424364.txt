What happens to the log likelihood when the maximum likelihood estimate does not exist?

What happens to the log likelihood (or indeed the likelihood) function, when the MLE does not exist? The log likelihood is defined (for independent observations) as $$l(\boldsymbol{\theta}) = \Sigma_{i=1}^N\text{ln}(P(y_i|\mathbf{x}_i,\boldsymbol{\theta}))$$ where the sum is over the observations, the $y_i$ are the endogenous variable values and the $\mathbf{x_i}$ are the values of the covariates in the ith observation. The maximum likelihood estimator is $$\boldsymbol{\theta}^* = argmax_\boldsymbol{\theta} \ l(\boldsymbol{\theta})$$ with a corresponding log likelihood $$l(\boldsymbol{\theta}^*) = max_\boldsymbol{\theta} \ \Sigma_{i=1}^N\text{ln}(P(y_i|\mathbf{x}_i,\boldsymbol{\theta}))$$ I understand that this may depend on the model, and perhaps even on the covariate distribution. I am particularly interested in the logistic regression with i.i.d. Gaussian covariates, however more general answers or answers for other models/distributions would be most welcome.
