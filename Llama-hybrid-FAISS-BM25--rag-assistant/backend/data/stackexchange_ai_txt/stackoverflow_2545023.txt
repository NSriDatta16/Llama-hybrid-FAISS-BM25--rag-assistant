How to make a parameter optional in WSDL?

I have a WebService API which needs 2 of its parameters to be optional in the WSDL public wsProxy[] Insert(wsProxy[] proxies, string loginname, string password, bool returnNewData) { //code here } I need to a way to show loginname and password as optional in the WSDL. Is there any way to do this in C#. Can I maybe add an tag in front of the parameters like this [optional]loginname ? I have been looking around but haven't been able to find anything so far.
