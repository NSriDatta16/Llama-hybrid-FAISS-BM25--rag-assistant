In terms of today's technology, are these meaningful concerns about data size?

We're adding extra login information to an existing database record on the order of 3.85KB per login. There are two concerns about this: 1) Is this too much on-the-wire data added per login? 2) Is this too much extra data we're storing in the database per login? Given todays technology, are these valid concerns? Background: We don't have concrete usage figures, but we average about 5,000 logins per month. We hope to scale to larger customers, howerver, still in the 10's of 1000's per month, not 1000's per second. In the US (our market) broadband has 60% market adoption.
