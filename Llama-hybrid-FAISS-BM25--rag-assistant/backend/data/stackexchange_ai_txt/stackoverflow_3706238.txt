It's the ID selector, a fundamental feature of the CSS standard. It matches the HTML element with the given ID, according to the id attribute (assuming a conforming document, of course). See the W3C Selectors spec for more. #my-div { color: #f00; } This text will be red. This text will not be red. You may also have seen the # notation used in a URL fragment identifier to refer to named anchors ( ). These can also point to elements with certain IDs in your page, just like named anchors, and I gather that it's why CSS uses the same notation for selecting IDs.
