I don't really understand what you mean by "be too much and too important and how we minimize its impact". Object-oriented programming is a paradigm that arose because it's a more natural way to think about and organize solutions to problem sets than just functions-operating-on-data. Because it's a more natural way to think about most problems, the real question should be "how can we tell when we're not using object orientation effectively and refactor our code to improve our solution?"
