Well, that's like asking: why are people still use statistical models? Off the top of my head: Interpretable effect estimates with CIs and p-values, i.e. you can use the model for (causal) inference Parametric CIs on predictions Faster, and better use of your data, because (if you trust the maths) no need to set data aside for validation Ability to include prior knowledge on structure and parameters Due to the simpler model structure you can have smaller predictive error if the training dataset is small If you are looking from a purely predictive ML viewpoint (and don't care about inference at all), I would say the logistic regression is a simple benchmark that you should run to see if you super shiny DNN does anything useful at all - if you can't beat the logistic regression, go home!
