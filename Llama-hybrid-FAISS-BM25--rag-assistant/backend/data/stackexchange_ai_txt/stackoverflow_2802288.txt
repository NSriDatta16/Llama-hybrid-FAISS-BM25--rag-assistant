I encountered a situation with Chrome where a page had no cache-control or expiration the first time Chrome loaded it (which was many months ago as I write this) and even though meta tags were later added to the page explicitly setting the expiration policy, Chrome never honored them. What had to be done to force a reload was to supply a dummy query-string argument -- just once, merely to get the page to reload with its newly added meta tags-- and thenceforward Chrome began to honor the expiration settings in the meta tags. BTW, I could not reproduce the problem with documents without meta tags that I created this week; the problem only affected documents that had been first loaded by Chrome many months ago. Perhaps the way Chrome caches documents lacking an expiration policy had changed in the interim, so that only documents loaded before the change were being cached in perpetuity. P.S. I know that this question was asked months ago and the OP may have solved his problem by now -- but you never know when someone's going to come along a few months from now looking for help on the same problem. So the "dead question police" can stand down.
