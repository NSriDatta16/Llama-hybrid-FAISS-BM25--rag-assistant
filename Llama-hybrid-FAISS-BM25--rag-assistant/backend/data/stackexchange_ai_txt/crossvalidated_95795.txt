How to determine the thresholds in oredered logistic regression

from what I have studied in the data mining course (please correct me if I'm wrong) - in logistic regression, when the response variable is binary, then from the ROC curve we can determine the threshold. Now I'm trying to apply the logistic regression for an ordinal categorical response variable with more than two categories (4). I used the function polr in r: > polr1 summary(polr1) Re-fitting to get Hessian Call: polr(formula = Category ~ Division + ST.Density, data = Versions.data) Coefficients: Value Std. Error t value DivisionAP -0.8237 0.5195 -1.586 DivisionAT -0.8989 0.5060 -1.776 DivisionBC -1.5395 0.5712 -2.695 DivisionCA -1.8102 0.5240 -3.455 DivisionEM -0.5580 0.4607 -1.211 DivisionNA -1.7568 0.4704 -3.734 ST.Density 0.3444 0.0750 4.592 Intercepts: Value Std. Error t value 1|2 -1.3581 0.4387 -3.0957 2|3 -0.5624 0.4328 -1.2994 3|4 1.2661 0.4390 2.8839 Residual Deviance: 707.8457 AIC: 727.8457 How should I interpret the Intercepts? and how can I determine the threshold for each group? Thanks
