When you're creating a bindings-compatible control (or, in your case, subclassing one), it's up to the control to notify the controller when its value changes. So, what you'll want to do is override - (void)bind:(NSString *)binding toObject:(id)observableController withKeyPath:(NSString *)keyPath options:(NSDictionary *)options and keep an eye out for the binding you're interested in. Keep track of observableController and keyPath (as well as the options dictionary if any value transformers will be used). When you update your control's value, you'll need to send [observableController setValue:newValue forKeyPath:keyPath]; to update the controller with the new value. Key value observing is a one-way street, and in bindings the controls are the observers.
