What would these ratingOne to ratingFive fields contain? The number of votes received? Then you won't know who cast the vote. If you really do need to denormalize, I'd just add an "average rating" field to the the picture table, and update that whenever a vote is cast (and keep the ratings table as is). More generally, don't get caught in premature optimalisation. Try writing a test script which creates 100.000 pictures and 1 million ratings (or whatever figure you want to support), and see how long your AVG query takes. Chances are it will still be plenty fast. Make sure your "ratings" table has an index on pictureID, so the DB doesnt need to traverse the million rows.
