laalto is right, pretty much any Semantic Web library is going to do it via recursive subClassOf retrieval. Only way you might get around this would be to have some inference/reasoning engine which would add additional Triples to the Graph as the original Graph is parsed So for example it would automatically add the following: . . . . . . # etc... How you do this in Jena I'm not sure, someone else who knows Jena would have to answer that. As for SPARQL laalto is again entirely correct, in some cases though you might be able to do a simple query like the following if the Triple Store and the associated SPARQL endpoint you query have some inference capabilities PREFIX my: PREFIX rdf: ASK { my:HomoSapiens rdf:type my:Mammal }
