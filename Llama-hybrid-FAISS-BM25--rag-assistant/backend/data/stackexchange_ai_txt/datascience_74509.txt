I don't know if that is the case, but if some kind of continuity assumptions are realistic, you could try to move away from categorical variables (block) to continuous variables (longitude and latitude). Then, if you have information on two neighboring blocks, you could interpolate those values with say a spline. Of course, this can also be fitted into a machine learning model with predictors such as average income of blocks with distance Your state level data can serve as a predictor and also as validation. Also, plotting your data always helps get some kind of intuition.
