Recall the definitions of precision and recall: $$p=\frac{TP}{TP+FP}, r=\frac{TP}{TP+FN}$$ Both of them have meaning and focus on false positives or negatives. On the other hand, $F_1$ score seeks a common ground between them and has a meaning as well: $$F_1=\frac{TP}{TP+\frac{1}{2}(FP+FN)}$$ where instead of taking only the false positives or negatives, their average is taken as false classifications. All of the three formulas, in some way, define their true and false s and calculate success. Of course, one could use $pr$ (or another measure) as a means for model selection, but note that you wouldn't reach a similar meaning with either $(p+r)/2$ or $pr$ .
