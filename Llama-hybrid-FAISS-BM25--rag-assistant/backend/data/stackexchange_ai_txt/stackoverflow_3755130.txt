I can see two possible errors. First, as @invalidname pointed out, recording in stereo probably isn't going to work on a mono device such as the iPhone. Well, it might work, but if it does, you're just going to get back dual-mono stereo streams anyways, so why bother? You might as well configure your stream to work in mono and spare yourself the CPU overhead. The second problem is probably the source of your sound distortion. Your stream description format flags should be: kAudioFormatFlagIsSignedInteger | kAudioFormatFlagsNativeEndian | kAudioFormatFlagIsPacked Also, don't forget to set the mReserved flag to 0. While the value of this flag is probably being ignored, it doesn't hurt to explicitly set it to 0 just to make sure. Edit : Another more general tip for debugging audio on the iPhone -- if you are getting distortion, clipping, or other weird effects, grab the data payload from your phone and look at the recording in a wave editor. Being able to zoom down and look at the individual samples will give you a lot of clues about what's going wrong. To do this, you need to open up the "Organizer" window, click on your phone, and then expand the little arrow next to your application (in the same place where you would normally uninstall it). Now you will see a little downward pointing arrow, and if you click it, Xcode will copy the data payload from your app to somewhere on your hard drive. If you are dumping your recordings to disk, you'll find the files extracted here.
