Scattered write is great because it allows you to write to any memory address. Previous shader impementations were usually limited in the memory addresses which a given shader program could write to. "Whereas fragment programs in graphics APIs are limited to outputting 32 floats (RGBA * 8 render targets) at a pre-specified location, CUDA supports scattered writes - i.e. an unlimited number of stores to any address. This enables many new algorithms that were not possible using graphics APIS to perform efficiently using CUDA" From the CUDA FAQ: http://forums.nvidia.com/index.php?s=fd8a3833d78a50e273c5c731476eed0d&showtopic=84440&pid=478583&start=0&#entry478583 Basically it makes CUDA programs easier to write because they aren't as limited by where they can write results. Bear in mind that one of the keys to getting good performance on a GPU is exploiting memory locality. Overusing scattered writes by writing to global memory a lot will most likely impact your performance.
