I found the following which I think are good enough for what I need. • Blacklight’s Drag Dock Panel - http://blacklight.codeplex.com/ - Not a VS-style full-featured dock, but good enough to present multiple tabs in a variety of layouts. • Win Toolbar - http://wintoolbar.codeplex.com/ - not resizable, but looks good.
