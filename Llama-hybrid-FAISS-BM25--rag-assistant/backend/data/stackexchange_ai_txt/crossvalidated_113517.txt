In general there is no reason to do variable selection. The model uncertainty and bias resulting from it are problematic. Insignificant variables are not tragic. And the data are incapable of telling which variables are "really" important. But if you have true costs of measuring variables, you can fit a well-defined sequence of models by adding variables in ascending order of cost, and stop when you have the best model for the money. There is little model uncertainty when using an apriori ordering of variables.
