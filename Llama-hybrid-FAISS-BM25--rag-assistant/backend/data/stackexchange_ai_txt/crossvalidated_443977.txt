how to deal with time series data for svm multi-class classification problem

I am more used to data sets that looks like the breast cancer data set and iris flower data set, and am very unfamiliar with time series data sets. The problem is to classify signals according to the output signal given a unique signal pattern over a period of time. How do I go about in labelling the data and proceed with training and classification? given that the data looks like the following, $$\begin{array}{|c|c|} \hline time&signal\\ \hline 0.0010&0.002292\\ \hline 0.0020&0.004544\\ \hline 0.0030&0.004752\\ \hline 0.0040&0.004912\\ \hline 0.0050&0.004534\\ \hline \end{array}$$
