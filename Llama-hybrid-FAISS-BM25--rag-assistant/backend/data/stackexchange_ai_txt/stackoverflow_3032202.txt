Making a circular NSSlide look and behave like in GarageBand

I am new to drawing with Cocoa, and I am making some software which will have sliders similar to these found in GarageBand: GB Sliders http://img33.imageshack.us/img33/2668/schermafbeelding2010061r.png These look beautiful and can be controld by moving the mouse up and down. Can you help me with customizing NSSliders by subclassing them, so I can make them look and behave exactly as in GarageBand? Thanks. I have one image for the knob which should be rotated as they do not need to be in 3D .
