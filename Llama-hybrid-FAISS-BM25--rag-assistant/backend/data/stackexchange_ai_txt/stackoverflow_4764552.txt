I think by default the Python Engine does not set the paths you need automatically. http://www.voidspace.org.uk/ironpython/custom_executable.shtml has an example for embedding ironpython. Looks like you are missing something like PythonEngine engine = new PythonEngine(); engine.AddToPath(Path.GetDirectoryName(Application.ExecutablePath)); engine.AddToPath(MyPathToStdLib); Unless I know where and if Ironpython is installed, I prefer to find all of the standard modules I need, compile them to a IPyStdLibDLL and then do th following from my code import clr clr.addReference("IPyStdLib") import site
