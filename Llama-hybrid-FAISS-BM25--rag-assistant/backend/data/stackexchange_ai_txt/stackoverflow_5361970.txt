The question is vague, but anyway here goes: Each peer generates a unique encryption key - known only to itself. When it needs to store data, it should do e.g: Hash data with e.g. a SHA algorithm, concatenate data and hash, encrypt, store. This allows for a cheap verification of data after retrieval without having to deal with asymmetric algorithms. To summarize: Use hashing and symmetric encryption algorithms without known weaknesses, such as SHA-2 and AES, avoid e.g. MD5 and DES. No need for asymmetric algorithms such as RSA/DSA, rather sign with an embedded hash.
