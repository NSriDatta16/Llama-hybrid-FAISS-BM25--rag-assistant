It's not quite that easy. The only general rule of thumb is that you should look for another solution when the current one can't keep up anymore. That could include using different software (not necessarily in any globally fixed order), hardware or architecture. You will probably get a lot more benefit out of caching data using something like memcached than switching to another random storage backend.
