If the file "metadata" is stored in a database, you can just name the files with a GUID and their extension. The simplest way to give them back to the users is to store them directly inside you web application, so they are available through simple urls, if security constraints are not too tight : http://my.web.site/files/cbacd260-10ec-4377-bd19-25daa1fd0fe2.pdf If you really want to serve your files through and HttpHandler, I'd use Response.TransmitFile( Server.MapPath("path/to/files/cbacd260-10ec-4377-bd19-25daa1fd0fe2.pdf" ); Documentation here : http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/12s31dhy%28VS.80%29.aspx The expected number of users is also very important. 30 users a day aren't the same as 30 000. File volumetry is also important : you talk about gigabytes, but you won't manage 30 GB as you manage 300. For the physical storage of files, try to avoid storing too many (2500+ in my opinion) files in the same directory. But usually, for file upload sites, you will have them "grouped" logically, so you can have a subdirectory.
