I almost always agree with cletus but im gonna play both sides and say where does one draw the line? do you keep maintaining that project that got handed to you from late 1903? When should one bite the bullet and rewrite the system? I think when given an project as disjointed as what you are describing, you should fragment the system into features, milestones that you what to achieve and test test test, tests that validates the feature you are rewriting.
