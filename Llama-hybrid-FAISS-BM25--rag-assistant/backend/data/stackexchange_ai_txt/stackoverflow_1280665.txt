You're in a bad situation. You have three(ish!) options: Quit (it sounds pretty bad, so this may be a good decision!) Complain and do nothing while hoping for the best. Constructively complain and do something about it. Make incremental improvements. Set up source control, a bug tracker, continuous integration, unit testing. Don't ask for permission, just do it. Show people the benefits of doing this. There's a good Joel article on this subject and, as the Pragmatic Programmer says, "it's easier to ask for forgiveness than permission". The bonus of this approach is that, even if nobody takes any notice of you or buys in to the improvements, it will be a good talking point if you interview at another company. It will prove that you think about your day to day development effectiveness and that you're a do-er rather than a whiner. :) Good luck.
