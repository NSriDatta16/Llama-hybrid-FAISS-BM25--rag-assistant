Also, I'd highly recommend looking at Feeder for constructing your Sparkle RSS feed. It can generate a DSA signature for you automatically, once you drag your binary into an update entry. It also can upload your binaries and feed to your server for you. Overall, it's saved me a tremendous amount of time with my Sparkle feeds.
