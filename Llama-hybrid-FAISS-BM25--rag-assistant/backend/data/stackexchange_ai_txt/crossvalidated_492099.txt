By independence and standard rules for variances, $$ Var(\bar{X})=\frac{1}{n^2}Var\left(\sum_iX_i\right)=\frac{1}{n^2}\sum_iVar(X_i) $$ Given identical distributions, $$ \frac{1}{n^2}\sum_iVar(X_i)=\frac{n}{n^2}Var(X_1)\to0 $$ Hence, the variability in the sample mean disappears, so to speak, when computing it over many realizations of the underlying random variable. Given that the mean is also unbiased for the expected value, convergence in probability follows. As an example, if you toss dice infinitely often, luck will "average out", with you tossing 3.5 on average.
