One reasonable perspective on statistics / econometrics is that the estimated model should be able to reproduce the data actually observed ( Rubin 1984 ; McFadden, 1989 ; Gouri√©roux et al., 1993 ; Gelman et al., 2014 ). In order to do so, sampling from the potential (statistical) model via pseudo-random generators is paramount. As commented by John Madden , Bayesian statistics is strongly connected with sampling / simulation, since this is often the only feasible way to represent the posterior distribution.
