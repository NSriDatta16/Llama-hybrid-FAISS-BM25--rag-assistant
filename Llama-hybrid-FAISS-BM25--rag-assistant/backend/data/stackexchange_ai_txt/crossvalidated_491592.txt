MCMC: long burn in vs re-initialization of the chain?

The developer of the well-known emcee package often gives this advice to help with chain convergence: Run a short (few hundred steps) chain Reinitialize all the walkers near the point with maximum log probability seen so far Return to step 1 a few times Then run your final chain starting where you ended up for your last run of step 1 My question is: is this any different than simply allowing the chain(s) to run for more steps and then discard a longer burn-in period? I.e., is this any different from a "normal" run with more burn-in steps?
