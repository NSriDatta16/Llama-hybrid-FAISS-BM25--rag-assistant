If you are interested in the mechanism by which language detection can be performed, I refer you to the following article (python based) that uses a (very) naive method but is a good introduction to this problem in particular and machine learning (just a big word) in general. For java implementations, JLangDetect and Nutch as suggested by the other posters are pretty good. Also take a look at Lingpipe , JTCL and NGramJ . For the problem where you have multiple languages in the same page, you can use a sentence boundary detector to chop a page into sentences and then attempt to identify the language of each sentence. Assuming that a sentence contains only one (primary) language, you should still get good results with any of the above implementations. Note: A sentence boundary detector (SBD) is theoretically language specific (chicken-egg problem since you need one for the other). But for latin-script based languages (English, French, German, etc.) that primarily use periods (apart from exclamations etc.) for sentence delimiting, you will get acceptable results even if you use an SBD designed for English. I wrote a rules-based English SBD that has worked really well for French text. For implementations, take a look at OpenNLP . An alternative option to using the SBD is to use a sliding window of say 10 tokens (whitespace delimited) to create a pseudo-sentence (PS) and try and identify the border where the language changes. This has the disadvantage that if your entire document has n tokens, you will perform approximately n-10 classification operations on strings of length 10 tokens each. In the other approach, if the average sentence has 10 tokens, you would have performed approximately n/10 classification operations. If n = 1000 words in a document, you are comparing 990 operations versus 100 operations: an order of magnitude difference. If you have short phrases (under 20 characters), accuracy of language detection is poor in my experience. Particularly in the case of proper nouns as well as nouns that are same across languages like "chocolate". E.g. Is "New York" an English word or a French word if it appears in a French sentence?
