Basically just draw a Venn diagram of two overlapping circles that are supposed to represent sets of events. Call them A and B. Now the intersection of the two is P(A, B) which can be read probability of A AND B. By the basic rules of probability, P(A, B) = P(A | B) P(B). And since there is nothing special about A versus B, it must also be P(B| A) P(A). Equating these two gives you Bayes Theorem. Bayes Theorem is really quite simple. Bayesian statistics is harder because of two reason. One is that it takes a bit of abstraction to go from talking about random roles of dice to the probability that some fact is True. It required you to have a prior and this prior effects the posterior probability that you get in the end. And when you have to marginalize out a lot of parameters along the way, it is harder to see exactly how it is affected. Some find that this seems kind of circular. But really, there is no way of getting around it. Data analyzed with a model doesn't lead you directly to Truth. Nothing does. It simply allows you to update your beliefs in a consistent way. The other hard thing about Bayesian statistics is that the calculations become quite difficult except for simple problems and this is why all the mathematics is brought in to deal with it. We need to take advantage of every symmetry that we can to make the calculations easier or else resort to Monte Carlo simulations. So Bayesian statistics is hard but Bayes theorem is really not hard at all. Don't over think it! It follows directly from the fact that the "AND" operator, in a probabilistic context, is symmetric. A AND B is the same as B AND A and everyone seems to understand that intuitively.
