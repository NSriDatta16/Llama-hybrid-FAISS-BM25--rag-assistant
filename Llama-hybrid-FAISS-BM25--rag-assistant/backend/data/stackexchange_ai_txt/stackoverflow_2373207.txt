Am I using delete correctly here?

I've just started combining my knowledge of C++ classes and dynamic arrays. I was given the advice that "any time I use the new operator" I should delete. I also know how destructors work, so I think this code is correct: main.cpp ... int main() { PicLib *lib = new PicLib; beginStorage(lib); return 0; } void beginStorage(PicLib *lib) { ... if (command != 'q') { //let's assume I add a whole bunch //of stuff to PicLib and have some fun here beginStorage(lib); } else { delete lib; lib = NULL; cout PicLib.cpp ... PicLib::PicLib() { database = new Pic[MAX_DATABASE]; num_pics = 0; } PicLib::~PicLib() { delete[] database; database = NULL; num_pics = 0; } ... I fill my PicLib with a Pic class, containing more dynamic arrays. Pic 's destructor deletes them in the same manner seen above. I think that delete [] database gets rid of all those classes properly. So is the delete in main.cpp necessary? Everything looking hunky dory here?
