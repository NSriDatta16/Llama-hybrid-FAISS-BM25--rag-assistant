Might want to stratify the data based on those demographic variables to find a small set of "food patterns," simple frequency distributions of food. Once the patterns are selected, re-stratify by pattern. Combine the subject logs within each pattern to estimate a Markov chain of meal choices. Voila! one-ahead meal predictions. Given enough data, you can tweak to make two-ahead predictions.
