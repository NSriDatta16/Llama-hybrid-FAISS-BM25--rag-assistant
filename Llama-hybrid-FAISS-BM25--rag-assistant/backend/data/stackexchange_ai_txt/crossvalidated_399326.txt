Here is a heuristic idea: The likelihood for a logistic regression model is $$ \ell(\beta|y) \propto \prod_i\left(\frac{\exp(x_i'\beta)}{1+\exp(x_i'\beta)}\right)^{y_i}\left(\frac{1}{1+\exp(x_i'\beta)}\right)^{1-y_i} $$ and the MLE is the arg max of that likelihood. When you scale a regressor, you also need to accordingly scale the coefficients to achieve the original maximal likelihood.
