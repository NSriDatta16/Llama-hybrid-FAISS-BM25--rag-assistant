Synthesizing @whuber's answer, and googling a bit: it seems at least one person writes the interval as $(\cdot, \cdot)$, https://www.mathbootcamps.com/three-ways-write-confidence-interval/ however this source also uses the $+/- \text{margin-of-error}$ notation and at the end they conclude: if you are taking a statistics course, it is of important to pay attention to how your professor or textbook prefers to present confidence intervals and generally stick to that method If instead, you are using confidence intervals in your research, it is probably important to consider your audience. Most people have no trouble understanding the idea of adding and subtracting a margin of error, even if they havenâ€™t had much formal training in statistics As far as the use for statistical significant testing, @whuber has a huge and comprehensive reply at https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/18259/10278 : "Yes, there are some simple relationships between confidence interval comparisons and hypothesis tests in a wide range of practical settings. However, in addition to verifying the CI procedures and t-test are appropriate for our data, we must check that the sample sizes are not too different and that the two sets have similar standard deviations . We also should not attempt to derive highly precise p-values from comparing two confidence intervals, but should be glad to develop effective approximations."
