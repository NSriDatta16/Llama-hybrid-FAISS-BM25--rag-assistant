It is possible that the problem is that the convert application you use just does not support embedding PNG into EPS. When using properly configured Adobe Acrobat Professional I newer got unexpectedly huge increase of the file size. But you should properly configure first your "PNG to PDF" conversion settings. Then you should export (or Save As) generated PDF as EPS from Acrobat.
