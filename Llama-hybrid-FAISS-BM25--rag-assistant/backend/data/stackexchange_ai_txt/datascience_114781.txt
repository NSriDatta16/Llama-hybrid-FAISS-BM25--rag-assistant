What are valid measures for reporting k-fold score in the case of confusion-matrix?

I know when model is made to predict a float value, a common approach to report the models validation is using k-fold technique and calculating the average of all folds accuracy ( here is a similar question). Now suppose that my model is a classifier and each fold outputs a confusion matrix. how can i combine confusion matrixs
