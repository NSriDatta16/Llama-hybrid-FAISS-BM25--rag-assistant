Just pass the ID of the current record to the details activity. This will then query the details for the ID given and get a Cursor for that record. Then create a class which extends ViewSwitcher (the user will only be able to see one details at a time, so we only need 2 views at any one time). In your custom view switcher class add a method similar to: class MySwitcher extends ViewSwitcher { ... long currentRowId; long nextRowId; long previousRowId; public void setItemDetails(long rowId) { final View nextView = this.getNextView(); currentRowId = rowId; /* Get the next/previous record IDs with a query like * "SELECT row_id FROM table WHERE row_id "+currentRowId+" ORDER BY row_id ASC LIMIT 1;" (Next) */ // Do something with nextView, like set some text or something // You could get a cursor based on the rowID with // "SELECT * FROM table WHERE row_id = "+currentRowId+" LIMIT 1;" ((TextView) nextView.findViewById(R.id.myTextView)).setText("Details for item #" + rowId); this.showNext(); } } If you don't want an animation the first time setItemDetails is called then use setAnimateFirstView(false) on the ViewSwitcher. Then you need to add an OnTouchListener to detect drags/swipes, and then call setItemDetails with the next/previous row ID when you detect a horizontal swipe -- you might want to set a different animation depending on whether you are moving to the next or previous item.
