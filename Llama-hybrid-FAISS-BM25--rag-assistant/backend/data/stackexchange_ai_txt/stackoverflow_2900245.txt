It appears that anyway you touch it, you'll need to provide for secure credit card number storage capabilities. If the server is compromised, at any time it will contain enough information to decrypt currently stored credit card numbers (i.e. keys and encrypted numbers). Potential solution is to use an internal server that acts as a "encryptor/decryptor" service and nothing else. This way compromising one machine does not expose credit card numbers.
