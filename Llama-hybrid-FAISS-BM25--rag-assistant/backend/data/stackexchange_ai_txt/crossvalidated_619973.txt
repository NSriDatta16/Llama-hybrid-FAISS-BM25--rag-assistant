No. Bayesian deep learning is about defining neural networks as probabilistic models and using prior distributions for the parameters. This is a probabilistic model, so whatever prior knowledge you want to include, it needs to take the form of a probability distribution. It is Bayesian because it employs Bayes theorem to combine the learnings from the data (likelihood) with the priors. So "prior" has a very specific sense here. I'm not an expert in this area, but there are symbolic machine learning models and active research in this area. I didn't read those papers carefully, but a quick search for "Bayesian symbolic machine learning" reveals at least a few papers like https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15860 or https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08892 that use Bayesian approach for symbolic learning, but they are using the priors in the regular sense. So they can be combined, but symbolic knowledge itself cannot "be" the prior in a Bayesian model.
