In WPF/Silverlight: Is it possible to bind a DataTable or an XML file to a ListView?

Is it possible in WPF to bind a data matrix (data table or an XML file) to a ListView? Given the following XML dataset: Huey Freeman 10 Michael Caesar 10 Reiley Freeman 8 Cindy 9 Robert Jebediah Freeman 70 Is it possible to bind this data to a ListView? Note that the data columns are not pre-defined. It could of any type and the names vary. P/S: I am aware of the DataGrid but it is too heavy for usage we just need to display the data.
