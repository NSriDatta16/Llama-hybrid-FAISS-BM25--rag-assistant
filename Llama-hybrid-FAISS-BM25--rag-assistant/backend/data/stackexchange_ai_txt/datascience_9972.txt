NLP : What are some common verbs surrounding organization names in text

I am trying to come up with some rules to detect named entities, specifically company or organization names in text. I think it makes sense to focus on verbs. There are a lot of POS Taggers that can easily detect proper nouns. I personally like StanfordPOSTagger . Now, once i have the proper noun, i know that it is a named entity. However, to be certain that it is the name of a company, i need to come up with rules and possibly Gazetteers I was thinking of focusing on verbs. Is there a set of common verbs that occur frequently around company names? I could create an annotated corpus and explicitly train a Machine Learning classifier to predict such verbs, but that is a LOT of work. It would be great if someone has already done some research on this. Additionally, can some other POS tags give clues? Not just verbs.
