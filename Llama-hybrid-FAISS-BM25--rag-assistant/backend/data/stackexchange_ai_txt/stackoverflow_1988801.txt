You have some real bad myths in your posting: JavaEE Myths: -App Servers easier to configure than apache, nope apache is easier. -You imply that only JavaEE full solution is enterprise, nope. CRUD Myths: -CRUD is slower than JavaEE? WTF? POJO and EJB is using CRUD. The limiting factor is not crud, its server throughput There are 3 limiting bottleneck areas no matter what technology even MS..server implementation, persistence layer, and app layer..the technology chosen is not the speed factor as you can exchange advantages in one layer for disadvantages in the other layer. Fro example we could spee dup Java by using document store instead of normal DB.. Most new Rails implementations use non apache servers that are faster by a factor of 3 to 5 than Apache..even a well tunned Apache server can outperform some javaEE stacks..just ask yahoo as they use Symfony on some of their properties..
