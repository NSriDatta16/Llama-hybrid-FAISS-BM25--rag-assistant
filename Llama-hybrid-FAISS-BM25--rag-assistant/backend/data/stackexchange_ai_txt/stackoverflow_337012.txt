I've written an open-source library for embedding windows explorer in .NET applications. You can take a look at http://gong-shell.sourceforge.net/ It exposes WinForms controls, as well as providing a .NET language interface to the Windows Shell. It's licenced under the GPL, so using it in a similarly licensed application is free, however if you want to use it in a commercial application drop me an email and I'm sure we can work something out!
