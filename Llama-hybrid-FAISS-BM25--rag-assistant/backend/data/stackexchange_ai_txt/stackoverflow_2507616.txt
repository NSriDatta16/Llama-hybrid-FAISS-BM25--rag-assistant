Let me stress first - I use SQL Server, I like SQL Server and it's unquestionably a stronger DBMS than Access with better performance and reliability. There's also SQL Server Express as a low-end option which is quite good enough for many purposes but gives the architectural advantages of SQL Server over Access. That said - way back in the day, when I were a lad and budgets were tight.... I have used Access as a back-end for interactive data storage on sites with significantly more than a few hundred users (total, never measured concurrent). It worked, I don't think we ever saw data issues and wasn't particularly slow. Remember a web app is a rather different usage case from a windows app because users aren't continually connected to the database so concurrency issues aren't quite the same. Access will remain a weak point in the architecture and it's well worth understanding its limitations (transactional integrity in particular) so you can make informed decisions on its use, but I wouldn't regard it as a given that it must be replaced. If it does the job now and there's no reason to believe it won't continue doing its job for the foreseeable future, consider letting sleeping dogs lie. The ROI from replacing it may not be there.
