What optimisation method is used in ordered logistic regression?

I am using the polr function in R to create an ordered logistic model and am curious to know what its optimisation method is? It seems to perform better than other models I have tested it against when looking at mean absolute error (MAE), but performs considerably worse when looking at MSE, so I was wondering if it optimises the model based on absolute error (as opposed to ordinary least-squares regression, for instance)?
