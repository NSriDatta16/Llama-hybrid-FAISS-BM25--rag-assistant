That depends on your server version. Anyway, IIS has its own compression features for dynamic and static content. It's native internal module and I guess it works very quickly. If you need more flexible configuration, you can pay attention on Helicon Ape . mod_gzip and mod_cache together can improve your performance. One important advantage is flexibility. You can set different compression level for different MIME types. Simple example: SetEnvIf mime text/html User-Agent (?!MSIE).* gzip=9 It enables Gzip compression with level 9 for HTML files and excludes Internet Explorer.
