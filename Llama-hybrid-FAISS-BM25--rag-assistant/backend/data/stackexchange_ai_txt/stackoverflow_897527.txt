You can 'nibble' the delete's which also means that you don't cause a massive load on the database. If your t-log backups run every 10 mins, then you should be ok to run this once or twice over the same interval. You can schedule it as a SQL Agent job try something like this: DECLARE @count int SET @count = 10000 DELETE FROM table1 WHERE table1id IN ( SELECT TOP (@count) tableid FROM table1 WHERE x='y' )
