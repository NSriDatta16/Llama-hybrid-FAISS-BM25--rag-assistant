Problem after migrating Magento

I am trying to create an exact mirror of a Magento production server on my local server for further development, but I have run into a few issues. On the production server, our Magento is configured to run without displaying the index.php , but after attempting a migration to my local server, the index.php is required to access any links. Additionally, when I select a category to visit (for example), I am directed to http://localhost/category.html instead of http://localhost/my-magento-store.com/index.php/category.html The other issue I've noticed is that I am unable to log in to the admin section. After entering the correct login credentials, I am redirected to the login screen again without any error messages. I am running a MAMP stack on the local server, and here is what I have done: Created a tar of the entire production server Created a database backup in Magento System > Tools > Backups Downloaded and extracted tar into local directory Imported database dump into local MySQL using Alexey Ozerov's big dump script. (The .sql file is 1.3m lines) Changed values of web/unsecure/base_url and web/secure/base_url in core_config_data table. (As I don't have a self-signed SSL cert, I put http://localhost:8888/my-magento-store/ for both values) Dumped contents of var/cache and var/sesson Changed permissions to 755 for all files on local dev server Navigated to http://localhost:8888/my-magento-store/ but got the "Index of /" page instead. Navigated to http://localhost:8888/my-magento-store/index.php and got an error. Followed these steps to solve the error, reloaded the page, and the home page loaded correctly. Any ideas?
