Is there a survey that explores all the available Markov chain Monte Carlo methods?

I am interested in exploring the efficacy of various Monte Carlo methods. I am aware of the Metropolis acceptance criterion, Hamiltonian Markov chains, Gibbs sampling, importance sampling, slice sampling etc. But, I guess that there are many more that I am not aware about. Can any one point me in the right direction? Thanks.
