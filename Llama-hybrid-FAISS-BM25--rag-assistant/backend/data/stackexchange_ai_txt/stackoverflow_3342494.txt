This is probably done to comply with the standards â€“ but they did it wrong in this case. From the description of CDATA data type : Although the STYLE and SCRIPT elements use CDATA for their data model, for these elements, CDATA must be handled differently by user agents. Markup and entities must be treated as raw text and passed to the application as is. The first occurrence of the character sequence " " (end-tag open delimiter) is treated as terminating the end of the element's content. In valid documents, this would be the end tag for the element. So they rather should have split the end-tag open delimiter like this: document.write(" ");
