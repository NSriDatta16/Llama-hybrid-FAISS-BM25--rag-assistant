Yes. See here for an old article on this. You need to have a build agent/server dedicated to this project, and need to get it to redirect to msbuild 4.0. Configure Team Build 2008 to use MSBuild 4.0 instead of MSBuild 3.5. To do this edit %ProgramFiles%\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\Common7\IDE\PrivateAssemblies\TFSBuildService.exe.config and set the MSBuildPath property to C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319. Restart the Team Foundation Build service.
