load an external js, when moving to another page

I have this button : siteDEMO that users can drag to their browser's toolbar, and when they go to their website, by clicking on the button on the toolbar, it loads demogen.js script. Now I want to add an event that when this script is loaded in a page, and the user clicks on a link, when browser moved to next page, load the script for that page again. any idea ?
