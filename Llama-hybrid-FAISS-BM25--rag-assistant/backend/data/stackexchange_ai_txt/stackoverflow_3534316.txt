How to set the appearance of a cell in a DevExpress grid?

I am using a DevExpress XtraGrid in my project. I need to set the appearance of a specific cell (specifically, the background color). And I cannot find any property or method in the grid that does this! The only way I can see of doing this is by catching the RowCellStyle event of the GridView , and determining whether the given cell needs to have its appearance altered - which is grossly inefficient, since maybe 1 out of 100 cells will need its appearance altered, but the other 99 will still be executing code to determine whether their appearance needs altering! There has to be another way - but what?
