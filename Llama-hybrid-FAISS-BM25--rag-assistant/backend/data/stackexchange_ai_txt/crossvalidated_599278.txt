Should i shuffle data?

I'm new to machine learning and have made some experience with some basic dataset and now i'm exploring BTC data. I'm asking is correct to shuffle data when the data are BTC, ETH or any other crypto? What i mean is that the price of a stock or crypto increase or decrease in every candle with a specific time-frame. Does have sense to shuffle by removing the sequentiality of the candles? shuffle or not shuffle?
