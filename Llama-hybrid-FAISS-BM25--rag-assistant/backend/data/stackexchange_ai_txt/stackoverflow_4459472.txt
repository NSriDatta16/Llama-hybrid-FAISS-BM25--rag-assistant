You need to: declare a vob storage: see mkstgloc and About ClearCase Storages : The key is to have a path that you can access through the network (an UNC path like \\myPC\ccstg_c\vobs , with ccstg_c the sharing name of a local directory under which you define your Vobs storage location) create your Vob (if it is a public one, you need to know the clearcase registry password, as detailed in Set or change the ClearCase registry password and rgy_passwd ) See mkvob .
