Specific questions: Statistical tests, fair analysis

Background: My dataset is small (3 to 10 values). But each set comes from 18 acquisitions of different areas of the same sample. So they would not be considered independent. But 3-10 values are too small to analyze whether the distribution is normal. And the raw values differ a lot between independent experiments but we express them as percentage of the 'control' and then are very comparable. Questions: We measure the background noise in our experiment and subtract it from each dataset. Does this skew the standard deviation of the samples? Should it not be subtracted? Is it fair to test our sample against the control which will always be 100%? Also, although I can calculate the standard deviation of the control within each independent experiment, how can I express the standard deviation between independent experiments? I'm sure you can't just average the standard deviations! For comparing one sample to the control, is the Wilcoxon signed rank test reasonable for such a non-parametric low sample data set? Can we compare it to the hypothetical value of 100%? For comparing a sample treated with increasing doses of a chemical (multiple datasets), is the Kruskall Walis test a reasonable one? Can it also be compared to the hypothetical value of 100%?
