Four pages of google'ing, and a bit of time hacking source code later ... Ok, so this may be a year old, but I figured out how to do it for version 1.8.3, and this is for whoever else bumps into this. To get multiple div's to go on top of each other via the z-index: First, you need a global variable. i.e. : var global_zindex then when you initialise the new draggable, in the onStart, give increment it: onStart : function(){ zIndex++; }, Now we edit dragdrop.js:435 to look like this: this.element.style.zIndex = global_zindex //this.originalZ; // HACK HACK HACK and bam, the div's pile correctly suddenly. This took so long, I had to post this here.
