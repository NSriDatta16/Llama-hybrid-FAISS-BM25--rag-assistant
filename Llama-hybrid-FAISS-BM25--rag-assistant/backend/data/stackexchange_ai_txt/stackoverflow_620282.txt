Have you checked whether you are in the same domain and path to change the cookies? […] a user agent rejects a cookie (shall not store its information) if any of the following is true: The value for the Path attribute is not a prefix of the request- URI. The value for the Domain attribute contains no embedded dots or does not start with a dot. The value for the request-host does not domain-match the Domain attribute. The request-host is a FQDN (not IP address) and has the form HD, where D is the value of the Domain attribute, and H is a string that contains one or more dots. — RFC 2109
