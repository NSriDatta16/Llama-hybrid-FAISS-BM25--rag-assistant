If you don't mind adding a bit of native code to your Java app, use: QueryPerformanceCounter() and QueryPerformanceFrequency() on Windows; or POSIX clock_gettime() function with CLOCK_MONOTONIC clock ID. Note that the use of the x86 TSC register is discouraged on multiprocessor systems, so you better use the above APIs.
