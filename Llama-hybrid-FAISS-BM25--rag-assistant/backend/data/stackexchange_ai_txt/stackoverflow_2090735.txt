We encountered this same issue - but found a slightly different solution. In our case, SketchFlow projects were being in the default location (My Documents\Expression\Blend 3\Projects), and the screens weren't coming up with Buxton Sketch. The difference we found is that, in our environment, "My Documents" is mapped to a network storage location (H:\Data). What we observed was: Open the project via My Documents\Expression\Blend 3\Projects. No Buxton Sketch. :-( Open the project via H:\Data\Expression Blend 3\Projects. Buxton Sketch OK. :-)
