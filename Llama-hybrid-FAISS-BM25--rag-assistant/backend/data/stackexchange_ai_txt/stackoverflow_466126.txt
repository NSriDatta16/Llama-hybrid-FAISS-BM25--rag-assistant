You'll want to use an Agile development process if this is your development environment. As part of this process, you'll probably want to continually have a working system to show your client so that they can make course corrections along the way. It will help them understand what progress is being made and where you're at. But more importantly it will give them a better understanding of how the system works with the current business requirements and what the impacts of their new changes will be. Just be careful not to make your prototype to visually appealing. If a prototype looks graphically polished there's a good chance that your business development people will think the software is much more complete than it really is. I would instead recommend trying to make it look less polished and focus more on features. For example, if you're working in Java Swing, there's a great look & feel called Napkin that helps with this. IT allows you to build as much functionality as you want, but the screen looks like it was drawn on a napkin. So people's attention and focus are on the functionality, not the graphical details.
