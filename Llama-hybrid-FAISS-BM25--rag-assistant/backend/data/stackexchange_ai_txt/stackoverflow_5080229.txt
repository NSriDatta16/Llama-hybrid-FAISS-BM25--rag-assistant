.NET DateTimes expose a DayOfWeek property. You can leverage that in this case: var currDay = DateTime.Today.DayOfWeek; //currday is now an enumeration with Sunday=0, Saturday=6 //We can cast that to a number and subtract to get to the previous Saturday var EndOfLastWeek = DateTime.Today.AddDays(((int)currDay+1)*-1);
