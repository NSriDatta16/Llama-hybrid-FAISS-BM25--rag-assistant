If you're using writing a .NET application, you might consider using ClickOnce. If you need quite a bit of customization, you might look elsewhere. We have an external process that performs updating for us. When it finds an update, it downloads it to a secondary folder and then waits for the main application to exit. On exit, it replaces all of the current files. The primary process just kicks the update process off every 4 hours. Because the update process will wait for the exit of the primary app, the primary app doesn't have to do any special processing other than start the update application. This is a side issue, but if you're considering writing your own update process, I would encourage you to look into using compression of some sort to (1) save on download and (2) provide one file to pull from an update server. Hope that makes sense!
