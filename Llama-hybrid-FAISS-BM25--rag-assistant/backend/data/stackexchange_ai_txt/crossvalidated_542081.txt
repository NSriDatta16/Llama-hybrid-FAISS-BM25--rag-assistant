The three signals definitely need to be treated separately. Also, you haven't specified how you intend to model this, but I'd suggest some dimensionality reduction technique. As I see in the figure, the right muscles have very abrupt jumps, while L-TA has more natural oscillations. This would likely be easy to see in the Fourier transform, where the abrupt jumps should translate into high power in high frequencies. If you're lucky, maybe even just two features per signal, high and low frequency power, might suffice for classification.
