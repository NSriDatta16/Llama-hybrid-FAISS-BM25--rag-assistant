The answer depends on what exactly is your data. If your data are sample sizes $n_i$ and observed proportions of success $p_i$, then you can use logistic regression to model such data. On another hand, if you only have values in $(0, 1)$ that you want to model, then this kind of data is to be modeled with beta regression , a regression model for conditional distribution that is bounded on both sides , modeled using beta distribution parametrized by mean and precision .
