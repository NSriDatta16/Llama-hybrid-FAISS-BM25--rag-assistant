I disagree with the excerpt you pulled. A public method without any dependency on object state can't possibly be part of an object that has one clearly stated charter. It's just not cohesive and should be placed somewhere else. So: if the method is private, accept the auto-fix, but if the method is public then don't. Just because a method is static and has no relation to state, doesn't mean it falls under the "low cohesion" category. Cohesion/Functionality isn't based on state. When you are trying to determine Cohesiveness think about the role of the class as a whole, not just the instance variables. If the logic you are looking at is related to the generic concept (GenericObjectTransformer) then leave it there. If it is a routine to calculate the orbit of the moon, or the depth of the ocean move it to a utility class (another smelly area of our field).
