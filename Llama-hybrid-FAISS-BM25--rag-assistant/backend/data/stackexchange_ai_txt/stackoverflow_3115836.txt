I recommend also the queue strategy, but you seem to dislike using the database as queue. You've got a XMPP infrastructure, so leverage it: use a pubsub Node and post your events to this node. Pubsub can optionally be configured to store unfetched items in a persistent way. Your daemon process (no matter what language) can fetch all stored items at startup time and subscribe to changes to get notified about incoming actions. This way you can solve your problem in an elegant, asynchronous way.
