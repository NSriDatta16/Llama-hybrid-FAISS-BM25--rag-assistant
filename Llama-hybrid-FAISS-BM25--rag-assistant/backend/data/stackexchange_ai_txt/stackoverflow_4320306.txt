In C if you cast a char to an int you just get the ASCII value of it. So, you're averaging the ascii value of the character 1 twice, and getting what you'd expect. You probably want to use atoi() . EDIT: Note that this is generally true of all typecasts in C. C doesn't reinterpret values for you, it trusts you to know what exists at a given location.
