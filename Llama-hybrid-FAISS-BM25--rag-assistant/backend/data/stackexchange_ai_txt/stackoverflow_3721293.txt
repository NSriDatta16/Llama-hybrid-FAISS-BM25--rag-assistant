Actually it can be more accurately said that the textbox is not rendered yet when you attempt to focus it. WPF has a sort of message pump at its heart, much like WinForms, but a much more advanced one - the Dispatcher. The Dispatcher is used to queue work - some actions you triggered are executed later on, on the same thread, when the messages in the queue get processed according to their priorities. BeginInvoke queues another work item on the Dispatcher queue, and it is executed after some other items that are needed first. That's a very hack-ish explanation, and I encourage you to read up more on it - simply google WPF Dispatcher and read any of the ton of articles, most are very good. Edit: also, a good event to handle in your case would be the Loaded event of the textbox; generally the Loaded event is triggered only after all other layout work is done and a control is actually visible. However, queueing items on the Dispatcher is also a good way of going about things.
