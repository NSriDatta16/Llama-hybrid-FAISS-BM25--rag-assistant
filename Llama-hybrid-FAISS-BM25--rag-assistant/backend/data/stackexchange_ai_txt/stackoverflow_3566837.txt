The best way to do is is to put your pages in the Public Pages of your organization and setup a virtual host (see Manage Pages -> Virtual Hosts in the Control Panel) for those pages. This way, www.my-homepage.com will redirect to the public pages of your organization. You should of course be owner of the domain and link the domain to the IP address of the server the website runs on. In Liferay, by default only users with the role of Administrator can add organizations. For managing content you should setup other roles. Create f.e. a Content Editor role and add permissions for the Web Content portlet (Create Content, Approve, Edit, Delete, View in Control Panel). This also answered your third question.
