An acceptance rate of $1\%$ is extremely low. You have to aim for an acceptance rate of around $15\%-30\%$. In the normal case the optimal rate is the famous $0.234$. However, this is a tricky diagnostic tool since this "optimal rate" can also be achieved despite a terrible sampling (for example when you sample well from an entry and terribly from another one, or some other combinations). You should also use other diagnostic tools, such as the log-posterior, autocorrelation plots, among others to check the performance of your MCMC. In addition, it is recommended to use (if possible) an adaptive method as a second opinion. (If you are using R, Python, or C, take a look at these packages )
