Why should I use BIRT setGlobalVariable() method?

I've some reports where I use JavaScript variables between different event handlers. Example: //Data Set beforeOpen: fooList = ""; //Data Set fetch: fooList += row['foos'] + ", "; //Dynamic Text expression, somewhere in the report: fooList This code works for me in 2.6.2. (There is an invisible table above this DynamicText which triggers Data Set use) Documentation says, that I should use reportContext.setGlobalVariable("foo","bar"); , but I haven't yet found, that using simple assignments is discouraged. What are disadvantages of using simple assignments in BIRT Javascript event handlers, such as foo="bar"; and reading it later in another event handler?
