As you noted, there are two common ways to locate unit test files: near the implementation code they are testing, and in a separate file hierarchy. The choice is a matter of what is the common practice in your organisation and personal taste. Regarding the location of common test code, just organize your test code are you would organize implementation code. In your particular case, if some test infrastructure is common to several independent components, it would be a good idea to create a new component (call it "testing", for example) that other components depends on for their tests, instead of adding dependences between existing components.
