Reversible jump MCMC was introduced by Green (1995) to tackle the difficulty of designing Markov chains moving between spaces of different dimensions. In P.J. Green's words, this is needed for problems "where one of the things you do not know is the number of things you do not know". In statistical settings, it corresponds to model choice problems where several models with an arbitrary number of parameters each are candidates for the model behind the observed data. Rather than considering all parameters at once in a possibly gigantic mega-parameter as in the alternative solution of Carlin and Chib (1995) , P.J. Green designs a symmetric proposal to move between arbitrary pairs of models by creating auxiliary variables that equate the dimensions of both model parameter spaces. The symmetry is such that the model from model M' to model M is the opposite of the move from model M to model M. For instance, if moving from $\theta$ to $\theta'$ means simulating an additional independent $\epsilon$:$$\theta'=(\theta,\epsilon)$$moving from $\theta'$ to $\theta$ means removing the former $\epsilon$, i.e., preserving the original equality $$\theta'=(\theta,\epsilon)$$
