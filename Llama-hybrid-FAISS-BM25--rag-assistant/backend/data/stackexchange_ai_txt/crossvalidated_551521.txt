Okay, The thing about residual plot is, If you find any patterns forming, It indicates a problem in your model. There is no specific pattern forming in the residual plot given. Moreover a Mean Absolute error of 119 is not at all bad for this data set. That means on an average, Your prediction are off by 119. This may not be enough but this is a good indicator to show that you are proceeding in the right direction. You can do on more thing, If this is a 2 feature data-set, You can plot out the Test values actual prediction graph vs the true test values and see the smoothness of the line its fitting
