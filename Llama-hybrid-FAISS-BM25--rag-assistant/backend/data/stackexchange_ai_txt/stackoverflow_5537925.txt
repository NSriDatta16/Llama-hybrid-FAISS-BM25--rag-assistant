I agree with Alexei, I think what you want to do is a linked list with a custom insertion function that inserts the elements in a specific order. This was based on your question. Now, I don't now what exactly you are trying to do here, but if the goal is to keep an efficient sorted collection of objects, my guess would be to use a Binary Search Tree . Traversing this tree in order will be very easy and return a sorted list of items. Insertions and deletions are pretty easy too and only have an average complexity of O(log n).
