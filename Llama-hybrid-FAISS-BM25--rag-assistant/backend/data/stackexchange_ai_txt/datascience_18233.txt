In your question, you have a binary classification problem. I understand what you're asking - you want to know how exactly a network classifies the inputs. Does the network only give (-1, +1) or something else? Most neural networks don't just say "this is upper or this is lower". The networks would give you a probability distribution [0..1] for each possible class. The most common implementation is the popular softmax layer . You'd just choose the class with the highest probability as the prediction. It's also possible to encode your network such that it outputs +1 or -1. In fact, we can always add a layer just after the softmax layer to do exactly that. If you haven't I recommend you to study logistic regression before tackling neural network.
