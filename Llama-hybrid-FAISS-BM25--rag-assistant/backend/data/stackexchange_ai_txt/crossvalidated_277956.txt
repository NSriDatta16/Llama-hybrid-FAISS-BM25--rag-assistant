(I cannot watch the video right now so this answer is to some extent a guess of what is meant) First of all, yes we mostly talk about variates spanning the dimensions. However, it is also possible to take the opposite view (this is sometimes calles R-mode vs. Q-mode analysis). Let me take a detour to cluster analysis to illustrate this: Cluster analysis with variates = genes = dimensions will look for groups of cases that have similar gene expression patterns. On the other hand, you can also take a "transposed" view and ask for groups of genes which are expressed similarly for the same cells. Genes and cells have changed their role compared to the first approach. For some types of data, you may get similar groupings both ways (see e.g. our paper on using this for spectroscopic data: A. Bonifacio, C. Beleites and V. Sergo: Application of R-mode analysis to Raman maps: a different way of looking at vibrational hyperspectral data, AnalBioanalChem, 407, 4 (2015) 1089–1095. DOI 10.1007/s00216-014-8321-7 ) whereas for other types of data both ways of looking at the data are interesting in themselves (e.g. for genetic data). In the latter case, you can use a heatmap giving both ways of clustering. Now for PCA, the fun fact is that up to some decisions of standardization (row vs. columns for centering and possibly scaling) you'll arrive at the same solution both ways - just scores and loadings will change their role. (see e.g. https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/147983/4598 and Why PCA of data by means of SVD of the data? for more details) Is the number of dimension the number of cells or the number of genes? IMHO this is rather ambiguious and as explained above depends on the view of the data you take (i.e. the question you ask/the application at hand). For PCA, there's the additional ambiguity that "dimensions" is sometimes also used refering to the rank of the data matrix. The rank cannot be more than the smaller of number of rows and number of columns and it is also the maximum number of principal components for that data matrix and thus the number of dimensions of the resulting rotated coordinate system (before reducing dimensions by truncating this coordinate system). In your example of 200 cells and 10⁴ genes the PC will at most span 200 dimensions, regardless of whether cells or genes were considered the variates by the mode of the data analysis.
