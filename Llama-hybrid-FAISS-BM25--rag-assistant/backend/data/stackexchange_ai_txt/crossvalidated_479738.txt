Very high R-squared, should I be suspicious?

I have a dataset of 20 observations which correlate solar panel output with meteorological factors and geographical latitude (a total of 3 predictors). When I build a non-linear regression model for this entire dataset, I get an R-squared of 71%. However, when I divide the dataset into two sets of 10, I get an R-squared of 1. What puzzles me further is that this is true for both of the two datasets I get by dividing by 2, arbitrarily. When I limit my dataset to the 14 data points which lie north of the equator, I get an R-squared of 73%. Obviously I have too few points south of the equator to compare reasonably right now. What am I doing wrong? Is the model with R-squared = 1 over explained or something? To reply to a suggestion, I attach below the residuals-vs-fitted In response to Sextus, here is some output from R: lm(formula = yields_differences[11:20] ~ poly(latitudesforplotting[11:20], 3) + poly(humidity_average_ordered[11:20], 3) + poly(insolation_annual[21:30], 3)) Residuals: ALL 10 residuals are 0: no residual degrees of freedom!
