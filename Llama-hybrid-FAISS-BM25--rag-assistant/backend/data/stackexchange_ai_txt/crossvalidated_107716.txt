Non-informative prior for regression model

I'm looking at p. 355 of Gelman's Bayesian Data Analysis (3rd ed.), for which there is no errata, and I see this: In the normal regression model, a convenient non-informative prior distribution is uniform on $(\beta,\, \log\sigma)$ or, equivalently, $$p(\beta,\, \sigma^2|X) \propto \sigma^{-2}$$ Shouldn't it say "uniform on $(\beta, \log\sigma^2)$"? If $W = g(X)$ with $g$ monotonic increasing, $h \equiv g^{-1}$, don't we have $$f_{W}(w) = f_{X}(h(w))\;h^\prime(w)$$ Let $X=\log\sigma^2$, $g=\exp$, $h=\log$; the density of $W=g(X)=\sigma^2$ is $f(w) = w^{-1}$ or, if I understand Gelman's notation correctly, $p(\sigma^2)=\sigma^{-2}$. Am I right or am I confused about notation... or just completely wrong?
