When predicting a binary outcome with strictly binary predictors, does logistic regression yield the same results as OLS?

I was recently presented with the prompt, essentially, to make the case for why logistic regression is the better choice (over OLS) when predicting a binary outcome with a set of binary predictors. In the case of continuous predictors, this would be a relatively straightforward answer. But after running some simulations for myself, I realized that I was getting the same coefficients (after transformation back to probability from log odds in the logistic case) between both models. I cannot convince myself that there is actually a pragmatic difference between the two models, but I am sure there must be - particularly since a binary outcome would violate the assumption of normality of OLS. If there is a more in-depth explanation of why this might be the case, I would love to learn a bit more.
