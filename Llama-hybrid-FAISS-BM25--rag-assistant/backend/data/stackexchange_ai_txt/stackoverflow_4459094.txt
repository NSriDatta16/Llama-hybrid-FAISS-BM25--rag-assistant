Not, absolutely not. In fact, S60 v1 is not even backwards compatible with v5 (there was a major binary compatibility break at S60 3rd edition). If you need S60 v1, you have some work to do - there are many breaks and API changes to deal with. If you want to increase market coverage, you can build on S60 3rd edition which will give you compatibility with S60 5th edition.
