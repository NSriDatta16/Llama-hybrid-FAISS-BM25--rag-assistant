Here is some code I have used to send the data to MySQL. It uses a little bit of jQuery to do the ajax magic (the line starting with the dollarsign is jQuery). function postData(data){ me.debug(data); var dataString = JSON.stringify(data); me.debug(dataString); $.post('storage.php', { data: dataString }); }; postData(recordJSON); As you can see I've modified the way the 'recordJSON' object gets sent to the postData function a bit too: I've removed the serialise function. Next, create a PHP file (called 'storage.php' in my case) and put this in it: You now have an array in PHP that you can do with as you please. In the examplecode above I've modified the jQuery post function a bit, so if it doesn't work, look there.
