How can I add a fadeIn effect to a string in jQuery?

I've got the following string that increments my integer contained within a paragraph, and I'd like to append the fadeIn() jQuery function to it. I've tried to concatenate it to the end of the string, but that didn't work. Any suggestions on what to do here? $p.text(parseInt($p.text(),10) + 1);
