I should think not, as it can open vulnerable security risk: If a web app can load an image from local storage, it means that there's a facility to browse local storage device (either via the browser JS engine or the web app). The malicious attacker can use this to gain valuable user information. If the image could be loaded, what will be the path of the image? And if this path is valid, can every user viewing your web application open the image? iPad doesn't have a storage directory like a PC (i.e. directory structure, e.g. home/user/* structure). Each application can store data that is only visible to the application (unless the application can allow sharing). It's better to store image on server machine and load images from there.
