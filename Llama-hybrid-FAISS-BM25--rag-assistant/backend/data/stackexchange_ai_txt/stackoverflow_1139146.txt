Unless you are an assembly guru the odds of beating the compiler are very low . A fragment from the above link, For example, the bit-oriented "XOR %EAX, %EAX" instruction was the fastest way to set a register to zero in the early generations of the x86, but most code is generated by compilers and compilers rarely generated XOR instruction. So the IA designers, decided to move the frequently occurring compiler generated instructions up to the front of the combinational decode logic making the literal "MOVL $0, %EAX" instruction execute faster than the XOR instruction.
