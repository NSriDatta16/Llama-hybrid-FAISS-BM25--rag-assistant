Check boxes require the use of an array. PHP will automatically place the checked boxes into an array if you place [] brackets at the end of each name. Please choose type of food: Steak: : Pizza: : Chicken: : Then you can do $foodArray=$_POST['food']; echo $foodArray[0]; //Steak Value echo $foodArray[1]; //Pizza Value echo $foodArray[2]; //Chicken Value PS - This information was found by Googling " Checkboxes PHP " and clicking the first link. I encourage you to do at least a little research in the future before posting a question that has anwers so readily available.
