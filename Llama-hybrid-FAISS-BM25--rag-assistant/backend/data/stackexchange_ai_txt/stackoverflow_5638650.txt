We have direct solution using Interface builder . In interface builder go to xib in which you have added tabBarController and delete the tabBarItem with which you have connected your tableViewController . Now, drag and drop an UINavigationController from library in your tabBar and set this navigationController 's rootViewController as your tableViewController . Thanks
