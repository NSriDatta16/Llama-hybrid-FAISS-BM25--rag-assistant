evaluation metrics for multiple values per session

I have an application that executes my foo() function several times for each user session. There are 2 alternate algorithms that i can implement as "foo" function and my goal is to evaluate them based on execution delay . The number of times foo() is called per user session is variable but will not exceed 10000. Say delays values are: Algo1: [ [12, 30, 20, 40, 24, 280] , [13, 14, 15, 100], [20, 40] ] Algo2: [ [1, 10, 5, 4, 150, 20] , [14, 10, 20], [21, 33, 41, 79] ] My question is whats the best metric to pick the winner ? possible options average from each session, and then evaluate cdf median from each session and then evaluate cdf anything else ?
