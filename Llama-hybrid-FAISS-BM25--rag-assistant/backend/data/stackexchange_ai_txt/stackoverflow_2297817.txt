As the files are going to differ by user, the cleanest way I can think of is keeping text files like doc1.txt.metadata.username . Keeping separate branches per user metafile sounds complicated to me, and hard to work with in everyday use. There would be be the idea of automating this using a pre- and/or post-commit hook, but it is discouraged in the SVN book : While hook scripts can do almost anything, there is one dimension in which hook script authors should show restraint: do not modify a commit transaction using hook scripts. ... Instead of modifying the transaction, you should simply validate the transaction in the pre-commit hook and reject the commit if it does not meet the desired requirements. As a bonus, your users will learn the value of careful, compliance-minded work habits. The simplest thing might be to establish doc1.txt.metadata.username as a rule, and to write a pre-commit script that rejects any commits of .metadata files without the current user name as the extension.
