Bayesian meta-analysis of multiple ranked lists?

Let's say I go around and ask a bunch of my friends to rank 30 movies. Each one returns me a list. Now the obvious treatment is to average the rankings, but I'm wondering if anyone has seen a more rigorous Bayesian treatment. For example, we can assume there is some latent "goodness" parameter $\theta$ drawn from a normal distribution and some noise associated with each person's list. Going further we can say that each person $i$ draws a $\theta_i$ from the distribution. The complication here, of course, is that the ranked list is not continuous (of course one could just treat it that way). I'm thinking I could create such a model in a PPL, but before I spend too much time on this, it would be good to know what has been done before.
