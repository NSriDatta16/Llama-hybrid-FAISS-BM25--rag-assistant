The normal way to disable warnings for a class in a particular file is to use the pragma warning preprocessor directive, but as you said, you don't want to manually edit an auto-generated file. Since these are partial classes, I thought you might be able to disable the warning by creating another file to extend it and applying the directive there, but that doesn't work - pragma directives only apply to the file in which they appear. I think your only option is to live with the noise or suppress the warning at the project/assembly level (from the project properties 'Build' tab, under 'Errors and warnings')
