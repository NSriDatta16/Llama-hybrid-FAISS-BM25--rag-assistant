Android: Draggable Toast, Or Alternative?

I'm drawing a number of bitmaps on a canvas, and using MotionEvents to let me drag them around. When each item is pressed, I'd like to display a Toast, or, Toast-like mini information-panel that tracks the movement of the bitmap being dragged during an ACTION_MOVE. The "Toast" would appear on ACTION_DOWN and vanish on ACTION_UP. The problem with using Toast is that I have to give it a duration, and, also, I can't change its position once it has been displayed. Unless I can kill the Toast for each ACTION_MOVE, and display a new one right away at the current coordinates? (Sorry, thinking aloud at this point, can't get to my dev machine to test...) I don't know what other options there might be to achieve this, and I'd very much appreciate suggestions from the community.
