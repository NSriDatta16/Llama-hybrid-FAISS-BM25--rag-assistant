SOLR and Natural Language Parsing - Can I use it?

Requirements Word frequency algorithm for natural language processing Using Solr While the answer for that question is excellent, I was wondering if I could make use of all the time I spent getting to know SOLR for my NLP. I thought of SOLR because: It's got a bunch of tokenizers and performs a lot of NLP. It's pretty use to use out of the box. It's restful distributed app, so it's easy to hook up I've spent some time with it, so using could save me time. Can I use Solr? Although the above reasons are good, I don't know SOLR THAT well, so I need to know if it would be appropriate for my requirements. Ideal Usage Ideally, I'd like to configure SOLR, and then be able to send SOLR some text, and retrieve the indexed tonkenized content. Context I'm working on a small component of a bigger recommendation engine.
