Two things.Your time series is monthly,you need at least 4 years of data for a sensible ARIMA estimation, as reflected 27 points do not give the autocorrelation structure. This can also mean that your sales is affected by some external factors , rather than being correlated with its own value. Try to find out what factor affects your sales and is that factor being measured. Then you can run a regression or VAR (Vector Autoregression) to get forecasts. If you absolutely don't have anything else other than these values , your best way is to use a exponential smoothing method to get a naive forecast. Exponential smoothing is available in R . Secondly don't see the sales of a product in isolation, the sales of two products might be correlated for example increase in coffee sales can reflect decrease in tea sales. use the other product information to improve your forecast. This typically happens with sales data in retail or supply chain. They dont show much of autocorrelation structure in the series. While on the other hand methods like ARIMA or GARCH typically work with stock market data or economic indices where you generally have autocorrelation.
