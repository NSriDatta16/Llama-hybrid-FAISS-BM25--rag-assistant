When I initially wrote the comments below I had assumed that the Heckman estimator could be used for dichotomous outcomes, but the second paper I cite says there is no direct analog. Hopefully someone can point to different and more applicable resources. I still leave my initial comment up as I still feel those papers are helpful. I'm not sure how acceptable it would be viewed to use OLS (as oppossed to logistic regression) simply so you can incorporate the Heckman correction estimate. The work of James Heckman would be applicable to your problem, especially if you have an instrument with which you can estimate the probability of being chosen for a C-section independent of trauma risk. Sample Selection Bias as a Specification Error by: James J. Heckman Econometrica, Vol. 47, No. 1. (1979), pp. 153-161. PDF version Also as an intro into the logic of the Heckman selection estimator intended for a largely non-technical audience, I enjoy this paper Is the Magic Still There? The Use of the Heckman Two-Step Correction for Selection Bias in Criminology by: Shawn Bushway, Brian Johnson, Lee Slocum Journal of Quantitative Criminology, Vol. 23, No. 2. (1 June 2007), pp. 151-178. PDF version
