Training and Testing dataset

I am fitting a glm model on my data set. But in my case I don't have any competing models to decide upon, i.e., I just have only one model and have to estimate the coefficients of the model. In such a case shouldn't I use all the data to train the model or should I still divide the data set into training and testing? Also cross-posted to the data science site.
