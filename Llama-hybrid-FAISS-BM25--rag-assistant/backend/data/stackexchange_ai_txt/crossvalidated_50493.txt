Based on the fact that it's the average age of Class 2 vs. Class 1 that (you hypothesize) may matter, you could try a model where the response is Lunch Cost, and the predictors are a factor for whether a student is in class 1 or class 2 the student's age This way, you can ask whether age matters, and whether belonging to class 2 (rather than class 1, which would be a baseline) also matters.
