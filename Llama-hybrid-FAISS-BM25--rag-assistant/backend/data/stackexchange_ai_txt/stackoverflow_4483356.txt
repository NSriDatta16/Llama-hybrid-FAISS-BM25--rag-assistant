Request a page with cron to update cache

I use http caching on Heroku: def homepage response.headers['Cache-Control'] = 'public, max-age=86340' ... end I also have added Heroku's free cron addon: desc "This task is called by the Heroku cron add-on" task :cron => :environment do if Time.now.hour == 0 # run at midnight # I want to request a page here end end Could you tell me what should I put inside this file in order to request a page? A similar question has been asked at How to force fragment cache on rails from cron schedule? They don't provide an example in the answer.
