No, I recommend against that. Correlation coefficients are not on an interval scale, so summing, say, .5+.5 will reflect something different from summing .2 + .8, much less 0+1.0. If you want to do this, computing Fisher's z first would help it make more sense. If you want to keep it in correlation metric, you could average the z s (instead of summing) and back-translate the mean to Pearson's r .
