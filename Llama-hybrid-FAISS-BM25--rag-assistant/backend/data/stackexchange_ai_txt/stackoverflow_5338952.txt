About switching pages in a ListView

I made a ListView that contains 3 rectangles (pages) & they are flicked horizontally, a rectangle is shown at a time & the view switches between them using a button, I want to know how to prevent the user from switching between them by pressing & dragging pages (he can only go to another rectangle by pressing the button) Thanks,
