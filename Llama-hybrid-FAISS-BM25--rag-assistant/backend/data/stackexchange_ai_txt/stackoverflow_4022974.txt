Storing images in google datastore using Flask (Python)

I am using flask on google app engine and am desperately looking for help to solve this. The GAE documentation talks of storing images in the datastore using the BlobProperty , which should be done something like this:- class MyPics(db.Model): name=db.StringProperty() pic=db.BlobProperty() Now the image should be stored in the datastore by doing this:- def storeimage(): pics=MyPics() pics.name=request.form['name'] uploadedpic=request.files['file'] #where file is the fieldname in the form of the file uploaded pics.pic=db.Blob(uploadedpic) pics.put() redirect ... etc etc But am unable to do this. as I get db.Blob accepts a string , but given a Filestorage object... Can someone help me with this. Also if anybody could hint me on how to stream the image back after uploading.
