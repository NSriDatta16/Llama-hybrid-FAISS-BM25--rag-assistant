Something to consider when deciding how to organize data: are there any requirements for tracking history of data. For example, do you need to know what the patient's address was 5 years ago (in addition to knowing their current address, of course)? If so, making that "historically-sensitive" data its own class, will likely make it easier for you down the road. Of course, some data won't be "historically-sensitive" - date of birth for example. :) Something else to consider: what data will be shared among patients? If you maintain data about family medical history, should that data be shared among siblings? If so, then encapsulating that data in its own object will save you lots of copy/synchronization pain later. These aren't the only considerations when analyzing your data. But they're definitely part of the puzzle.
