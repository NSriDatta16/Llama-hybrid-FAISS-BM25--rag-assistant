CProgramming.com is one of the best places to learn C is. It has clear and concise tutorials about Basics of C ( loops , pointers recursion etc.) Data structures (linked lists, binary trees etc. ) OpenGL for graphics Tips and Tricks Code Snippets and even AI ( neural networks ) They also have small Quiz at the end of each chapter. The K & R is simply the best (but I guess you wanted some online tutorial).
