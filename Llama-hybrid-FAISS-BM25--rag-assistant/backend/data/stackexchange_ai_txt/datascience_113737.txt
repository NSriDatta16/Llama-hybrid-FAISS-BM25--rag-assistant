Classification report for binary class problem

I am building a binary CNN using single neuron in the last dense layer and "binary_crossentropy" as the loss function while compiling to predict either class1 or class2. I am having problem in creating a classification report as y_pred is a 1D array with continuous values while y_test is having binary values. Getting following error- ValueError: Classification metrics can't handle a mix of binary and continuous targets However, if I use two neurons in the last dense layer and use "categorical_crossentropy", I was able to create confusion matrix and classification reports successfully as I was able to use np.argmax on y_pred and y_test
