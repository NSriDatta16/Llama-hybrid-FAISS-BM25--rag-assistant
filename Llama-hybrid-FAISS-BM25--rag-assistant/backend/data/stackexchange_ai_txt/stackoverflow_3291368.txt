from wikipedia n-sphere To generate uniformly distributed random points on the (n âˆ’ 1)-sphere (i.e., the surface of the n-ball), Marsaglia (1972) gives the following algorithm. Generate an n-dimensional vector of normal deviates (it suffices to use N(0, 1), although in fact the choice of the variance is arbitrary), \mathbf{x}=(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n). Now calculate the "radius" of this point, r=\sqrt{x_1^2+x_2^2+\cdots+x_n^2}. The vector \frac{1}{r} \mathbf{x} is uniformly distributed over the surface of the unit n-ball. A matlab code fragment that accomplishes this is: numdims = 8; numpts = 3^10; x = randn([numdims numpts]); lx = repmat(sqrt(sum(x.^2,1)), [numdims 1]); x = x./lx; %x(:,j) is the jth point on the circle)
