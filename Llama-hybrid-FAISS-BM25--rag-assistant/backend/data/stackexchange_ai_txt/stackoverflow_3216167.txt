Does the iPhone offer a good Cryptographic API/Service Provider?

How extensive are the Cryptographic options offered by Apple for the iPhone OS? Does it have public key infrastructure support? Can the Keystore (or I guess keychain) be leveraged by third party applications and are they able to pull/store private keys there? What about support for the LDAP for pulling user's public certificates?
