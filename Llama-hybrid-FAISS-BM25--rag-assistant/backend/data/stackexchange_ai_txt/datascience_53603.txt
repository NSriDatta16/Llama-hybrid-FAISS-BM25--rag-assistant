Welcome to the forum (and machine learning). Choosing an estimator/model can sometimes be the hardest problems, as such there are many different opinions and ways to do so. The first thing I notice with your problem statement is that you're wanting to predict the Sales (either in $ or quantity, I would assume). Because you're not trying to predict a category or binary label, we can rule out classification models and look at instead regression style models. A logical starting point for this would be to explore using a Linear Regression. This assumes that you have some existing data with the price, quantity, or target you're trying to predict. Linear Regression is a logical starting point as they're simple to implement, yet can get some pretty good results. Scikit-learn has a nice package in Python on linear regressions . If you don't get satisfactory results using Linear Regressions, you may wish to explore Decision Trees, either scikit-learns implementation or xgboost . This rules out classification models. Briefly, I think it's important to note that the features to your model are nearly all categorical, eg. make, model, etc. To handle these features, you'll need to encode these features, a guide on that is here . Take your time, explore your data a lot and start with a simple model. The more you understand your data, the more you'll understand the model. Enjoy and have fun! :)
