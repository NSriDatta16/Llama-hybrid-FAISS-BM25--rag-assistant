Most (but not all) clustering algorithms will partition your data set into disjoint, non-overlapping clusters that cover the entire data set. But there will likely be uncommon "configurations" that probably do not fit into any cluster. Furthermore, you will need to define a suitable similarity measure. When are two households similar? This is domething you need to decide, because there is no mathematical "correct" way. E.g. you could look at the average number of attributes every member has in common to the most similar member in the other household. So e.g. two persons in each household, and one has 4/5 attributes in common, the other 5/5. Then you could define the similarity to be 9/10 i.e. 90%. An alternate, more promising, approach is that of frequent itemset mining , which yields common patterns but does not require every data point to conform to exactly one of them. Thr classic use case is "people who bought X also bought Y". It is possible (but not a matter of point & click) to abstract this to "households where a person with attributes X live, also contain persons with attributes Y and Z", along woth frequency and likelihood values.
