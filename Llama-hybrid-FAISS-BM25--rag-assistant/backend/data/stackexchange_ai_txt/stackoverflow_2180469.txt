I don't think of it as embedding SQL in your code any more than embedding a Stored Proc name in your code is. More often than not a change to your Proc involves change to your code anyway. For example, you usually need to add a new in/out parameter or update a getter/setter method to reference a new column. What it does is remove a lot of the leg work of writing twice as much code to align properties and methods in your code with procs and columns in your DB.
