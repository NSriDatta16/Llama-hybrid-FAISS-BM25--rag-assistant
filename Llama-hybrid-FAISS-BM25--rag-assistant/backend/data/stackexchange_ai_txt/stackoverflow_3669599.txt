read only databases and index fragmentation in SQL Server

I have a number of read only databases alter database [ReferenceData] set READ_ONLY that is used by our application and was wondering what type of things I can tweak for maximum performance? So far, I came up with the following goals: Force padding in indexes to 100% fill factor index fragementation be less than 10% If space isn't a problem look at DMVs and add as many INCLUDED columns as recommended Do these make sense? Are there more things I should be tweaking for max efficiencies? I'm running SQL Server 2008 on Windows 2008
