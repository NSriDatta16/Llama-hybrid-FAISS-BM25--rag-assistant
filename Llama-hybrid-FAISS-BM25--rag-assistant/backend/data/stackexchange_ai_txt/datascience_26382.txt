What is the shape of conv3d and conv3d_transpose?

I want to do a GAN with coloured pictures. This means I need a three dimensional input and therefore I like to use conv3d and conv3d_transpose. Unfortunately in the TensorFlow documentation , I can't find any formula for the output shape. Can anyone give me a hint on how to find the shape of the function's results?
