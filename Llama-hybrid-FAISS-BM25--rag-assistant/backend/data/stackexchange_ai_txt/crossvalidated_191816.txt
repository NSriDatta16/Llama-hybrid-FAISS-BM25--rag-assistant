Normalise heart rate data

I need to statistically examine time series of heart rate data over many different users. Since I don't have data for each user for each instance, I should find a way to normalise the data so that I can somehow average them (different users have different baseline heart rate, variance, response rate and potentially other characteristics). Any ideas on how to do that? I could statistically normalise the heart rates, or take the z-values,... is there a better way of doing this?
