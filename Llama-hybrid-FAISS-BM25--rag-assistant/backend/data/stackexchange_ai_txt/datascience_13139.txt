big question. Ok so here's a few things I'd look at if I was you.. Have you tried any feature engineering ?(it sounds like you've just used the features in the training set but I can't be 100%) Random Forests should do pretty well, but maybe try xgboost too? It's quite good at everything on Kaggle. SVM's could be worth a go also if you're thinking of stacking/ensembling. Check out some of the tutorials around this competition. There's hundreds of them and most of them are great. Links: R #1 (my favourite) R #2 Python #1 Python #2 ...Hopefully this helps
