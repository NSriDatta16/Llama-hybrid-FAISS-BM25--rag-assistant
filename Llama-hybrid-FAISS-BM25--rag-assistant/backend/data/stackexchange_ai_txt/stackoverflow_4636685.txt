Magento admin separate ajax product Grid load

I have to load separate product Grid to select needed product items and store it under my another custom module's model in magento admin side. So i have a custom module created by using Module creator and added another tab which i wish to show all the products as a list or grid to select(Exactly i want it like in new order page under admin side) and store. Do you anybody know how to load product grid or list under custom module area. I really appreciate your help. Thanks
