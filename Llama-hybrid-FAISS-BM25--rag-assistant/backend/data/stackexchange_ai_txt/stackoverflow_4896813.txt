Cache: (hence the random nocache variable) I think you are filling up the users browser cache with a lot of crap this way. You should sent correct headers to bypass caching instead(also better for proxies). //Set no caching header("Expires: Mon, 26 Jul 1997 05:00:00 GMT"); header("Last-Modified: " . gmdate("D, d M Y H:i:s") . " GMT"); header("Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate"); header("Cache-Control: post-check=0, pre-check=0", false); header("Pragma: no-cache"); Pick one: http://enfranchisedmind.com/blog/posts/jquery-periodicalupdater-ajax-polling/ https://github.com/blog/467-smart-js-polling http://925html.com/code/smart-polling/ Sidenote: The performance/scalability is (probably) going to suck(especially if the load is NOT in memory). I think if you could you should really avoid polling. Some solutions to prevent this: http://pusherapp.com/ : small apps(single) can use it for free. (5 Max connections, 10,000 Messages per day). http://socket.io : very very good node.js module to do this for you. I would advise you to watch this video from node camp giving a short introduction: " Socket.IO Workshop: Guillermo Rauch "
