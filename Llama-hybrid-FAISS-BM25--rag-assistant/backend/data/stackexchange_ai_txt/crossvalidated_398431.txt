How does backpropagation work with mixed architectures?

This question raised to me since I'm unsucessfully training a CNN-LSTM network atm. If for instance, LSTM requires a different type of BP algorithm (TBPTT), how do softwares deal with it? What is the correct way of handling this? Doing the same type of BP everywhere? Or changing in the middle of the architecture when reaching a different type of layer?
