view global/static/inherrited variables in eclipse debugger

This is a minor annoyance for me that keeps coming up. When I'm debugging a program I can see variables in the immediate scope, but I can't see variables which are global, static, or variables inherited by 'this' class. The only way I know how to get these values for testing is to create a dummy variable to store the variable I want within scope of a given function, which isn't efficient or elegant. Is there an easier way to see the value of any/all of the three variable types I mentioned while stepping through the debugger? Thanks
