Do I need to balance my data when I am using a logistic regression model for statistical inference and not prediction?

I am looking into how various features affect an outcome using a logistic regression model. I do not care about prediction right now. My dataset is imbalanced where class 0 accounts for 88% of the data and class 1 accounts for 12% of the data. Do I need to balance my dataset beforehand if my goal is inference and not prediction? Is there another way to account for this imbalance, such as utilizing a quasibinomial generalized linear model?
