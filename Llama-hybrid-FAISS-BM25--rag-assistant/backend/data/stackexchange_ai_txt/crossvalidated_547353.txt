High Precision and High Recall issue- Random Forest Classification

I am building a classification model using Random Forest technique using GridSearchCV. The target variable is binary where 1 is 7.5% of total population. I have used several values of GridSearch Parameters but results are almost always same precision recall f1-score support 0 0.91 1 0.95 738 1 0 0 0 75 avg/total 0.82 0.91 0.86 813 As per confusion matrix, none of the 1’s are being correctly identified. Accuracy is equal to 1. 0 1 0 738 0 1 75 0 Are there any general ‘hacks’ there for high precision and high recall scores? Does 7.5% mean the model/classes are imbalanced? Any suggestions?
