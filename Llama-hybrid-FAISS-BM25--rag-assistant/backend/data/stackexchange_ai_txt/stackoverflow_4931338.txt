What makes you think this is impacting you? In particular, gen-0 collections are very, very cheap - and to be encouraged. I would look more at ""What might cause some of these requests to escape gen-0 into gen-1; am I clinging onto any object unnecessarily, for example via an event?". Of course, another thing to look at is: are there any places you can avoid creating unnecessary objects, for example: are you doing string concatenation in a loop that could be StringBuilder instead? any moderate-to-large collections that could be initialized with the correct length to avoid reallocations? any scratch-buffers that could be reused? for example, do you do a lot of encoding work that uses a byte[] briefly in a method, where that byte[] could be passed in as a scratch area, or grabbed from a pool? any other things that could be cached and re-used - for example, a new Regex("some literal") created inside a method, that could be made into a static field, plus compiled for performance any intensive string parsing that could use interning? (not necessarily the inbuilt interner though)
