Is this an acceptable case to use a JSP scriptlet?

I know that using JSP scriptlets is generally frowned upon, which is why I'm wondering if there is a more elegant way of achieving what I'm trying to do. Pretty much I am creating a view, and depending on certain situations in the domain model, I am rendering different HTML. For example, consider the scenario where a user could be in a role. And a method like this is defined on the User model class: public boolean isInRole(String roleName) { // Logic here to determine if the user is in a role } And then we have a JSP, like below: // Some HTML here... // Generate some admin menu here As far as I know this can't be done using JSTL/EL. Does using scriptlets here sound like a good idea? Or is there another approach I should be taking? Thanks for any suggestions.
