The issue is that an "averaged" model through MuMIn is actually stored as a list of the input models with a few new attributes. It is not actually the "output" model. Every time you print or summarize the model.avg output, it re-generates the averaged outputs from the list for display. You will need to manually generate the components of the diagnostic plots using predict and then do the math.
