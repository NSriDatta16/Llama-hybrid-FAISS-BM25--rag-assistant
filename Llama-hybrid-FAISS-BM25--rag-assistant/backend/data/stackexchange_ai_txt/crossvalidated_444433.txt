In MCMC methods, you typically sample from partially known (as also pointed out in the comments section) distributions. Knowing its form up to a scalar (i.e. constant wrt $\theta$ ) is enough. Therefore, MCMC can also be used to approximate integrals by implicitly calculating the normalization constant. For example, you probably won't be able to calculate the normalization constant for $e^{-\theta^8}$ , but will be able to sample from it using MCMC.
