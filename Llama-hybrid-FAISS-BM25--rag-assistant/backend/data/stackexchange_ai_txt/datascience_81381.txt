How to determine semantic differences in NLP

I would need to determine the difference in meaning between the following two sentences: I am at home I am not at home I am at the office the first two sentences differs in verb, which changes the meaning of the sentences (to negative); the second one, with the first one, differs because of the place. I have thought of word2vec, but I am not completely sure if this is the best tool to analyse sentences like the above ones. Also cosine_similarity could be a solution, but I would have not information about the meaning. I think it is more about semantic meaning...
