SubSonic SQL CE Error

I have an old c# project which currently runs on a SQL CE database. I decided yesterday that I would like to use SubSonic to generate a DAL for me as I have used SubSonic a lot in my other projects (with a standard MS SQL database backend) and I love it's ease of use. Everything seems fine, I can create and delete records but as soon as I update a record using the Save() method an error it thrown: Example: Person person = new Person(); person.Name = "Robert"; person.Save(); // Works fine, record is saved person.Name = "Robert - Updated"; person.Save(); // Fails with error below "There was an error parsing the query. [ Token line number = 1, Token line offset = 61, Token in error = SELECT ]" When I update a record by creating a new Query and setting the QueryType to Update, it also seems to be working as expected. Any ideas? Thanks
