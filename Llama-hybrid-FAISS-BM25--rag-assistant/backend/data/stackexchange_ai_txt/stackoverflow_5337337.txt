Could not load NIB in bundle

I am trying to integrate Janrain Engage as custom module with Appcelerator Titanium. I have created a sample module and dragged the JREngage folder to the sample module xcodeproj as indicated in the Jainrain's documentation. Now I give build command to this project, then execute the ./build.py and then finally I execute the titanium run command. It launches the application in simulator with a blank screen and immediately crashes throwing the following error. Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInternalInconsistencyException', reason: 'Could not load NIB in bundle: 'NSBundle (loaded)' with name 'JRProvidersController'' Why could this error be occurring?
