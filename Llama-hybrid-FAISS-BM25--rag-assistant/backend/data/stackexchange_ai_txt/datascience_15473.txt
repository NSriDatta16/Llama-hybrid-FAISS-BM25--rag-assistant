You might want to look into scikit's DecisionTreeRegressor() class . A decision tree regressor will predict a real number. The decision tree classifier, by contrast, will predict a discrete class for an observation. A more advanced version would be the RandomForestRegressor() class , which builds a random forest of regression trees. A third option to consider might be a GradientBoostedRegressor() . I would also recommend this flow chart from Scikit that can help you choose an estimator.
