Select average from MySQL table with LIMIT

I am trying to get the average of the lowest 5 priced items, grouped by the username attached to them. However, the below query gives the average price for each user (which of course is the price), but I just want one answer returned. SELECT AVG(price) FROM table WHERE price > '0' && item_id = '$id' GROUP BY username ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 5
