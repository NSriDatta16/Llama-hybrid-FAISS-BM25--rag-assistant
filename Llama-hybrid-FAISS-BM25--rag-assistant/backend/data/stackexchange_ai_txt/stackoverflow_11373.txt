Shouldn't it always be "$ORACLE_ HOME/network/admin/tnsnames.ora"? Then you can just do "echo $oracle_ home" or the *nix equivalent. @Pete Holberton You are entirely correct. Which reminds me, there's another monkey wrench in the works called TWO_ TASK According http://www.orafaq.com/wiki/TNS_ADMIN TNS_ADMIN is an environment variable that points to the directory where the SQL*Net configuration files (like sqlnet.ora and tnsnames.ora) are located.
