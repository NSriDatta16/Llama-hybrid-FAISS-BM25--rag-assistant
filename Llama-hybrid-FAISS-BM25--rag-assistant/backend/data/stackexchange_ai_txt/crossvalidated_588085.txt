Electronic healthcare records provide longitudinal data that don't have the regular observation times of panel or standard time-series data. Even if formal methods of interrupted (regularly spaced) time series analysis aren't appropriate, you can still model such longitudinal data as functions of time. Chapter 7 of Frank Harrell's course notes shows ways to handle data irregularly spaced in time from a set of individuals. Use an adequately flexible function to describe the time course of the data so that the irregularity of observation times doesn't matter. For example, you can define the reference time = 0 as the intervention time for each patient, transform calendar dates into time relative to that reference, and evaluate levels or rates of change before and after the intervention. That's the basis of the difference-in-difference approach to trying to infer causality from observational data, which doesn't necessarily require identical observation times.
