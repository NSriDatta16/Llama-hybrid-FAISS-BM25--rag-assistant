.Net Regular Expression to get parenthetical text at end of tags

I have a simple pattern I am trying to match, any characters captured between parenthesis at the end of an HTML paragraph. I am running into trouble any time there is additional parentheticals in that paragraph: i.e. If the input string is "..... (321) " i want to get the value (321) However, if the paragraph has this text: "... (123) (321) " my regex is returning "(123) (321)" (everything between the opening "(" and closing ")" I am using the regex pattern "\s(.+) " How can I grab the correct value (using VB.NET) This is what I'm doing so far: Dim reg As New Regex("\s\(.+\) ", RegexOptions.IgnoreCase) Dim matchC As MatchCollection = reg.Matches(su.Question) If matchC.Count > 0 Then Dim lastMatch As Match = matchC(matchC.Count - 1) Dim DesiredValue As String = lastMatch.Value End If
