How to access columns in a table that have different cell widths from MS Word

I am trying to get the cells from 1st column in a table. Getting exception in the " Foreach(Cells c in rng.Tables[1].Columns[1].Cells) " because the table contains columns that have mixed cell widths. for eg: in first row, there are 4 cells and in second row, there are only 2 cells (2 cells merged together) Error Message: " Cannot access individual columns in this collection because the table has mixed cell widths. " Document oDoc = open word document foreach (Paragraph p in oDoc.Paragraphs) { Range rng = p.Range; /* */ foreach (Cell c in rng.Tables[1].Columns[1].Cells) { //.... } }
