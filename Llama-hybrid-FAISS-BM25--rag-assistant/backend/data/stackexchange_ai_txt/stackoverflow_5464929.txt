You start with launching Visual Studio 2010 and creating a new ASP.NET MVC 3 project using the default template. In advance you have thought about how you would organize your view models, controllers, views and data access layer. You have drawn diagrams that will help you facilitate through the development process. You have analyzed if there are any reusable parts of those 250,000 lines of code or is it all garbage. Then you can define expectations, write unit tests, ... classic development lifecycle. Also setup your Git repository as early as possible in your development process, at best after creating the project template, and put this template under source control immediately. Also don't forget to setup your continuous integration build server as early as possible so that you are notified of build failures in the trunk .
