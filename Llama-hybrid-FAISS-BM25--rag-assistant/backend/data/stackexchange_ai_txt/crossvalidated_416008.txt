A quantile-quantile ("Q-Q") plot can help. There is a qqplot() in base R, but the version in the car package ( qqPlot() ) is somewhat enhanced; in particular, it shows a point-wise confidence envelope for the 1:1 line. Pointwise (rather than curvewise) confidence envelopes means that on average we'd expect about nrow(DT)*0.05 =78*0.05 = 3.9 values in your data set to fall outside the envelope by chance ... m $Y) par(las=1,bty="l") p Y,lambda=m) car::qqPlot(jitter(DT $Y, factor=3), distribution="pois", lambda=mean(DT$ Y), ylim=c(0,30)) I added the jitter to help distinguish the repeated values in the data set (it would be nicer to make the points correspondingly larger, but that would require more hacking than is convenient ...) Based on the plot, it looks like the points at the lower end are actually more unusual than the points at the upper end - that is, your data are a little bit thin-tailed on the right side: we would have expected the smallest values to be in the range 0-4, not 6-8 ...
