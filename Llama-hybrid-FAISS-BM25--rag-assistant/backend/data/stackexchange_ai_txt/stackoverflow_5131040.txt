Your suspicions are correct. The easiest way to get what you want is to use an NSFetchedResultsController and it's delegate. If you create a dummy project in Xcode make a navigation-based application and make sure use Core Data for storage is checked. the area after #pragma mark Fetched results controller delegate in RootViewController.m will show you how to keep your UITableView updated when the model changes.
