One thing that may not be apparent is that linear regression can be used as a t-test: clear sysuse auto ttest price, by(foreign) Here you can see the output: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Group | Obs Mean Std. Err. Std. Dev. [95% Conf. Interval] ---------+-------------------------------------------------------------------- Domestic | 52 6072.423 429.4911 3097.104 5210.184 6934.662 Foreign | 22 6384.682 558.9942 2621.915 5222.19 7547.174 ---------+-------------------------------------------------------------------- combined | 74 6165.257 342.8719 2949.496 5481.914 6848.6 ---------+-------------------------------------------------------------------- diff | -312.2587 754.4488 -1816.225 1191.708 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ diff = mean(Domestic) - mean(Foreign) t = -0.4139 Ho: diff = 0 degrees of freedom = 72 Ha: diff 0 Pr(T |t|) = 0.6802 Pr(T > t) = 0.6599 The mean price for domestic cars is 6072.4, and that for foreign cars is 6384.7. The difference is about -312.3 dollars (95%CI -1816.2, 1191.8) with a p-value of 0.6802. Now, we can recast it as a linear regression. The coding scheme for foreign is: . codebook foreign -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- foreign Car type -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- type: numeric (byte) label: origin range: [0,1] units: 1 unique values: 2 missing .: 0/74 tabulation: Freq. Numeric Label 52 0 Domestic 22 1 Foreign And the linear regression is: . reg price foreign Source | SS df MS Number of obs = 74 -------------+---------------------------------- F(1, 72) = 0.17 Model | 1507382.66 1 1507382.66 Prob > F = 0.6802 Residual | 633558013 72 8799416.85 R-squared = 0.0024 -------------+---------------------------------- Adj R-squared = -0.0115 Total | 635065396 73 8699525.97 Root MSE = 2966.4 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ price | Coef. Std. Err. t P>|t| [95% Conf. Interval] -------------+---------------------------------------------------------------- foreign | 312.2587 754.4488 0.41 0.680 -1191.708 1816.225 _cons | 6072.423 411.363 14.76 0.000 5252.386 6892.46 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Given the regression formula: $$\text{Price} = 6072.4 + 312.3\times\text{Foreign},$$ where "Foreign" = 0 for domestic cars and = 1 for foreign cars. For domestic car, the average price is just the constant (or intercept) which is 6072.4. For foreign car, the average price is 6072.4 + 312.3. Notice that, the mean difference 312.3 is the same as the regression coefficient here. Their p-values and 95%CI are also the same. The sign being flipped was due to the fact that t-test looks as the difference as (domestic - foreign) and regression considers (foreign - domestic.) In your case, the analogy to t-test still works, but now your multiple regression also permits adjusting for other variables.
