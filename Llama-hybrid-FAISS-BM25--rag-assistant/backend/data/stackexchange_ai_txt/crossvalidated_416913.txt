Yes, I agree that it's not exactly clear what the author was trying to depict with his "convolution" example. A better rephasing of the general task at hand might be "if we want to use convolution on pointclouds, then we'd better make sure it's invariant to the ordering of the points, and makes use of the spatial location of points ". And indeed there has been work along these lines: Deep Parametric Continuous Convolutional Neural Networks among others. PointNet does a pretty good job at permutation invariance, but doesn't really take advantage of the actual spatial locations of the points.
