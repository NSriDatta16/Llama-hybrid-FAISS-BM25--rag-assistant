While this is not a purely Bayesian framework (since MAP estimators can be argued as being un-Bayesian ), one should consider that the prior $p(\theta)$ in this analysis is a genuine prior, thus chosen by a Bayesian experimenter rather than provided by Nature. This freedom of choice (and the ensuing subjectivity of the Bayesian analysis) mean that constraints to ensure the convergence of the modified EM sequence can be enforced upon the prior by picking the hyperparameter $\nu_0$ accordingly, i.e. $$\nu_0>D.$$ Note that there are several arguments for choosing $\nu_0$ larger than the lower bound $D-1$ : when $_0 , the Whishart random matrix $Λ_$ is not almost surely invertible , i.e., the covariance matrix may be degenerate when $_0\ge$ , the Whishart random matrix $Λ_$ is thus almost surely positive definite when $_0>2n+−1$ the inverse Whishart random matrix $Λ_^{-1}$ enjoys an $n$ -th order moment, which implies that when $_0≤+1$ there is no (prior) expectation of the inverse Wishart random matrix $Λ_^{-1}$ .
