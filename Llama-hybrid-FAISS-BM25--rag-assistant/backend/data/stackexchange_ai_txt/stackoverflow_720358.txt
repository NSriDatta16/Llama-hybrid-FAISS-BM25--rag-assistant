I'd suggest using Linq to SQL. You are correct in thinking that you should not be using any foreach loops - all you need is databinding. eg. In your code behind, you might have a DataBind event that does something like this: protected void GridView1_DataBanding(object sender, EventArgs e) { // Get an instance of our generated DataContext class. DAL.AdventureWorks db = new DAL.AdventureWorks( WebConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings["AdventureWorksCS"].ConnectionString); // Get a strongly typed List from the Stored Procedure output List myData = db.MySP().ToList(); GridView1.DataSource = myData; } You will need to have setup your Stored Procedure in your Linq to SQL Classes by dragging it onto the design surface. Hope that helps.
