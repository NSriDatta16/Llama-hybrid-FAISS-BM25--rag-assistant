It depends on the "true" data generation process. If the model does not match this process, then it will not perform as well as a model (perhaps a simpler one) that does match it. So a GLM typically performs worse than a random forest, but not when the true data generation process is exactly like a linear regression. For example: I simulate data below (using R) from a logistic regression model. A GLM has a higher accuracy (85%) than a random forest (79%) on the test set. In general, models perform better when their form and assumptions match what truly generated the data. Our models are never perfect, but they perform well when they approximate the process close enough. library(randomForest) inv_logit .5 sum(diag(table(test $y, pred1))) / sum(table(test$ y, pred1)) mod2 $y, pred2))) / sum(table(test$ y, pred2))
