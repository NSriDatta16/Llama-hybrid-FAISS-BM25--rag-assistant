You're not going to succeed using ownership chaining, as you already discovered. A solution would be like this: report_writer must create its reports with an EXECUTE AS SELF clause so they get executed under the report_writer priviledges. Then the report_reader group will be able to leverage the EXECUTE permission on reports schema to execute said reports, and the reports will be able to read the data because of the execute as clause.
