What was used before data augmentation (e.g. SMOTE) to train ML models on imbalanced data? Please provide citations

I am seriously curious on how imbalance data was treated in machine learning and statistical learning before modern time data augmentation solutions such as SMOTE appeared. Please provide citations not only opinions.
