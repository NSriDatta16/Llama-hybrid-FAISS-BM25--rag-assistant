You are correct about Region - given that Region is categorical, it gets dummy coded. Pr(>|z|) does give p values, and 0.05 is a typical cut-off point for significance, but the rest of your statement in that paragraph is not correct. Estimate is values to be plugged into the logistic regression equation; they are not very intuitive; more intuitive are odds ratios. You can get these by take e ^ estimate or you can have R give them to you (along with their confidence intervals) with exp(cbind(OR = coef(fit), confint(fit))) Standard error is (in simple terms) an estimate of how good the estimates are. AIC is useful only for comparing two or more models, if this is the only model you are running, you can ignore it.
