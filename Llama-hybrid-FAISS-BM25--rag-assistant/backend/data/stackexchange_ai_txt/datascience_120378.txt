Is there a machine learning model I should look into to predict the effect land topology will have on prevailing wind direction near bodies of water

I'd like to predict the change in wind velocity due to land near bodies of water. Warmer or colder land should change the wind velocity of nearshore breeze. I'd also like to predict wind shadows that may be present from land topology. Is there are particular machine learning model that I should look into for this? This would be for hyper localized predictions. Less than 1 mile in resolution.
