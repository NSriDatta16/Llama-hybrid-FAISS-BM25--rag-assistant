Getting low accuracy on keras pretrained word embeddings example

Original blog post claims that it is possible to get 95% accuracy on the validation set (20 Newsgroup dataset) after only 2 epochs using pretrained word embeddings (glove.6B.100d). All code is located here . I did not changed anything in this example but getting only 40% accuracy on the validation set after 2 epochs and 75% after 10 epochs. I can't get to 95% accuracy even after 20 epochs. Switching from tensorflow to theano backend do not make any significant change. I'm using Keras 2.0.2, tensorflow-gpu 1.0.1, theano 0.9.0, python 2.7.12. What I'm doing wrong?
