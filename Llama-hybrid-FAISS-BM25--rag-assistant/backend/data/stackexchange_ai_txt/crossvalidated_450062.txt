If you have a binary variable coded as -1/1, this has the benefit of making the linear combination of coefficients for that category a contrast . That may be nice for statistical models, but for machine learning my opinion is that 0/1 is better. Not only does 0/1 make interpretation of means and variances easier, but it also makes interpreting conditions of the data (e.g ad was present or absent) easier as well as automatically being a min/max scaling which some methods (like neural nets) seem to benefit from. All in all, I would prefer 0/1 over -1/1.
