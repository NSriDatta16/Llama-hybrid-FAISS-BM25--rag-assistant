I used a previously solved hack to call a bean method from JS : Created an empty, invisible form, with h:commandButton and f:ajax inside it calling listener . Created a separate button for launching the expand/collapse event. From that button initiate javascript method, that animates the expansion/collapse and at the same time clicks the hidden button inside the form. All needed data is sent using the listener attribute. Listener targets a session bean, which checks/updates a map of states, identified by component's client ids. This is pretty simple, wonder why I didn't realize it eariler... However, it's still far from perfect and it doesn't answer how the request-scoped beans could be initiated with default values to use them as storage/transport form.
