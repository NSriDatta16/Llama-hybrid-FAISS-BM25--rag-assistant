DotNetOpenAuth oAuth in ASP.NET MVC

I'm trying to understand how to apply the oAuth consumer library from DotNetOpenAuth in the context of ASP.NET MVC. oAuth is new to me, and the library doesn't seem very simple. Does anyone have a sample of leveraging this library, for this usage, in ASP.NET MVC?
