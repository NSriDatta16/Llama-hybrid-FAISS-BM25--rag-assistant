The base template must always come from you first. This includes the HTML layout, CSS and JS, even if they're just empty files 'cos you're not done with 'em. With some experience, you should know how to layout the basic elements which should not change significantly over the period of the project. IDs and class attributes should be liberally applied to wherever you see fit. The developers will take your HTML template and incorporate it into whatever templating system they're using. Your HTML template sample will be thereafter used as just a reference from then on. However, your CSS and JS files should then be committed into your source control repo where both you and developers should be accessing the same files. Your committed changes must be accessible by them at all times. Enforce a rule where Java developers must never put in any inline JS or CSS declarations. If you catch anyone using tags, talk to your manager to fire the guy, he's hopeless ;) In order to minimize you asking the developers to build and rebuild all the time while you're troubleshooting some layout issue, consider using a continuous integration tool such as Hudson . Whenever you need to deploy to test something, just go to the Hudson control panel and click on Build to get the latest build deployed with minimal effort. If you really need to change the template (i.e. FUBAR change coming from inconsiderate end users), ready the new template first and then talk to the developers on how to incorporate it in. Most of the time, your base elements are still applicable, it's just how they're laid out that's changed. None of these are really fool-proof. It just makes life suck a little less. I definitely encourage you to learn a bit of JSP tag libs just so you have a higher comfort level during the project.
