For a historical account, I would suggest " The Golden Holocaust " by Robert Proctor. It's about the tobacco industry which had scientists, epidemiologists and statisticians inadvertently or not making arguments on its behalf. (This includes R.A. Fisher.) PS: The full title is "The Golden Holocaust: Origins of the Cigarette Catastrophe and the Case for Abolition", so I would caution that this book is part history, part advocacy. It's a great book. Another recommendation: " Voices in the Code: A Story about People, Their Values, and the Algorithm They Made " by David Robinson. This one tackles ethical questions head-on; it's about the limits of technology and science (statistics, machine learning, artificial intelligence) to make hard ethical choices.
