Local Storage is a simple map from key to value, so no. There is no method to look up the key for a value, or more accurately, the key s because there may be more than one. You could additionally store a reverse table of city->state to accomplish this: // Georgia's largest city is Atlanta window.localStorage.setItem("Georgia", "Atlanta") // What is Georgia's largest city? var x=window.localStorage.getItem("Georgia") // returns Atlanta // Atlanta is in Georgia window.localStorage.setItem("Atlanta", "Georgia") // What state does Atlanta belong to? var y=window.localStorage.getItem("Atlanta") // returns Georgia So now setItem() means "there is a relationship between X and Y" and getItem() means "is there a / what is the relationship between X and Y?" Ideally you'd have these in two different tables to separate out what type of relationship you're talking about (i.e., state->city and city->state) but you should be okay in this simple case.
