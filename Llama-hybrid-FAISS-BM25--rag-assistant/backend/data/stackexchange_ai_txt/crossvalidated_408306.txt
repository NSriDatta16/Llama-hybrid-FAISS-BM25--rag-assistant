I did a cursory search for the context of the quote you give. I find it showing up a lot with slides for Gharamani . In those slides he's using that statement to suggest that MAP is not a bayesian method. My experience with Bayesian methods has been that the results of some inference are usually a distribution of parameters that you then average over in some way to get an estimation/prediction. I think Xi'an demonstrates that getting the evidence itself doesn't require optimization. The only point where optimization comes into play is when you have to make a decision to select a model based on some utility function.
