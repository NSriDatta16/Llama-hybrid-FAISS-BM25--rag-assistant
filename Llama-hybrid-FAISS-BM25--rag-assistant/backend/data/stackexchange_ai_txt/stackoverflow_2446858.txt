Embedding ASPX in ASP page

I have an ASPX based component which I'd need to inlude into a plain ASP based script. Scenario is, that I'm working within an LMS system (Angel to be exact) and I wan't to create a new nugget within that framework. An Angel nugget is pretty much what a portlet is in the Java world. Now, the nugget spec. states that my starting point has to be a file called default.asp. What I'd like to do is: read relevant data from ASP session pass data to ASPX component have ASPX do it's job and display the results My problem is that I fail to run / display my ASPX component without using an iframe, which I want to avoid since that crushes the layout / design of my nugget. Is there a way to get this done properly or do I have to rewrite my component in ASP to get this going? Note: the component performs web service queries and such and I'd like to avoid rewriting that.
