Is ANOVA being misused for these binary data?

Everywhere I have read that if you want to test the hypothesis of dependence of a binary outcome on your data, you should not apply ANOVA (if its incorrect, please let me know). We can apply logistic regression, chi square testing etc. I have come across a paper in the reputed Journal of Vision , where I believe the ANOVA is being misused. I would like to mention that this is not just one case and I have seen many papers like this: Paper In this paper the authors are mainly seeing how inversion of face images leads to accuracy changes. However, they have written this statement: ANOVA was conducted with the main factors of Orientation (upright or inverted), Change Type (configural or featural) and Region (eyes or mouth). The results (Figure 3) showed a significant main effect of Orientation, F(1, 21) = 24.35, p Can someone help me out by figuring how ANOVA is being applied here? All the 3 parameters Orientation, Change Type and Region are binary. However the authors are reporting the p values and hypothesis significance. Is this the correct way to do so? I am mainly asking this not just from the viewpoint of this paper. As I have mentioned many authors just take factors that are binary, apply ANOVA and show that one of them is better in a specific task.
