Infragistics WebGrid vs. Telerik Grid

I have been using the Infragistics UltraWebGrids for a few years now in multiple products, but have reached a crossroads with them. I have been looking into the Telerik products and they appear to perform better than the Infragistics grids in the demos. The following are the things I'm looking to know. 1. Which would you use and why. 2. Which grid performs better. 3. Which product is quicker to implement. 4. Which product is easier to maintain.
