Your demand seems to have a quarterly cycle. I suggest that you separate this out by: - using a three-month sliding window to plot a trend line - calculating average demand on day one, day 2 of the quarter etc to plot the periodic variation - add the two figure and substracting actual demand to determine residuals This will give you a clearer idea of what is to be explained. Exogenous factors could increase the quarterly variation, change the gradient of the underlying change, or make a temporary change in the size of the residual.
