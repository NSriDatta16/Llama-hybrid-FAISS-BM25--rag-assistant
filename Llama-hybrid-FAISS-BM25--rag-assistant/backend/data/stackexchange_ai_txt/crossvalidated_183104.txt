Using MCMC to sample from a posterior, are our posterior beliefs on parameters independent?

I've been given a classification problem in which MCMC (slice-sampling) is used to sample from a hierarchical posterior. After getting $n$ samples, the Monte Carlo method can be used to give an estimate of parameters of the model. My question is: Are our posterior beliefs about individual parameters independent? I would argue they are not, as each sample in slice-sampling is auto-correlated...
