How to measure which program is faster than another in a statistically meaningful way?

I am trying to compare 2 computer programs, X and Y, for speed. I want to determine which one is faster. I could, for example, chronometer those programs 20 times, take the average and state that the program with the lowest average is the fastest one. I don't know much about statistics, though - is that what I'm doing actually correct? What would be a more meaningful way to test them?
