If you need just document storage then sharepoint can do very well. WSS is ewen free and it provides very good document storage capabilities. But you have to plan carefully as updating existing applications is painfull. If you decide to go with Sharepoint then I can give you few advices from top of my head Pay attention to security configuration (user groups, privilegies,..) Plan your document libraries well as it is not easy to just move documents betveen them Also consider limiting number of versions that one document can have, because sharepoint stores full backups betveen verions, not just changes Don't use infopath:) we have very bad experience with it (just don't tell this to managers) If you don't really need to change graphical look of Sharepoint than don't bother with it as it brings many problems (I'm talking about custom masterpages and custom site templates) Try to use as much OOB stuff as possible, because developing your own webparts not only cost more, but it can be quite complicated. Make sure to turn-on search indexing. This is quite tricky, because it is by default turned off and then you will be as surprised that search is not working as I was :) If you try to just deploy it and load 10.000 documents into it then you will surely have problems with it later. If you give a little thought about structure then you will end up with really good document storage.
