Chaos theory studies dynamic deterministic systems that are highly sensitive to initial conditions, such that small changes in the initial conditions lead to large "chaotic" changes in outputs. The result is a deterministic system that fully determined by its initial conditions, but is unpredictable over the long-term by any approximating method. This differs substantially from the subject of statistics and machine learning, since the latter are concerned with stochastic systems that are generally not highly sensitive to initial conditions. While chaos theory is not strongly related to statistics and machine learning, there are some areas of overlap. The main application of this kind of system in statistics and machine learning is in the creation of deterministic algorithms that generate pseudo-random numbers . These algorithms are designed to be chaotic deterministic systems that are highly sensitive to initial inputs, such that they generate "chaotic" outputs that can be treated as effectively random. More generally, it is possible to look at chaotic deterministic systems and analyse them via the methods of statistics, which in effect ignores the deterministic dynamics of the system and treats it as a stochastic process. This can yield an understanding of the distribution of outputs that come out of a chaotic system under a particular input distribution.
