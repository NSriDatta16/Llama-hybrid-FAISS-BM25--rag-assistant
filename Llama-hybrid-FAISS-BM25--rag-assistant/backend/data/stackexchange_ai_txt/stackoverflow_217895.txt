A Person is a human being, whereas a Customer is just a Role that a Person may adopt from time to time. Man and Woman would be candidates to inherit Person, but Customer is a different concept. The Liskov substitution principle says that we must be able to use derived classes where we have references to a base class, without knowing about it. Having Customer inherit Person would violate this. A Customer might perhaps also be a role played by an Organisation.
