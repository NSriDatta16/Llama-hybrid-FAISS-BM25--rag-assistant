Resolve Lord's Paradox with principal components analysis (orthogonal distance regression)?

I've been reading Judea Pearl's description of Lord's Paradox in his 2018 book The Book of Why: The New Science of Cause and Effect , in which he presents the following plot: In this special case where the data points lie along the same diagonal, if Statistician 2 conducts a regression of Final Weight on Initial Weight using principal components analysis (or orthogonal distance regression), wouldn't that eliminate the different findings of the two statisticians and resolve the paradox? Using PCA to fit a line that minimizes the average squared distance between the points and the line would produce a single fitted line for men and women, rather than two separate regression lines when the average SSE for Final Weight is minimized with least squares.
