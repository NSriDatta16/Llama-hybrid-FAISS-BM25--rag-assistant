HTML scraping a website whose authentication details I have

so I'm using the following code to get the html source code of a specific url: import java.io.*; import java.net.*; public class SourceViewer { public static void main (String[] args) throws IOException{ System.out.print("Enter url of local for viewing html source code: "); BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in)); String url = br.readLine(); try{ URL u = new URL(url); HttpURLConnection uc = (HttpURLConnection) u.openConnection(); int code = uc.getResponseCode(); String response = uc.getResponseMessage(); System.out.println("HTTP/1.x " + code + " " + response); for(int j = 1; ; j++){ String header = uc.getHeaderField(j); String key = uc.getHeaderFieldKey(j); if(header == null || key == null) break; System.out.println(uc.getHeaderFieldKey(j) + ": " + header); } InputStream in = new BufferedInputStream(uc.getInputStream()); Reader r = new InputStreamReader(in); int c; while((c = r.read()) != -1){ System.out.print((char)c); } } catch(MalformedURLException ex){ System.err.println(url + " is not a valid URL."); } catch(IOException ie){ System.out.println("Input/Output Error: " + ie.getMessage()); } } } This code works with wikipedia and other sites, but for my url it doesn't. For example: INPUT: Enter url of local for viewing html source code: http://ntu-edu-sg.campuspack.eu/Groups/SC207-SOFTWARE_ENGINEERING/WikiCPE207_Template_0/Week_11_Software_Testing OUTPUT: HTTP/1.x 403 Forbidden Set-Cookie: ARPT=LWYYVUShyp1CKIQY; path=/ X-Powered-By: Servlet/2.5 Server: Sun GlassFish Enterprise Server v2.1 Set-Cookie: UGROUTE=4c5e7101a68101c06a712650c7352d98; Path=/ P3P: CP="ALL DSP COR CUR ADMa DEVa TAIa PSAa PSDa IVAa IVDa OUR BUS UNI COM NAV INT CNT STA PRE" Set-Cookie: UG=zc2qAfg{; Path=/ Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate Pragma: no-cache Expires: 0 X-Powered-By: JSF/1.2 X-Powered-By: JSF/1.2 Content-Type: text/html;charset=UTF-8 Content-Language: en-US Transfer-Encoding: chunked Date: Tue, 22 Feb 2011 16:09:48 GMT Input/Output Error: Server returned HTTP response code: 403 for URL: http://ntu-edu-sg.campuspack.eu/Groups/SC207-SOFTWARE_ENGINEERING/WikiCPE207_Template_0/Week_11_Software_Testing Response code 403 indicates that the server is denying me permissions to scrape. I do have the authentication details required to log on, and if I try to access the url from the browser, a window pops up asking me redirect to the parent site. I was wondering if there was some way to make this window pop up from my code. To circumvent the authentication problem, I tried logging in from the browser, and then running the code while I was still logged in. However, on running the code, i get the same output. This confuses me, since copy-pasting the url into another tab on the browser after being logged in does not ask for authentication details but simply displays the data, implying that I already have permissions. Can some one please advise me on how to scrape the url?
