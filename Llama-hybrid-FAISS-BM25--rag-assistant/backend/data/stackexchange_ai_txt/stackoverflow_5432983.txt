Imagine you added a button to your window and placed that button underneath the mouse even though the mouse button was already pressed. The button wouldn't automatically 'click' if the mouse button was already pressed when the button appeared beneath it. TagVisualizer is the same way - it only pays attention to tags that go down on it or that it's formally given control of. So how do you formally give an element formal control of a contact? That's where 'capture' comes in. Find the Contact object that represents the tag and then call contact.Capture(tagvisualizer) . That should do the trick! Keep in mind though that probably a better design than dynamically creating new TagVisualizers would be to simply modify the Source property of your visualizationdefinition. Another alternaitve would be to dynamically change the contents of the tagvisualization element itself.
