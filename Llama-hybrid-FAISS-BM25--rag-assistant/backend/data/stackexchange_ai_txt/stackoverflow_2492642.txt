MS Access 2003 - Formatting results in a list box problem

So I have a list box that displays averages in a table like format from a crossyab query. It's just what I need the query is right, there is just one thing. I had to set the field properties in the query as format: standard..decimal:2. Which is exactly what I needed. However..the list box will not pick up on this. First I typed the crosstab sql into the list box's properties....and then I ran into this problem. So then I actually just created the query object, saved it and set that as the rowsource for the list box. Still won't work....when I open the query it is the correct format. So is there a way to further format a text box? Is there a way tell it to limit decimal places to one or two on returned values? Thanks!
