For the first, a test for a difference in two binomial proportions for $H_0: p_t = p_c$ against $H_a: p_t \ne p_c$ would look like this in R: Suppose the treatment group has 325 Yes responses out of 501 and the control group has 278 Yes responses out of 489. The treatment group has about 65% Yes's and the control group only about 57% Yes's. So the proportion of Yes's in the treatment group is somewhat larger. The question is whether the difference is large enough to be statistically significant. prop.test(c(325, 278), c(501, 489), cor=F) 2-sample test for equality of proportions without continuity correction data: c(325, 278) out of c(501, 489) X-squared = 6.6843, df = 1, p-value = 0.009727 alternative hypothesis: two.sided 95 percent confidence interval: 0.0195785 0.1408124 sample estimates: prop 1 prop 2 0.6487026 0.5685072 The P-value about 0.01 indicates that significance at the 1% level (thus surely at the 5% level). That is, $H_0$ is rejected. I'm not sure I understand what data you have for the second situation. If you have 20 questions on a 7-point Likert and John has 19 responses 5 and below and one 7, it is obvious that the 7 is higher than the rest, but I'm not sure what statistical significance means in this situation. Do several other respondents have similar 'unusual' scores? If so, is the same question typically rated higher? It's unclear how much higher catches your attention; whether we are talking about John alone or in comparison with other subjects; whether this particular question was of interest from the start or we noticed it after the survey. Maybe descriptive methods are best here. Consider the boxplot for John's (hypothetical) questionnaire: j = c(1,3,2,4, 4,3,2.2, 7,4,5,1, 4,4,3,3, 3,5,4,2) boxplot(j, horizontal=T)
