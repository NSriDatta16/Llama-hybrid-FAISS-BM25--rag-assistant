A single repository in Subversion is the largest unit of storage that is managed within Subversion itself. Separate repositories are just different directories, each containing one repository. If you already have a script to back up a single repository, then you can set up that script to take the repository name/path as a parameter. Then, you could write a script like: #!/bin/sh for repo in /home/repositories/*; do backup-single-repository $repo done
