Yes it is legit to compute a moving average on a stationary series , and it can be convenient too, for the most various reasons. Stationarity in itself means the process has an unconditional constant expected value, but a stationary process can still have different expected values for different time points, conditioned to the previous values . For instance a process can have a tendency of giving new observations that are close in value to the previous ones, and still be stationary as long as these values tend to go back to the unconditional mean over time. This answer wouldn't be complete without citing the notorious MA models, which make a weighted moving average of the process in order to make a forecast of new observations. I'm bringing them up because estimating MA weights requires stationarity.
