Grails is directly analogous to Ruby on Rails , but running with Groovy. What's Groovy ? It's a scripting language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). So you can make use of Java libraries that you already have or are available (since they're compiled to bytecode and thus run on a JVM), plus the power of the JVM (for garbage collection, speed via JIT compilation etc.) and the conciseness of Groovy. The learning curve for a Java programmer to pick up Groovy is supposed to be pretty small (thus leveraging off the huge number of available Java programmers). It's a very different way of creating web apps to the standard Java mechanisms of servlet programming, JSPs, Java Server Faces etc. Grails (like Ruby on Rails) promises a more dynamic and iterative development environment than the standard development mechanisms (whether that's true in practise , I can't advise)
