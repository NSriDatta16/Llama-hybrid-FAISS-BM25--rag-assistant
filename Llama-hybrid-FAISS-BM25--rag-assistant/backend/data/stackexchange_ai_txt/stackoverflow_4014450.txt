You can just use if or case statements, like this: SELECT SUM(if(project = 5 AND AnimealID LIKE 'AVD%', 1, 0)) AS countbyproj, TO_DAYS(s.VisitDate) AS day, DATE_FORMAT(s.VisitDate, '%b %d %Y') AS date, s.origin, SUM(if(ca.organism = 2, 1, 0)) AS countGoats, SUM(if(ca.organism = 2 AND ca.sex = 'Female', 1, 0)) AS countGF, SUM(if(ca.organism = 3 AND ca.sex = 'Female', 1, 0)) AS countSF FROM samples s JOIN custom_animals ca ON s.AnimalID = ca.animal_id GROUP BY TO_DAYS(a.VisitDate); I can't check query, I don't know what result you're expected and which tables/relations you have, so this is only example with idea. If you need count unque AnimealID's for each day: SELECT SUM(byproj) AS countbyproj, day, date, origin, SUM(Goats) AS countGoats, SUM(GF) AS countGF, SUM(SF) AS countSF FROM ( SELECT s.AnimealID, if(project = 5 AND AnimealID LIKE 'AVD%', 1, 0) AS byproj, TO_DAYS(s.VisitDate) AS day, DATE_FORMAT(s.VisitDate, '%b %d %Y') AS date, s.origin, if(ca.organism = 2, 1, 0)) AS Goats, if(ca.organism = 2 AND ca.sex = 'Female', 1, 0) AS GF, if(ca.organism = 3 AND ca.sex = 'Female', 1, 0) AS SF FROM samples s JOIN custom_animals ca ON s.AnimalID = ca.animal_id ) dataset GROUP BY dataset.day, dataset.AnimealID;
