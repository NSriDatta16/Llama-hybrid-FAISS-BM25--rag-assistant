A specific example - Most-Talked-About Tracker Combine Last.FM, Google News Feeds, Twitter and Google Chart to find out which bands people are talking about, assign scores and show trends. You can compare the media and social coverage to the sales/play data for their music to see if you can predict a one-hit wonder or a lasting band. If you can, you could add in some text analysis to see if the stuff people are saying is positive or negative. 750words.com has some interesting metrics on it, but I've no idea how it's actually done.
