In the databases I'm aware of, a NULL value doesn't consume any more space than a non-NULL one, it still has to allow for a maximum size. However, the fact that a column is NULLable may consume extra storage. That's because, in addition to the possible values, you also have to store the fact that the column is NULL or not for each row. However, that's pretty efficient in terms of storage. For a NULLable column, the extra time taken for a query would be minuscule at most. You should not really care whether it takes more time. The design of a database is driven by the requirements of the data, not how fast it runs. I don't mean you should ignore performance altogether but, if your column needs to store NULL values, then it needs to, regardless of the performance hit.
