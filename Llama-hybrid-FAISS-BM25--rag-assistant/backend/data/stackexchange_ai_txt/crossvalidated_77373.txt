A natural tool is the CDF, because by definition its range is 0 to 1. By multiplying a CDF by 30, you get your desired range. In logistic regression, the linear predictor is transformed to a probability using just that (the logistic CDF to be precise). I'm going to give you some R-code that will let you fit a linear regression and then transform it to a [0, 30] scale using a logistic CDF multiplied by 30. The predictions are nice, but unfortunately the coefficients are a bit more difficult to interpret. set.seed(123) x
