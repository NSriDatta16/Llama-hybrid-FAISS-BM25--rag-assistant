Data models in php

I'm sort of experimenting with very obscure data models in php. For example, if I have a table called "model_attributes" in an SQL database. This is a list of all the available attributes for the model I'm working on. Now, I want the model, and other models to be able to derive functions from this list to pull data out of an array, after the data has been loaded into the array from the constructor. Here is an example in pseudo-code: for each attributes as attribute create new function ( getAttributeName ) and getAttributeName() would return $this->_model_data['attribute_name'] First off, is this good practice? It seems organized, but at the same time seems kind of dirty. Maybe someone could give me some other suggestions as to how to handle large data models in php. Also, if anyone has done something like this, how could I handle this in phpDocs?
