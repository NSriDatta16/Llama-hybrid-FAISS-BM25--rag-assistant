LIBSVM "Warning: using -h 0 may be faster"

I am using LIBSVM package (Matlab version) in order to perform wind power forecasting. My training dataset is quite big, approx. 52000 values of 4 parameters. The code seems to run correctly but is quite slow and I get the following message: WARNING: using -h 0 may be faster What does that mean and what do I have to change in my code?
