Deep Learning approaches for Record Linkage

Record linkage (RL) is the task of finding records in a data set that refer to the same entity across different data sources (e.g., data files, books, websites, and databases). Record linkage is necessary when joining data sets based on entities that may or may not share a common identifier (e.g., database key, URI, National identification number), which may be due to differences in record shape, storage location, or curator style or preference. (Source Wikipedia) There are several approaches to solving a record linkage problem , deterministic, probabilistic , machine learning approaches etc. I am looking for deep learning approaches for solving record linkage use cases. Could find below work on "Entity Resolution Using Convolutional Neural Network" https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050916324796 Please share thoughts on how to solve a record linkage problem using deep learning.
