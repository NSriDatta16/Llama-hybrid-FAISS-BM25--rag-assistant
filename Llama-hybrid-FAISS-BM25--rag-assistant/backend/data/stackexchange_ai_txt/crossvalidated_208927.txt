First off, 95%-5% is NOT an example of imbalanced dataset, I would consider downsampling if there was something of the order of 99.9%-0.1%. Most approaches should work just fine. Edit: Seems like this answer has this covered already, have a look here: https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/133385/41367 ; Now, if you have to rebalance, here are some options: Weight the infrequent class Stratified Sampling to downsize the frequent class Balanced subsampling to create multiple random balanced subsamples, then bootstrapping, ensembling (eg. Random Forests) etc. From what I interpret, 3rd point should address your question about undersampling within the algorithm.
