Volatility forecasting in presence vs. absence of ARCH effects

Suppose I have a time series $x_t$ with no autocorrelation (consider for example log return of stock prices). If $x_t^2$ is autocorrelated, we can model the series with a GARCH model and provide a good forecast of the future volatility. But what if $x_t^2$ is not autocorrelated? What can we say on the obtained volatility prediction? Does it mean that the predicted volatility is completely random or that the volatility is simply the mean of the historical volatility? Is the volatility forecast better in absence or in presence of autocorrelation in $x_t^2$? EDIT: My impression is that short time forecast is more reliable in presence of autocorrelation in $x_t^2$, while long term forecast is more reliable in absence of it.
