parameter injection into dynamically created UserControls without specialization

What I would like to know is if there is a technique to inject parameters into the rendering HttpContext such that it would be available to the UserControl when its page life-cycle events (Page_Init, Page_Load) are called during rendering (during HttpContext.Current.Server.Execute() )? Such a technique would allow injecting data into any UserControl (say via a call to a remote service) without having to specialize it for dynamic rendering. It would load the same way as if it was a static control on an ASPX page. Start with this base code fragment: Page page = new Page(); UserControl ctl = (UserControl)page.LoadControl(controlSpec); page.Controls.Add(ctl); // want to inject data into the control at this point StringWriter writer = new StringWriter(); HttpContext.Current.Server.Execute(page, writer, true); String renderedContent = writer.ToString(); return renderedContent; I've seen the @ScottGu ViewManager example where he adds a Data member to each of his UserControls and uses reflection to inject a data source into that member before the control is rendered into HTML. I've also seen Stefan Sedich's take on the @ScottGu example where he derives a generic ViewManager which allows the same thing but avoids the need for reflection. For example, I would like to be able to add a parameter to the Request object or to the QueryString in the HttpContext before rendering the UserControl .
