Environmental risk assessment based on sample number and concentrations of a toxic element

Happy New Year '14 everyone. I'm seeking a formal solution to a simple problem. I'm working with a database of a toxic element in different regions. I want to prioritize regions where immediate action should be taken based on my soil data (mean concentration of the toxic element in a region and the fraction of soil samples contaminated in that particular region). The idea is to put more weight on the fraction of soil samples contaminated. But I'm not sure if there's a nice way for quantifying the risk associated with such observations. For instance: #region 01 #toxic element concentrations in 5 soil samples #these observations have concentration unit (e.g. ppm, ppb, etc.) t1 m1 [1] 0.04 #fraction of contaminated soil samples in region 1 (we assume that, #anything above 0.025 unit is dangerous for organisms f1 0.025))/length(t1)) ##no unit since fraction > f1 [1] 0.8 #region 02 t2 m2 [1] 0.11 f2 0.025))/length(t2)) > f2 [1] 0.6 The above observations in two different regions clearly demonstrate that there's no relation between fraction of soil samples contaminated and the mean concentrations; i.e. a region can have a large number of samples that are contaminated (or not contaminated) with a low (or high) mean concentration of the toxic element. A real STUPID way of prioritizing zones based on the provided data might be just adding fraction and mean: #region 01 > m1+f1 [1] 0.84 #region 02 > m2+f2 [1] 0.71 This means that action should be taken in region 01 before region 02. But this solution is unacceptable in a global scale because I'm adding concentrations to the fraction which are unlike. If the concentrations were big numbers (say, 100 times the values shown above for another toxic element) and the safe threshold were 2.5 unit concentrations, the fraction remains same (0.8 and 0.6), but prioritized zones are flipped since region 2 ($11+0.6=11.6$) $>$ region 1 ($4+0.8=4.8$)! In other words, normalizing the toxic element concentrations to a fraction level is needed (if I want to put more weight on the fraction part), but I'm sure there's a statistically elegant way to deal with this. Is there any plausible relative probability distribution technique? Any package in R dealing with relevant problems?
