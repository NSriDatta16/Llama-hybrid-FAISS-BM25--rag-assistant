Find posterior distribution for uniform distribution

Given X with uniform distribution in the interval [μ,μ+θ]. Suppose θ is given. Find the posterior distribution with prior distribution on your own. From that, find the Bayesian estimator with quadratic loss function. If θ is not given, how to find μ. Actually, this is a tough question in my last exam and I don't know how to approach it. I have read some papers and I solved it based on what I got. My solution: And I don’t know how to proceed. Is it correct with this approach? Please give me some explanations. Thank you very much.
