How does caret handle factors?

I have been testing conditional trees and random forests with caret, and I've noticed it does something weird with factors. So, for example, a ctree using the base dataset chickwts : # Via 'party' ctreeNC = ctree(weight ~ feed, data=chickwts) plot(ctreeNC, type="simple") # Via 'caret' ctreeCARET And with random forest: # Via 'randomForest' rfNOCARET importance(rfNOCARET) IncNodePurity feed 242589 # Via 'caret' rfCARET varImp(rfCARET) IncNodePurity feedhorsebean 120992.97 feedlinseed 50673.75 feedmeatmeal 15688.51 feedsoybean 32652.89 feedsunflower 23308.30 I read that train only accepted numerical values (in 2008), but I'm not sure if this has changed by now. Any insights?
