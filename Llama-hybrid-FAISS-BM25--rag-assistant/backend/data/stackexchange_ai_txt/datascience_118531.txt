One idea is to compute first differences in each time series (the change in one measurement to the next in one series). Then, at each time step, compare the difference of series 1 and to that of series 2. (For example by subtraction.) This method would tell you when something different happened at one location (for example a fire) even if the temperature of the two places was very different to begin with (one sensor in Antarctica and the other at the equator).
