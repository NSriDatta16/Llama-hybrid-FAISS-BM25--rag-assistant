What do you need to document? The design? You can use sandcastle to generate a code file from the XML comments in your source code. Providing a detailed description of design choices and architecture can't be automated and requires time to document. Provide workflows where necessary to explain processes. You might want to split this document into high level design and detailed design, providing an overview of functionality and then a detailed description of the design. Don't replicate or explain the actual code per se (i.e. "using an integer counter, loop through..."), that's what the source is for. The application usage? Again, this is something that you will need to spend timing writing. Hopefully you already have a functional specification and use cases for the application and can leverage these to write a user document.
