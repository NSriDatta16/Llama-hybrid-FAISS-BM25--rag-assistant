I don't know ragel, but the code of RecordDigit is very similar to C, so here's what it does. as you suspected, p is a pointer; *p looks at a character of a character array (string). subtracting '0' from the character '9' leaves the numeric value 9. as you noticed, multiplying by 10 makes no sense the first time this is called, but as successive digits are translated it makes a lot of sense, as now the digits '321' become the number 321, multiplying by 10 after each invocation of RecordDigit to shift the number over by a decimal point. I don't yet grok "number".
