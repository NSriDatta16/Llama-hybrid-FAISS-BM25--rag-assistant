I have always found the Wikipedia article on sensitivity and specificity to quite well summarize the various measures. The formula for concordance you mention above is the same that the Wikipedia article calls accuracy. This is not the same as concordance, which also goes with names c-statistic or area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Concordance is also different from specificity. Your formula for the specificity seems to be correct, but the formula for concordance is not. The difference between accuracy and AUC is that accuracy is measured at a certain cut-off point that was used for dicotomizing the probability distribution given by logistic model whereas AUC measures overall accuracy over a range of cutoff points, so to say. There's a well written article on concordance in Austin, P. C. and Steyerberg, E. W. (2012). Interpreting the concordance statistic of a logistic regression model: relation to the variance and odds ratio of a continuous explanatory variable. BMC Medical Research Methodology , 12(82):1â€“8. . The second paragraph of the Background gives several definitions for concordance. There's also some information specifically on the SAS implementation and how to invoke the ROC curve and to produce an AUC value in SAS.
