The main difference to the Factory Method Pattern is the ConcreteCreator (compare the diagram in the upper right corner), which is a simple class in your case. In the "real pattern" the factory class is abstract with an abstract factory class. So, there is one more abstraction level. However, for many use cases, your Simple Factory is enough.
