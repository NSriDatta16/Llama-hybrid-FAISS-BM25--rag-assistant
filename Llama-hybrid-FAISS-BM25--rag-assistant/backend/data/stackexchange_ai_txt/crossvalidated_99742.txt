How to analyze interdependent interaction terms of lmer model

Assume I test a number of patients repeatedly over time to see how a certain treatment changes their skin conductance in response to a certain colour ( cond ) after 2 months, 4 months, ... etc. I test the skin conductance on the palm, wrist or arm simultaneously to see whether the place matters. I have a longitudinal dataset of the form: SC = skin conductance: dependent variable (metric) time = fixed factor with 6 levels (time1, time2, ..., time6) for each measurement in time place = fixed factor with 3 levels (place A, place B, place C) cond = fixed factor with 2 levels (cond1=blue, cond2=red) ID = random factor with subject ID (because not each subject could be tested at each time point) I put the data into the following form: data$time and do some model comparison: model_1 leave three-way # interaction out and continue with model_2 # remove two-way interactions: model_3 In the end I end up with the final model being sc ~ time + cond + place + time:cond + cond:place + (1|ID), data) Here are my questions: How can I look into the interaction terms? If e.g. place would have been dropped from the model altogether, looking at the following post hoc test would take the average over the factor place , right? posthoc_test Because, however, the factor place is still in the model, the above post hoc test is applied only to the baseline level of place , i.e. placeA What if I want to see how time and cond interact, regardless of place ? Is this even possible given that place is itself "captured" in the interaction cond:place ? How do I report the significant interactions? Is the p-value I get from the model selection procedure (i.e., p=0.003 for time:cond ) also the one I can later report for time:cond ? P.S. By now I'm almost convinced that the answer to question 2 is, that the values I get from the model comparison are the ones I can report for time:cond in general. In short: it doesn't matter that I got the values from a model comparison instead of getting them from a preformulated ANOVA. Please correct me if I'm wrong!
