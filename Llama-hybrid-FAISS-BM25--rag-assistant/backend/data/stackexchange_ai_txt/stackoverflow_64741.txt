While I am sure there are other ways to solve your issue, is there a specific reason that you want to communicate with .net via web services? One very clean solution is to use something like WebOrb ( http://www.themidnightcoders.com/weborb/dotnet/ ) They have community as well as commercial offerings and handle the issues you are describing quite elegantly. -mw
