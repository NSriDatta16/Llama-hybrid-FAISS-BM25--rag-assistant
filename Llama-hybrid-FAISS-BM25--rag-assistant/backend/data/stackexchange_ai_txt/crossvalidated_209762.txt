Problem with replicating a paper

I'm having some trouble at replicating this paper (text here: http://www.michiganjb.org/issues/52/text52c.pdf ) The paper wants to assess the economic impact of the Olympic games in the long run . The author has a big dataset cointaing data on GDPpc for host and runner-up countries from 10 years before to 10 years after the Games. Data are from page 88 for host countries and from page 89 for runner-up countries. Regressions and variables are explained in page 73. I'm just interested in regression (1) and (2a). The problem is that I can't get the author strategy. In the paper, it looks like the author is using a simple OLS regression, but since he collected data on different countries across 21 years shouldn't he using a panel data regression? If I run an OLS i get similar (but not identical result), while with FE or RE I get totally different results. Which technique would you use in such a case? Paper: Mehrotra A. To host or not to host? A comparison study on the long-run impact of the Olympic Games. Michigan Journal of Business. 2012;4 (2) :61-92.
