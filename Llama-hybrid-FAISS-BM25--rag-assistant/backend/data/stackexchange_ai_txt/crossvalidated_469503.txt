Why does the BERT NSP head linear layer have two outputs?

Here's the code in question: class BertOnlyNSPHead(nn.Module): def __init__(self, config): super().__init__() self.seq_relationship = nn.Linear(config.hidden_size, 2) def forward(self, pooled_output): seq_relationship_score = self.seq_relationship(pooled_output) return seq_relationship_score I think it was just ranking how likely one sentence would follow another? Wouldn't it be one score?
