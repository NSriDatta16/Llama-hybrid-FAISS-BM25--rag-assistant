Dynamically added Draggable won't drag

I am adding a draggable DIV dynamically but when I click and hold on it to drag it, it will not drag. I am adding it like so: $("#leftPersonalContent").append(leftSlotContent); $("#" + firstID).addClass("ui-draggable"); where leftSlotContent is of the form .... and firstID is "puzzlePiece_left_2". After the element has been added I used Inspect Element (in Chrome) to see the actual code generated and it looks like this: .... Why would it not drag?
