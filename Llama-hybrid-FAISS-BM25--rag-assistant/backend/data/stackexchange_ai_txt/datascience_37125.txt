How to find coreset of a given dataset in python?

I am trying to implement the core-means algorithm, which is basically k-means using coreset. I have searched up and down but could not find any libraries or modules which could help me with this. The paper I am following talks about building a coreset using grids, something like a quadtree where you keep dividing the point space in 4 equal parts to find heavy points which makes a coreset. Any help would be greatly appreciated in getting me started as to how should I go about implementing this and if there are any libraries/modules available to help me do so. PS: I'm new to python and machine learning and Hi StackExchange!
