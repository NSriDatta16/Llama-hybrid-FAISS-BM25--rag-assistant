I think you're underestimating what it means for a DOM element to be unique . It's not only the class, tag name or index within the current parent element that identifies a DOM element. Each DOM element internally has a unique identifier, which is not accessible to you. It's used by the browser to organize the DOM internally. There can be hundreds of seemingly identical elements in your page, each single one has a unique internal identifier. If you compare one DOM element to another, the browser will always be able to tell whether it's the same element or one that just looks like it. this refers to one specific DOM element, therefore jQuery is able to filter it out of a collection of seemingly similar elements.
