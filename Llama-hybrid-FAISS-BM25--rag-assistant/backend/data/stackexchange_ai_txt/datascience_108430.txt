The problem is might not be well solved by machine learning. One of the primary goals of machine learning is to generalize to unseen data. It is unclear what generalization would be in this context. It might be more useful to frame the problem as an optimization problem - find the best solution to the observed data and constraints. In particular, the problem is very similar to bin packing .
