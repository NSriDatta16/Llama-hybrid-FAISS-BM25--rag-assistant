Durations of tasks -- how to generate gantt-like chart from CSV

I have this CSV data: Task,From,To,Duration Task 1, 2011-02-20 12:30.12, 2011-02-20 12:32.33, 3422 Task 2, 2011-02-17 15:39.32, 2011-02-18 9:05.23, 345 Task 3, 2011-02-15 09:02.09, 2011-02-18 9:05.24, 3453455 And I would like to generate something like a gantt chart showing when task has started and ended with seconds granularity. Is there any tool of Excel template which can do this job easily? I dont want to set up gantt charts in excel every time I paste data. Just to load CSV into some app. and see. :) Thank you Martin
