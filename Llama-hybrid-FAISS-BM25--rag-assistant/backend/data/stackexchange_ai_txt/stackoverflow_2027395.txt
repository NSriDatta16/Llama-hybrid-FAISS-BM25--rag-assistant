I was once given the task of drawing all sorts of complex and overlapping shapes that needed anti-aliasing. My solution was to draw everything to memory at a higher resolution (2x? 3x?) than the image that needed to be displayed. Then as a last step convert the high res image to low res by averaging the R,G and B separately for each of the multiple pixels in the high res version that would be reduced to a single pixel in the display image. It may not be the most efficient way of doing things, but its dead easy to code and the visual effect was excellent.
