your function has it calling the second line immediately after the first. I imagine it is turning orange instantly, rather that a one second highlight that you want. You need to make the second line a callback to your first. Might look something like this (not sure what the correct effect() overload parameters are): function turnOrangeOnWarning(t) { myparagraph.text(t).effect("highlight", {'color':'orange'}, 1000, function() { myparagraph.css("background-color", "orange"); } ); }
