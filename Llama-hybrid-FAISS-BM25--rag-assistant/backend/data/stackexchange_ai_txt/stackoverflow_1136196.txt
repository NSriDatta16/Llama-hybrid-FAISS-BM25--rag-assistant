If you need to cut out testing, cut out integration or end-to-end testing. Misko Hevery at Google explains it really well here . "Unit Testing gives you more bang for your buck" is the best quote to come out of his article. Other than that, when you have decent code coverage and are handling a few edge cases of your code then its a good time to stop unit testing.
