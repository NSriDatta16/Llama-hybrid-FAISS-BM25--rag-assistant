Reasoning for failure to reject $H_0$

Following up on this question , I would like to make an intuitive explanation of why i'm failing to reject $H_0$ ie that all varieties of wheat have same effect on yield. So, here is a boxplot: And here is the model for it (without a global intercept): lm=lm(yield~0+factor(variety)+clay+I(rainfall-mean(rainfall))) Here is the summary for it: Call: lm(formula = yi ~ 0 + factor(va) + clay + I(ra - mean(ra))) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -3.4685 -1.1002 -0.0688 1.3723 3.2639 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) factor(va)A 13.44778 0.63204 21.277 My reasoning of why i'm failing to reject $H_0 : \mu_A=\mu_B=\mu_C=\mu_D$ So, by looking at the means and boxplot, they have the same yield averagely, and A has a bit higher average. But the fact that A has a slightly higher average doesn't justify the rejection of $H_0$ . Would this be right?
