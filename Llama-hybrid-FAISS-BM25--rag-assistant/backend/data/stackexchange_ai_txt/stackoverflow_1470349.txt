How to determine allocated blocks on an NTFS disk

Is there a way of determining which clusters on an NTFS disk are allocated? I'm thinking along the lines of the display you see on a defrag program before you kick off the defrag itself. I guess you could parse the MFT but it strikes me that this could take a long time on a system with potentially hundreds of thousands of files. Thanks
