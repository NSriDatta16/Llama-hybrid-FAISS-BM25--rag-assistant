Okay, there are a lot of people here saying, "yes" and "yes, but it will be hard" so I'll differ. No. The problem isn't "learning Java" in 10 weeks, because I think that by the time 10 weeks is up, you'll be able to program some things and have an idea of what to do to solve some simple things. But that won't make you ready for a J2ME fast track course. Fast track courses tend to be for people that have a strong background in the prerequisites. You might be able to do many of the things as you are going along, but without the background to understand the why of what you're doing, it will seem like a lot of semi-random things to memorize by rote, and will likely quickly vanish. Basically, I think it just takes time: time to let lessons sink in, time to experiment and fail a few times so that the why suddenly jumps out at you... Ultimately, I suspect that you could get through it, but that you would not end up being very proficent at all. (the final two paragraphs of Uri's post say it all.) I don't want to be a complete downer, and I definitely hope you do well and succeed...but I would hate to bet money on it. (Understand, I don't know you from Adam...so I'm making statements based on my experience with how it was for me, and people I've worked with...so this isn't a slight against you...just an observation that this is a very big meal you're setting down to eat.)
