For forecasts $\hat{y}_1, \dots, \hat{y}_N$ and corresponding actuals $y_1, \dots, y_N >0$, the MAPE is defined as $$\text{MAPE} := \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N\frac{|\hat{y}_i-y_i|}{y_i}.$$ The MAPE is typically expressed as a percentage. The MAPE has some shortcomings that should be kept in mind. Variants on the MAPE ( Tashman & Green, 2009, Foresight ) include using the forecast instead of the actual in the denominator, or using the average of the forecast and the actual, yielding the so-called "symmetric MAPE" (sMAPE), which has a different kind of asymmetry (Goodwin & Lawton, 1999, IJF ) . Alternatives to the MAPE as a point forecast accuracy measure include the mase , the mae and the mse .
