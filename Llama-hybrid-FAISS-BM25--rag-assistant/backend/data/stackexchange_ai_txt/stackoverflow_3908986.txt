Just a guess, but if you have 'overflow:hidden' from the div#containment, when you drag the node, any part of it will be obscured by the parent div. (Even though it's outside the boundaries of the parent container, DOM-wise, it's still a child). Alternatively, you could move the child node outside of the parent div inside your dragstop listener.
