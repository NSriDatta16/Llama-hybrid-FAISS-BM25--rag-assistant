Unbiased Estimator for $EX_1EY_1$

Suppose you have a set of i.i.d. variables $X_1,...X_n$ and $Y_1, ..Y_n$. The correlation between $X_i$ and $Y_i$ is $0.5$ for $i = 1,...n$ and $0$ for $X_i$ and $Y_j$ for any $i \neq j$. Provide an unbiased estimator for $\phi = \textbf{E}X_1\textbf{E}Y_1 $. I started testing whether using sample mean give us an unbiased estimator but it does not. So far, since the covariance formula does have an instance of $EX_iEY_i$ I found that encouraging but not sure how to procede from there.
