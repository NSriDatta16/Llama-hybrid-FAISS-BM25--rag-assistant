The correlation to be avoided is the one between $\mu$ and the $\gamma_j$ and $\delta_k$. By replacing $\gamma_j$ and $\delta_k$ in the computational model with alternative parameters that center around $\mu$ the correlation is reduced. See for a very clear description section 25.1 'What is hierarchical centering?' in the (freely available) book 'MCMC estimation in MLwiN' by William J. Browne and others. http://www.bristol.ac.uk/cmm/software/mlwin/download/manuals.html
