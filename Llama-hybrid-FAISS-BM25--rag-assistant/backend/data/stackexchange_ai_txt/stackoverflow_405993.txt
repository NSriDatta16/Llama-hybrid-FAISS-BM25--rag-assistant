I did a bunch of digging to figure out if this was possible without embedding an Active-X control and it seems that you can't. There are various libraries out there that you can use from within your script to do this but the primary reason is this: Javascript runs in a sandbox environment which doesn't have access to the file system this is for security purposes. Likewise it therefore doesn't have access to OLE without use of an Active-X control designed for accessing that type of structure. I found a tutorial that demonstrates here: http://straxus.javadevelopersjournal.com/creating_a_mozillafirefox_drag_and_drop_file_upload_script_p.htm
