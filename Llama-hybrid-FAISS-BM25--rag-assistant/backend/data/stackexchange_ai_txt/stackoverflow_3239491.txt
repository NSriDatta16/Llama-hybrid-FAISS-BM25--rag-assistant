You can use html() and as long as you escape other characters that may be special in HTML. eg. function encodeHTML(s) { return s.replace(/&/g, '&amp;').replace(/ ')); You might also consider turning \n\n into a paragraph break. The other approach would be to continue using text() but set a white-space: pre-wrap style to keep the \n characters as line breaks Since IE prior to version 8 doesn't support this you would need a fallback style to set white-space: pre; word-wrap: break-word; for that browser. Other older and obscure browsers may also not support this.
