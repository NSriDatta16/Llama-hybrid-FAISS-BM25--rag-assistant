Compare averaged GLM with boosted regression trees using cross validation : d2 and RMSE calculation

I want to compare BRT and averaged glm models on test sets by calculating the explained deviance and RMSE. How can I calculate d2 and RMSE from predictions? I use the following functions: gbm1 GLM poisson glm1=glm(larve~chla+station+ vit+direct+lune+ temp,data=ahe2,family="poisson") dd=dredge(glm1,rank="QAICc",chat=c_hat(glm1)) models.list muminavg.quasi I split data: kfold1=createFolds(ahe2$larve, k = 10, list = T) After that, I will use predict() on the prediction set. I thought to calculate RMSE with the square root of the mean squared residuals. For deviance, and particularly for gbm1, I don’t know how to proceed (t(residuals(glm1))%*%residuals(glm1) ?). I also wanted to implement a averaged gam but don’t know to plot it.
