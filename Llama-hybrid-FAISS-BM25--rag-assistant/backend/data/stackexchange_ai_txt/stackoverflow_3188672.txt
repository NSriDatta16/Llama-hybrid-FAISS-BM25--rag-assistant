How to elegantly check if a number is within a range?

How can I do this elegantly with C#? For example, a number can be between 1 and 100. I know a simple if (x >= 1 && x would suffice; but with a lot of syntax sugar and new features constantly added to C#/.Net this question is about more idiomatic (one can all it elegance) ways to write that. Performance is not a concern, but please add performance note to solutions that are not O(1) as people may copy-paste the suggestions.
