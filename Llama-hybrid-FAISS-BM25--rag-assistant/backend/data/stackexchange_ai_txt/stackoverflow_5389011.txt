The xslt functions MathSubtract, MathAdd etc correspond to the predefined Functoids that your map uses (in the xmlns 'userCSharp'). Most of the functoids are just inline XSLT C# functions - BizTalk adds the C# script for the functoid at the bottom of the xslt when the map gets compiled. (I think some of the simple functoids can use xslt primitives as well). Your own script functoids will also be added to this block. You can see what BizTalk is doing by compiling your assembly containing the maps, and then using the "Show all Files" command to look at the corresponding .btm.cs file to see what has been added. BizBert site gives quite a good reference on the implementation of each of the functoids. (The double "" escaping is because the XSLT is kept in a string constant) private const string _strMap = @" and then a script CDATA block at the bottom ... etc
