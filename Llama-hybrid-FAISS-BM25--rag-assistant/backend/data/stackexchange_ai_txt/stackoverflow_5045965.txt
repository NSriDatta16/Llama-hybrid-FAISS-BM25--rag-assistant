Get MediaStore content Uri from File path?

I have an application that lists all videos in MediaStore. (I need both internal storage and external storage). Basically I have two cursors which query MediaStore.Video.Media.EXTERNAL_CONTENT_URI and MediaStore.Video.Media.INTERNAL_CONTENT_URI. Then I use a MergeCursor to merge these queries and display in a ListView with a CursorAdapter. The thing is that sometimes I want to delete one of the videos, but I need the "content Uri" for this operation because I don't have a way to determine the storage of the selected video. I have the full file path of the Video and the ID in MediaStore. How can I get the "content Uri" from the file path/Uri?
