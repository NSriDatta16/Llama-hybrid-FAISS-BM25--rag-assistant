It's probably failing because of the path you're using: fs = new FileInputStream(new File("/Users/paul/Desktop/CollegeTrack/Samp.xls")); I assume this points to a file on your computer somewhere, since it's got "Desktop" in the path. Your emulator is running an entirely separate OS (Android) and it has no concept of where this file is. In order to access it you'll need to either 1) Transfer the file to the emulator's storage or 2) Establish a shared network connection between the two. Think about it in terms of an actual phone: You can't point your phone to a file on your desktop. It's a self-contained independent device. The emulator is exactly like this, it just happens to be running on top of your computer's OS.
