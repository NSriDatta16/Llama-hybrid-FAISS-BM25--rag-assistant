Do not confuse a priori knowledge of the true parameter value with having a true prior over the parameter space The answer to this question depends on the underlying philosophical interpretation of probability that one takes within the Bayesian paradigm. The most popular (and in my view coherent) philosophical interpretation is the "epistemological interpretation" of probability. $^\dagger$ This philosophical approach takes "probability" to be a tool used to quantify our uncertainty about unknown things, subject to a set of coherence requirements (see Bernardo and Smith (1994) , Ch 2-3 for discussion). Broadly speaking, a probability measure arises as an effective tool for the quantification of uncertainty if we wish to measure uncertainty using real numbers (i.e., using a continuum as a measure of certainty) and we wish to avoid certain kinds of "incoherence". This approach was famously put forward in Ramsay (1931) and has been discussed at length by subsequent authors (see e.g., Kyburg 1978 , Kennedy and Chihara 1979 , Skyrms 1987 , Christensen 1991 , Skyrms 1992 , Zynda 1996 , Welch 2014 , Roche and Schippers 2014 ). These arguments typically require the user to quantify their uncertainty in a way that avoids "Dutch book" outcomes over possible bets on states, which is argued to be a type of incoherence of belief. Setting aside the particulars of the coherence argument, what is most important here is that probability is viewed as a tool created by humans to analyse the world, not an inherent part of the world itself. In particular, the epistemic interpretation does not assume that there is any metaphysical analogue to probability in nature (e.g., aleatory probabilities of events), and so it is compatible with both deterministic and non-deterministic views of nature. If you adopt the epistemic interpretation of probability as the foundation for Bayesian statistics then a "true" prior is simply one that properly represents your epistemic approach to uncertainty about a quantity at issue given the information you start with (i.e., prior to seeing the data that is the subject of the analysis). The prior is true if it properly represents your beliefs (subject to the stipulated coherence requirements) prior to seeing the data and it is false if it doesn't. Likewise, if you genuinely believe that the likelihood function in your analysis captures the nature of the observable data, then the posterior formed by updating your true prior belief will be true posterior. The posterior is true if it properly represents your beliefs (subject to the stipulated coherence requirements) after seeing the data and it is false if it doesn't. Within the epistemological paradigm, one must decide whether the true prior is elicited by genuine subjective beliefs (e.g., via subjective a priori views of break-even betting odds), or by some objective approach (e.g., reference priors), etc., to decide what constitutes a "true" representation of your beliefs; consideration of the relevant literature and methods should determine your beliefs as to how to view a priori uncertainty, so you will need to decide what approach you think properly encapsulates your "true" prior. Now, even though the "true" prior/posterior may be determined by the epistemic approach, in most circumstances a Bayesian will still believe that there is some true long-run behaviour that establishes the true parameter value in a model (see this related question ). This belief typically arises from an underlying belief in an infinite sequence of potential observations from the experiment under study, and the true parameters generally correspond to various limiting functions of the stipulated sequence. Thus, there will typically be a true (but unknown) parameter, a true prior, and a true posterior, and all of these will be different. You get yourself into trouble when you then say that the Bayesian approach completely includes the frequentist approach simply because you could take the prior distribution to be a point-mass distribution on a known point. Firstly, that would still not make Bayesian analysis equivalent to frequentist analysis (there are several other differences in these approaches), but more importantly, is that actually your true prior belief? If you are certain a priori that the parameter is equal to the stipulated value then that is indeed your true prior (and you might get into this situation ) but if you are not certain of that parameter value then that is not a true prior in the epistemological sense. $^\dagger$ This is often called the "subjective interpretation" which is a bad name for it, since it doesn't necessitate subjectivity of the prior.
