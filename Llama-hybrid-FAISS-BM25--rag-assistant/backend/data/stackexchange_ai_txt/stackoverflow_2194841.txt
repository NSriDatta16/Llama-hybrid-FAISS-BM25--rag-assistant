AFAIK, there is no built-in feature to serialize geospatial data to GML 2.x. You need to use some third-party tools, implement a writer youserlf or, this suggestion may sound a bit strange, use PostGIS for this transition. PostGIS is alternative geospatial database, similar solution to SQL Server, but implementing de-/serialization for both formats: GML 2 and GML 3 . What I'd suggest is to use PostGIS as an intermediate and translating storage. Store data to GML 3 using SQL Server functions Load data serialized to GML 3 using PostGIS function ST_GeomFromGML Store data from PostGIS to GML 2 format using ST_AsGML which allows you to specify target version of GML: text ST_AsGML(integer version, geometry g1); It may sound strange to propose another geospatial database, but I'm sure it would work fairly smoothly and well.
