I work with Perl exclusively for my day job and program C++ for fun on nights and weekends. They require totally different mind sets. You're better off approaching C++ as a noob programmer and learn it from 'Hello World' on up. Sure you can fast track over general concepts such data types, but still pay enough attention to know your short from your long and your reference from your pointer. I would avoid learning C first unless you really need to know C. Character handling in C is a pain and not suited for what I suspect you want to do. The String class in C++ is your friend: learn it, live it love it!
