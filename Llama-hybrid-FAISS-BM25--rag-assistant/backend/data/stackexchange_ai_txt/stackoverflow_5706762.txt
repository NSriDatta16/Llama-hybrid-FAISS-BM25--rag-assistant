Edit headers of MultiPartEntity

I'm making a XML + image post in my Android application with a MultiPartEntity and every thing is good except the server that I'm posting to requires me to set the Content-Type of the HTTP post to application/soap+xml; charset="utf-8" So how do I get to change it from this... POST / HTTP/1.1 Host: 192.168.0.193:1234 User-Agent: Apache-HttpClient/UNAVAILABLE (java 1.4) Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=XR43mUmjvTb58T7crHhgj83C84qmZO_9k0-s Content-Length: 28150 Connection: Keep-Alive --XR43mUmjvTb58T7crHhgj83C84qmZO_9k0-s ... to this POST / HTTP/1.1 Host: 192.168.0.193:1234 User-Agent: Apache-HttpClient/UNAVAILABLE (java 1.4) Content-Type: application/soap+xml; charset="utf-8" Content-Length: 28150 Connection: Keep-Alive --XR43mUmjvTb58T7crHhgj83C84qmZO_9k0-s ... This is probably not the correct way to post it but I have to, than it will work.
