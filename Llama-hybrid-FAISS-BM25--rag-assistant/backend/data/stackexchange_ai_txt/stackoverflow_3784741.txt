The C99 implementation of gcc is not yet completed, but fairly usably in everyday programmers life. I don't have the reference at hand, but for gcc there is a statement somewhere that they will switch to C99 (or merely to their dialect gnu99) the day that this implementation is considered to be terminated. The question of using C99 features or not, is divided in a pragmatic part: for which platforms I do have to compile my code what features would I gain (for my taste a lot of cleanness and ease to program portable) and an emotional / ideological part. For the later, there is no cure but the application of the dinosaur principle.
