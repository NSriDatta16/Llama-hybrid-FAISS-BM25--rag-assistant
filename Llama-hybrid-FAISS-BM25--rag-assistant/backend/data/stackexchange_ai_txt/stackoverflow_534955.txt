Best Database Change Control Methodologies

As a database architect, developer, and consultant, there are many questions that can be answered. One, though I was asked recently and still can't answer good, is... "What is one of, or some of, the best methods or techniques to keep database changes documented, organized, and yet able to roll out effectively either in a single-developer or multi-developer environment." This may involve stored procedures and other object scripts, but especially schemas - from documentation, to the new physical update scripts, to rollout, and then full-circle. There are applications to make this happen, but require schema hooks and overhead. I would rather like to know about techniques used without a lot of extra third-party involvement.
