Logistic Regression Variable Selection Multiple Variables

I have a large dataset with 4000 variables and 20000 observations. Most of the variables are a variety of moving averages since I am trying to create a predictive model. I'd like to use logistic regression with the best of these 4000 variables. I know this is an absurd amount and I am looking to trim it down to less than ten or so but am unsure of the best way to do it. I'm aware that using stepAIC or the like will take forever and I need something that can select variables based on the p value or any other criteria.
