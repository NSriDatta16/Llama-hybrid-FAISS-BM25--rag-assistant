You can use the "use constant" pragma, but constants defined that way aren't referenced like normal variables. They do get you the performance increase of having constants, though. If you're not looking for the compile-time optimizations of using a constant, your best approach is probably just using discipline when writing the code and not assigning to variables that shouldn't be assigned to. :)
