The HTML 5 spec has rules for serializing an HTML fragment when you call innerHTML on it, documented here: Serializing HTML fragments (note that innerHTML isn't in the HTML 4 spec, so the HTML 5 spec is the current reference). TLDR version of the spec: Spaces, angle brackets, ampersands, equals signs and double quotes are the only chars that get escaped when innerHTML is called.
