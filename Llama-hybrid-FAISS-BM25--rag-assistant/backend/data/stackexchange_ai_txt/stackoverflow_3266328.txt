Are you performing any kind of checks on the mail function? It should return true if it's executing successfully - knowing that would help us cut down on other possible reasons you may not be receiving the mail, such as filters, server or smtp configuration etc. Doing something like: if (mail($to, $subject, $body, $header)) { echo(" Message successfully sent! "); } else { echo(" Message delivery failed... "); } Should give you a better idea, and should die outright if the function does not exist for some reason. Php's mail function is incredibly finicky on free web hosts, since it's commonly abused for spam purposes. Posting full headers also can help legitimate messages pass spam tests. $headers = "Return-path: \n"; $headers .= "Reply-to: "."\n"; $headers .= "Content-Type: text/html; charset=windows-1252\n"; $headers .= "Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\n"; $headers .= "From: \n"; $headers .= "X-Priority: 3\n"; $headers .= "MIME-Version: 1.0\n"; $headers .= "Organization: My Organization\r\n"; $headers .= "\n\n";
