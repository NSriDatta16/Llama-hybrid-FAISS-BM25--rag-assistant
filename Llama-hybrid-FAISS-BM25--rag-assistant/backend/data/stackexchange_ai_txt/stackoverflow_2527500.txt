The myUser.class.php file is the session controller/storage, yes. You can create your own security module if you wish, but many use the plugins mentioned in nselikoff's answer . They're not perfect but they do a decent job. Whichever ORM use, you should definitely start with one of these plugins, and extend/improve them if you need too. Your admin generator modules are not secured by default, no - it is up to you to implement a security layer. As an aside, don't think of admin-generated modules as exclusively for a backend/backoffice purpose, as there may be some reason for a frontend app to require one. Certainly a system you use internally at your company or at home on a local webserver doesn't need a security layer to function. Changing the security.yml file to secure an app, module or action requires you to specify the login page in your app's settings.yml , but the security plugins will help you configure this.
