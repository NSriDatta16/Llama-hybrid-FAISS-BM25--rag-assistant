Some general information about android icons: There are built-in icons that android uses, which are in android.R.drawable and stored in the file system corresponding to that location. Google discouraged referencing these icons directly, instead asking you to store a local copy of them in case they change in future android versions. That and more information about making icons here: http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/ui_guidelines/icon_design.html You can also find free icon sets online, like here: http://androgeek.com/android-icon-packs-basics-and-a-list-of-free-icon-sets.html Other links: https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/master/core/res/res/drawable-hdpi http://androiddrawables.com/
