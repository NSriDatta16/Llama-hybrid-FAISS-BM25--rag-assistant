How can I indent a selected block of text in Eclipse 3.5.2?

I use TAB and Shift-Tab in Visual Studio to indent an entire selection. This does nothing in Eclipse, and I can't seem to find another way to do it. Update: I wasn't really paying all that much attention to this initially and did not ask the question correctly. I now realized that it is in XML files where TAB still does not indent a selection. I did not find a setting for this in the properties, so I assume it is not possible.
