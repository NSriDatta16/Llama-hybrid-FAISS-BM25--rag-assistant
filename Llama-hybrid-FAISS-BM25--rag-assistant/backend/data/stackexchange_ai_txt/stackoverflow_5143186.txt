A couple of ways to accomplish this. string text = "We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America."; string augmentedText = text.Replace("provide", " provide "); You could also use regular expressions to accomplish this. Here's a sample that converts each word to upper case: public static string MatchEval(Match m) { return m.ToString().ToUpper(); } static void Main(string[] args) { string text = "This is some sample text."; Console.WriteLine(text); string result = Regex.Replace(text, @"\w+", new MatchEvaluator(MatchEval)); Console.WriteLine(result); } Hope this helps...... Good luck!
