ASP.NET Custom Membership Provider - Add User to Roles

I'm trying to implement a custom membership provider in my asp.net web app. The problem is that whenever I call the "Roles.AddUserToRole" method it writes to the default membership db built in asp. The strange thing is that when I call the "Membership.CreateUser" method it writes to my custom membership tables. No sure whats going, any help would be much appreciated. Here a bit of my web.config if this will help: name="" type="System.Web.Security.SqlMembershipProvider" connectionStringName="" enablePasswordRetrieval="false" enablePasswordReset="true" requiresQuestionAndAnswer="false" applicationName="" requiresUniqueEmail="true" passwordFormat="Hashed"
