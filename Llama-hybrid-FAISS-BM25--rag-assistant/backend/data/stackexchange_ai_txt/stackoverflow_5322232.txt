Companies - over the long run - take the most profitable course of action when creating products, and using Javascript for appliances is not very profitable. Javascript does not intrinsically have the capability to interact with hardware on the level needed to control an appliance. Any attempt to use javascript for something like this would require a lower level language to already be on the system, and that lower level language would need a system to interpret javascript. This would require additional storage and computational power, not to mention that javascript itself would have to be heavily modified. It is more profitable to just use the lower level language directly (not to mention that it would have better performance). I am sure that if javascript were used for appliances, there would be a jQuery function called $('#rocket').takeOff() which we could all use to go to the moon in a cross-browser compatible manner.
