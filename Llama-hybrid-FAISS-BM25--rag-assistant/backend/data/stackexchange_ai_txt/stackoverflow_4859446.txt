Can't really say what is the most expensive, but I'm pretty certain it's not new (of course your constructor can be heavy, if it does a lot of things): The common code path for new Object() in HotSpot 1.4.2 and later is approximately 10 machine instructions (data provided by Sun; see Resources), whereas the best performing malloc implementations in C require on average between 60 and 100 instructions per call (Detlefs, et. al.; see Resources). And allocation performance is not a trivial component of overall performance -- benchmarks show that many real-world C and C++ programs, such as Perl and Ghostscript, spend 20 to 30 percent of their total execution time in malloc and free -- far more than the allocation and garbage collection overhead of a healthy Java application Taken from this article, note that it talks about JVM 1.4.2 (article was published in 2005). Here's another one from 2003, talking about some Java performance myths still circling. And newer JVM's should be considerably faster than the versions from back those days.
