Should I be passing ftpClient to enterDirs like fileList is passed to getSortedDirectories and then make my download requests? ... Is this the best approach? I do think that passing the client object explicitly as an argument is indeed the best approach -- mostly, it's spare and elegant. The main alternative would be to code a class and stash the client object into an instance variable, which seems a bit more cumbersome; to use a global variable for the purpose would, in my opinion, be the least desirable alternative (the fewer globals around, the better!-).
