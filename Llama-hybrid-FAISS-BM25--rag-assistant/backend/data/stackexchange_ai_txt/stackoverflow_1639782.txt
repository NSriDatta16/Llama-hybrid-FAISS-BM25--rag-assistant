Statistics update seems to be causing problems

Woke up this morning with a page that our cluster was down. It came back up right away. I found log error logs with entries about IO taking longer than 15 seconds. Our monitoring server had tried to ping the server and had a timeout error. I checked one of our monitoring tools to see what was going on at 4:30 in the morning. It seems to be statistics being updated on one of our large databases. The tool shows our disk being maxxed out. I see very high % busy times for one of the disks. Now sqlagent is progressing through every other database alphabetically doing the same thing. We do have auto update stats on - but I thought that happened on a as-needed basis. I don't have any statistics update jobs enabled right now(that I know of - and the job monitor doesn't show any running jobs), so I'm not really sure whats causing this. http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;195565 - confirms my thoughts on the as-needed nature of autostats. The same thing also happened last night around 6:30pm - on the same large database - a few select statsman from... statements. The disks are on a SAN and we're running the latest version of sql 2005.
