Here's a couple of quotes from this paper . The first: Under regularity conditions, the maximum likelihood estimators of $\theta$ are consistent and asymptotically normal, with covariance matrix equal to the inverse of the asymptotic Fisher information matrix (see Caines, 1988). Besides the technical conditions regarding the existence of derivatives and their continuity about the true parameter, regularity requires that the model is identifiable and the true parameter values do not lie on the boundary of the parameter space. Number two: Pagan (1980) has derived sufficient conditions for asymptotic identifiability in stationary models and sufficient conditions for consistency and asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood estimators in non stationary but asymptotically identifiable models. Strong consistency of the maximum likelihood estimator in the general case of a non compact parameter space is proved in Hannan and Deistler (1988). Recently, full asymptotic theory for maximum likelihood estimation of nonstationary state space models has been provided by Chang, Miller and Park (2009). Your model isn't identifiable. This issue came up on an earlier thread here .
