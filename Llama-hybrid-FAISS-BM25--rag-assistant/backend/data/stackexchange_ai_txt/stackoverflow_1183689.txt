The main problem is that you've got the [[Director sharedDirector] stopAnimation]; after the return kEventHandled; rather than before it. return exits the function as soon as it's called, so anything after it will never get reached. I don't have my mac in front of me to check the rest of your code, but it seems fine, so I'm guessing that's the main problem. If you're not even seeing the NSLog(@"Touches Began"); then you need to make sure that you're doing this in a CocosNode that extends Layer . Another useful thing(once you're seeing the touches) is the NSStringFromCGPoint function, which allows you to easily display and debug the values in a CGPoint , so you could do something like: NSLog(@"This layer was touched at %@", NSStringFromCGPoint(location));
