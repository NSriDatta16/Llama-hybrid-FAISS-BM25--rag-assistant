When people use data-driven modeling and machine learning interchangeably, they normally intend for them to mean the same thing. Simple definitions might be like this: Data-driven modeling: The process of using data to derive the functional form of a model or the parameters of an algorithm. Machine learning: The process of fitting parameters to data to minimize a cost function when the model is applied to the data. The "learning" part requires data. One example of a data-driven modeling that is not machine learning might be physics-based modeling. In some cases of physics-based modeling, the results of an underlying physics process is compared with data, but the error with the data does not update the model parameters. Therefore, the model is not machine learning. I don't think there are any machine learning models that are not data-driven. One other note: These phases have no real definitions, and many people define them for their own purposes. For example, see this IBM page
