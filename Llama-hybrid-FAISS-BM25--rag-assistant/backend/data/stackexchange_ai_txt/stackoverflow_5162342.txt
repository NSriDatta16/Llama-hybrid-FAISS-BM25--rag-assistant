Checking against a list using if else statment

I've gone through most of the related questions and none of them seem to give me the idea I need for my program. users = ["Block Harris", "Apple Mccoy", "Plays Terry", "Michael Strong", "Katie Blue"] nicknames = ["Block", "Apple", "Plays", "Michael", "Katie"] passwords = ["abc", "def", "ghi", "jkl", "mno"] levels = [5,2,1,4,3] security = 0 found_user = False username = "" while not username: username = input("Username: ") password = "" while not password: password = input("Password: ") for i in range(5): if username == users[i]: found_user = True if password == passwords[i]: security = levels[i] print("Welcome, ", nicknames[i]) break else: print("Sorry, you don't know the password.") if found_user == levels[0]: print("Security level 1: You have little privelages. Congratulations.") elif found_user == levels[1]: print("Security level 2: You have more than little privelages. Congratulations.") elif found_user == levels[2]: print("Security level 3: You have average privelages. Congratulations.") elif found_user == levels[3]: print("Security level 4: You have more than average privelages. Congratulations.") elif found_user == levels[4]: print("Security level 5: You have wizard privelages. Congratulations.") else: print("Apparently you don't exist.") data_network() What I am trying to do here is trying to test for the security level of each of these members or found users in the database and then printing an appropriate message based on their security level using the if-else statements below. I have no idea what the program is doing but it's not evaluating the found user according to their level in the list. For example, for the first person, the level in the list is 5 accordingly, but it prints message for "found user == level[2]".
