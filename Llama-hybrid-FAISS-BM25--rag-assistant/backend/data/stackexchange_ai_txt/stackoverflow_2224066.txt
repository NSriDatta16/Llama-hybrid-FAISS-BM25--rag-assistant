How to convert SSH keypairs generated using PuTTYgen (Windows) into key-pairs used by ssh-agent and Keychain (Linux)

I've generated key pairs using PuTTYgen and been logging in using Pageant, so that I have to enter my pass-phrase only once when my system boots. How do I achieve this in Linux? I've heard of keychain but I hear that it uses a different key pair format - I don't want to change my Windows keys and it would be nice if I could seamlessly connect in the same manner in both Windows and Linux.
