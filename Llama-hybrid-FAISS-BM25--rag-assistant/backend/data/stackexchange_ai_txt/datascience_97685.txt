For x -axis: No one can see 10K points on a single plot, therefore give the user the opportunity to display desired range How is it possible? For example, user DataRangeSlider from bokeh widgets For y -axis: if your largest and smallest values are intrinsic to your system and you want to display them as they are, use logarithmic scale if your largest and and small values are outliers, use robust moving values, for example medians if your largest and and small values are outliers and you want to avoid averaging, just restrict the y -axis to the values of interest
