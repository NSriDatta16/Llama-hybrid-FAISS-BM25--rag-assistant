Mixed Model logistic regression with lots of zero's

Imagine a cluster randomized trial with a binary outcome. Now let's say that the clusters aren't too large (e.g. 10 observations per cluster) and that in the control arm, the event is not so abundant (e.g. 10% - event is a positive thing). The natural approach of analyzing the resulting data - as I see it - would be a mixed model logistic regression. However, I notice in simulation that if there is a substantial amount of clusters with zero events, then the glmm warns for a singular fit (but still delivering estimates). These singular fits blow up the type I error when I simulate under H0 (when I discard the singular fits, simulated power and type I error is as expected). Info on the simulation: Assume $p_0$ and $p_1$ the proportions of positive outcomes in both arms Starting from an ICC of 0.05, calculate a between-cluster variance for $p_{0i}$ and $p_{1j}$ Choose a number of clusters and a number of within-cluster measurements Draw $p_{0/1i}$ for each cluster (0 or 1 depending on treatment-assignment) Simulate outcomes based on these $p_{0/1i}$ 's Analyze with mixed model logistic regression and see there are a lot of convergence issues when chosing $p_0$ rather small, probably because there are too many clusters with zero positive outcomes, which doesn't work very well with the log-link. The problem is that these cases clearly blow up the type I error. Filtering them out, produces the expected power/type I error (dependent on the chosen $p_0$ and $p_1$ ) - leaving them in, increases the proportion of significant results. So my question: which alternatives for GLMM to consider to analyse a cluster randomized trial when a decent amount of clusters is expected to contain zeros?
