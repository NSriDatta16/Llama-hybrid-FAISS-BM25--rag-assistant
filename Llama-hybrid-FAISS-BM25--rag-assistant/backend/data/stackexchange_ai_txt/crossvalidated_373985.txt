Detecting a series of measurements

This is somewhat nonstandard: My input is a series of values (integers or reals), and my goal is to decide if this series is likely to be a series of measurements of some unknown phenomenon (be it an airplane's altitude, a room's temperature, a daily stock price, etc.). If not a series of measurements - this series can be anything. I have no clue how these values were generated or what do they represent (if anything at all). The only thing I do know is that these values are given in some 'natural' order (temporal, spatial or other). One test I considered: The average absolute difference between consecutive values is smaller than the average absolute difference between each 2nd element, 3rd element, etc. avg(abs((aₙ - aₙ₋₁)) I'll be happy to learn if there are known methods to tackle this problem. Alternatively - any idea would be appreciated.
