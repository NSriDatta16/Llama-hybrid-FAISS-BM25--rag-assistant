How much contentOffset changes in UIScrollview for zooming?

In UIScrollview, when I scroll/drag, I got changes in scrollview contentOffset which represent how much I had scrolled/dragged in the scrollview. By this way, I have updated the subview of scrollview for scrolling. But, when I zoom the scrollview (using pinch zooming), the contentOffsets of the scrollview is also changed. I do not understand how much contentOffset has changed because I can not relate the changes with zoomScale value. So, is there anyway to know changes in contentOffset for zooming? My intention is get the value of contentOffset changes for dragging while zooming (which is not I am getting because of zooming content offset changes) so that I can update my scrollview's subview accordingly. I am stuck in here. Any help will be very much appreciated. thanks Shaikot
