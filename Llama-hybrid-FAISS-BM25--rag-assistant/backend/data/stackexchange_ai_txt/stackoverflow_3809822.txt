magpie rss and remember the milk feed url

So, I'm working for the first time with embedding a RSS (or atom, but right now I'm trying to stick to rss) feed from my Remember the Milk account in my own website. (Eventually, there will be an at a glance dashboard style thing.) Now, like I said, this is pretty much my first time actually working with rss feeds. I've been using Magpie RSS, and whenever I give it a url to fetch, it errors out saying: Warning: MagpieRSS: fetch_rss called without a url in /magpierss/rss_fetch.inc on line 238 Warning: Invalid argument supplied for foreach() in dash.php on line 53 So, from this I conclude that my URL is wrong. However, this is the RSS feed url supplied by RTM, and which works just fine in my google reader. So, what am I screwing up? Edit: The php I'm using to call rss_fetch: channel['title'] . " "; echo " "; foreach ($rss->items as $item) { $href = $item['link']; $title = $item['title']; echo " $title "; ?> It's pretty much the example php from Magpie.
