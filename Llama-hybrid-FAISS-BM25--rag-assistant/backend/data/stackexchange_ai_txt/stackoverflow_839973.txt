how to get a client's MAC address from HttpServlet?

I was asked to write a servlet that collects client's details such as ip, mac address etc. getting his IP is pretty straight-forward ( request.getRemoteAddr() ) but I dont find an elegant way to get his MAC address. seems reasonable that the web server has access to data such as Mac address etc, since it gets the TCP packets and all. does this data registers somewhere? is it accessible? (I'm working on top of Tomcat6)
