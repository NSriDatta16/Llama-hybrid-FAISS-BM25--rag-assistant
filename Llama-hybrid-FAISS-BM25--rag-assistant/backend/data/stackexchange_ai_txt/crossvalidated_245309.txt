logistic regression assigning low probability score to actual 1 in dataset

I did logistic regression in r having 35,000 rows and 284 variables in dataset. After removing alias variables, vif and backward selection 25 variables remained on which logistic regression was performed using glm function of which 15 came significant. Dependent variable is binary( 1's & 0's) of which 30% is 1. The challenge is model assigning very low probability score to actual 1's in data set. The score for both 1's and 0's are almost overlapping. Ideally high score should be given to actual 1's. What could be the reason? please suggest.
