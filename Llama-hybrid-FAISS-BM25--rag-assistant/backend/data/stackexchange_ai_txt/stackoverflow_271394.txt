How can I generate random integers in a range in Smalltalk?

A class I am taking currently requires us to do all of our coding in smalltalk (it's a Design class). On one of our projects, I am looking to do some things, and am having a tough time finding how to do them. It seems that what most people do is modify their own version of smalltalk to do what they need it to do. I am not at liberty to do this, as this would cause an error on my prof's computer when he doesn't have the same built-in methods I do. Here's what I'm looking to do: Random Numbers. I need to create a random number between 1 and 1000. Right now I'm faking it by doing rand := Random new. rand := (rand nextValue) * 1000. rand := rand asInteger. This gives me a number between 0 and 1000. Is there a way to do this in one command? similar to Random between: 0 and: 1000 And/Or statements. This one bugs the living daylights out of me. I have tried several different configurations of (statement) and: (statement) ifTrue... (statement) and (statement) ifTrue... So I'm faking it with nested ifTrue statements: (statement) ifTrue:[ (statement) ifTrue:[... What is the correct way to do and/or and Random in smalltalk?
