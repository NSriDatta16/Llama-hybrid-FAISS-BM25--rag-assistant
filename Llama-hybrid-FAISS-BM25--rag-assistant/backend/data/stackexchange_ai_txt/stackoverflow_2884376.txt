The main problem I found is that control over the external information can only exist if there is allowScriptAccess in the html embed code of the , like this: and allowScriptAccess="always" In the tag. This is a bit late for me since I can't tell everyone who embeds my player to add those lines to their site, but from now on... Anyway, someone who wants to hide can easily just delete the lines. So I renamed the SWF file ... and now everyone who does the remote embed has to check back and get the new code. Here's the AS2 code that worked: function geturlhttp() { //urlPath = ExternalInterface.call("window.location.href.toString"); urlPath = ExternalInterface.call("eval","document.location.href"); //both work, try which one is bet } geturlhttp(); var lv:LoadVars = new LoadVars(); lv.var1 = urlPath; lv.var2 = title; //an internal variable, the name of the file lv.sendAndLoad("http://www.somesite.test/tracker.php",lv,"POST"); So the tracking only works on my own site, not the external remote embedding sites which come up empty or "null" in sql. And here's the PHP code I made with SQL. I've only made something for the insertion and I'm going to work on display and selection later...
