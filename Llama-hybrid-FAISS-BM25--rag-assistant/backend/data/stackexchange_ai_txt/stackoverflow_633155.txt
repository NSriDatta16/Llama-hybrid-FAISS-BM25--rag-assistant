Unless there is a specific performance benefit of storing the year and month seperately, I would stick with the date. Regarding indexing, if have you two columns, you will need to create an index on the combination of columns rather than one for the date column. The date will be converted internally into a long value so the storage space required is not really an issue. Additionally, think of the possible maintenance pain with two fields. You would have two db fields, possibly two fields on an object or the need to build/parse month and year to/from the db. Keep it simple with a date and let the DB keep track of your data integrity. I work with data like you described - expiration dates where day is always last day of the month so we only need month and year. We store these as a date.
