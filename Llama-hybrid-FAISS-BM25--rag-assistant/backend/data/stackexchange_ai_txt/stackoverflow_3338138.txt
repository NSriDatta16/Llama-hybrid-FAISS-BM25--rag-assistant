insert all $_POST data into mysql using PHP?

once again I have a question for the STACKOVERFLOW hivemind. Here's the deal, I'm trying to insert all of my $_POST data from a form into a mysql table. Before, I did: INSERT INTO forms (Place, Date, Find, username, who_sponsored, hours, comments, howdiditgo, studentleader_name, studentleader_email, description) VALUES ('$place', '$date','$where', '$username', '$who', '$hours', '$comments', '$how', '$description',)"); where all the $values were declared as $_POST['Place'], $_POST['Date'], etc. Now, every time I add a new part to the form (like another textarea or something), I want to just have to create a new column in mysql instead of adding another $_POST['foo']. Here's what I have tried doing: // In the previous form, I have set all input ids to "service[]", so all this data would be in a more specific array than just $POST. Turns out all the $_POST['service'] stuff is null... Here's an example: $forms = serialize($_POST['service']); var_dump($forms); mysql_query("INSERT INTO forms VALUES('$forms')") or die(mysql_error()); The error I keep receiving is: Column count doesn't match value count at row 1. I realize this means that I am trying to put too much data into the database, because there are not enough columns to fit the data. I've checked back and forth to see if I have it right (which, I think I do). For Reference, here's my code for both the form and mysql table: Place of Service Date of Service Where did you find this opportunity? What organization sponsored this opportunity? How many hours did you work? How did it go? Description of Service: Comments: Student Leader Name (If Applicable) Student Leader Email(If Applicable) Mysql Table: Place | Date | Find |form_id | who_sponsored | hours | comments | howdiditgo | description | studentleader_name | studentleader_email | username NOTE: I plan to sanitize my DB contents/$POST data as well, but for my purposes I left it out! If you have any questions feel free to ask and I'll post here with EDIT: tags :)
