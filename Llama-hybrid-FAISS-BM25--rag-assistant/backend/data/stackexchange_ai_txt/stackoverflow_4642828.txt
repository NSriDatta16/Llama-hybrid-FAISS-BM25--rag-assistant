How to get multiple years Y-axis data from a single file on the same plot?

I have gas meter readings over three years which I'm trying to graph in R, to highlight the changing daily usage over the months in a year, and to compare different years' usage. Data sample: Date,Gas 02/01/2010,4460.9 13/01/2010,4543 04/02/2010,4656 16/02/2010,4733 07/03/2010,4842 26/03/2010,4933.8 I can calculate the average daily usage from the periodic readings, and plot the whole of the data across several years as a single data series: A But I can't figure out how to get R to automatically split the data into different ?frames? for each year, so that I can plot separate lines for each year. I can manually create different input files with just the data for each year, but it's inelegant, and will need the code changed every year. I'm sure it's a simple question, but I've stared at manuals, and can't figure it out.
