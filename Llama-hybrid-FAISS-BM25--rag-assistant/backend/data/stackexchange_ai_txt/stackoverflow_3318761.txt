I don't think there really is a reliable way of detecting whether Flash made the request. Flash doesn't allow you to set the user-agent, and there are a lot of restrictions on what headers can be set. Take a look at http://help.adobe.com/en_US/AS3LCR/Flash_10.0/flash/net/URLRequestHeader.html as John Ballinger suggested, you could set your own header using this and look for that header in the PHP page.
