First, there is a standard factorization of probability that always holds: $$P(\sim A , \sim B , \sim C) = P(\sim A) P(\sim B | \sim A)P(\sim C | \sim B, \sim A) $$ Given the shape of the Bayesian network, we conclude that $C$ is independent of $A$ given $B$. That means: $P(\sim C | \sim B, \sim A) = P(\sim C | \sim B)$ Since we know $P(A) = 0.3$, we also know $P(\sim A) = 0.7$. Furthermore $P(\sim B | \sim A) = 1 - P(B | \sim A) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5$. Finally $P(\sim C | \sim B) = 1 - P(C | \sim B) = 1 - 0.1 = 0.9$ Putting it all together we get $$ P(\sim A , \sim B \sim C) = 0.7 \cdot 0.5 \cdot 0.9 = 0.315$$
