Random Forests and data transformations

I've started reading about Random Forests and one of the attributes that appeals to me is that they are good at dealing with independent variables that interact with one another. Does Random Forest also "automatically" transform variables into, for example, the square of the variable? Is there a good reason to square or perform other transformations of a variable (of course dependent on the situation)? For example if I have y = x1 + x2 + x3 is there anything to be gained by running the model y = x1 + x1^2 + x2 + x2^2 + x3 + x3^2 ?
