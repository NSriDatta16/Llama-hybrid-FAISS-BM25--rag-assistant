Generally, you want to store the data from your application in a database. For WPF and C#, that database is usually SQL Server or SQL Server Express, because Visual Studio 2008 easily integrates with those. Do not use XML for this. XML is not intended to be a large scale storage medium; the purpose of XML is to provide a common language for different computer systems to talk to each other. SQL Server Express is usable on any Windows PC; you just need to deploy the redistributable, using a named instance. See also http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd981032(SQL.100).aspx . If it's a small application and you want to go simpler, you can use SQL Server Compact Edition, or SQLite with the ADO.NET provider.
