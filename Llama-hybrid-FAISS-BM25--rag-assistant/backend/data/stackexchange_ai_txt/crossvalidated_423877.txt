Time series Count-data forecasting in R

I have sales data shows the number of units sold (so it is a count data). I am evaluating the following models: the lightgbm Count Time Series Following Generalised Linear Models (R tscount library) arima (R forecast library) Multiple Aggregation Prediction Algorithm (MAPA R library) What would be the advantages and pitfalls of these models? I would appreciate if you give me a piece of brief information on it. This is only one of the TS. the data is a collection of 5000 ts.
