How to have "My Cart" link outside of Top Links?

I've only been working on Magento for a few days but already it is so confusing. I'm starting to get my head around it but one problem is doing my head in at the moment. My client wants a shopping basket sort of function NEXT to the top links rather than a "My Cart" in the top links. Simply, all I want to do is move "My Cart" out of the top links and place it in the top right corner next to a hopping bag, but have no idea how to get this link in that position. For a visual example, the clients shopping basket is going to look similar to the one one Next's website. Thank you for any help you offer.
