This seems like a good use case for a Bayesian Bandit using Thompson Sampling. This will allow you to start with a 50-50 recommendation - something like: ABABABAB but eventually end up with AAAAABAAAAAB (mostly As) or BBBBBABBBBB (mostly Bs) based on a user liking one of them more than the other. You might also end up with ABABAABABABAB (blended) if the users like both. The approach assumes that you have access to feedback or ratings from your users in real time and have the ability to act on it Read it up - it is pretty simple to implement.
