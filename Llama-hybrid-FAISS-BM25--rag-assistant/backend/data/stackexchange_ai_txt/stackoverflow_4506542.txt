For the moment flash video is the container of choice for most video content on the internet. Saif is right. If you want those specific videos you'll need to convert them yourself. There are several decent flv to mp4 converters available for free (Miro comes to mind). SWF is takes a bit more work to extract the video content. Now if you are looking for Delphi content that's already available in MPEG 4 you can try http://edn.embarcadero.com/tv . The content from the most recent Coderage event is available as an mp4 download.
