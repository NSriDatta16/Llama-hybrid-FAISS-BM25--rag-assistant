I tried $(selectedContents).find('span') , but it resulted an empty set! As well as the filter , which too resulted empty set! However $(selectedContents).children('span') resulted what I wanted! Like patrick_dw said, probably jQuery does not work as expected with DocumentFragment! Thanks all, for your help.
