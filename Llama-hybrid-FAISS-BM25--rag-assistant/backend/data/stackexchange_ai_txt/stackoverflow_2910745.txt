I would imagine that you will need to work with images rather than PDF (or convert any PDF to an image first) Some options: 1) You could build a viewer that sends the screen size coordinates and a point on the image that requires viewing to return only the part of the image required. 2) Have a look the iPhone seadragon app (free). This uses Microsoft seadragon and Deepzoom technology that you could look at to service large images for zooming. more info on seadragon here: http://www.seadragon.com/
