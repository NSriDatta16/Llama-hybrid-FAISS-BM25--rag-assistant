As @MatthewDrury pointed out, params should be a named argument or put in the right position. The right objective is binary:logistic , not binary.logit : maximum_fitted_value2 Now, to make this question at least to have some statistical flavor: Due to the first or second problem mentioned above, xgboost uses the default reg:linear objective. This both explains predicted probabilities above 1 and the equality to binary.logitraw . Edit: Ctrl+K not working for code highlighting?
