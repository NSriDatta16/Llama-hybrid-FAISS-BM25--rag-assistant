Is this possible to develop some criteria based search on the Strings in C# or JAVA?

I have one List in C#.This String array contains elements of Paragraph that are read from the Ms-Word File.for example, list 0-> The picture above shows the main report which will be used for many of the markup samples in this chapter. There are several interesting elements in this sample document. First there rae the basic text elements, the primary building blocks for your document. Next up is the table at the bottom of the report which will be discussed in full, including the handy styling effects such as row-banding. Finally the image displayed in the header will be added to finalize the report. list 1->The picture above shows the main report which will be used for many of the markup samples in this chapter. There are several interesting elements in this sample document. First there rae the basic text elements, the primary building blocks for your document. Various other elements of WordprocessingML will also be handled. By moving the formatting information into styles a higher degree of re-use is made possible. The document will be marked using custom XML tags and the insertion of other advanced elements such as a table of contents is discussed. But before all the advanced features can be added, the base of the document needs to be built. Some thing like that. Now My search String is : The picture above shows the main report which will be used for many of the markup samples in this chapter. There are several interesting elements in this sample document. First there rae the basic text elements, the primary building blocks for your document. Next up is the table at the bottom of the report which will be discussed in full, including the handy styling effects such as row-banding. Before going over all the elements which make up the sample documents a basic document structure needs to be laid out. When you take a WordprocessingML document and use the Windows Explorer shell to rename the docx extension to zip you will find many different elements, especially in larger documents. I want to check my search String with that list elements. my criteria is "If each list element contains 85% match or exact match of search string then we want to retrieve that list elements. In our case, list 0 -> more satisfies my search string. list 1 -it also matches some text,but i think below not equal to my criteria... How i do this kind of criteria based search on String...? I have more confusion on my problem also Welcome your ideas and thoughts...
