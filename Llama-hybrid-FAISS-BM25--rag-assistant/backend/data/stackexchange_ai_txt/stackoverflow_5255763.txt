How can I use the Conditional OR to search emails with imap_search - PHP IMAP library

I need to use an OR statement in an imap_search() command. I found that a condition OR is not supported in this library. Imap_search Bug Report Link There has to be a way that I can search through the email using a conditional OR, how would I go about doing it? I'm not sure where I'd start. What I'd like to be able to do: $boxes = imap_search($connection,'SINCE "08-Mar-2011" AND (BODY "bobby" OR BODY "robert" OR BODY "bob"');
