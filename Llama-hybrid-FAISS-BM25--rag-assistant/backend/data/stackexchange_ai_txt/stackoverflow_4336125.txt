You might want to use Web SQL Database, but that's implemented only by Chrome, Safari, and Opera. If that is not a problem look here: http://www.html5rocks.com/tutorials/offline/storage/ By the way what do you mean with in local storage I have just one table ? You could use the local storage to hold different values, like so: localStorage['foo'] = "foo"; localStorage['bar'] = "bar"; localStorage['baz'] = "baz"; Values are strings, so you can also save say json or something else if you like.
