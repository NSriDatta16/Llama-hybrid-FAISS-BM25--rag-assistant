How to copy a XIB to another project?

Simple. I have two projects in Xcode. In one of them I made a .xib file and I want to copy it to another project, so as to save some time redoing it. I can't drag it to the other project, nor do copy/paste by command, nor copy/paste by the Edit menu. Any suggestions?
