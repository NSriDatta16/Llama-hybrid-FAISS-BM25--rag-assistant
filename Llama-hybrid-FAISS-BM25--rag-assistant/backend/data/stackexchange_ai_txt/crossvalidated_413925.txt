The answer will depend on what is your definition of regression, see Definition and delimitation of regression model . But a usual definition (or part of a definition) is that regression models conditional expectation . And a regression tree can indeed be seen as an estimator of conditional expectation. In the leaf nodes you predict the average of the sample observations reaching that leaf, and an arithmetical mean is an estimator of an expectation. The branching pattern in the tree represents the conditioning.
