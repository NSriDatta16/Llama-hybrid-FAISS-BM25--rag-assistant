given mean and standard deviation, find value of given percentile

I'm running a DnD campaign and made a Random NPC generator in Excel. It's pretty slick, but the random height/weight calculator is... flat. RAND(X,Y) flat. So I'd like to add some Bell Curve calculations, because why not. I've entered the average min/max heights and weights for each race, and can easily calculate the mean. Now, if I assume those average min/max values are 1 standard deviation, I've got the ingredients of a formula. (the average height listed for Human was pretty close to real life 1SD range for a human male) It's been... years... since I took a stats course, and I remember almost nothing. Bell Curve and SD is about it. I spent a few hours poking around, but didn't find any answers, or at least I don't think I did. X__X So, given a Mean, and ranges for 1SD, I'd like to enter a percentile (1d100) and arrive at a height. For example, a 16% would be -1SD, 50% would be exactly the median, and 85% would be +1SD (following the 68–95–99.7 rule). Hopefully that makes sense. Given the criteria above, could someone please explain what Excel formula to use? Preferably using a built-in one.
