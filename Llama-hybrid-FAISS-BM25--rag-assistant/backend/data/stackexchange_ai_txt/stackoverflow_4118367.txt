Having URL without .aspx extensionStrange behavior with Facebook Multi Friend Selector

I bought and implemented this from Vatlab: - http://demo.faceconn.net/InviteFriends.aspx If you go here and click "SKIP" button on the top right, it works: - http://www.leapup.com.au/invite.aspx On the other hand if you go here and click "SKIP", it throws an error page: - http://www.uniquevolve.com/Webform1.aspx There is not a lot of difference between the two except for the AppID, APIKey, Secret, AppName and AppCanvasUrl. So I'm inclined to think that Vatlab's code is buggy.. even he has no clue how to fix it. Do you know a good ASP .Net implementation of Facebook Multi Friend Selector? Thank you.
