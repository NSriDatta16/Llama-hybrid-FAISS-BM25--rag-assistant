You could consider using the jQuery data storage methods. In your context menu code you can put: $('.outfeedPosition').bind("contextmenu", function (e) { $('#contextMenu').css({ top: e.pageY + 'px', left: e.pageX + 'px' }).show(); //Store the item that was clicked $("#contextMenu").data('originalElement', this); return false; }); Then when you want to reference the element that initiated the click, you can just do this: $('#ctxDelete').click(function () { var originalElement = $("#contextMenu").data('originalElement'); alert('delete was clicked by ' + originalElement.id ); }); And put originalElement in the jQuery function $() to access the jQuery goodness. It doesn't matter where you put the data, since any DOM element can have data associated to it. You can store anything - in the example code above, I store the HTMLElement raw (not jQueryified) but you can store that too if you want.
