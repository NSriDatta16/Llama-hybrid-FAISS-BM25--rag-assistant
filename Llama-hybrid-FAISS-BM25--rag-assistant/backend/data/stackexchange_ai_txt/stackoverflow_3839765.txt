There is a W3C proposal for a File API in HTML5. I ran a few browsers against this test , and found that Firefox 3.6, and Chrome 6 support File Reader API and Local Storage . Safari 5 (on Windows) supported Local Storage but not File Reader API . Sorry I couldn't test IE9 as corporate policy has IE6 (?!) nailed in place.
