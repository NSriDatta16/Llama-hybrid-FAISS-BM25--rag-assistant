The comments about speeding up Insights got me intrigued and I will give that a try but so far I never included shared units in the projects that used them. Instead I created packages for each library and added them to the project group (mostly for organizational purposes only, i.e. I never actually compile them as runtime packages). I found this easier to manage (especially with all the recent improvements in the project manager) than having all files in one project as the folder hierarchies inside the individual (package-)projects won't be as deep and especially there's no ".."-level that way.
