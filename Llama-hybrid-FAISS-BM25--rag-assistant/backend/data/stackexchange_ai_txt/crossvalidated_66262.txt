Question about foundations of the uniform shrinkage prior

I am collecting papers about the uniform shrinkage prior for hierarchical Bayesian model. In "A prior for the variance in hierarchical models" of Michael J. Daniels it is stated at the end of page two that: An alternative proper prior, shown to give a minimax estimator for the k means for the above model by Strawderman (1971) under certain conditions, would be to place a uniform prior on the shrinkage parameter. The mentioned paper by Strawderman (1971) is "Proper Bayes Minimax Estimators of the Multivariate Normal Mean" . I do not understand in what sense this article explicates the quote of Daniels (maybe the paper is too technical for me and I missed the point). If somebody has some hints regarding the article or more generally can explain the quoted sentence, I will appreciate it.
