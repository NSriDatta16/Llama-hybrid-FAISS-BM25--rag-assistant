A common approach is indeed to first model the data using some time series model, make a prediction, and then evaluate how far the current measurement deviates from the prediction (or try a cumulative error over several time points). It is possible to make a distribution of the errors from the fitted data. This approach stands and falls with the series being predictable. Try Holt-Winters instead of ARIMA. This is supported in R.
