Let's assume that OrgType has a field called position . This is common when you want to present a select list to the users who will be choosing a type. It's highly unlikely that your Organization will ever care about this field. Now extrapolate this to other related models with fields that other models don't care about, and add in the fact that if you ever wanted to change one of these fields you'd then have to hunt down each declaration of them, not just each place where they are used. It's a mess. Open up your db tool and look at your fields when you want to know what they are. Keep your models clean and readable. If you see code like this: organization.org_type.name It's pretty obvious that OrgType has a name field, without having to look it up, and without having to wade through configuration clutter in each model.
