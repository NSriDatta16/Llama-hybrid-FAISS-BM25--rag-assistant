Machine dependent means, fundamentally, dependent on the hardware that comprises the computer - RAM can be accessed via the CPU+RAM bus so isn't necessarily part of this - however video cards, external storage, mouse / keyboard etc. are. This is gotten around by abstracting away the complexities of hardware using drivers which have a common interface - for example, DirectX abstracts away interaction with a video card by providing a well-defined interface.
