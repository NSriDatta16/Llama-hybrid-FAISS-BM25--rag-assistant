How to form a single index?

My goal is to order companies based on their profitability in a specified period (from the most profitable, to the least profitable). For that I need a single index. I have got a dataset similar to the one below: Company Ratio 1 (2020) Ratio 2 (2020) Ratio 1 (2021) Ratio 2 (2021) Index Company A X% X% X% X% ? Company B X% X% X% X% ? Company C X% X% X% X% ? The difference is that I have 300 companies, 6 different profitability ratios (operational, gross profit, net profit etc.) and 3 years. Based on the financial analysis literature, I believe it is sound to assume that the profitability ratios measure the same underlying construct (i.e. overall profitability). Is it methodologically valid to simply pool the data across time points, i.e. combine the 6 ratios at 3 years into 6*3=18 data points for each company and then do e.g. PCA? I would not hesitate if I had a single-period data (one year, six ratios), however I am not sure if I can apply this procedure for a time-series (there might be a temporal dependency where for each ratio: t depends on t-1, and t-1 depends on t-2). Also, in the case PCA is not the right approach, what other procedure could I apply? I use SPSS.
