How to pick starting parameters for MASS:fitdist() with the beta distribution?

I have data set of ~700k yes/no events that I want to first aggregate on various features (e.g. group by average), always resulting in a 34 length vector. From there, I want to fit a beta distribution to the resulting vector. Below is an example of one possible vector: dput(0.0955104277250779, 0.0782381918284555, 0.109683584625186, 0.10115721657354, 0.102377369846524, 0.0691699604743083, 0.0940254652301665, 0.078494747777906, 0.0824474231569216, 0.087598944591029, 0.114703196347032, 0.0966910484151863, 0.0995783979120659, 0.090916800949877, 0.111081696404935, 0.101724137931034, 0.0880689367194321, 0.106699751861042, 0.0772264084644516, 0.109373466383118, 0.0732657833203429, 0.139175257731959, 0.0902068720589541, 0.0900240916465903, 0.103787190855189, 0.0846888376687521, 0.0901782178217822, 0.0943396226415094, 0.0778525161933234, 0.057852491291837, 0.0902365266227454, 0.0940445474171976, 0.0834914611005693, 0.0886513916653852) From there I want to fit a beta distribution (this is leading up to empiricial bayesian estimation btw). See http://varianceexplained.org/r/empirical_bayes_baseball/ for the general idea. When I try and fit a beta distribution however, I receive errors as shown below. library(MASS) m2 Although I have been successful in fitting other vectors with the fitdist() function, I have been unable to fit this specific vector, although the data appears rational and well formed. I have encountered a wide variety of errors when aggregating/subsetting the data in different ways as well. In general, I'd like to be able to set the start parameters in such a way as to guarantee a fit, even if the resulting shape is less than ideal. The goal being to remove the needed trial and error tweaking of the start values. I've read the fitdist documentation thoroughly, and searched for a similiar question/issue with no luck. Happy to provide additional example vectors as requested.
