Any recomended Neural Network structure to classify similar images?

I have a number of very similar images, and I want to classify them into two groups. I used Resnet50 before, but the network does not seem to be learning at all. As the training progresses, the validation accuracy always stays at around 50% to 60%. I have cropped the images to the most relevant portions and tried some other structures as well, but none of them seems to be working. Any suggestions or recommendations?
