Is the 'dictionary' organized with one word per line? You could sensibly use 'strlen()` instead of the loop with 'p += 1'. Presumably the dictionary is also sorted? Once you have the dictionary in memory, you don't need to read the whole of the article into memory. You could read one word at a time with 'fscanf()', then eliminate any punctuation so "t'other" appears as words "t" and "other" and "doesn't" appears as "doesn" and "t" - if you like. Or you could decide that isn't helpful. On the other hand, you probably do want to remove characters like question marks and double quotes. Does your dictionary provide all variants on a word, or do you need to get involved in stemming? "Antidisestablishmentarianism" can be stemmed into "anti", "dis", "establish", "ment", "arian", "ism", I think, as an example. You also need to consider whether it is correct to lower-case everything. You might decide that "IBM" is OK and "ibm" is not, for example; likewise with "ICBM" and "icbm" (and both "Ibm" and "Icbm" are bad under any reasonable definition of 'proper spelling'). You should be exploiting the fact that your dictionary is sorted to reduce the search time using a binary search or some similar mechanism.
