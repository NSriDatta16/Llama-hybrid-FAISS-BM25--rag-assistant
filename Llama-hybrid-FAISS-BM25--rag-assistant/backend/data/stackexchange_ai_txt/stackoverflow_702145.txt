Is it OK to add a Condition to a core InstallShield Custom Action? (like OnInstallFilesActionBefore)

I added a condition to the OnInstallFilesActionBefore Custom Action via the Sequences editor. I made it so it only executes the first time you install the setup, which means my condition is: Not Installed I'm now seeing this warning logged when compiling: ISDEV : warning The condition for Custom Action OnInstallFilesActionBefore in the InstallExecuteSequence Sequence has been modified. This will cause unpredictable results at runtime. See, I thought that Custom Action was simply an InstallShield-specific wrapper that allowed us to add code before the InstallFiles action. Does it do anything else other than the code I add to it? If all it does is execute the code I added to it, then do I need to pay attention to this warning? I'm a little concerned that it says it " will cause unpredictable results at runtime", as if they are certain. As for as I can tell, it works fine. My code is executed when first installing, but not when uninstalling or repairing. That's what I want. For the record, I'm using DevStudio v9.
