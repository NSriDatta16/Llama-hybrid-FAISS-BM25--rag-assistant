Specifying two-level Random Effect model with rma.mv in metafor

I am having some trouble understanding rma.mv in R which I would like to use for my first meta-analysis. I have got about 40 studies where I can extract multiple effect sizes from e.g. because they give measures for different valleys or different interventions to compare to a controll group. Because these effect measures from the same study are probably more similar than others and correlated/not independent, I want to use a study-specific random effect (specifying the random argument random = ~ 1| ID_study). This two-level random effect is something my professor told me to do after I had read about three-level models (thinking of random = ~ 1| ID_Study/ID_ES). She said that random effect model would be enough and could keep it less complex. As I was looking for papers to cite in my method section in my thesis, I came across authors like Cheung (2019) saying that a random effect model could not account for dependency of effect sizes i.e. I believe that the “Random Effect model” described with rma.mv ( https://wviechtb.github.io/metafor/reference/rma.mv.html ) must be something different? Does a Random effect model with rma.mv have a different name or is described by an author somewhere (unfortunately Viechtbauer does not describe it in his metafor paper from 2010)? Additionally I am not sure how to interpret the sigma^2 and Q-heterogeneity statistics in my case. Would sigma^2 be the same as tau = describing the heterogeneity between the studies or between the effect sizes? Thank you very much for your much needed help in advance!
