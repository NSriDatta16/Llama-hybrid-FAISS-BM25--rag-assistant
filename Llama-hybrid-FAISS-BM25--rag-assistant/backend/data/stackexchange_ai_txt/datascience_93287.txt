CNN for image classification with two outputs

Is it possible to classify my images (cars parts) by the type of cars part(door, window ...) and also by the view of the image( front, back, right, left, top and bottom). My pictures are labelled like this: View_idPart, the view is a number from 2 to 7. I want to use a CNN model, but i don't know if this is possible? I hope that I will have some answers, I will be so grateful
