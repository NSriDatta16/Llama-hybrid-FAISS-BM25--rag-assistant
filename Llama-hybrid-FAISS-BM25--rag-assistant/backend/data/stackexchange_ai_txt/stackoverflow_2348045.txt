Resolve C++ virtual functions from base class

Sorry if this is a dupe, I cant find an answer quite right. I want to call a function from a base class member, and have it resolve to the subclass version. I thought declaring it virtual would do it, but it isn't. Here's my approach: class GUIWindow { public: GUIWindow() { SetupCallbacks(); } virtual void SetupCallbacks() { // This function always called } }; class GUIListbox : public GUIWindow { public: void SetupCallbacks() { // This never called } }; GUIListbox lb; // GUIWindow::SetupCallbacks is called :( What am I doing wrong? Many thanks Si
