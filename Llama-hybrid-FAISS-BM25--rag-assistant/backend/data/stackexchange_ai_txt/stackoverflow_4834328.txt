The reason you get that error is because grade is not defined on the first iteration. You don't realize this because you have the while positioned after the action. You should write it like this while grade.last != '' { grade=gets.chomp } Now, other than the fact that this loop doesn't do anything that you want it to, this form is much better, because it becomes apparent that grade is nil when it evaluates. Here is a quick re-write of your code... puts "This program will calculate your GPA this semester" puts "How many courses are you taking?" num_courses = gets.chomp.to_i # num_courses is now an integer puts "You are taking #{num_courses} courses" # let's pretend num_courses = 4 puts "Use A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D, or F" values = { # using a hash will allow us to avoid a "A" => 4, # large and inefficient if / elsif statement "A-" => 3.7, "B+" => 3.3, "B" => 3, } total = 0.0 # sets our total prior to the loop for scope num_courses.times do # so we will do this loop 4 times total += values[gets.chomp.upcase] # looks up the value from our hash end # and adds it to the (running) total gpa = total / num_courses # calculates the gpa from the total # and the num_courses we asked earlier puts "Your GPA is #{gpa}" There are a few other ways you could do some of this, but hopefully the above is simple enough that you see the general concepts that you may have been struggling to grasp before. I hope this helps you, but ask anything you might still wonder.
