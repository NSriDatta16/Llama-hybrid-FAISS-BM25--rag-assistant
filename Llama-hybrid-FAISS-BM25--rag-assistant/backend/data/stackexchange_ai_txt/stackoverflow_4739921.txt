Drupal: module for handling public and private files storage

I need to create a web system for handling public file downloads and to create protected directories for single users. Users can see the content of the public folder and can read/write in their directory without, obviously, seeing the content of other users directories. I would like to use Drupal but I have not found a module that permits a similar thing. Can anyone suggest me links to useful modules?
