Imagine you have a basic maths framework, a lot of functions doing addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Imagine in everyday life you often need to compute averages. Then you make a function (using the functions from the framework, inside it), that will take an array of numbers as parameters an return the mean. The framework is actually doing the work, it's still a lot of additions and a division, but your API-like function is a way nicer way to do what you need. Let's say you were using Numpy (an algebra framework on CPU) to do your stuff. Numba is it's equivalent but on GPU. If in your code you had a lot of "numpy.add(a, b)" everywhere you needed an addition, you would need to change it everywhere to "numba.add(a, b)", so a lot of shitty work. But if instead you were using your homemade function "add(a, b)", then you just have to change the framework you use inside your function, easy peasy ! So yeah you understood correctly, it's better to update the API than the framework. To come back to this dumb example, Numpy is a "CPU computing framework", so it wouldn't make any sense to change it to use the GPU (Numba was created for it). But your custom function can easily be modified, as it's purpose is to "do the job the best way for you". So it's good practice to stick to using your "API" everywhere, even if it sometimes seems unnecessary. Now picture Keras as this function, and Tensorflow as the algebra framework. Sure, most of the time you can use directly the framework, but if you want your code to be cleaner, you'll use your API. As of today Keras and Tensorflow are bundled together and Tensorflow interface is getting closer to it, but that was the idea. If you can do the same model as easily with Keras than directly from Tensorflow, it might seems better to get rid of the "useless" middle-man (Keras), but beware! If one day Tensorflow implements a better way of doing it, Keras will use it, while using directly Tensorflow you'll need to update your code... I over simplify everything, I know, but you seems to have a hard time to distinguish framework and API. You can see that the API is dumb, meaning that the API on itself is using the algebra framework and would be useless without it. Or it would need to implement all those operation and become a fully-fledged framework instead of a simple API. The API needs the framework to work, as Keras needs TensorFlow.
