Offline not working in mobile Safari with cache manifest

I'm working on a mobile site for the iphone. I've added a cache manifest and loaded it with a list of resources needed for offline capability. The manifest file has the correct content type. If you view the response header for the file, the content type is text/cache-manifest. The manifest file is here: http://hoodisgood.clientsit.es/cache.manifest The site is viewable here (you'll need to take a look on your iphone (or simulator) or on Safari with user agent set to the iphone. http://hoodisgood.clientsit.es/ After viewing the site and bookmarking it to the home screen, I set my iphone to airplane mode and when I try to view the site, I can't. I get an alert that it can't open because it's not connected to the internet. I've specified all the files I need for offline operation in the cache manifest file. Also, correct me if I'm wrong, but with a cache manifest, shouldn't the browser read from the cached source even when the device is online? When I view the site, photos I haven't seen are loaded from the server, as it should be. When I close and reopen, previously viewed images are still loading from the server. Am I doing something wrong? I checked and re-checked, everything seems to be correct, just not sure why it's not working. Thanks.
