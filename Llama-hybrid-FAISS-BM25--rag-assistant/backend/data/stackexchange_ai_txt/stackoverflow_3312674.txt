Stripes is a great framework. It's been our framework of choice the past few years and has yet to disappoint. However, if you mean RESTful in the sense that you want to use HTTP PUT/DELETE, etc. Stripes might not be your answer. I think you'd have to set up Filters, or additional logic in your Beans, it wouldn't be straight-forward (as it seems to be in Spring from a cursory googling). On the other hand, if you mean things like /app/delete/3 or /app/update/4 & pass POST params, Stripes is an excellent choice. The Stripes book (Pragmatic Programmers) explains the framework well, and has a chapter on using DI with Spring. All the normal bells and whistles (including validation) are excellent.
