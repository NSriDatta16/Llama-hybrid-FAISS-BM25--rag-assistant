Not quite sure what you mean by "loop an array of text". Is it safe to assume data.reviews is a JSON object? if so, what you have should work, but you may want to use: $('#reviews').append($(' ').text('"'+itemData.review+'"')); That would be in place of your current code in the .each block. (this is assuming you're adding a new paragraph to #reviews for each entry. Your current method keeps replacing the contents of the paragraph with the very last entry found.)
