C# Assembly not found at runtime

A strange error begans to happen with my XNA project on a new pc. I have two projects on the solution and a library that is used by both of them. One of the projects, a XNA Game Project, runs perfectly. The other project is a mix of WindowsForm and XNA. The form launches a XNA class when a button is clicked. When I run the program, it works great till the moment I click the button which launch the XNA class. A FileNotFoundException is fired exactly at the moment that the constructor will be executed. System.IO.FileNotFoundException was unhandled Message="Could not load file or assembly 'Microsoft.Xna.Framework, Version=3.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=6d5c3888ef60e27d' or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the path specified." The reference is correct, there is no problem on compilation. We already tried to delete the reference and add it again but it didn't work. Everything worked correctly in others teammate's pc. Anyone has any idea what is the problem?
