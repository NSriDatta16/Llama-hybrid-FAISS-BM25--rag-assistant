Model Size of Random Forest VS CatBoost

I trained models based on the same dataset, using random forest (sklearn) and CatBoost. I use n_estimators=1000 for random forest, and n_estimators(iterations)=1000 for CatBoost. The random forest has significantly larger model size compared to that of CatBoost. They both have a lot of trees in the model. Why the size difference is so large?
