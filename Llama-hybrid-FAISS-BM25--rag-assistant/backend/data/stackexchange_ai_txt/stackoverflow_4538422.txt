magento _redirect with parameters that have + or /

seems like a call to $this->_redirect('*/*/myaction',$myargs); does not properly escape the arguments so if $myargs=array(p1=>'string that has + or / within it') the created URL will be something like: ..../myaction/?p1/string%20that%20has%20+%20or%20/%20within%20it causing the getParams collection on the action to have p1 with value 'string that has or ' is there any standard way I should handle the arguments before passing them to _redirect ?
