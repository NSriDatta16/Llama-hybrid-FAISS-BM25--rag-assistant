Date vs Milliseconds | for scalablility, saving, searching and obtaining time in Java + MySQL(or other Db's)

Which is the most beneficial in Java and a DB for DateTime? (Using JodaTime as Date) (DateTime object (Java) + TIMESTAMP (DB) ) VS (Milliseconds long (Java) + BIGINT(DB) for the use of DateTime information in Java Web application backed by an underlying Database Areas of interest manipulating, processing and memory usage in Java saving using efficient storage space in a MySQL database ease of porting a BIGINT/TIMESTAMP column to other DBs ease of searching the DB for a BIGINT/TIMESTAMP or between two BIGINTs/TIMESTAMPs E.g. Say I had an event with a start & end DateTime. Is it faster to search for events on dates using BIGINT in the DB than TIMESTAMPS I might be swapping the underlying DB as scalability and retrieval issues arise. Would saving the DateTime as a TIMESTAMP in a MySQL DB lead problems when porting to another DB like Oracle? I currently use the Joda DateTime in java then storing the millisecond of that value. When retrieving it, I convert the milliseconds back to a DateTime object and display it.
