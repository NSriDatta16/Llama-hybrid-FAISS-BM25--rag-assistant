How do I convert an octal number to decimal in Ruby?

I am trying to find a clean way of referencing an array's index using octal numbering. If I am looking for the array index that is octal 13 it should return the value for a[11] . This is what I have come up with to accomplish it, but it doesn't seem very elegant or efficient: a = [ 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62 ] v = 13 puts a[v.to_s.to_i(8)] # => 61 # OR puts a[v.to_s.oct] # => 61 Is there a better way?
