1 - A Magento module is a set of files that can be dropped into (and removed from) Magento cleanly to add or change functionality. As more fundamental changes are required, it's harder to keep these files isolated, but it can usually be accomplished. A Magento module will NOT be reusable in a different cart, as the framework for Magento is not the same as any other cart. 2 - Get code samples and have a neutral person review that code. Have them explain pitfalls of developing in Magento. Ask for some tradeoffs that they had to make in developing a module. Ask about a difficult module that they've developed. That isn't an exhaustive list, but you get the gist.
