Compute average number of rows per group in Sql Server Reporting Services

I have a table widget in reporting services where I group rows on a given id. For each group, I display the number of rows per group, using countrows(). How can I display the average number of rows per group at the end of my report ? What I am missing is : how to count the number of groups?
