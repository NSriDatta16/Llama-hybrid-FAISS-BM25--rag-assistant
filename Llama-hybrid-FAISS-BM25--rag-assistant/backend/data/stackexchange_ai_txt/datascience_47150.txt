Condensed Nearest Neighbors algorithm helps to reduce the dataset X for k-NN classification. It constructs a subset of examples which are able to correctly classify the original data set using a 1-NN algorithm. It is returning not the array of misclassified points, but a subset Z of the data set X. CNN works like that: 1) Scan all elements of X, looking for an element x whose nearest prototype from Z has a different label than x 2) Remove x from X and add it to Z 3) Repeat the scan until no more prototypes are added to Z Z used instead of X for kNN classification. An advantage of this method is decreasing of execution time, reducing a space complexity
