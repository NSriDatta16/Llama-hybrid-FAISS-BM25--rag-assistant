As your dependent variable (i.e., graduation) is binary (0/1) you should perform a logistic regression . This will measure the effect of your independent variables (e.g., student's grade, age, gender, etc.) on the probability to graduate. If your data are "structured" (e.g., the students belong to schools themselves nested within geo areas), then you should consider running hierarchical regression (e.g., mixed effects logistic). In your case I am more concerned by the availability of the information for each student (" Not all students were required to take the same classes, so some students don't have letter grades for certain subjects "). This is an issue if you want to estimate the effect of "letter grade" on graduation, because in standard logistic regression this will be treated as missing values and your corresponding observation will be "automatically" removed from the data set. When you specify your independent variables, try to include only the ones which have a value for most of the students. For example, in your case you could first try to estimate a Logit model linking Proba{Graduation} with "type of classes" => For each subject and each student, you should be able to code a binary variable indicating whether the student took the subject.
