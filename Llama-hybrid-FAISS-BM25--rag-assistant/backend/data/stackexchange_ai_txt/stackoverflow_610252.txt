I think you got it wrong. My understanding is that asynchronous execution in your case should be handled at architecture level instead of ORM level i.e. message queue driven architecture. What I see is that your webserive will only place a message in the queue and there is some kind of background agent does the asynchronous processing off the queue. Since I don't have enough reputation to comment and Stackoverflow is alerting me inserting another "answer" I will leave my comment here. Lee B: SQLAlchemy? How do you use it with .NET???
