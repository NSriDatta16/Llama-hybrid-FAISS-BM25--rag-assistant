Add Absolute Value as a Feature

In a machine learning context, does it make sense to have both a measurement and its absolute value transformation as features? There are already ~120 features in this predictive model (an elastic net regression, which I inherited), so I think it would be good to try to reduce the dimensionality. Many of the features are simply absolute value transformations of other features, some of which are nearly always positive and others of which are more-or-less balanced around 0. I don't exactly have a statistical argument for my dissent, but intuitively I don't know what the model would be gaining by having those transformed features. If my assumption is correct, a more formal explanation of why I should remove these transformed features would be appreciated!
