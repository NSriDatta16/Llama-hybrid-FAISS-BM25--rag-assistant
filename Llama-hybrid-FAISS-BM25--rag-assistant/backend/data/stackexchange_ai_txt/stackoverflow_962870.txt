By "much padding" I mean that even though there's plenty of space above and below the text, it wraps it so it become two pages. I didn't add any padding myself. The abstract pages has more padding than the other pages. {\raggedright}p{3cm} works, almost... I can set raggedright on all columns but the last. Setting it on the last will give a compile error. "you modify the amount of space that is added after a paragraph": I do? Is a {sub}section considered as a paragraph? Because I get extra spacing below these too. Latex was a requirement for this report. I understand after playing around a bit with it that you really should learn it by heart. And I will! As you say. Latex is really good looking. And to specify a standard to the best reading-ergonomic makes lots of sense.
