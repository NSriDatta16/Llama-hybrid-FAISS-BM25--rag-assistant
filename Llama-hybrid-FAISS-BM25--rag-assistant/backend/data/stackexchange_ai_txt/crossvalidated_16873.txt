Bayesian statistics for the working scientist

What is a good resource that explains Bayesian statistics for an experimental scientists who already use Frequentist statistics? What are the Bayesian analogues for all the tools working scientists use, like ANOVA and linear regression (and how do the Bayesian analogues compare), and what software can be used to perform the Bayesian methods? I've heard people arguing that we should publish Bayesian "likelihood ratios" instead of doing significance testing. How would one do this?
