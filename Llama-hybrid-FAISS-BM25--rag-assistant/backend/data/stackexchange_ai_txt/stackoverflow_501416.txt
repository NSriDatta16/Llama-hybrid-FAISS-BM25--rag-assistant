If your application is document-based and you filled out the necessary keys in your Info.plist correctly, then it Just Works. When the user drags a file to your application's Dock tile, Dock will highlight your app on the tile if the file is of a type you signed up for, and if the user drops the file there, NSDocumentController will instantiate one of your document classes for the file. If the file is not of a type you signed up for, both will ignore it. So, is your app document-based? If so, is the file one of a type you signed up for?
