Backup MS SQL Server 2005?

I have a MS SQL Server 2005. It is very easy to backup individual databases, just right click on database then Tasks->Backup. My question is how to back up SQL server database objects outside the databases? For example, under the Security->Logins, there are list of login users; under the SQL Server Agent->Jobs, there are list of jobs, and under the Server Objects->Linked Servers; ans so on. Is there any way to do full-backup of SQL server? in TSQL? I tried to find out from SQL Server Management Studio but I could not find any.
