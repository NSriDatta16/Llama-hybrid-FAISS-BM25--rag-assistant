Interpreting PCA where the lower PCs have low variance

Normally I expect most of the variance or at least a quarter of the variance to be explained in the first 2 dimensions of the PCA. However, recently I came across a PCA where the first was only about 12% and the 2 about 6%. What does this mean exactly? Does this mean that the PCA in question is not good enough to explain most of the variance?
