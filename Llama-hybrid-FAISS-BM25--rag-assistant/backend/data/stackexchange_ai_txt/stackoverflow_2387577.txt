jquery 'attribute contains' selector with a dynamic value

Let's say that i have a variable questionId which is an integer, and i want to find tr elements that have the fragment ( "question_"+questionId ) in their id. How can i do this? I thought that i would be able to do it with the jquery 'attribute contains' selector . Eg, this works, for a non-dynamic value, $("tr[id*='quiz_question_7674']") but, i can't work out how to plug the variable value in there. This doesn't work for example: questionId = 7674; $("tr[id*='quiz_question_'+questionId]") Any ideas anyone? Is there a better way than 'attribute contains' to do it? I have the feeling i'm missing something obvious. thanks, max EDIT - SOLVED. doh, i am indeed missing something obvious. I keep forgetting that it's just a string, nothing more: $("tr[id*='quiz_question_"+questionId+"']")
