My style is a combination of Attilla the Hun, Napoleon Bonaparte and Nelson Mandela. Whatever you do, don't try to adopt my style. More seriously, to be a good leader you have to develop your own style and you have to integrate that into the culture of the organisation you work in. So, the answer to your question must start with asking yourself some penetrating questions and giving honest answers to them. You must also take some time to understand the traits of the individuals in your team and figure out what makes them tick and how to motivate them as individuals. What works with one may not work with another. And, while I'm writing, I'll direct a passing kick at the respondents who suggest that it is a manager's job to get out of the way and let the team work: it's the manager's job to manage, you have people you work for who have certain expectations of you and you have to pay attention to them as well as to the losers on your team. I write 'losers' because you have just been promoted and they haven't. Sure, you have to lead them to great achievement but you won't do that by keeping out of their way, you'll do it by leading them in the right direction, with the right mix of carrot and stick. Oh, and don't let them know that you think they are losers, it will upset them.
