I have found that this course gives very good insights on Data Science: https://prod-edx-mktg-edit.edx.org/course/statistical-thinking-data-science-columbiax-ds101x-0 and I would also suggest a book that I find well written and easy to follow: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/IPSUR/vignettes/IPSUR.pdf
