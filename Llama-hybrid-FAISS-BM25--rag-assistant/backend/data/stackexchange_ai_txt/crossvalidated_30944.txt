Regarding your statement I'm more interested here in knowing when to use logistic regression, and when to use probit There are already many answers here that bring up things to consider when choosing between the two but there is one important consideration that hasn't been stated yet: When your interest is in looking at within-cluster associations in binary data using mixed effects logistic or probit models, there is a theoretical grounding for preferring the probit model. This is, of course, assuming that there is no a priori reason for preferring the logistic model (e.g. if you're doing a simulation and know it to be the true model). First , To see why this is true first note that both of these models can be viewed as thresholded continuous regression models. As an example consider the simple linear mixed effects model for the observation $i$ within cluster $j$: $$ y^{\star}_{ij} = \mu + \eta_{j} + \varepsilon_{ij} $$ where $\eta_j \sim N(0,\sigma^2)$ is the cluster $j$ random effect and $\varepsilon_{ij}$ is the error term. Then both the logistic and probit regression models are equivalently formulated as being generated from this model and thresholding at 0: $$ y_{ij} = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if} \ \ \ y^{\star}_{ij}â‰¥0\\ \\ 0 &\text{if} \ \ \ y^{\star}_{ij} If the $\varepsilon_{ij}$ term is normally distributed, you have a probit regression and if it is logistically distributed you have a logistic regression model. Since the scale is not identified, these residuals errors are specified as standard normal and standard logistic, respectively. Pearson (1900) showed that that if multivariate normal data were generated and thresholded to be categorical, the correlations between the underlying variables were still statistically identified - these correlations are termed polychoric correlations and, specific to the binary case, they are termed tetrachoric correlations . This means that, in a probit model, the intraclass correlation coefficient of the underlying normally distributed variables: $$ {\rm ICC} = \frac{ \hat{\sigma}^{2} }{\hat{\sigma}^{2} + 1 } $$ is identified which means that in the probit case you can fully characterize the joint distribution of the underlying latent variables . In the logistic model the random effect variance in the logistic model is still identified but it does not fully characterize the dependence structure (and therefore the joint distribution), since it is a mixture between a normal and a logistic random variable that does not have the property that it is fully specified by its mean and covariance matrix. Noting this odd parametric assumption for the underlying latent variables makes interpretation of the random effects in the logistic model less clear to interpret in general.
