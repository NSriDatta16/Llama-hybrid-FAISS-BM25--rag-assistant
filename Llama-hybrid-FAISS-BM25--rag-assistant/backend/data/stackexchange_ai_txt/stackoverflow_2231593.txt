Upcasting with a generic type parameter

Is it possible to "upcast" from a generic class based on T, into a generic class based on something more general than T? For instance, say I have a class named Derived that inherits from a class named Base . Can I ever do something like this: List der = new List (); List bas = (List ) der; Or, using interfaces, is it ever possible to do something like this: List specific = new List (); List general = (List )specific; As written here, each of these examples fails with an InvalidCastException . The question we're arguing about is whether it's actually impossible, or simply a syntax error that could be fixed if we knew how.
