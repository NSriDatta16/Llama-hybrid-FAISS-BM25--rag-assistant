When you use the means you are removing much of the variation of the y's around their averages. This would be incorrect if you are assessing the relationships between the individual y's and the x's. In particular it will cause you to overestimate the correlation between the y's and the x's and give you too much confidence in the estimated regression coefficients. If your purpose is to assess the relationship between the average y and the x's, that might be ok. (One subtlety occurs when the numbers of y's involved in the averages vary, because then you should be using weighted least squares methods rather than ordinary least squares.) Just beware of the ecological fallacy , which is the mistake of using the aggregated (i.e., averaged) y's in place of their individual values. These considerations are independent of any distributional assumptions.
