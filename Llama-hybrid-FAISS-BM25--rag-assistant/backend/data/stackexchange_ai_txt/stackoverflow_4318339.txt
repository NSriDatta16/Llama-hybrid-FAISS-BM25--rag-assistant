Uploading a JPEG created from a WriteableBitmap without saving it to the users computer first

I have an application that allows users to upload videos to the server and part of the process is to create a thumbnail image on the client that will be used for the video when loaded on the server. I have a writeablebitmap that I want to convert to a jpeg and upload to the server. Is it possible to do this without saving the jpeg to the user's computer first - I do not want to require a trusted app. Is it possible to store it in isolatedstorage first and then upload it from there as if it is just another file on the user's computer? thanks Michael
