How to identify best Model for univariate time series data?

I have a time series data- 53.97 63.32 57.06 60.27 69.46 75.08 78.31 73.28 85.84 69.34 62.57 60.11 55.63 47.29 61.22 58.46 66.26 59.71 51.12 39.36 51.89 53.85 47.64 31.75 35.01 31.34 26.64 29.48......... Are there any set steps to approach any time series or should I just look at statistical property of data that choose from available econometrics model like ARCH, AR, MA, ARIMA ?
