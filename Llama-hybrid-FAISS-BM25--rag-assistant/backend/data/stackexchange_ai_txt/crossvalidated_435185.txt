Empirical results often indicate (e.g. [1]) that simpler gated RNN's (e.g. MGU or GRU) perform comparably to LSTM, and since in microcontroller application memory consumption is important, I would suggest to work with simpler gated RNN models instead of LSTM. [2] is my old implementation of GRU for microcontrollers (e.g. teensy 3.6). [1] https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.3555v1.pdf [2] https://github.com/povidanius/gru_neurocontroller
