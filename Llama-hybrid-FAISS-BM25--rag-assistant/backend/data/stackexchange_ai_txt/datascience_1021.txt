Extract canonical string from a list of noisy strings

I have thousands of lists of strings, and each list has about 10 strings. Most strings in a given list are very similar, though some strings are (rarely) completely unrelated to the others and some strings contain irrelevant words. They can be considered to be noisy variations of a canonical string. I am looking for an algorithm or a library that will convert each list into this canonical string. Here is one such list. Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope | StarWars.com Star Wars Episode IV - A New Hope (1977) Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope - Rotten Tomatoes Watch Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope Online Free Star Wars (1977) - Greatest Films [REC] 4 poster promises death by outboard motor - SciFiNow For this list, any string matching the regular expression ^Star Wars:? Episode IV (- )?A New Hope$ would be acceptable. I have looked at Andrew Ng's course on Machine Learning on Coursera, but I was not able to find a similar problem.
