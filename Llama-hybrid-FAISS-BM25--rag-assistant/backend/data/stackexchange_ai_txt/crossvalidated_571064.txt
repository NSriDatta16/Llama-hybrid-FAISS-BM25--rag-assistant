Difference between ROC-AUC and Multiclass AUC (MAUC)

I am trying to understand the interpretation of these metrics in a multiclass scenario: ROC-AUC and MAUC . Scikit-learn provides an implementation for ROC-AUC score, which can be used for both binary and multiclass problems. However, some studies such as 2 , 3 , 4 and 5 suggest averaging class-wise AUC in multiclass . My experiments with this metrics yield different results. Do they then evaluate to different quantities? For clarity, I used 4 implementation as well as sklearn's ROC-AUC . I the case of sklearn 's, I set the hyperparameters as: roc_auc = metrics.roc_auc_score(y_test, ypred, average='weighted', multi_class='ovo',labels=labels) With Random Forest classifier, we obtained: ROC-AUC: 0.58 # sklearn's roc-auc-score MAUC: 0.69 This is more than a 10% difference so the two values are not close at all.
