Script that recognizes first sentence, put it inside a heading and the rest inside a paragraph

Hey there, I have this code, i take a wordpress post content, put it inside a variable and than match the first sentence, put it inside a h2 heading and the rest inside a paragraph. 1.The problem is this... my script recognizes only . or ! or ? at the end of the first sentance. Can i make it recognize "..." suspension points? 2.If in my wordpress post i have a text like this: The first sentance! followed by some text than i hit enter continue with more text My script shows only "The first sentance! followed by some text" and nothing after the enter that i hit. Why? and ideeas? Here is the code: ob_start(); the_content(); $old_content = ob_get_clean(); // I put wordpress inside a variable $content = strip_tags($old_content); // I use strip tags preg_match('/(.*?[?.!])(.*)/', $content, $match); $first_sentence = $match[1]; $the_rest = $match[2]; if ( $first_sentence != '' && $the_rest != '' ): echo ' '.$first_sentence.' '; echo ' '.$the_rest.' '; else: echo ' About me: '; endif;
