Constructing human readable sentences based on a survey

The following is a survey given to course attendees to assess an instructor at the end of the course. Communication Skills 1. The instructor communicated course material clearly and accurately. Yes No 2. The instructor explained course objectives and learning outcomes. Yes No 3. In the event of not understanding course materials the instructor was available outside of class. Yes No 4. Was instructor feedback and grading process clear and helpful? Yes No 5. Do you feel that your oral and written skills have improved while in this course? Yes No We would like to summarize each attendees selection based on the choices chosen by him. If the provided answers were [No, No, Yes, Yes, Yes]. Then we would summarize this as "The instructor was not able to summarize course objectives and learning outcomes clearly, but was available and usually helpful outside of class. The instructor feedback and grading process was clear and helpful and I feel that my oral and written skills have improved because of this course. Based on the selections chosen by the attendee the summary would be quite different. This leads to many answers based on the choices selected and the number of such questions in the survey. The questions are usually provided by the training organization. How do you come up with a generic solution so that this can be effectively translated into a human readable form. I am looking for tools or libraries (java based), suggestions which will help me create such human readable output. I would like to hide the complexity from the end users as much as possible.
