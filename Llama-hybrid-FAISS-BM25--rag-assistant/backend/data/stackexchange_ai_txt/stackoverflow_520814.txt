As an out of the box solution i would prefer using "Microsoft Office SharePoint Server" for indexing and searching within the content of documents. A free alternative is Lucene.Net library if you want to write your own service for indexing and searching. Writing your own full-text search service with Lucene.Net will give you all the flexibility you need (yes you can store the index on an external storage if you want to).
