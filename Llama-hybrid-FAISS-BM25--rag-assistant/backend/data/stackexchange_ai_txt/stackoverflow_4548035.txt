One thing that comes to mind is you're starting with lessons and pulling the course details over with it. That means you're going to have a new row per lesson with a joined course. You may want to sort by course (so they're grouped) then (in PHP) keep a tally of "current course". When the course changes, switch to new heading paragraph, table, etc. Pseudo code: $currentCourse = null; // intitialize the course $query = your select sorted by course; while ($row in $query) { if ($currentCourse != $row['course']) { if (!is_null($currentCourse)) { // there was a course before it, close the current one } // begin setting up heading1, table beginning, etc. $currentCourse = $row['course']; // set this as the active course } // dump the current row as a table entry } // close the table (same code as in the second if statement)
