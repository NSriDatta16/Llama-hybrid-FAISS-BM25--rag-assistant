We had a development wiki and it was a great tool. We used it for everything ! When brainstorming new ideas, we'd capture them on the wiki. The low friction nature of the wiki made it easy for anyone in the organization (we were a small startup) to add ideas as they thought of them. We had a high level "brainstorming" page which linked to detailed pages containing a thorough description of each idea. For each iteration, we'd "move" feature idea items from the "brainstorming" list to the feature list for that iteration. The details of the feature were flushed out to include design and implementation details. As features were completed, the iteration page became our release notes page - which also included the release tag from our version control system. We had a bug page that worked very similar to the feature pages. Bug fixes were added to the iteration/release pages as they were worked on/complete. We also created our user documentation on the wiki and exported those pages it with the release. As time went on. This tool was viewed more and more valuable. We wound up creating new wikis for different the products the company was working on. I hope you find your development wiki as useful as we did!
