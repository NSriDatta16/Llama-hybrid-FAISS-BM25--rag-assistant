If differencing a non-stationary timeseries makes it stationary. Why dont we difference every series and become rich?

Can every non-stationary time series be converted to a stationary time series by applying differencing, and if yes why not do it on all non-stationary series? Please explain this in plain english without to much math. I have just started my econometrics semester and need to understand this!
