Warning, \d doesn't mean [0-9] in Perl 5.8 and 5.10 (unless you use the bytes pragma). It means any UNICODE character that has the digit property, such as MONGOLIAN DIGIT FIVE U+1815 (á •), if you want to restrict it to only whitespace and numbers you can do math with, you need to say /^[\s0-9]$/ .
