I've been reading about this and I'm slowly coming to the conclusion that profiler-like tools in general do not require administrative access, but stating that you require it is an easy way for the tool makers to avoid all problems related to insufficient privileges. So, I guess they are being lazy but also somewhat pragmatic. Correct me if I'm wrong (I'm no expert on the Windows security model), but I believe one way to handle this situation would be to require admin privileges only at install time. Then create a ProfilerUsers user group and grant any necessary privileges to that group, then ask which computer users should be added to that group. The most shocking thing I've discovered is that a lot of developers run all the time with administrative privileges.
