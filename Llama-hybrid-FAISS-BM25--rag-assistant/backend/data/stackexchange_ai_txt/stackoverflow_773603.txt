One generally uses locals() to achieve this result, but the exact functionality is up to you. >>> print apple Traceback (most recent call last): File " ", line 1, in ? NameError: name 'apple' is not defined >>> print banana Traceback (most recent call last): File " ", line 1, in ? NameError: name 'banana' is not defined >>> variables = {"apple" : "a rigid, juicy fruit", "banana" : "a soft, fleshy fruit"} >>> for variable,value in variables.iteritems(): ... locals()[variable] = value ... >>> print apple a rigid, juicy fruit >>> print banana a soft, fleshy fruit EDIT Thanks to everyone who has diligently commented on the badness of this approach. I wholeheartedly agree that THIS IS A BAD APPROACH , and it deserves to be mentioned in the actual response for anyone who stumbles across this page. (Never underestimate that; I saw this technique in a code snippet somewhere. I can see why in that particular case it was harmless, but I know I can't go around encouraging bad methodology just because there are situations in which it won't break.)
