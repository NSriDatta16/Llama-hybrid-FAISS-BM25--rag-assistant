Data storage format for iPad app. Export to excel

I am fairly new to Objective C and iOS programming but am constantly trying to learn as much as I can. I am about to start an iPad project which will involve storing large amounts of data which will need to be exported to one extremely large excel spreadsheet.(it's for a friend....they currently enter massive amounts of data into excel by hand so that they can analyze it). This database contains over 400 names(this number is constantly growing) and the app will be very functionally similar to to built in contacts app, except that for each name there will be approximately 2,000 attributes. These attributes will be entered across tens, if not over a hundred views. The excel file will be located on a local server and the database will be synced with it over wifi. If I have to write a server side application to handle this, I happily will. My question is this: What data storage method would serve best for my purpose accounting for the sheer size of the database and the need to export to excel? (i.e. CoreData?, SQLLite?, XML?) I sincerely appreciate any help you might offer. James
