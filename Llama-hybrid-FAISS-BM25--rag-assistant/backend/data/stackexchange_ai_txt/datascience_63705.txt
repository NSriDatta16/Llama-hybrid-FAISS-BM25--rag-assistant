Actor Critic Model implementation

I am going to work on a project which requires implementation of A2C model using Tensorflow 2.0. I am new in the Machine Learning field and also in Python. These are topics which I have covered theoretically: Different methods of Machine learning (supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement) Linear and Logistic Regression Required knowledge on Statistic and Probability Neural network Policy gradient Gradient Descent Basic of Tensorflow 2.0 (basic operations, preprocessing of Data) Now I am a bit confused about what structure should I follow to become well familiar with Reinforcement learning, A2C model with Tensorflow and complete the project. I need some structured guidelines to study (even if possible from scratch).
