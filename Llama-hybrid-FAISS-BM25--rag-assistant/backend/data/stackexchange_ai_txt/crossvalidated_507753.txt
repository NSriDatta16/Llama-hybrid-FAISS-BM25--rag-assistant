ARIMA fit vs. Linear Regression -- which one to use?

I have a data set made up of 30 observations, years 1980-2020. The second variable is the amount of cargo passing through a particular harbor on the west coast (in tons). I have attempted to fit an ARIMA model to this time series data, with the following result: ARIMA(0,1,0), which I have read is a random walk. What does this mean for the data? Can predictions me made for future values of cargo using a random walk model? When I predicted future values in STATA, I got a simple linear line with an upward trend. How does this differ from just using a standard linear regression model? I know that the Microsoft Excel function "trendline" is the linear regression model, but was told by my teacher that a "trendline" is not a future forecast. How does ARIMA differ from this "trendline?" Thanks!
