First of all the distribution of x is not actually a distribution but a family of distributions. You know assume a form of x which is a function of $\theta$ but you do not know the value of $\theta$ . This is similar with the family of normal distributions $N(\mu,\sigma^2)$ where you don’t know the value of parameters versus standard normal distribution $N(0,1)$ . Now what means $P(x|\theta)$ ? This is actually the distribution function, remember that the conditional formula is read “probability of x given the value of theta”. Now the formula for sufficient statistic says if you know the value of statistic and the one of the parameter the distribution you determine for x is the same as the one determined for x if you knew the value of statistic only. So knowing the statistic is enough (sufficient) to determine the distribution of x. Or otherwise said, the statistic can be used to estimate the parameter entirely, without a need for additional information. In your example with dice you assume a distribution family multinoulli, but you do not know the parameters. If you estimate the parameters values with a statistic and you determine the same distribution for the dice as if you would knew the parameters value then the statistic used for inference is sufficient. One final word about what means determine in the previous paragraph. Of course you cannot determine exactly the parameters values, the statistic is built from sample, so it contains limited information. The determination here refers to the procedure itself. Everything is valid at limit, if you would have an infinite sample and so on.
