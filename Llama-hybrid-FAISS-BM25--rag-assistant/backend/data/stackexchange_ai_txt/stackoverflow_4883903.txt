Zend Engine The Zend Engine is an open source scripting engine (a virtual machine), commonly known for the important role it plays in the web automation language PHP. It was originally developed by Andi Gutmans and Zeev Suraski while they were students at the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology. They later founded a company called Zend Technologies in Ramat Gan, Israel. The name Zend is a combination of their forenames, Zeev and Andi. (source: Wikipedia ) Nowadays, Zend is no longer the main developing force behind it, but just takes a sponsoring role. The Zend Engine is developed by the open source community. It is still the heart of the PHP scripting language. The Zend Engine is written in C. Tag purpose The purpose of the zend-engine tag is to indicate a question is about the internals of PHP. Possible questions could be about how php does reference counting or copy on write, e.g. when you want to know what happens under the hood when doing things in PHP. It can also be applied to questions in the c tag that deal with extending PHP at the core.
