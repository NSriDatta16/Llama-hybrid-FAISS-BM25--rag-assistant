Data retrieval and Join operations with cluster db server

If any database spreads across multiple servers (ex. Microsoft Sql Server), how can we do join or filter operations. In my scenario, if suppose: A single table spreads across multiple servers how can we filter rows based on user input? If master table is there on one db server and transaction table is at another db server, how can we do join operations? Please let me know how can we achieve this and where can I get more details about this?
