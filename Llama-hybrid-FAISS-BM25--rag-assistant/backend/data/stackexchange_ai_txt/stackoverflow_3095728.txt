I finally managed to make it work creating a junction folder link from a subdirectory (user) under the application folder to a directory in the user's folder. Then I added the following line in app.config under the assemblyBinding tag: The application writes the resource files in the user's folder and they are accessed by the application as if they were in the correct path. It is not the most elegant solution but it it working.
