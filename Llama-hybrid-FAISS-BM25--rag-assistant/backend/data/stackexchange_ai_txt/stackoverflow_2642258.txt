MSTest 4.0 changed the name of its helper process from "vstesthost.exe" to "qtagent.exe" (I think that's the right name, but my memory is a little fuzzy. MSTest will start the helper process as long as the /noisolation parameter isn't used. You can then use process explorer to figure out what the name is). Additionally NCover 3.3 (the current release) does not support .NET 4. NCover 3.4 is supposed to have .NET 4 support; if you email support@ncover.com they'll probably send you a build if you ask.
