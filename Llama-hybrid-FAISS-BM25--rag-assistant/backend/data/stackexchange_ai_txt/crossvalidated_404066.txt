Any advantage of Bayesian methods for this data?

I have data of blood sugar level and 8 predictor variables of 15000 subjects. Some of the predictor variables are categorical. I want to determine independent predictors of blood sugar levels. I can do this with linear multivariate analysis. Is there any advantage of using Bayesian methods for this kind of situation?
