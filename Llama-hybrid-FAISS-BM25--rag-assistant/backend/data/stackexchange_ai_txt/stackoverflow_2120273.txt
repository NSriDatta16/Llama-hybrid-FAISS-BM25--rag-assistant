Make a div's total width the same in both Strict and Quirks mode

Consider the following Test If this is output onto a page that IE8 renders in strict mode (or if you load into Firefox etc) then the inside of the div (the white area where test is) will be 150px wide but the div in total will be 50 + 150 + 50 = 250px wide (accounting for the border) If this is rendered in Quirks mode then it will only be 50 + 50 + 50 = 150px wide. The difference is in Quirks the width includes any border as explained here If you are putting a html fragment onto a page and you do not know ahead of time which mode will be used are there any reliable hacks (css/javascript or otherwise) that will ensure that the div has the same overall dimensions in both Strict/Quirks mode on all major browsers (IE6/7/8, Firefox, Opera, Chrome)?
