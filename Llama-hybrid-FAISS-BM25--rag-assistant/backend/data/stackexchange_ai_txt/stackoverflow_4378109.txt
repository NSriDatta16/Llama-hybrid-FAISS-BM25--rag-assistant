Well... with a custom route setup in ZF - and you can probably omit the 'lang' portion. it's also really easy to configure and good for SEO. sessions are good way to setup #1 when a user returns to your site database storage is a good way to setup #2 and #1 when a user logs in with their own preferences set. What is also a good way to attempt to do the initial setup is use Zend_Locale to detect the users language via their OS/browser settings. But, if you do this you should always let users override your detected value (and save it in a session or db setting) This is something that is entirely up to you. You'll be hard pressed to find a "standard."
