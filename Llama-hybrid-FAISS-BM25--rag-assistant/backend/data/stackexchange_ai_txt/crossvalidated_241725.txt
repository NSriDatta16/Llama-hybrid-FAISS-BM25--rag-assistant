F score is computed for the first feature, and another score is computed for the second feature. But it does not indicate anything on the combination of both features , this is the weakness of F score. SVM, Random Forests, lasso or many algorithms can be considered based on type of data and model being used. What can help there is sub sampling the data and running the selection algorithms on the subsets. If the results are consistent across the subsets, it is relatively safe to trust the stability of the method on this particular data and therefor straightforward to interpret the data in terms of the ranking.
