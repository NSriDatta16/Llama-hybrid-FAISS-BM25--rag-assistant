I hacked away at creating a "blocking" modal dialog, by having a custom control that has a vertical- and horizontal alignment as stretch, and then add that as a child of the layout of the current control. e.g. and then in the custom control Utilities.UITools.MessageBox x = new Utilities.UITools.MessageBox(); x.SetError(e.Result); this.LayoutRoot.Children.Add(x); Depending on what has to be displayed in the modal, I dynamically add controls to the modal layout. Clearly, not an elegant solution, but at least it works.
