sasb's and michaelpryor's answer appears to be correct, but if it's not working for you, try this alternative: - (void)applicationDidFinishLaunchingUIApplication *)application { application.statusBarOrientation = UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeRight; } Or this one: [[UIDevice currentDevice] setOrientation:UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeRight]; Or this one: [application setStatusBarOrientation: UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeRight animated:NO]; You may also have to call window makeKeyAndVisible; first. A few links: Developing in landscape mode , iPhone SDK: How to force Landscape mode only? @Robert: please refer to The iPhone SDK, NDA, and Stack Overflow .
