Have you tried the Internet search ? The results should be able to answer most, if not all, of your questions. The topics of your interest sound like rather general or high-level. I'm sure that they can, in one form or another, be applied in the data science context . In my opinion, those topics are more related to operations research (OR) , therefore, I would recommend you to perform some research on the Internet on the intersections between control systems (theory) and data science. Having said that, first thing that comes to my mind is that the most likely candidate for use of control theory concepts and methods in data science context would be distributed systems and algorithms for data analysis , such as MapReduce ( Hadoop , etc.), as well as other parallel processing systems . If there exist an intersection between OR's area of optimization and control theory, then it very well could be used for big data algorithms optimization , among other tasks.
