How to rotate a bitmap when drawing a subset of it?

I am using pCanvas.drawBitmap(mBitmap, mRectSrc, mRectDst, mPainter); to draw a subset of a bitmap. I wondering how I can rotate that bitmap without affecting the view. In my attempts, when I set the canvas to rotate the whole view (viewport) is rotated. This is not what I want.
