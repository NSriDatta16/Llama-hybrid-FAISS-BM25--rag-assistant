What is the difference between storing data from ten experiments in ten datasets, as compared to storing it in single dataset with additional column for marking the experiment identifier? There is no difference and the choice of method for storing the data would reflect rather the practical, then statistical considerations. As about analyzing the data, you should ask yourself if the experiments are "the same thing", or more formally, if they are exchangable . In most cases if you have multiple experiments on the same thing, then you would analyze the data in a single model, but taking into consideration also the fact that you had multiple experiments, e.g. by using additional dummy variables for marking the experiments. In such case, your model would estimate some kind of overall effect of your experiments and the individual effects for each of the experiments. If it doesn't matter what experiment does your data come from, then your model should estimate that the individual effects of experiments are close to zero, and your model would de facto simplify to model that does not use information about particular experiments. On another hand, if it makes a difference where did the data come from, then your model should be able to find such effects. In such case you should pay greater attention to finding why it matters where did the data come from (maybe the experiments were not the same, there were some problems with sticking to the experimental procedure, or with the data itself, etc.).
