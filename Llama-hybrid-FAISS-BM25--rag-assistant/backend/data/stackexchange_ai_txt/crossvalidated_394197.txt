This is an a fascinating question that I've pondered over a lot also, and can come up with a few explanations why. Neural networks work nothing like the brain. Backpropagation is unique to neural networks, and does not happen in the brain. In that sense, we just don't know the general learning algorithm in our brains. It could be electrical, it could be chemical, it could even be a combination of the two. Neural networks could be considered an inferior form of learning compared to our brains because of how simplified they are. If neural networks are indeed like our brain, then human babies undergo extensive "training" of the early layers, like feature extraction, in their early days. So their neural networks aren't really trained from scratch, but rather the last layer is retrained to add more and more classes and labels.
