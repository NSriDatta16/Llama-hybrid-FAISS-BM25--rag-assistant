The spec seems to list header as a block level element, http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/2007-10-26/multipage/section-documents0.html#block-level0 But since HTML5 is not finalized yet, it's understandable that user agent vendors don't automatically make them block-level. So you should just make a rule setting those html 5 elements defined as block by the spec to be display:block; .
