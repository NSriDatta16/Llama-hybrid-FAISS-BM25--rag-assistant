Semi-Supervised Learning The combination of unsupervised learning and supervised learning is referred to as semi-supervised learning , which is the concept that I believe you are searching for. Label propagation is often cited when outlining the heuristics of semi-supervised learning . The essence is to employ clustering, but to use a tiny set of known cases in order to derive (or propogate) the labels of the clusters. Hence one is able to use a small set of labeled cases to classify a much larger set of unsupervised data. Here are some references: Wikipedia has an entry on the semi-supervised learning . The scikit learn User Guide is often a useful starting point and has a label propogation routine . There are, in fact, papers treating semi-supervised random forest models . Another one here Hope this helps!
