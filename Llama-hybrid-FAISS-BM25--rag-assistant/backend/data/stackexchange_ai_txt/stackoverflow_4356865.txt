malloc ing an array of pointers is done as follows: self->ourArray = malloc(5 * sizeof(NSString *)); if (self->ourArray == NULL) /* handle error */ for (int i=0; i ourArray[i] = nil; malloc doesn't make guarantees about the contents of the returned buffer, so set everything to nil explicitly. calloc won't help you here, as a zero pattern and nil / NULL aren't the same thing. Edit : even though zero and null may be the same on i386 and arm, they are not the same conceptually, just like NULL and nil are strictly not the same . Preferably, define something like void *allocStringPtrs(size_t n) { void *p = malloc(sizeof(NSString *)); if (p == NULL) // throw an exception for (size_t i=0; i
