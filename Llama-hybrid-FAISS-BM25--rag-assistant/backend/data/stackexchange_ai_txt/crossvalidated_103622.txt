How do I interpret $b$? Does this mean that a 1 percentage point increase in X, increases the growth rate by 0.07 percentage points? A 1 percentage point increase in X increases the difference in the log of $Y$ by 0.07 percentage points ( on average ), for $Y_{i,t-1}$ held constant. If you think of the difference in the log of $Y$ as growth rate (which it sort of is), then yes.
