Sorting problem in Java

I am having some trouble sorting some arrays and getting an error by the compiler when I do try so. I have also tried doing it as Arrays.sort but, no luck. import java.util.Scanner; public class CH6PA { private static double difficulty; private static int score; private double[] average = new double[7]; public static void main(String[]args) { Scanner keyboard = new Scanner (System.in); do { System.out.println("Enter the level of difficulty (1.2-3.8)"); difficulty = keyboard.nextDouble(); } while (difficulty 3.8); int[] judge = new int[7]; for(int i = 0; i 0 && score
