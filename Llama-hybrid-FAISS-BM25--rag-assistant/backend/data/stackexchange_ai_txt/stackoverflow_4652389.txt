The main problem I see is that each reducer is effectively going to insert into the database around the same time. If you don't think this will be an issue, I suggest you write a custom Storage method that uses JDBC (or something similar) to insert into the database directly and writing nothing out to HDFS. If you are afraid of performing a DDOS attack on your own database, perhaps collecting the data on HDFS and performing a separate bulk load into mysql would be better.
