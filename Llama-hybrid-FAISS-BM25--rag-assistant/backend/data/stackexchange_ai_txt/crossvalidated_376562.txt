How to tell if your Likert scale score is LOW, AVERAGE, or HIGH?

I found that some Likert Scales doesn't tell you how much you should score to be considered in the LOW, AVERAGE, or HIGH margin? So how do we deal with these scales? If my score is 21 (for example) and the total score for the scale is 40, should we simply assume that since it's close to the middle then this must mean I have an AVERAGE score?
