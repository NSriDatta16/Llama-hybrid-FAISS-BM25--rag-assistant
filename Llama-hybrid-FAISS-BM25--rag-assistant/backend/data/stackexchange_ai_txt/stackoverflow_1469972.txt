XSLT: trying to do a contains() with a full XPath. Why does this fail?

Alerting Variables LDMS Alerts LDSM Alerts Why? Examples Resources Table of Contents - Agent Watcher # Intel vPro # Above is my code sample. The first xsl:if statement always fails and never shows the Agent Watcher text or print me button. Even if the section is filled out in the XML. If the section is there, the first xsl:if statement fails, but the second one, contained in the xsl:for-each shows the content. How do I get this to work. I want to have it encompassing so that if the XML has content in the section it will put it up but if not it wont be empty content with a header or vice versa. Attaching sample XML to process.
