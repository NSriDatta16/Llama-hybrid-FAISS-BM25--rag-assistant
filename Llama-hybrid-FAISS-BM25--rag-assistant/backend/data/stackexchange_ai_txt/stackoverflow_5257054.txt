The simplest solution though not the most elegant is to copy the django-admin.py from the Scripts folder. The Scripts folder will be found under your Python installation . On my computer it is in C:\Python26\Scripts. Then paste the django-admin.py into the folder you are trying to run the file from. It is true that the use of the System path will give flexibility. This is a particular solution if you are in a hurry. Then type for instance python django-admin.py startproject fluffyteaspoons and you will create the project fluffyteaspoons
