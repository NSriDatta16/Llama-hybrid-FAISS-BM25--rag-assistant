WPF, Project White and Infragistics

I am trying to use Project White to write automated tests for my WPF application. It is all going well until I try to interact with Infragistics controls. Has anyone had any experience of this set up and would you be able to post an example of how I can (for example) interact with the XamRibbon or XamOutlookBar?
