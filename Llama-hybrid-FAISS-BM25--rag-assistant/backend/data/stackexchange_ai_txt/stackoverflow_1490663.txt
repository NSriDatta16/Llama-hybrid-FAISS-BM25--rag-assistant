What's the easiest way in VB.NET to parse this XML into objects?

What's the easiest way in VB.NET to parse this XML? Here's an example of the full source: View Source XML I believe that the XML can be read directly into a class structure that matches the XML's structure. Let's take a bit of the XML from the above example, - - 1321 herbert street, Warren, MI X I thought I could use this code, taken from another SO posting, to convert the XML to corresponding objects Imports System.IO Imports System.Text Public Class Xml Public Shared Function SerializeToXMLString(ByVal ObjectToSerialize As Object) As String Dim mem As MemoryStream = New MemoryStream() Dim ser As System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer = New System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer(ObjectToSerialize.GetType()) ser.Serialize(mem, ObjectToSerialize) Dim ascii As ASCIIEncoding = New ASCIIEncoding() Return ascii.GetString(mem.ToArray()) End Function Public Shared Function DeSerializeFromXMLString(ByVal TypeToDeserialize As System.Type, ByVal xmlString As String) As Object Dim bytes() As Byte = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(xmlString) Dim mem As MemoryStream = New MemoryStream(bytes) Dim ser As System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer = New System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer(TypeToDeserialize) Return ser.Deserialize(mem) End Function End Class ..but the problem is, how the heck do I define these objects-even for the scaled-back simple example? For example, the kml part is confusing.. I started out with this class... Public Class kml Public Class Response Public Name As String Public Status As String End Class End Class ..but wen I run this code: Dim kml As kml kml = CType(Xml.DeSerializeFromXMLString(GetType(kml), XmlDoc.OuterXml), kml) ..I get a parsing error. I also tried this: Public Class kml Private _Response As New Response Public ReadOnly Property Response() As Response Get Return _Response End Get End Property End Class Public Class Response Public name As String Public Status As String End Class I know I'm probably way off here. Someone please push me in teh right direction... thx Follow up question. How do I handle nested collections, for example, the Placemark collection in this example?
