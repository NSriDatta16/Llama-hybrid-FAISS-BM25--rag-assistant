sharepoint validate custom field

I cave created a custom list in sharepoint (created and provisioned to the 12 hive) how can i perform validation on certain fields of the list when a new list item is added? i think i can do it through the "itemadding" event reciever, but is there a more elegant sharepoint way? eg i just want to check an email field has a valid email format.
