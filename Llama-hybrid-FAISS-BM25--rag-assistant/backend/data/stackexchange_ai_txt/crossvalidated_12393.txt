I'm currently having a similar problem. I also believe that the approach to calculate the total effect of w is correct. I believe this can be tested via h0: b2 + b3 * mean(x) = 0; ha: b2 + b3 * mean(x) != 0 However, I stumbled upon a paper by Ai/Norton, who claim that "the magnitude of the interaction effet in nonlinear models does not equal the marginal effect of the interaction term, can be of opposite sign, and its statistical significance is not calculated by standard software." (2003, p. 123) So perhaps you should try to apply their formulas. (And if you understand how to do that, please tell me.) PS. This seems to resemble the chow-test for logistic regressions. Alfred DeMaris (2004, p. 283) describes a test for this.
