Clustering groups based on frequency and last date of choice

I have data coming in the following format: UserId, GroupId, Frequency (how many times the user chose the group), Max timestamp (the last time the user chose the group). Based on this dataset we need to figure out which groups look alike. I was thinking of using collaborative filtering but I have 3 concerns: We don't have any knowledge of "Dislikes"; we only know which groups users "Like". We don't really have ratings. In other words, users don't rate the group. Either they choose OR they don't. Frequency doesn't really imply interest level. Should I use value '1' to imply interest & '0' to imply 'donâ€™t know the interest level'? Should I use collaborative filtering or is there a more appropriate machine learning algorithm? Thanks for your help.
