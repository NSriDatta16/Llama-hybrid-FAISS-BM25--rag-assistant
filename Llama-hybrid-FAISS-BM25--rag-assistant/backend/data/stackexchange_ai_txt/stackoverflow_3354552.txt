Certainly you should never store a password in a plain text file within the document root. What further steps you take to secure it will depend on the level of access you have to configure your webserver. You could define the password in php.ini (or via the ini setting in the Apache config or .htaccess). Or set it in the environment when you start up your webserver. There's no point in just encrypting the password - that means you need to store a decryption key - unless you use the user supplied password with quorum authentication to decrypt the password (but this prevents non-authenticated sessions from accessing the db, and gets messy when you need to add new users to the quorum). If its a cheap hosting package and you have no accessible storage outside the document root then storing the password in a php include file within should prevent it being exposed (file will be parsed by php intead of downloaded). Alternately simply naming the file with a '.ht' at the beginning may prevent remote access. Note your second option is somewhat redundant - if someone can do that much damage to your code then they don't need to extract the password from the running code. Really there's no solution to the problem. C.
