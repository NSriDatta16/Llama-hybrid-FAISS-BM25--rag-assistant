Depends. In general, you'll want to override onSaveInstanceState() and save all the data into the Bundle (it's a simple key/value pair affair) and recreate that in onCreate() (or onRestoreInstanceState(), if you want to separate the code out). However, this is mostly for those instances where the app is destroyed and recreated because the user changed the orientation. If you want the data to be persistent (i.e. you go to that activity, return to the calling activity, possibly even switch to a different app altogether and then come back), I recommend saving everything into your SharedPreferences in onPause() and then put it back in place in onResume(). That way, the data will be in persistent storage and even outlive a system reset.
