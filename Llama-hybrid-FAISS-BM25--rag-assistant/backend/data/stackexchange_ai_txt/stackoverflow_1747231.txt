As RageZ has talked about Zend_Form ... If you're really only after the filtering- and validation-part you don't have to use the (sometimes) bloated and complicated interface of Zend_Form . You can use Zend_Filter_Input , which actually is Zend_Form without forms (the rendering part). You can use the same filters and validators as in Zend_Form but in a conciser way. But every PHP framework should have its own input-sanitation component, so replace Zend_Form / Zend_Filter_Input with the appropriate component of the framework you like to use.
