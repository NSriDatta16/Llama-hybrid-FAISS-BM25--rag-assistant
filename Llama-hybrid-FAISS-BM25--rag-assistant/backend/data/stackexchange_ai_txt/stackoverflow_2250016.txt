It seems that your integration tests are higher level unit tests since you still bind them to one or more classes. Try to pick class that depends on all others (transitively) from the group and associate test with such class. If you have true integration tests then association with concrete classes is of little value. Then tests are classified by application subject areas (domains) and by types of functionality. For example, domains are orders, shipments, invoices, entitlements, etc. and functionality types are transactional, web, messaging, batch, etc. Their permutations would give you nice first cut of how to organize integration tests.
