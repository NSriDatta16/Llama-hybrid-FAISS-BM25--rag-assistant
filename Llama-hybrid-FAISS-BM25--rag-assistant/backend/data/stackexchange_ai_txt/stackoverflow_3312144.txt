Embedding flash files

I have the strangest problem I can't seem to figure out. I have created a simple flash image gallery. Like every other gallery it gets photo information from an XML file. It works fine, I have had no issues working on the flash file locally. However once I uploaded the .swf and .xml (and all the images) I ran into some trouble. The .swf simply does not read the XML file. I'll lay down what I've done so far, hopefully this will expose my error. I read XML data by doing the following in ActionScript 2 xml_parser = new XML (); xml_parser.ignoreWhite = true; xml_parser.onLoad = xml_loaded; xml_parser.load ('http://full/path/to/gallery.xml'); My XML file is done up like so Photo Title Here is some info http://full/path/to/image.jpg http://full/path/to/thumbnail.jpg I embed the .swf the old fashion way Now when I access the html file that I have embedded the gallery into, I get a lot of undefineds and no pictures. However when I access http://path/to/gallery.swf (standalone swf) it works fine I see all the pictures and their descriptions. My question is simply WHY IS THIS. How come the .swf doesn't read the XML when it is embedded into a page of html? I am testing this on Internet Explorer 8
