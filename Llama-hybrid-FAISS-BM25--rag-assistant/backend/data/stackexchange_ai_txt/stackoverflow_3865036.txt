Using a single count for figures and tables in LaTeX

I've been given a LaTeX document to edit with the following code for using a single count for figures and tables. \makeatletter \newcounter{unisequence} \def\ucaption{ \ifx\@captype\@undefined \@latex@error{\noexpand\ucaption outside float}\@ehd \expandafter\@gobble \else \refstepcounter{unisequence} \expandafter\@firstofone \fi {\@dblarg{\@caption\@captype}} } \def\thetable{\@arabic\c@unisequence} \def\thefigure{\@arabic\c@unisequence} \makeatother This works well to give a single counter for captions of tables and figures but, I find that if I click on any of the caption numbers in the .pdf this code generates, I am always returned to the first figure or table in the document rather than the one I want, e.g. clicking on in Table [3] will take me to Table 1 instead. Does anyone know how to fix this? Or can anyone advise an alternative? I am a LaTeX newbie. Thanks Mr Morgan.
