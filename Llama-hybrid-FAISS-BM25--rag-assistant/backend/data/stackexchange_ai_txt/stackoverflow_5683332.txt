There are some things to remember when you work with UTF8 encoded source files: Some editors may add BOM in the beginning of the files - this may damage the script output - you should save you files without BOM. strlen and other string functions may work not as you expecting - you should use multibyte string functions for string length, etc: http://php.net/manual/en/book.mbstring.php regex requires u modifier to work with unicode characters. you should be careful when you work with files - pay attention to the current encoding, because when the file does not contain BOM (see #1) editor may open it in system default encoding. some source code tools may do not work correctly with UTF8 files (because they do not contain BOM, but some of them work incorrectly even when the files have it). From my experience, I can say that it is better sometimes to store strings in resources (text files or so) and do not use UTF8 in code files, but sometimes it is ok - this depends on whether you have problems with it or not.
