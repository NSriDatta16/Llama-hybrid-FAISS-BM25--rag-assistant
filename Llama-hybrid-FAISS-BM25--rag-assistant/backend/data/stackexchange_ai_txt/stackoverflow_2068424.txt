I did read a paper about the method in which a certain music information retrieval service (no names mentioned) does it - by calculating the Short Time Fourier transform over the sample of audio. The algorithm then picks out 'peaks' in the frequency domain i.e. time positions and frequencies that are particularly high amplitude, and uses the time and frequency of these peaks to generate a hash. Turns out the hash has surprising few collisions between different samples, and also stands up against approx 50% data loss of the peak information.....
