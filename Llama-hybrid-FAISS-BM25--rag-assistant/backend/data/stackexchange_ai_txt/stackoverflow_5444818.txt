Android external data storage problems

I'm trying to store data on the SD card, according to the guide here I should be using getExternalFilesDir() (API level 8), I would really like to do so but calling File directory = context.getExternalFilesDir(null); keeps returning null , I'm using my main activity as context. Then I tried reverting to use File dir = Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(); , it correctly returns the SD root, but apparently I am unable to create the suggested "/Android/data/package_name/files/" directory: File root = Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(); File dir = new File(root, GlobalConstants.EXTERNAL_SAVE_DIR); boolean canCreate = dir.mkdirs(); In this code canCreate is false (EXTERNAL_SAVE_DIR is obviously /Android/data/package_name/files/). Is there anything I'm missing, maybe should I ask permissions on the Manifest (I found nothing about)? I've read getExternalFilesDir() has a bug where contents get deleted on application update, I don't really care about that and I would rather use it instead of the other one as I'm trying to conform to API 8 and I like the idea of it handling the directory name for me. Any idea?
