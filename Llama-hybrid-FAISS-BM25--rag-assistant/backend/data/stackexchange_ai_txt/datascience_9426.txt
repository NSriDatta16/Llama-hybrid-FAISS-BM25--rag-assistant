This is not a technical question. You should decide which one is more important for you: the columns or the rows that contain these 277000 NA values. Probably the columns are more important. I recommend deleting the rows at first, building a model (starting from one variable and adding more variables gradually), calculating the model measures (such as adjusted R-Squared) . At this point you have some baseline. Then restore these deleted rows and see how your model measures change. Maybe these 6 columns are not predictors of your response variable and you are worried for nothing. There is no magic to say which method works for your data. Give it a try. This is exactly what is done in statistics and machine learning. After understanding your data better, you can decide to fill your missing values or not. Keep in mind that data analysis is an iterative process.
