The use of the CLT for justifying the use of the Gaussian distribution is a common fallacy because the CLT is applied to the sample mean, not to individual observations. Therefore, increasing your sample size, does not mean that the sample is closer to normallity. The Gaussian distribution is commonly used because: Maximum likelihood estimation is straightforward. Bayesian inference is simple (using conjugate priors or Jeffreys-type priors). It is implemented in most of the numerical packages. There is a lot of theory about this distribution in terms of hypothesis testing. Lack of knowledge about other options (more flexible). ... Of course, the best option is to use a distribution that takes into account the characteristics of your context, but this can be challenging. However, is something that people should do "Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler." (Albert Einstein) I hope this helps. Best wishes.
