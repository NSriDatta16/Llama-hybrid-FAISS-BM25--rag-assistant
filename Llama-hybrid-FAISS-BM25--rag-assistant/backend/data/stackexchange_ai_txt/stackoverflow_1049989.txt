Percentage Error for 2 sets of 3D points

I have a reference set of n points, and another set which 'approximates' each of those points. How do I find out the absolute/percentage error between the approximation and my reference set. Put in other words, I have a canned animation and a simulation. How do I know how much is the 'drift' between the 2 in terms of a single number? That is, how good is the simulation approximating the vertices as compared to those of the animation. I actually do something like this for all vertices: |actual - reference|/|actual| and then average out the errors by dividing the number of verts. Is this correct at all?
