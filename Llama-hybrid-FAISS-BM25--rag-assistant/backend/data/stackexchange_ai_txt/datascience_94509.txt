Good books or resources for better understanding mathematical notation used in Machine Learning / Deep Learning Papers

Can anybody recommend any books or resources that would be good for better understanding the mathematical notation that is often seen in ML/DL papers? Preferably with examples of how the notation can be "transcribed" into tensorflow code. I did Linear Algebra and Vector calculus in uni a long time ago but it is a long way back and I would like to get back up to speed with it. This question I think is not what I am looking for because I would like to see an emphasis on how one can transcribe the math into code.
