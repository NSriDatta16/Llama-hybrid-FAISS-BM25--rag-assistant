VSS: Move file from one folder to another?

Is there a way in Visual SourceSafe to move a file from one directory to another while retaining its history? Edit I actually found a round about way to do this. First I drag the file I want to move to the directory I want to move it to, this creates a "Link" to the file there and then I "permanently destroy" the file in its original location. Does this actually do what I thing it does?
