The MCMC algorithm is closely related to Simulated Annealing (SA), in that both explore a surface stochastically, using the Metropolis acceptance criterion for proposed points. We provide parameters that permit use of the MCMC routine for SA, though this is not the primary focus of the feature. source: vensim
