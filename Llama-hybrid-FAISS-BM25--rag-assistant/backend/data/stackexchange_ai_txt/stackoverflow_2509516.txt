The question of elegance is of course subjective but the following example will do exactly what you want, including separate error messages for the 2 invalid conditions i.e both values provided and no values provided. class Foo EDIT Thinking of more solutions then this might pass the elegance test better errors.add_to_base("You must provide either a foo or a bar") unless [f.foo, f.bar].compact.length == 1 Although this will fail on space filled fields.
