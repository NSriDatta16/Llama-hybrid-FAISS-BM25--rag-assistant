By Map Routing, you mean finding the shortest path along a street network? Dijkstra shortest-path algorithm is the best known. Wikipedia has not a bad intro: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm There's a Java applet here where you can see it in action: http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/people/JamesStewart/270/9798s/Laffra/DijkstraApplet.html and Google you lead you to source code in just about any language. Any real implementation for generating driving routes will include quite a bit of data on the street network that describes the costs associate with traversing links and nodesâ€”road network hierarchy, average speed, intersection priority, traffic signal linking, banned turns etc.
