Does applying ARMA-GARCH require stationarity?

I am going to use the ARMA-GARCH model for financial time series and was wondering whether the series should be stationary before applying the said model. I know to apply ARMA model the series should be stationary, however I'm not sure for ARMA-GARCH since I'm including GARCH errors which imply volatility clustering and non-constant variance and hence non-stationary series no matter what transformation I do. Are financial time series usually stationary or non-stationary? I tried applying ADF test to a few volatile series and got p-value Can somebody clear that up for me?I'm getting really confused
