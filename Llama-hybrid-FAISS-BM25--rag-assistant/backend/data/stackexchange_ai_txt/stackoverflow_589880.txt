FileSystemWatcher is a pragmatic way of getting early visibility of a file drop, but there are a lot of edge-cases that can cause missed events. You would still need a periodic sweep to be sure. To avoid as many mutex issues; could the clients upload as foo.xml.upload, and then rename to foo.xml one there? That would avoid a lengthy locked file... (you just ignore the .upload ones). Also: beware "not invented here"... there are many existing utilities that monitor folders; BizTalk for (an overkill) example. I'm not saying "don't do it yourself", but at least consider pre-canned options.
