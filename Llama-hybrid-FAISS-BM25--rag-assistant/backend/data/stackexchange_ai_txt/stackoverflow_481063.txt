What's an easy way to access prebuild macros such as $(SolutionDir) and $(DevEnvDir) from code in C#?

Right now I'm thinking write the paths to a file in the pre-build event and then read from that file in the code, but I'm wondering if there's an easier more elegant way. edit: This is sort of a follow up to Help with one step build all projects + installer (.NET + WiX) since I didn't really get an answer to that, seeing if I can get an answer to a simpler question.
