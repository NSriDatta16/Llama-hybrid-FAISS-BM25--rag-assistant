Given yelp data, how to find top 100 restaurants in America?

Every year, Yelp released top 100 places to eat in America based on their data. I'm wondering how to design a machine learning algorithm to do this? This is definitely an open question. My basic idea is to build a ranking algorithm based on users' rate. Can anyone give some ideas? Or is there paper about this kind of topic? I also do not know does this question fit in this forum. If not, please let me know.
