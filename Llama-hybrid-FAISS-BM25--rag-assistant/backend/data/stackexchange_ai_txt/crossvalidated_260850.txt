Are those that fish more often more likely than a one-timer to catch a specific fish?

I live in the Northern Territory, Australia where for the second year running the government and commercial entities have created a 1 million AUD fish competition to encourage tourism. One tagged and released barramundi if caught anywhere in the many waters within the NT will net the fisher $1 million. My question is given we are talking about a single fish with free reign to travel, are the odds of catching it increased by the number of times someone has a go? I'm inclined to think a person fishing for one day in a single spot has as much chance as a person who goes to a number of places even daily, as this fish is a moving target with a huge playing field. But I am not a statistician. Please enlighten me! PS I think for statistical purposes we would have to disregard the skill of the fisher and their knowledge of waters. Or does that come into play?
