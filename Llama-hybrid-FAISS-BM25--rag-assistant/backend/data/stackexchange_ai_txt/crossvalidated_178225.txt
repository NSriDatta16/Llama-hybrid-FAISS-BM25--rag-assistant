If you're using Pearson's correlation coefficient ($r$, the most widely-used metric), then this isn't the best method. Pearson's $r$ measures the strength of the linear relationship between two quantitative variables. In changing the qualitative variable to a quantitative one, you have to be careful. For example, changing "basic," "intermediate," and "expert" to 30, 60, and 90, respectively, you are in essence saying that the difference between levels "basic" and "expert" is exactly twice as large as the difference between "basic" and "intermediate" as well as exactly twice as large as the difference between "intermediate" and "expert." A more appropriate way to do this is to use a linear model (regression) and use indicator variables. When you interpret the coefficients in your model, you will have one level as your "reference level." You can think of this as your baseline. The coefficients of the other two levels will indicate the average difference in your outcome $Y$ between your reference level and the level corresponding to that coefficient. If your model is $[Exam Note] = \beta_0 + \beta_{intermediate}X_1 + \beta_{expert}X_2$, then $\beta_{intermediate}$ indicates the average difference in exam note between basic and intermediate skill levels.
