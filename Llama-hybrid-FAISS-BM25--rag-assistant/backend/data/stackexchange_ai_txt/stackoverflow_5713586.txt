Passing python objects across interpreters

I would like to exchange objects between two python interpreters working on the same (and different ) machines. Is there a mechanism to achieve the same? ~Vijay To be more specific: I have few processes running on same (and different) machine(s). Few of these processes produce objects which are consumed by the other processes. I am trying to tackle a producer/consumer problem among these processes. I was previously running these processes on the same python interpreter as threads, and was able to use queues to solve the producer-consumer problem. However due to increasing loads I have decided to shift some processes to other machines. Now these processes residing on different machines(and interpreters) need to share the access to a queue. I would like to know if there is a mechanism which helps me do this efficiently. I could write a single class which manages the queue and handles the objects to/from the other processes using sockets. I think this is a common problem if one wants to use python to handle large amounts of data. Hence I was interested to know if there were other more elegant solutions available. ~Vijay
