Credit to Rgrove who developed this library: http://github.com/rgrove/storage-lite It covers all the possible use cases for storing persistent data using local storage and not cookies. This library uses YUI but it is easy to make it work with prototype.js: the core remains exactly the same. Compatible with IE6+, Firefox 2+, Safari 3.1+, Chrome 4+, and Opera 10.5+ without any further installation.
