Developing the design and architecting skills with OOP in mind is the most desirable skillset for a great language agnostic career. The benifit when you code in Oops is both for the other team members out there and for the organization as a whole. Because the code will be understandable to all and if the developers quit the job, company doesnt need to worry much. In the other case if you follow functional style it will be real hard for others to understand what you have done.
