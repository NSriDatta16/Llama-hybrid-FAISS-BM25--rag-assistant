Does it matter if real data will be imbalanced, if the ML model was trained on a balanced dataset?

I have trained a machine learning model (supervised, classification, LinearSVC) on a balanced dataset, which produces relatively good results on the test data. I am happy with the numbers, but not confident about the application in real life. However, in real life, I anticipate the incoming data will be highly imbalanced - that is, up to 99% of values will be coming from class A, and only 1% from class B. Will this somehow affect my model performance, and does this make my results somewhat less reliable? If that is the case, should I take a different approach?
