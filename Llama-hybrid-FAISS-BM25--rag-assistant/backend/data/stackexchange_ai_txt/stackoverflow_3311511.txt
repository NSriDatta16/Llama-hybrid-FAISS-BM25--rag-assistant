For the most part MS did not make that many breaking changes between 1.x and 2.0. 3.0 and 3.5 are library released that just extended the 2.0 runtime with things like LINQ, WCF, WPF and WF. 4.0 has many breaking changes does to a reorganization to support the Client Profile (the libraries avilable on a cutdown client like the Windows Phone) vs the full profile (what you would run on a server). @Zai based on your comment I have always found the Programming C# series a great survey of what exists within C# and the .NET Framework.
