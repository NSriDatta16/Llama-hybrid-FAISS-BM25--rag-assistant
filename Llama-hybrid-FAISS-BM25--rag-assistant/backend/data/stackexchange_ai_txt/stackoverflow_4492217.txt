Extract content in paragraph Tags

I have following html in string and i have to extract the content only in Paragraph tags any ideas?? link is http://www.public-domain-content.com/books/Coming_Race/C1P1.shtml I have tried const string HTML_TAG_PATTERN = " ]+.*?>"; static string StripHTML(string inputString) { return Regex.Replace(inputString, HTML_TAG_PATTERN, string.Empty); } it removes all html tags but i dont want to remove all the tags because this is the way how i can get content like paragraph by tags secondly it makes line breaks to \n in text and and applying replace("\n","") dose not helps one problem is that when i apply int UrlStart = e.Result.IndexOf(" "), urlEnd = e.Result.IndexOf(" &nbsp; \r" ); string paragraph = e.Result.Substring(UrlStart, urlEnd); extractedContent.Text = paragraph.Replace(Environment.NewLine, ""); &nbsp; \r this appears at the end of paragraph but urlEnd dose not makes sure only paragraph is shown the string extracted is shown in visual studio is like this this page is downloaded by Webclient End of HTMLpage We will provide ourselves with ropes of\rsuitable length and strength- and- pardon me- you must not\rdrink more to-night. our hands and feet must be steady and\rfirm tomorrow.\"\r &nbsp; \r \r\r \r \r \r \r \r 1 &nbsp;\r \r Next \r \r \r \r \r The Coming Race -by- Edward Bulwer Lytton \r Encyclopedia - Books - Religion - Links - Home - Message Boards This Wikipedia content is licensed under the GNU Fr
