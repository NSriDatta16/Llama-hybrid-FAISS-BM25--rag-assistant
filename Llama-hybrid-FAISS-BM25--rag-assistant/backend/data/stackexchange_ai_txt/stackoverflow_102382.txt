ssh-agent with passwords without spawning too many processes

I use ssh-agent with password-protected keys on Linux. Every time I log into a certain machine, I do this: eval `ssh-agent` && ssh-add This works well enough, but every time I log in and do this, I create another ssh-agent. Once in a while, I will do a killall ssh-agent to reap them. Is there a simple way to reuse the same ssh-agent process across different sessions?
