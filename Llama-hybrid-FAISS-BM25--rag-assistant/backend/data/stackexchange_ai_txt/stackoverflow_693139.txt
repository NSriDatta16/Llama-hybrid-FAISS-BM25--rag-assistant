What are convincing examples where pointer arithmetic is preferable to array subscripting?

I'm preparing some slides for an introductory C class, and I'm trying to present good examples (and motivation) for using pointer arithmetic over array subscripting. A lot of the examples I see in books are fairly equivalent. For example, many books show how to reverse the case of all values in a string, but with the exception of replacing an a[i] with a *p the code is identical. I am looking for a good (and short) example with single-dimensional arrays where pointer arithmetic can produce significantly more elegant code. Any ideas?
