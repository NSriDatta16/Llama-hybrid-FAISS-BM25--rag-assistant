I use Method 3. Blobstore may require an extra fetch, but db.BlobProperty does not. For objects where it is important that it comes out of storage exactly as it was put in I use PickleProperty (which can be found in tipfy, and some other utility libraries). For objects where I just need its state stored I wrote a JsonProperty function that works similarly to PickleProperty (but uses SimpleJson, obviously). For me getting all data in a single fetch, and being idiot-proof, is more important than cpu performance (in App Engine). According to the Google I/O talk on AppStats, a trip to the datastore is almost always going to be more expensive than a bit of local parsing.
