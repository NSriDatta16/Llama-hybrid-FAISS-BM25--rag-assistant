Upgrading to JUnit4 and keeping legacy JUnit 3 tests and test suites by running them together

I was surprised not to find the answer so far. If I am missing something basic I will be more than happy to know that. There is a large legacy code base that was upgraded to Java 6 (from 1.4). Large number of JUnit 3 tests are present in the code and are organized into test suite that runs successfully with JUnit 4 default runner in Eclipse. Now, I am adding new tests that are pure JUnit 4 tests (annotations, no TestCase, etc.). What would be a way of running both old JUnit 3 test suite and new JUnit 4 tests together?
