Complex GUI in clojure

I just started using clojure today (however , I have used Java a lot and know of functional paradigms) and I was wondering if it was a good idea to build a clojure app with a reasonable complex interface (dragging, dropping, panning, zooming,...) using Swing? I can imagine that a lot of the normal swing logics (especially concerning OO) has to be bypassed one way or the other.. I asume that all is possible , but is it possible in a way that justifyable? I mean wouldn't it be like hitting a nail with a screwdriver in stead of with a hammer? Has anyone here have experience in building GUI's with Clojure (and of Course : is Swing the ideal candidate for that?) Thanks !
