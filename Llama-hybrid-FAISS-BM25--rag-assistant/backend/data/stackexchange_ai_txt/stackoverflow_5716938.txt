Javascript Regular expressions matching sentence

I have the following example paragraph: The following is my text. My introductory line of text is the this, that and the other. My second line is much the same as before but completely different. Don't even talk about my third line of text. I would like the capture the following sentence using regular expressions: My introductory line of text is the this, that and the other. The code I have thus fare is: (\bMy\sintroductory\sline\sof\stext).*(\.) But this gets all the text. How would I capture until the first fullstop only?
