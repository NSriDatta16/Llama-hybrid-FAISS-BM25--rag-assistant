unfortunately, Google Maps only supports static route computation. When I talk about satic it means that the system considers only the route and the average speeds, which are fixed, to determine travel time. Taking buses into account would require a comprehensive knowledge of bus lines, stops and timetables. It's not impossible to do, but it is really hard. Just for an example, the estimated bus travel time must take into account the waiting time for the next bus at the stop, and it must have then knowledge of timetables too! (not only lines and speeds). The same applies merging bus and underground (where available). I hope believe that, in the future, Google Maps will be able to provide these information too.
