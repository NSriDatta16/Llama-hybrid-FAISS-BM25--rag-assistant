What GUI Framework would you recommend

Management wants us to switch to Infragistics. But my boss says that any 3rd party is destined to fail, and at that point there won't be anything we can do about it. Is he right, is he wrong? I don't know. What are your opinions, is it better to use something developed inside the company, or do you prefer something like DevExpress, Infragistics, Krypton to name a few or is there something else even better that you would recommend instead?
