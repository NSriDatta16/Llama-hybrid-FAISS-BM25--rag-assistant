PCA is not the only dimensionality reduction that can be used, there are plenty of other methods, e.g. you may consider feature extraction to extract distinctive features from your data (with different lengths). FFT on a sliding window; overlapped or not, might be a good option, DCT of the results of FFT or without might be another option, it all depends on the Data used.
