Use an absolute URL in the js file e.g. '/project/xml/xmlfile.xml' If you want it to be more general than that, there are other things you could do, like reading the current url and building the ajax url from that. Update: responding to comment An example of how you might generate the proper path. If projects are always the first subdirectory, this should work to build the proper url. function xml_url(){ var first_dir_regexp = /https?:\/\/[^\/]+\/([^\/]+)\/.+/; matches = first_dir_regexp.exec(document.location.toString()); return matches[1]+"/xml/xmlfile.xml"; } //... xml_url() This code uses a regexp to pull out the first directory of a url and appends /xml/xmlfile.xml to it. e.g. if the page is example.com/project1/awesome/index.html, it returns example.com/project1/xml/xmlfile.xml Note this code is pretty fragile, you would probably want to add some checks to it. It's just an example. If your projects are more than one level deep, you should consider adding some config settings that let the javascript know more about the environment it is running in.
