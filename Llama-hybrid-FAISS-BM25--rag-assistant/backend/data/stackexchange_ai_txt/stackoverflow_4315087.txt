There are open source tools which allow to translate resx files. I haven't found a version which uses a online translation service such as google translate or the microsoft translator api or even the bablefish. But I think the Resx Translation Helper (open source project) should be very easy to modify. Note however, that the author explicitly discourage the usage of autogenerated translation: It does NOT automatically translate because user-translation is currently still much better than automated translation.
