Generalized variance in PCA

This generalized variance is a term that I have trouble understanding, simply because I can't find much on it on the internet,.i.e. which is the formula and some of its advantages and/or disadvantages? I came across this question while reading multivariate statistics and then in PCA, where I have stumbled upon the following two problems. Suppose that two variables have total variance equal to 10. And generalized variance equal to 9. Both variables have equal variances. Find the correlation of the two variables. Suppose that a Princepal Component(PC) explains the 90% of the total variance. One variable has variance equal to 10. Find the correlation between that variable and the PC.
