How to draw a plot with mean and CI?

I want to draw a plot in Matlab or Stata. I have a mean and CI for some distribution. there should be a line with the upper end of the line representing the upper CI and the lower end the lower CI and the middle, the average. I am not sure how to do it or how to search for it. Can anyone kindly help me out ? Thanks. NB: is there a way to connect these CI ? (with straight lines ? 3 straight lines)
