Be very clear what you are testing. Sounds like currently they test 150 devices, 1 (or a few) PCs and one server. That's a long way from 150x150devices, 150 PCs and 1 server. So is the goal to stress the server, the PC? To determine behaviour under stress? To exercise particular paths? Sounds like you intend to build some software to run on PC (LoadProducer) that shall emulate the devices, and fire the LoadProducer against the real PC. Hopeing to emulate people pressing buttons. I think that this potentially has a lot of value. As to bells and whistles, my advice is first to get a simple command/file driven version going and then consider whether you can afford to build the UI. UIs are effort sinks, if you don't get the function right first you'll allow your attentions to be diverted towards prettyness. I would not be too concerned about the number of devices you can emulate, surely it's many, if it's not 150, then presumably you just use several LoadProducers. If I really wanted to exercise the PC code then I might also want to emulate the server, or create a test version of the server code that can do amusing things such as go really slow, or send spurious answers.
