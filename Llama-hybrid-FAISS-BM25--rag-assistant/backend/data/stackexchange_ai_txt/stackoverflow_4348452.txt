python packaging for relative imports

First off all: I'm sorry, I know there has been lots of question about relative imports, but I just didn't find a solution. If possible I would like to use the following directory layout: myClass/ __init__.py test/ demo.py benchmark.py specs.py src/ __init__.py myClass.py Now my questions are: How do the test files from within the package properly import myClass.py? How would you import the package from outside, assuming you take myClass as submodule in libs/myClass or include/myClass? So far I couldn't find an elegant solution for this. From what I understand Guido's Decision it should be possible to do from ..src import myClass but this will error: ValueError: Attempted relative import in non-package Which looks as it doesn't treat myClass as packages. Reading the docs : The __init__.py files are required to make Python treat the directories as containing packages; It seems I'm missing something that specifies where the scripts of the package are, should I use .pth ?
