R Mediation with continuous predictor and binary logistic regression models

I am running a mediation model using the r mediation package, but I am not getting the correct output for my variable types. I have a continuous predictor, but the output is treating my predictor as a categorical variable. In short: Predictor = cognitive test score [Composite_Z] (continuous) Mediator = self-awareness [Awareness] (dichotomous; variable type = numerical in order to run mediation) Outcome = driving frequency [DRFRQ] (dichotomous) 10 Covariates = Age (continuous), Sex (dichotomous), Race (dichotomous), Education (dichotomous), Severity (continuous), Time (continuous), Seizures (dichotomous), Income (ordinal), Motor (continuous), UrbanRural (ordinal) I have two models that are going into my mediation analysis (both of these run fine without issues)-- Model #1 : binary logistic regression examining the relationship between cognition (predictor) and self-awareness, while accounting for the covariates. R code: fit.a.A3H1 Model #2 : binary logistic regression examining the relationship between cognition (predictor) and driving frequency (outcome), while accounting for self-awareness (mediator) and the covariates. R code: fit.total.A3H1 Mediation model : Then, I put those models (outlined above) into my mediation analysis. I am using the R mediation package to run the analysis. R code: fitMed.A3H1 Output: Causal Mediation Analysis Quasi-Bayesian Confidence Intervals Estimate 95% CI Lower 95% CI Upper p-value ACME (control) -0.001007 -0.004191 0.00 0.27 ACME (treated) -0.000686 -0.002933 0.00 0.27 ADE (control) 0.031882 0.003696 0.06 0.03 * ADE (treated) 0.032203 0.003727 0.06 0.03 * Total Effect 0.031196 0.004744 0.05 0.03 * Prop.

Does anyone know why I'm running into this problem and ways I could fix it? Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated! What's also strange is that I do not have this problem when I run a separate mediation analysis with the same predictor/mediator/covariates (but a different outcome variable that is continuous instead of dichotomous). This separate mediation analysis is made up of a (1) binary logistic regression model and (2) linear regression model, and the output shows only the overall ACME/ADE/etc (i.e., there are not groups).
