Move Canvas In Reverse Direction

I have two canvases. Currently, when I drag a rectangle inside of the first canvas, it also moves the rectangle in the second canvas. I do this using TranslateTransform. What I want to do is when I drag rectangle (A) to the left, rectangle (B) moves to the right, and vice versa etc. Is there a relatively easy way to do this? Chris
