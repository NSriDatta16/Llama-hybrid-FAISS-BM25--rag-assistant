why auto-correlation still exists after accounting for AR1

I have a dataset including several yearly time series of different sites. I established a predictive climateâ€“abundance association using M1 To fix the auto-correlation, I have tried both increase the k value for s(Year) and s(Year,by=site) as suggested, and also include AR1 (also tried ARMA with combinations of p=1 or 2 and q=1 or 2), but the model still have autocorrelation. For example, I fitted with AR1: M2 And fitted with ARMA(1,3): I'm confused why the autocorrelation structure doesn't account and is there anything missed in the model? Thanks.
