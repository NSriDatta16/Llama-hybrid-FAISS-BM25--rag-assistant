length of time series to estimate $\phi_2$ for an AR(2)

So I have this question that I am kinda stumped on... I have an AR(2) model with $\phi_1=0.4$ $\phi_2=0.5$, I need to find how long of a time series I would need to estimate $\phi_2$ with 95% confidence that the estimate is no more than $\pm0.15$ normally when I am working with linear regression I would just calculate SSE and divide by n-2 to get the standard error of the model. My problem is that I have no data and am at loss as to what equation I would use to estimate n. I know how to estimate $\phi_k$ for k=1,2,3... on rstudio but not what the actual equation that is used to generate the results. So perusing my book I found that CI for estimated values of $\phi_k$ is $\pm\frac{2}{\sqrt n }$ so just set $0.15=\frac{2}{\sqrt n}$ and solve for n...yielding $n=178$ ? $$0.15\gt\frac{2}{\sqrt n }$$ so $n\gt177$
