How can I strip line breaks from my XML with XSLT?

I have this XSLT: http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex? Which is being applied to this XML (notice the line break): \text{average} = \alpha \times \text{data} + (1-\alpha) \times \text{average} Unfortunately, the transform creates this: Notice the whitespace character literals. Although it works, it's awfully messy. How can I prevent this?
