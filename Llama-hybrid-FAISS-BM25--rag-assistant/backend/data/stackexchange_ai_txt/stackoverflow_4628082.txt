As someone who's written a storage engine plugin, I've found that executing a query from within a MySQL plugin is incredibly difficult. MySQL isn't re-entrant, due to locking within the MySQL process. You could use the MySQL client api (as suggested by chris) to connect to the same server. But it is 99% likely you will simply deadlock the whole server.
