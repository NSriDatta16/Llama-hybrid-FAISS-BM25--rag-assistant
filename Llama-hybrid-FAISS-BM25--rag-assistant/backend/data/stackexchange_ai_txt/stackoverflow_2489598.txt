asp.net update LINQ dbml files

Is there a quick and easy way to update my LINQ dbml files? Right now, if I update a Stored Procedure, I need to open the dbml designer file, delete the old SP, save, drag and drop the new SP, and save again. Dont' get me wrong, this isn't "hard"... just with all the fancy new technology out there, it would be nice to be able to just right-click and hit "update".
