Structure in this context refers to a predetermined model or assumptions related to that model or the underlying sample or population distributions. For example when we use a Linear Regression model to fit the data we assume that the assumptions for linear regressions hold for our data. When we use a random forrest, assumptions about random forrests need to hold. The structure of the model also makes it tractable. A neural network on the other hand has no predetermined structure or assumptions about the underlying distribution of the data. The downside is that the resulting model is not tractable and cannot be interpreted easily.
