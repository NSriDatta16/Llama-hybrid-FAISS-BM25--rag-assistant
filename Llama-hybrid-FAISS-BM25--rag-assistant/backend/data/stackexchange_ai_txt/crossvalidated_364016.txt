Fisher information matrix in logistic regression

I am self-studying the basics of logistic regression. I came across this sentence: In logistic regression expected and observed information matrixes are equal I am aware that the information matrix is part of the MLE, namely the second derivative of the log likelihood function. I came across that statement when I was trying to understand the difference between Newton-Raphson algorithm and Fisher scoring algorithm as optimization algorithms. In Weibull distribution the optimization algorithms are necessary to find the maximum. This leads to my another question: Why MLE for Weibull distribution cannot be determined analytically?
