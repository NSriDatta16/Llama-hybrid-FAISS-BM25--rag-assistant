Draper and Smith, Applied regression analysis , Wiley 3rd edition 1998 is inevitably dated in some respects but there is a good reason for it to have survived to be still in print almost 50 years after first publication. Sheather, A modern approach to regression with R , Springer 2009 is a concise data-oriented coverage. There is Stata code in support as well as R code. Fahrmeir, Kneib, Lang and Marx, Regression: Models, methods and applications , Springer 2013 looks pretty solid and covers more than classical linear regression. There are some authoritative econometrics texts that do an excellent job in explaining which assumptions are important and which are not, but they are often lousy at looking closely and carefully at datasets and using graphics to their full potential. That was, naturally, a personal opinion.
