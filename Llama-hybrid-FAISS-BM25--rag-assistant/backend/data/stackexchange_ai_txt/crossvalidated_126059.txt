If random forests gives me a bad cross-validation score, should I trust it for feature selection?

I get an R^2 value of about 0.22 when I 10-fold cross-validate with my entire dataset. My main use for random forests is to analyze feature interactions. But should I trust the feature importances given, despite it's low R^2 value? Thanks in advacne
