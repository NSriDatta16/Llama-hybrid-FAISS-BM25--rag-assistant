I would split my data into a $train$, $val_1$ set, and $val_2$ set. Fit the ARIMA model to $train$ + $val_1$ and the calculate your residuals, the train the NNet on the residuals from $train$ and test on the residuals from $val_1$. Once you are satisfied with the Neural Net chosen, fit the hybrid ARIMA-ANN model on $train$ + $val_1$ and test on $val_2$. Two comments: The description of ARIMA in the paper (section 2.1) is a little bit dated and iffy - I would use the auto.arima function in R to get similar or better results than what they are describing. This statement from the introduction of the paper: "the neural network model alone is not able to handle both linear and nonlinear patterns equally well." is strange. There's no reason why a suitable chosen NNet architecture can't handle both linear and non linear components together and I don't know where the author is getting it from.
