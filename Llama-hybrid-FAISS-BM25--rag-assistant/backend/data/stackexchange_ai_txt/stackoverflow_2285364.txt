I like Mike B's answer, but here's a possible alternative: use strrchr and substr : $ip = '200.0.0.12'; echo substr(strrchr($ip,'.'),1); One advantage: it's supposed to be (a little) faster then Mike B's answer. In my (very unscientific) timings i got an average runtime of 1.3562 seconds (500.000 iterations) versus 1.6590 seconds for the array_pop / explode version.
