Scapy install issues. Nothing seems to actually be installed?

I have an apple computer running Leopard with python 2.6. I downloaded the latest version of scapy and ran " python setup.py install ". All went according to plan. Now, when I try to run it in interactive mode by just typing "scapy", it throws a bunch of errors. What gives! Just in case, here is the FULL error message.. INFO: Can't import python gnuplot wrapper . Won't be able to plot. INFO: Can't import PyX. Won't be able to use psdump() or pdfdump().
