Constant bit rate is intended for streaming media, so that would be the natural choise. Variable bit rate will give you slightly better quality in relation to file size, but you get much greater variations from the average bit rate. If the average bit rate is close to the capacity of the user's connection, they may experience that the video stops for a while in parts where the bit rate is over the average. So, if the capacity of your user's connection is much higher than the average bitrate that you choose, VBR works better.
