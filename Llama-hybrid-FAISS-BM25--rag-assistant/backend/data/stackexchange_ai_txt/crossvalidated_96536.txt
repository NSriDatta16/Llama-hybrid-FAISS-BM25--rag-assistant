What do empty (missing) values in the output of PCA or factor analysis mean in R?

I am doing factor analysis with factanal in R and observe empty spaces in the loadings table: factanal(x = ~V1 + V2 + V3 + V4 + V5, factors = 2, data = airfoil_self_noise) Uniquenesses: V1 V2 V3 V4 V5 0.898 0.005 0.005 0.995 0.394 Loadings: Factor1 Factor2 V1 -0.319 V2 0.877 -0.474 V3 0.997 V4 V5 0.754 -0.194 Here, I have no idea what empty space means in Factor1-V3, Factor1-V4, Factor2-V1, and Factor2-V4. Weren't they supposed to be filled with some numbers, like with 0? The same sometimes happens in PCA using principal function.
