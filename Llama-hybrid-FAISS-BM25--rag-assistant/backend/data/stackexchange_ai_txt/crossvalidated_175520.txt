Cliffs: (depending on the meaning of 'at random position' in the resampling algorithm), the resampling algorithm proposed in the question loses information contained in the measurements $y_1,\ldots,y_k$. Instead, the resampled values should be selected from the existing values, using for example multinomial resampling. Background This looks like essentially the bootstrap particle filter by Gordon et al., 1993 [1], that is, for $k=1,\ldots$, the particles $x_k$ and weights $w_k$ form an approximation to the distribution of $x_k$ conditional on all measurements. I assume we have $M$ particles. First, the particles are set to some values $x_0^{(i)}$, for $i=1,\ldots,M$ and the weights are set to $w^{(i)} = 1/M$. Then, for each measurement $k$, For $i = 1,2,...,M$: Draw $x^{(i)}_k$ from dynamic model $p(x^{(i)}_k \mid x^{(i)}_{k-1})$ Weight based on dynamic model weights: $w^{(i)}_k = w^{(i)}_{k-1}\,p(y_k \mid x^{(i)}_k)$ Normalize weights to sum to $1$. Possibly resampling: replace the current particles $x^{(1,2,...,M)}_k$ and weights $w^{(1,2,...,M)}_k$ by the result of the resampling algorithm (The dynamic model and measurement model are not completely clear from the question, but the scope of the question is the resampling step anyway, so I assume there is some dynamic and measurement model, at least implicitly). Resampling The purpose of the resampling step is to obtain a new approximation to the filtering distribution, such that the degeneracy problem where one particle gets all weight, is prevented. The problem with the proposed resampling algorithm is that if the new values of the particle are selected 'randomly' with some arbitrary distribution, they do not take into account the measurements obtained so far. And thus do not form a good approximation to the filtering distribution. Instead, typically in the resampling step, the particles are selected from the existing particles. The simplest idea, used in [1], is the so-called multinomial resampling: Input: old particles $x^{(1)}_k,x^{(2)}_k,...,x^{(M)}_k$ Output: new particles $\tilde{x}^{(1)}_k,\tilde{x}^{(2)}_k,...,\tilde{x}^{(M)}_k$. For $i = 1,..., M$: Sample a random integer $J_i$ randomly with probabilities $w^{(1)},w^{(2)},...,w^{(M)}$ Set $\tilde{x}_i := x_{J_i}$ (i.e., select the particle from old particles using the weights as probabilities) Set $\tilde{w}^{(i)}_k := 1/M$ Various other resampling schemes exist, see, e.g., [2].
