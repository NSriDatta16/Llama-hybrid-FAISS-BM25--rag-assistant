javascript arrays on gmaps

i'm newbie in javascript so, in this example exists the geometrycontrols.js (for global controls) and markercontrol.js (for marker controls) my problem is identify the arrays where "data" is saved... at the reference i see a savedata function but i have no idea how work with this function... on the other side, in test.html if i've the outup on the Glog startup and output "data", and let me thinking that comes from array... My objective is save the coordinates and other all atributes to mysql database, and when i discover where are "data" is the easy part. if someone worked with this example (or not) can help me i'm grateful ps: i'm really a newbie on javascript :P edit1: I was out for a time, and now I focus in geometrycontrols.js specially in: GeometryControls.prototype.saveData = function(opts){ var me = this; if(opts.allData === true){ //me.saveAllData(); } else { //construct a json data record var geomInfo = opts.geomInfo, index = opts.geomInfo.index; var record = geomInfo.storage[index]; var recordJSON = {}; recordJSON.type = record.type; recordJSON.coordinates = []; //determine geometry type, and copy geometry appropriately if(record.type === "point"){ recordJSON.coordinates.push({lat:record.geometry.getLatLng().lat(),lng:record.geometry.getLatLng().lng()}); alert(recordJSON.coordinates); } else { alert("is not point"); var vertex; for(var i=0;i When I alert(recordJSON.coordinates), the outupt is [object Object] and i've no idea why, in theory this array contains the coordinates...
