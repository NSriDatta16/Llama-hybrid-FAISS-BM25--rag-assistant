You don't need to do anyting specific for your CI product. StyleCop integrates very well out-of-the-box: You only need to do two things once: put a few StyleCop files into your project folder (and into source control!) add two lines to every .csproj file in your solution. This makes StyleCop run on EVERY compile, no matter if done in Visual Studio or directly with MSBuild, on any machine, without having to install anything. Any StyleCop rule violation will cause a compilation error, so the complete build will fail if your code doesn't adhere to StyleCop's rules.
