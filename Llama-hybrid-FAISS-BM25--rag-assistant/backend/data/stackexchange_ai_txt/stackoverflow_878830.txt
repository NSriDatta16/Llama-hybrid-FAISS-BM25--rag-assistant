I'd consider qualifying the string with an optional suffix: /users/48573/id /users/48573/name If you receive a string without the suffix: /users/48573 then you check the string and see if it's an ID or Name. If you only get a valid ID but not a name then it's a retrieval by ID equivalent to: /users/48573/id If you only get a name back then it's a retrieval by Name equivalent to: /users/48573/name If you can retrieve the value by ID or Name then you return a 300 response error and return links to both possiblities to the client: /users/48573/id /users/48573/name The legacy consumers continue to work 'as is' except for the occasional occurence of duplicate ID/name pairs where they receive the new 300 response error.
