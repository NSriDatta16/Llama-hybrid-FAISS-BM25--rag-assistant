First principal component separate the clusters but other PCs not

I have two sets of vcf files with different samples but from the same population. I merged the two and want to compare the two sets via PCA analysis. Since the two set is from the same population I expect an overlap on the PCA. But when I plot the pca results, (PC1 vs PC2), there is a shift in the first PC but not on the second. When I plot PC2 vs PC3, PC3 vs PC4 etc. there is a nice overlap. Do you know why there is a shift in PC1 only? one set clusters around zero and the other not. The direction is exactly the same.
