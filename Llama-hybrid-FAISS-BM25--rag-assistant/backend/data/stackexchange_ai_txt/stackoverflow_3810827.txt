Usually your code calls CComModule::UpdateRegistryFromResource() which in turn passes control to a special mechanism implemented in ATL which does the job - parses the resource that was produced by embedding the .rgs file into the module and edits the registry. ATL comes with sources so you can just read how it is done.
