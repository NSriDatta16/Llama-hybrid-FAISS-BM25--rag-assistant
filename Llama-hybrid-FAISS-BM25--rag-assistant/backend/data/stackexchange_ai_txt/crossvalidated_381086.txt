Partially answered in comments: Your question appears to be predicated on things that just aren't true. That formula applies only to a bivariate normal distribution and only to a specific probability (that both variables exceed their means). There can be no general formula to translate correlation into conditional probability. Since you have data and the software to work with them, why do you seek such formulas? What is the statistical problem you are trying to address? â€“ whuber AS for your additional question in comments: With reading problems in children, let's say at the age of 8 years, it's useful to be able to predict them from the children's earlier scores on one or more variables, at 4 or 5 years, but it's also useful if you can say, based on the scores on predicting variables, "These children have a chanced of x % of developing reading problems" . This could be addressed by, for instance, logistic regression, or maybe better, if you have a reading score at 8 years and not only a binary response, usual (linear) regression or some variant.
