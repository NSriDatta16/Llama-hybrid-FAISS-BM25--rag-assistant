It seems to me your question is more about how to get your timers to fire even while the app is closed. The answer is you don't. However, you can use local storage on the iPhone to store the most recent time that event XYZ occurred, and when the app starts up again next (say 1 day later), you can compare the current time with the most recently saved time, and quickly update the state before the user sees anything otherwise. The user will be none the wiser, and it will appear as if time actually elapsed within the game world.
