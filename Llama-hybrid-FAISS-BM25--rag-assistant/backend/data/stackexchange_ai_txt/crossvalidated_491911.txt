Dickey-Fuller indicates that stationary Ornstein-Uhlenbeck is non-stationary?

Suppose that I simulate an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes $X=(X_t)$ using this example code (Euler-Maruyama). Using this code, it should be possible to ensure that the time series $X$ is stationary , by sampling its initial value $X_0$ from the stationary distribution of $X$ . Specifically: if $X$ has the coefficients $(\theta, \mu, \sigma)$ then we set $X_0\sim\mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2/(2\theta))$ ; in the given code, this corresponds to setting y_init = np.random.normal(loc=mu, scale=sigma**2/(2theta)) . However, when testing the resulting simulation of $X$ for stationarity using the Dickey-Fuller test the null hypothesis (of non-stationarity) is typically accepted with high $p$ -value: from statsmodels.tsa.stattools import adfuller adfuller(ys) returns statistics such as (-1.366413328210143, # Is this to be expected, or does it indicate that the simulated $X$ is non-stationary?
