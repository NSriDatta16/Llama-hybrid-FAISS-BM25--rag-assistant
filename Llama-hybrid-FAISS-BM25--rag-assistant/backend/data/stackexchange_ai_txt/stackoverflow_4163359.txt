Sure, of course it's slower to process up to 1000 case conditions than say, 10. If this is all you're doing, it's probably not even much compared to the amount of processing that goes into displaying a web page built with the average MVC framework. The important question is how does this perform in the real world, though? Have you noticed there is a performance problem? I'd try a load test on it and see whether the response time is excessive.
