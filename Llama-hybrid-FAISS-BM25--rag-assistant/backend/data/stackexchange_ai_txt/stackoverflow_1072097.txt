Pointers to some good SVM Tutorial

I have been trying to grasp the basics of Support Vector Machines, and downloaded and read many online articles. But still am not able to grasp it. I would like to know, if there are some nice tutorial sample code which can be used for understanding or something, that you can think of, and that will enable me to learn SVM Basics easily. PS: I somehow managed to learn PCA (Principal Component Analysis). BTW, you guys would have guessed that I am working on Machine Learning.
