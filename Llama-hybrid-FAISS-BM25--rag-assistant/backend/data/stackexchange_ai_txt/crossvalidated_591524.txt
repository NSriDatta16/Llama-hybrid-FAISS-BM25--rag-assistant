In this case, your idea seems correct of treating "not disclosed" as a third value of the categorical variable. Are any of the available descriptors correlated with smoking? Blood pressure for example? If so, then you should take care about the choice of model - Random Forest would work better than Logistic Regression in face of the partial correlation.
