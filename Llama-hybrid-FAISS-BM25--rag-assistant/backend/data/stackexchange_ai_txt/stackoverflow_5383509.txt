Most likely you want to compute the spatial index yourself. A spatial index is just a space-filling-curve reducing your 2D problem to a 1D problem and thus make it easier to understand. Instead of picking the spatial index most likely you can pick a nested-string-key from the sfc or quadtree. The nested-key is read from the left to the right and the query for similar keys or lat/lng pairs is hence just a string comparision with every operator possible. I have done a sfc implementation in php at phpclasses.org ( hilbert-curve ). Most likely you want to download it! Or most likely you want to search google for Nick's blog spatial index hilbert curve and quadtree.
