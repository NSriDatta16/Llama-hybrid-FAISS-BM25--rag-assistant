Providing an installer for asmx Webservices

What is the best way to deploy a couple of asmx webservices to IIS. (6.0, 6.1, 7.0) The services are an optional install and I think the most convenient way to install them would be some kind of Windows Installer package. I created a small C# program that directly modifies the IIS Metabase, but this only works on IIS 6.0 and 6.1 and I don't want to ship something that might harm a customers IIS installation. Our services (~10 different .asmx files) are all precompiled and organized in the following structure: /services /serviceA /bin Service.asmx /serviceB /bin Service.asmx /serviceC /bin Service.asmx ... .. .
