Categorical independent variables for logistic regression

I'm currently struggling to find a appropriate method to analyze my experiment. Currently, I have 4 groups of subjects, and each subjects made a choice between 3 options(A or B or No choice). Below table shows a portion of my data. Group Choice 1 A 2 A 2 B 4 A 3 No choice 1 A 2 A My hypothesis is that, being in group 4 makes subjects shift choice from B to A. But I'm confused because there's 4 groups on a single category of independent variable and they're not ordinal. Will it be right to shift my data as below.. Group1 Group2 Group3 Group4 Choice O X X X A X O X X A X O X X B X X X O A X X O X No choice O X X X A X X X X A ..and use (multinomial) logistic regression to predict choice (A or B or Nochoice) from group number? I am thinking of seeing the effect of "being on group4" on increase of number of A choices in baseline of reference to choice B.
