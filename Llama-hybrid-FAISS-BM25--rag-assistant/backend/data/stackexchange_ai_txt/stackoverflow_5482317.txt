Having problem in creating hover effect in grid

well i have little knowledge in JavaScript. My idea is to design a grid look so that whenever user drag some horizontal or vertical object on grid either horizontal or vertical line of gird hovers and he can have idea this is where i have to drop my object. I have made gird using table specifying border-left,now i have grid of some column and row and for showing horizontal and vertical line i am using border with position absolute.now i am not getting how do i get position when mouse goes on border-left or border-right of table(td) so that i can place my border with that gives a hover effect
