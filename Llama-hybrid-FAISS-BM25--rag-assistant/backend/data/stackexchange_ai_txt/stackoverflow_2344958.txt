Embedding a Google Map is different from using the Google Maps API. You have a couple of options here - you can update your MyMap, export is as KML (via the View in Google Earth link) and load it using GGeoXML. Alternatively, you can use the Maps Data API to load data from your My Map and programmatically add it to the map. Here is a sample: http://gmaps-samples.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/college-finder/index.html .
