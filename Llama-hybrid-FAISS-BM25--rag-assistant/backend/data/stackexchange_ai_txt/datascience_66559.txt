Actually HDP require a lot of hidden parameters, which are in code. If you play with such parameters you will get different results (different topics).

User have to define parameters ‘eta’ ‘gamma’ and ‘alpha’ and maximum of topics. If you specify max of topics say about 23 topics, then youк model provide 23 topics in output. If you set up 15 topics then you get 15 topics in output….
