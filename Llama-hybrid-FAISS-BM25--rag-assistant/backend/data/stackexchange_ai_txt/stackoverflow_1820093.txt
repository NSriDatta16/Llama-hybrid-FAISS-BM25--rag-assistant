Bypassing the DAO and working directly with the ADO connector (or native driver) is exactly what everyone does, and there is nothing "nasty" or wrong about it. If these are indeed edge cases for you, then what kind of framework would you expect? What is worse is when people wrap all kinds of weird shenanigans around their DAO to do something it sucks at just in the name of "not going around ". I mean if you have a stored proc, then you have obviously decided that DB agnosticism is out the window (it's a overrated goal anyway) so why have misgivings about using ADO.Net? Just make it very explicit in the code, don't hide it. Say it loud and proud "I'm using the database, and I don't give a flick what anyone thinks!". Oh and please make sure its still seperated from the rest of your logic. I don't want my unit tests to get slow because of your stored proc.
