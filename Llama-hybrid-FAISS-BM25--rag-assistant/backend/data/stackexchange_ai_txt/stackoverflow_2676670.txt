Visual Studio XML comments (summary) and special characters

I have a method in a C# / Wpf project and I'd like to comment / document it using the XML comments like this /// /// Initialises Drag & Drop /// void initDragDrop() { } When I now use this method somewhere in my project and hover the mouse over it, I get the message "XML comment contains invalid XML: At this place, no spaces are allowed" (I translated the text after the colon manually to english, so it may not be literally in your visual studio). I found out the problem is the "&" sign, if I remove it, it works fine. But I want to keep it, so how to I escape it in the XML summary? I tried "\&" but this isn't working. Thanks for any hint!
