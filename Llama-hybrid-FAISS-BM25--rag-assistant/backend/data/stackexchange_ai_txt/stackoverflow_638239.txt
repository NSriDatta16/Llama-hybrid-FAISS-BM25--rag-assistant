XSLT: Walking a tree-like structure

I have an xml document, that has a list of categories: Configurations LCD Monitor CRT Monitor Monitors Printer ... And a list of products: ... 12 ... ... If product's category is equal to 12, then it should be transformed to "Configurations/Monitors/CRT Monitor" (take category 12, then it's parent (13), etc.). If parent is 0, stop. Is there an elegant way to do this using a XSL Transformation?
