Difference between averaging data then fitting and fitting the data then averaging

If any, between fitting a line to multiple separate "experiments" then averaging the fits, or averaging the data from the separate experiments then fitting the averaged data. Let me elaborate: I perform computer simulations which generate a curve, shown below. We extract a quantity, lets call it "A" by fitting the linear region of the plot (long times). The value is simply the slope of the linear region. There is of course an error associated with this linear regression. We typically run 100 or so of these simulations with different initial conditions to calculate an average value of "A". I have been told that it is better to average the raw data (of the plot below) into groups of say 10, then fit for "A" and average those 10 "A"'s together. I have no intuition for whether there's any merit to that or if it is any better than fitting 100 individual "A" values and averaging those.
