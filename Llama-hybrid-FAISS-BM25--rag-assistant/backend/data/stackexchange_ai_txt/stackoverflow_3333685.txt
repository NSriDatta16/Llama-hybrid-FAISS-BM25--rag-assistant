If things are unlikely to change then it's probably not worth the extra effort. If you decide to, though, the question is whether new classes would implement all or just part of the functionality. For example, do they share backend storage, so all would need to be updated at once (in which case there is no point in splitting), or do they relate to entirely separate concerns in which case splitting (as suggested by @GarethOwen) is probably the way to go.
