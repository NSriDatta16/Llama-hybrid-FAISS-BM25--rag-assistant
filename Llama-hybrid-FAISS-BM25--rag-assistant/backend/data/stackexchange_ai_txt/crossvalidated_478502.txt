Time varying Shapley Decomposition

I have read a lot on Shapley decompositions for relative contributions of regressors in linear regression. I was wondering if there is a way to do time-varying relative contributions. For example: If I have monthly data on stock prices and a set of regressors such as market volatility, market uncertainty index, other demand and supply variables, etc. Is there a way to find relative contributions (Shapley decompositions) for each of these regressors for each time period. For example: Hypothetically it is possible that before the 2008 recession, demand and supply variables were major contributors. After the recession, the relative contribution of market uncertainty might have increased. Therefore, is there a way to find continuous Shapley decompositions for time series data?
