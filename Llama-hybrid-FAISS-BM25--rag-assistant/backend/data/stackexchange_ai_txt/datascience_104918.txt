They are exactly the same and provide a scikit-learn API to their xgboost model instead of the learning API that is also available. You can see in the source code that in xgboost they are importing the XGBClassifier from xgboost.sklearn , which is exactly the same model as you are using as your second model. With regards to which of the two to use, since they are exactly the same it doesn't really matter but I would probably use xgboost.XGBClassifier since that is the class that is already exposed at the top level of the package.
