Neural Network with linear activation function

I'm learning how to apply neural networks. In the example below, I use a linear activation function. Does this mean that the model becomes multivariate regression or is it an enhanced regression that covers discontinuous function due to layer and thresholds that control whether neurons fire up to the next ones
