Every field has it's own jargon, and that must tell us something - people like having special words, phrases or assigning special meanings to existing words that are only relevant within their own field. I suspect if we went back to the pyramids, there'd be a full set of architectural and building phrases that your average Egyptian just wouldn't understand. So banning jargon just wont work, creating an FAQ and glossary normally do the trick. BTW This must be a case of pots and kettles. Does anyone outside IT think phrases like - "...We'll use an ORM, and then WCF will talk over HTTPS, throw in a bit of AJAX and some clever CSS on the client and we're laughing ..."
