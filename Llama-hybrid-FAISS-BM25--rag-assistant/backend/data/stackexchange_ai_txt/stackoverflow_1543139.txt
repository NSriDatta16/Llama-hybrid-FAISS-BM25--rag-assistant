This is a little bit strange but it will work: If you want to know the next value, start by getting the greatest value plus one: SELECT max(id) FROM yourtable To make this work, you'll need to reset the identity on insert: DECLARE @value INTEGER SELECT @value = max(id) + 1 FROM yourtable DBCC CHECKIDENT (yourtable, reseed, @value) INSERT INTO yourtable ... Not exactly an elegant solution but I haven't had my coffee yet ;-) (This also assumes that there is nothing done to the table by your process or any other process between the first and second blocks of code).
