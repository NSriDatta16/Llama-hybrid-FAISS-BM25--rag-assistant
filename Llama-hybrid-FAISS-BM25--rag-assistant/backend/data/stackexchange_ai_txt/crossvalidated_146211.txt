There exist various approaches to testing whether a time series is stationary . One of the most popular approaches is based on unit root test family of tests, which include Augmented_Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test (available in R as tseries::adf.test() ), Zivot-Andrews test (available in R as urca::ur.za() ) and several others (see the links in the unit root test Wikipedia article). Another approach is to use the KPSS test , which is considered complimentary to unit root testing. Finally, there are approaches, based on spectrum analysis , which include Priestley-Subba Rao (PSR) test and wavelet spectrum test. Some theoretic discussion and examples are available via the previous link as well as in corresponding section of the online textbook "Forecasting: principles and practice" by professors Rob J. Hyndman and George Athana­sopou­los: http://www.otexts.org/fpp/8/1 .
