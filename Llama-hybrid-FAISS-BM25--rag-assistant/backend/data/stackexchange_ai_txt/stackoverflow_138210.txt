You don't want to re-add 'BUILTIN\Administrators' as it is a SQL Server 2000 security flaw. All domain administrators will have full sysadmin rights to your SQL Server to drop databases etc. Find the account that is running SQL Agent (Right click SQL Server agent in enterprise manager and select properties). Then add this account as a SQL Server login using windows authentication and add it to the sysadmin fixed server role.
