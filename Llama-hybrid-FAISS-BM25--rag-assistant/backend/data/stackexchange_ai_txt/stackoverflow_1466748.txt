I figured it out. The trick was to create my own designer that inherits from ParentControlDesigner and overrides the Initialize method and calls EnableDesignMode for the inner content panel. On top of this, I needed to set the Designer attribute of my user control to this new designer. The details are shown here . One problem, though. I can drag controls to the content panel I created and everything looks fine. But, once I recompile, the controls disappear. They are still there, I just think they're getting drawn before the banner panel. I will create a separate thread for this problem.
