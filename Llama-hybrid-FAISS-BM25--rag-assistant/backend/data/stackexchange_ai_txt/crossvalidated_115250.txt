Given your response, something is clearly odd in your data, at least for your model. You probably have outliers, influential points, leverage points etc. Have you looked for these? If you are using SAS, PROC ROBUSTREG offers some nice diagnostics. Doubtless there are also some in R, but I don't know them.
