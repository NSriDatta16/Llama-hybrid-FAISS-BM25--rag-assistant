One online article that really helped me understand Gibbs Sampling is Parameter estimation for text analysis by Gregor Heinrich. It's not a general Gibbs sampling tutorial but it discusses it in terms of latent dirichlet allocation, a fairly popular Bayesian model for document modeling. It goes into the math in fair detail. One that goes into even more exhaustive mathematical detail is Gibbs Sampling for the Uninitiated . And I mean exhaustive in that it assumes you know some multivariate calculus and then lays out every step from that point. So while there's a lot of math, none of it is advanced. I assume these will be more useful to you then something that derives more advanced results, such as those that prove why Gibbs sampling converges to the correct distribution. The references I point out don't prove this.
