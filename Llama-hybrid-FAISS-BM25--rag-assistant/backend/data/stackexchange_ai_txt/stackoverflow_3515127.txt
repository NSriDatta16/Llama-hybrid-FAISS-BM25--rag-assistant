Found the answer right after posting. Here's what I did. Created a new Tablix. Dragged the Name field to the data row of the first column. Dragged the Value column to the data row of the second column. Dragged the Period field to the header row of the second column. That created a new group, and a new second level header column. I then copied the value from that new top header column to the header cell below it, and deleted the whole new header row. When asked whether to delete the row and associated groups, or just row, choose just the row . You should be left with a Row Group and two Column Groups, and it should render as intended.
