Apple's built-in command line program ibtool lets you do this. You can dump the strings from a XIB, localize them, then create a new XIB based on the existing XIB but using the localized strings. So you can always have a base set of XIBs and recreate them all whenever the localized strings change. More info here: http://www.bdunagan.com/2009/03/15/ibtool-localization-made-easy/ .
