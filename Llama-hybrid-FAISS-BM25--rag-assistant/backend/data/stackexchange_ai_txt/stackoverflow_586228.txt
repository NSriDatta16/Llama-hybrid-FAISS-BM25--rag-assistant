I have had a lot of luck with the weblogs.asp.net main feed . It's an aggregation of all blogs on the site, including Scott Guthrie 's and other Microsoft insiders, as well as a lot of non-Microsoft folks who are fairly serious technical bloggers. The topics are definitely not just limited to ASP.NET, there is healthy coverage of .NET development and Microsoft technologies in general. You can scan the headers of the blog posts, and themes jump out to you that point to what is "hot" and new in the Microsoft space.
