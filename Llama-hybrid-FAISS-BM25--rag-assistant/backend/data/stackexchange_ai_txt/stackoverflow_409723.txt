I would never rely on automatic vectorization from any compiler. With gcc I would be doubly wary because the effects of gcc 's optimizations always vary from version to version. Almost everyone I know who relies on special optimizations or gcc extensions has to deal with breakage when a new gcc version is released. You can usually trust pragmas and intrinsics, but you should keep a sharp eye on release notes for new gcc versions, and you should tell your own users what gcc version is needed to compile your code. Once or twice when vectorization really mattered, we've added something to the test suite to call objdump and verify that vector instructions are actually being used. It would be nice to be able to detect 'bad vector code' (as Nils describes) automatically as well, but we've never gotten that far.
