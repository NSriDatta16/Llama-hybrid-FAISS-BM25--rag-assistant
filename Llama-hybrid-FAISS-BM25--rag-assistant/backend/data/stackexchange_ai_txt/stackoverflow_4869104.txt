Good File Organization Suggestions for Developer

I am struggling a little with folder organization to organize the many projects that I work on. I work on OS X - right now I am using ~/Development/ as the root folder, and I have many types of projects. For example, I have my iPhone apps under ~/Development/Xcode I develop in many languages, from PHP, to Ruby, to Python, to Objective-C. So, for example, I might have a couple of open-source apps based on PHP where I am using the Zend framework. Some of these projects are for clients, others are tests/experiments when learning a new language or general experimenting. I am really interested in how other developers have organized code/projects and could pass along some advice to make it very easy to navigate through code/projects related to many languages and types of projects.
