PCA on part of dataset

I have read numerous questions/answers on this site and others debating the use of PCA and other dimensionality reduction techniques on mixed data (containing both continuous and categorical variables). I have seen no reference to the idea of idea performing PCA on only the continuous variables and holding out the categorical ones. What are the ramifications of this approach? Specifically, I am thinking of performing PCA on only the continuous variables, and then using the computed components and held-out categorical variables to build a model. In my situation, I am more concerned with final model performance than understanding the relationship, though re-computing the original continuous variables from the loadings would not be overly difficult.
