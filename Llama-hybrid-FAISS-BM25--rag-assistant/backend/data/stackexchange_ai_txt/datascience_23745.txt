Breaking captcha with a neural network - Learning deep learning

I would like to implement a neural network allow to make captcha recognition. Actually, I'm new in deep learning that's the first neural network I'm building. I have seen a another similar project on Github : https://deepmlblog.wordpress.com/2016/01/03/how-to-break-a-captcha-system/ However, I'm not able to understand it. I don't know what's a vgg base neural network model, etc ... I was wondering if there is a course or courses that I could follow in order to be able to implement such a neural network. I don't know where to start ... I don't aim to become an expert for the moment, I just want to first concretely discover this science that seems exciting. Thank you for your help
