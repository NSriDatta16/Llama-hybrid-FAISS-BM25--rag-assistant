Random effects structure for product assessment

Could I have some advice which, if any, random-effects structure should be added to my model please. My data includes multiple people (50) indicating whether they like/don't like a bunch of toys (15). Not every person gives a measure for each toy. The predictors are descriptions of each toy; colouful, fluffy, battery-operated, and such. The aim is to get a prediction of whether a new toy will be liked given its feature set by a new individual. The data looks like: Person Toy Like X1 X2 X3 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 2 0 0 1 0 1 3 1 0 0 0 1 4 1 0 1 0 2 2 0 1 1 1 2 3 1 0 0 0 2 4 1 1 1 0 2 5 1 0 0 1 I am using a logistic regression model. I have estimated a random-intercept model using 'Person' as the grouping variable. Like = X1 + X2 + X3 + (1|Person) Is this sensible. Should I, and if so how should I, include the 'Toy' indicator? Thanks.
