General question about oversampling with TSNE or PCA

I have an unbalanced dataset and I am planning to use over-sampling (resampling) and finally, I want to use PCA or TSNE for a better demonstration of the data (the data has more than 50 dimensions). I am wondering if I can use PCA or TSNE with oversampling? if yes, should I do it after I run the resampling algorithm? what's the logical procedure to do it?
