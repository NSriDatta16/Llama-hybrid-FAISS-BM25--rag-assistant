nunit locking dll

I have been using nunit with visual studio 2010 on a windows 7 64-bit pc. I am able to open the nunit gui and run my unit tests. If I then change one of the unit tests and try to rebuild, I am getting a file locking error as follows - Error 1 Unable to copy file "obj\Debug\myProject.Tests.dll" to "bin\Debug\myProject.Tests.dll". The process cannot access the file 'bin\Debug\myProject.Tests.dll' because it is being used by another process. myProject.Tests I have used process explorer to verify that it is the nunit-agent.exe that is locking the dll. I have noticed via tools > test assemblies that the nunit.exe is running under clr version Net 2.0 and nunit-agent.exe is running under clr version Net 4.0. could that have something to do with the problem? If so, how can I fix it? If not, does anyone have any idea what else may be going on? Thanks for any thoughts.
