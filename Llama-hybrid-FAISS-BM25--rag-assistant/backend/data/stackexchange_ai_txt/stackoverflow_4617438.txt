Simple Primitive Elements in Flex 4?

Normally on other IDEs, I simply drag a Rectangle object to the body or content of my application then resize it, define colors, etc. What I discovered in Flex 4 (Flash Builder 4) was that it's not just like that (or is it?) and I can't seem to find something to drag to my application to create a Rectangle object. My question is, how do I do it? How do I create a simple Rectangle?
