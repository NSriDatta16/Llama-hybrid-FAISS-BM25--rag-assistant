How to get frequently occurring phrases with Lucene

I would like to get some frequently occurring phrases with Lucene. I am getting some information from TXT files, and I am losing a lot of context for not having information for phrases e.g. "information retrieval" is indexed as two separate words. What is the way to get the phrases like this? I can not find anything useful on internet, all the advices, links, hints especially examples are appreciated! EDIT: I store my documents just by title and content: Document doc = new Document(); doc.add(new Field("name", f.getName(), Field.Store.YES, Field.Index.NOT_ANALYZED)); doc.add(new Field("text", fReader, Field.TermVector.WITH_POSITIONS_OFFSETS)); because for what I am doing the most important is the content of the file. Titles are too often not descriptive at all (e.g., I have many PDF academic papers whose titles are codes or numbers). I desperately need to index top occurring phrases from text contents, just now I see how much this simple "bag of words" approach is not efficient.
