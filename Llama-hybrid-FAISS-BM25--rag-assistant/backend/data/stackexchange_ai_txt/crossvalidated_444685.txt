Move selection in reinforcement learning

How would one select moves in a complex game that has multiple screens. For instance, how would you handle things like item screens and skill point selection screens when implementing a reinforcement learning agent to play a game. What kinds of output spaces will be required of the network? For instance, a simple dungeon crawler can deal with controls by outputting the movement and weapon/skill controls. However, what about dealing with menus like equipment layouts etc. How do we modify the network to deal with this as well?
