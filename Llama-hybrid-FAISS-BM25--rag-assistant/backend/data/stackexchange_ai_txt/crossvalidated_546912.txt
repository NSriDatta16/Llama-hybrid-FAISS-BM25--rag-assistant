Creating a confusion matrix for every fold from k-fold cross validation in R

I am attempting to run a 5-fold cross validation in R for a logistic regression model followed up by confusion matrices for each "fold." However, my code is only producing one confusion matrix. forestcov This produces one matrix. My goal is to run a 5-fold cross validation and produce a matrix for every fold. I can't figure out why I am only getting one matrix. Is the error in my cross validation or the confusion matrix, and how should I go about correcting it?
