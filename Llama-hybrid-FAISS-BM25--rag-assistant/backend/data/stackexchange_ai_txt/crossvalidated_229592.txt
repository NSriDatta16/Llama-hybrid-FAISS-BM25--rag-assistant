SSE for subset much better than full data

I am running k-fold cross validation on a complex neural network model. I often can get the situation where on a particular k-fold, the SSE (sum of squared prediction errors) for the reduced data set plus the SSE for the predicted subset is My sense is that something is wrong. Am I correct or not? Example: full data set SSE = 100 fit to 90% of data = 75 predicted SSE of remaining 10% = 15
