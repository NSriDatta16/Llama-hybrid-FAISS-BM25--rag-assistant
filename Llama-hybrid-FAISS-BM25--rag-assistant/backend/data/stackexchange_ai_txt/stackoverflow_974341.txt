I am not 100% sure, but I think HTML fragments should always be "complete", meaning that adding just " " will not work. A solution would be to build a string with a complete HTML fragment, and then append it, instead of appending the pieces one at a time. You can always add the click handler after you created your jQuery object, like this: jRow.find("img").click(function () { ... });
