Using Google's visualization organisation chart with Rails

I intend to implement an Organization Chart in my app and the best resource I found to display one was Google's Organisational Chart . I'm using awesome_nested_set to maintain a tree structure in the database, and now I need to display the tree as an organization chart, for which I thought I could use the Google Org chart. Can it be done? If so, any tips or resources would be helpful. Thanks !
