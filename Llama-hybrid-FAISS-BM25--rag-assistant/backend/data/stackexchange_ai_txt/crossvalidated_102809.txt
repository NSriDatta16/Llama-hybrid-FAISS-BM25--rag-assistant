Coefficient standard error of zero in quantile regression

I'm currently experimenting with quantile regression of a strongly right skewed outcome variable y on a 3-category exposure x (values 1,2,3). I wanted to model the .2, .5, and .8 quantile, using the interior point algorithm for estimation and bootstrapping (Markov chain marginal bootstrap method, n=1000) for confidence intervals. The software (SAS v9.2) gave no warning about convergence problems or the like. For the latter two, the results appear reasonable, however, for the .2 quantile, I sometimes get standard errors of 0 for the intercept and both of the two exposure coefficients (dummy coded, 2 vs. 1 and 3 vs. 1). Group sizes for subgroups defined by x are: 227 (x=1), 423 (x=2), and 90 (x=3). Like I said, y is strongly right skewed, with a range of 0-14 (mostly integer values, but decimal values also exist in the data). Proportion of subjects with y=0 is 31% for x=1, 18% for x=2, and 10% for x=3. I speculated that this might be the reason for the 0 standard errors, but I neither have enough experience with this particular method, nor enough mathematics background to really understand the algorithms. Therefore my questions: Is it normal to get stanard error of 0 with this method? And what does it imply for the interpretation of these results? Should I drop the analysis of the .2 quantile altogether? Does the validity of the other two quantile regressions (for .5 and .8) remain unaffected by this? Below is the SAS code I used, and the results of an exemplary analysis. I repeated the analysis 10 times and in 5 cases, standard error were 0 like in the example below, and in the remaining 5, they were between .01 and .10. Results for the .5 and .8 quantile were pretty stable. PROC QUANTREG DATA=...
