Posterior computation for Laplace distribution

I am dealing with being Bayesian and looking for a closed form for a posterior for the scale parameter $\tau$ of a Laplace distribution, such that I can derive a full conditional in my Gibbs sampler. I do not think I could exploit conjugacy for the Laplace, but any closed-form computation for the posterior would be useful. Any ideas on how to choose the prior and obtain a closed form posterior from which it is known how to sample from?
