would be something like this: - (void)touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *tap = [touches anyObject]; CGPoint pointToMove = [tap locationInView:self.view]; CGFloat xdiff = pointToMove.x-myFish.center.x; CGFloat ydiff = pointToMove.y-myFish.center.y; if (!CGRectContainsPoint(myFish.frame, pointToMove)) { CGFloat angle = 0; if (xdiff) { if (xdiff>0) { angle = atanf(ydiff/xdiff); } else { angle = M_PI + atanf(ydiff/xdiff); } } [UIView beginAnimations:nil context:NULL]; [UIView setAnimationDuration:0.3f]; [UIView setAnimationBeginsFromCurrentState:YES]; [UIView setAnimationCurve:UIViewAnimationCurveLinear]; myFish.transform = CGAffineTransformMakeRotation(angle); [UIView commitAnimations]; } [UIView beginAnimations:nil context:NULL]; [UIView setAnimationDuration:1.0f]; [UIView setAnimationBeginsFromCurrentState:YES]; [UIView setAnimationCurve:UIViewAnimationCurveLinear]; myFish.center = pointToMove; [UIView commitAnimations]; } and you probably want to implement these too: - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event - (void)touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event EDIT: updated code, now the rotation is done in a separate animation, so that the fish rotates faster than he swims.
