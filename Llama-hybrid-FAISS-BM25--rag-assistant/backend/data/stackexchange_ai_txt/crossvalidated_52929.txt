Test to show when diverging linear regression models are statistically different

What method will allow me to identify the values of the independent variable where two (or more) diverging linear regression models are statistically different? e.g. Take two simple linear regression models derived from some experimental test: $y_1 = -1x+100$ and $y_2 = -0.5x+100$. These could represent two time points on a dose vs survivorship relationship, or two different materials in a temperature vs strength relationship. At $x = 0$ the two models give the same $y$. As you move away from $x = 0$ the values of $y_1$ and $y_2$ diverge, however for some period their confidence intervals will overlap suggesting that $y_1$ is indistinguishable from $y_2$ in this region. Taking the temperature vs strength relationship as an example, this suggests that there is no difference in strength of the two materials over this temperature range. Therefore, I would like to be able to calculate this range, or conversely identify the range of $x$ values when $y_1$ is statistically different to $y_2$. My understanding of predictions bands is not great, but I don't think this is the solution. The only solution I can come up with is to calculate the $y$'s and CI's at discrete values of $x$ and run a series of tests. I am looking for something more elegant!
