Welcome to the Data Science World. Note: I am not 100% sure about your project and details are not known. So I will only point you in some directions. As I understand your question, your problem is to group "nearby" objects without a formal definition of "nearby". But you have some cases where humans annotated which objects belong together. This basically leads to two tasks: Define a meaningful distance metric Group nearby objects using above metric Finding a metric Here, I would like to point you to metric learning , which does exactly this. If you are looking for a quick start, scikit-learn provides some methods and a tutorial . Depending on your data and the type of anntotations, you might need to perform some preprocessing, e.g. some embeddings and maybe look for some different methods than the ones in scikit-learn, but I hope I could point you into a direction. Grouping objects The first thing that comes to ones mind whould be to use some clustering, but clustering algorithms are mainly designed to give a small number of clusters. But you are looking for a huge number of clusters, so you might have to search a bit. Hierachical clustering might be a way to start with. Or you look for related segmentation algorithms (mostly known from the image domain). You could build a graph of nearby objects and try some graph cut algorithms. I hope this could point your search into some promissing directions.
