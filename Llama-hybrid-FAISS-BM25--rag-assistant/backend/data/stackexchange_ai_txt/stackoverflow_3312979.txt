I think Bertrand Meyer's programming by contract idea is largely dead. He built pre- and post-conditions into Eiffel, but that language is below Latin on the usage scale. There are Java programming by contract libraries out there; Contractor is one. But its day has come and gone. The fact is that even Eiffel had a way to turn them off in production, because the runtime cost wasn't worth the benefit. Only 6 Eiffel questions on Stack Overflow - a small percentage indeed. If you search for SO tags with "contract" in them, you'll see a very small number. Not much interest in the topic on this site. It claims to draw the biggest audience of professional programmers in the world.
