12 Hours horrible? I work in an organization owned by the family and my workday is typically 14 hours. Luckily I do my learning on the job... Sometimes when I am bored I just sit in my office and read SO, or a book, or blogs, or articles. You won't find me complaining. I like the work I do, and it pays.
