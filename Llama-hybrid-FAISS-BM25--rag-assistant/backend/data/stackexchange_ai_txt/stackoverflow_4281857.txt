Wpf: Drag And Drop To A Textbox

I've googled this problem, and people have answered similar questions, but for some reason I can't get anything to work. I must have missed something here... At any rate, when I run the following code, the TextBox_DragEnter handler is never called. However, if I change the TextBox element in the xaml to a TextBlock element, it is called. Is there any way to get the same behavior from a TextBox element? The following code completely isolates the problem... MainWindow.xaml: MainWindow.xaml.cs: using System.Windows; using System.Windows.Controls; using System.Windows.Input; using System.Collections.ObjectModel; namespace Wpf1 { /// /// Interaction logic for MainWindow.xaml /// public partial class MainWindow : Window { public MainWindow() { InitializeComponent(); } private void TextBox_DragEnter(object sender, DragEventArgs e) { e.Effects = DragDropEffects.Copy; } private void TextBox_Drop(object sender, DragEventArgs e) { } } } Many thanks in advance! Andrew EDIT: Just to clarify, I would like to allow dropping a custom object into a textbox. In the Drop handler for the textbox, I would then like to set the text of the textbox to a property in the object, and then set the IsReadOnly property of the TextBox to false. I'm just having some trouble enabling drag and drop for the TextBox...
