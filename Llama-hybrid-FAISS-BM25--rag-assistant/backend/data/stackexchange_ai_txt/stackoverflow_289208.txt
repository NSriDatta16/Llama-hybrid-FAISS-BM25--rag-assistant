Anyone experience VS2008 (inc SP1) ignoring or losing Breakpoints randomly?

Since upgrading to 2008 I and many people here have noticed that randomly VS will no longer step in to code or jump over breakpoints. Its got to the stage where debugging is becoming a real chore. We are running SP1 but noticed problem on 2008 basic too. In ref to Robert's question: We host WCF and Remoting services inside windows services. Essentially the calls from the clients (generally windows exe) will end up in a thread on the service itself and in our code (as opposed to remoting or WCF infrastructure). Once in our code the break points have this behaviour. Much of the debugging we do here is in service code so ATTACH to process to invaluable and sometimes is impossible to get to the state needed except by attaching to processes after they have started. It happens to developers both with extensions such as resharper and to those who run a vanilla VS. Looking on google doesn't give much help. Anyone else experience this? regards, Preet Spudlo's answer has worked out greatly for us. Thank you. Please download the fix from MSDN
