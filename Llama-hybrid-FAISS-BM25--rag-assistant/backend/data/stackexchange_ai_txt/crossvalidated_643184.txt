Identical intercept and random effect values in multinomial regression model in R

I have 6 animals whose behaviour I’m testing over multiple trials. It’s a pretty small dataset (max 15 observations per animal). Behaviour falls into multiple types. The same behaviour can occur multiple times per animal, and trial numbers vary per animal. This data is organised lengthwise, with one row per observation. I’m interested to see if behavioural type is influenced by trial number, so I fitted a multinomial model in R with the multinom function in the nnet package. Formula: Behaviour ~ Trial + (1 | AnimalID) . The model works fine, no errors are reported, and the coefficients seemingly match patterns that I can observe in the dataset. What I find very strange is that the random effects coefficients are exactly identical to the behavioural intercept coefficients. Same for the corresponding standard errors. When I remove animal ID as a random effect from the model, the model fit (residuals and AIC) remain exactly the same. Both the intercept coefficients and their standard errors, however, are twice as large as in the prior model. What is happening here?
