Hyper-V/WMI programming Question

I've looked at several objects in the "root\virtualization" name space but I have not been able to find where Hyper-V stores the path to the config file for a given virtual machine. I need to get this file path programmatically or at least just the home path of a given virtual machine would be fine as well. What WMI object and field stores the path to a given virtual machine (hint it's not Msvm_ComputerSystem) ?
