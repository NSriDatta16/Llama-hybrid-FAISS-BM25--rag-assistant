Using a stylesheet with iText, possible?

Does iText provide/support for any kind of styling sheet? What I mean is, like in Apache FOP, the data is represented in the XML and the formatting is programmed in the XSL. So then we pass the XML and XSL to the FOP engine which in turn converts the data in XML using the formatting specified in the XSL to create a PDF. Does iText support a similar functionality or the only way we have is to program the whole formatting in the Java code itself, meaning specifying the table/cell(its dimensions etc.), paragraph(its font, color etc.)?
