How to change Orchard record repository

I work on a project where we're considering using Orchard CMS . However, we want to use web services as data sources for some of the content items. I guess we have to change the repository implementation in order to make this possible, but I'm not sure about that. So my question is: Is my guess correct, or is it more complex? And how can it be done then? Thanks! Update: I see that Orchard's IRepository interface requires LINQ provider to be implemented. That's impossible in this scenario since the web services are offered via SOAP. I'll better further describe the scenario: The website we wish to build has to use web services to get information about an organization members and units. We would like to display members of some organizational unit, for example, on the website. We also want to create our own content type "Event" that should have an M:N relationship (Attendees) with "Member" (from WS).
