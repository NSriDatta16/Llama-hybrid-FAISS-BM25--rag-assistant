Is there a data storage pattern similar to mipmaps in graphics?

We've got a bunch of data the users may want to view windows of and do so quickly. They may want to look at a window of the data that is a day, a week, a month, or an arbitrary beginning and ending data. Sorting and summing up all of this stuff in real time is proving to be painful for us so I got the idea of doing something similar to Mipmaps in 3D rendering. You end up storing the same data pre-calculated at a variety of different scales and then interpolate the results using the varying scales. So I would already know what the numbers were for a year, a given month, a given week, and a given day for a store and if they ask for a particular range I use the various scales to quickly add up something that gives the right results but I don't have to necessarily reprocess the full data set, I just retrieve four or five records and add or subtract them. Is this a real pattern? Does it make any sense and there are places I can read about how to do it best or are there much better ways of dealing with large chunks of data like this where it needs to be viewed in varying slices? It seems like this should be a well known and solved problem. For example, lots of people have stock portfolios and they need to do this kind of thing every day. Our data isn't stock prices, but the idea is the same.
