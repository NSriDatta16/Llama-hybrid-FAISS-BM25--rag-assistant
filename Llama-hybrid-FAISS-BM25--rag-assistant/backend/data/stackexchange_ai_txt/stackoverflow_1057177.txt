Yep, one has to declare an overloaded stub action in the controller. What I have done is declare the stub to match the instance where there is no parameter for the userName thus we get a clean compile. I have then decorated this overloaded action as illustrated to ensure that it is never called. Now everything is hunky dory. Cheers for the reply Robert [ActionName("UNCALLABLE")] public ActionResult Category(int categoryId, int page) { return View(); }
