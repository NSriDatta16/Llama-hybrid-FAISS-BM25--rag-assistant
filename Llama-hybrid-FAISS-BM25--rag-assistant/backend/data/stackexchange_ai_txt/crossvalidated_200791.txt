I am not sure regression would help you doing this. In my opinion, the simplest way would be for you to build the histogram of the daily number of rows you have. Then fit any distribution that comes to your mind (does it look gaussian, by any chance) and build a confidence interval around the mean. Call : $n_{Today}$ the number of rows observed today $\mu$ the average of the daily number of rows $\sigma$ the standard deviation of the daily number of rows If it is gaussian, a simple rule such as $n_{Today} If you have the past observations with a label "some data was lost/no data was lost" you can turn this in a classification problem. However, with one single feature, you will have trouble to find a decision rule which is not $n_{Today}
