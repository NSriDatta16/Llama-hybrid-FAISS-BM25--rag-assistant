TI MSP430 Interrupt source

I know that when working with the MSP430F2619 and TI's CCSv4, I can get more than one interrupt to use the same interrupt handler with code that looks something like this: #pragma vector=TIMERA1_VECTOR #pragma vector=TIMERA0_VECTOR __interrupt void Timer_A (void){ ServiceWatchdogTimer(); } My question is, when I find myself in that interrupt, is there a way to figure out which one of these interrupts got me here?
