Logistic regression is not a classification method. So in your original sense you cannot compare them. Logistic regression is a direct probability estimation model. And you are ignoring a huge literature testing stepwise regression. To compare logistic regression to a classifier you'll have to turn the classifier into a "probability machine". then use a proper accuracy scoring rule such as the Brier score.
