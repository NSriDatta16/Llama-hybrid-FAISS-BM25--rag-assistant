You can't process data in templates. There are a fair number of questions in SO from people trying to do "real" processing in the templates. The Django template language is -- intentionally -- not JSP or ASP or PHP. It just does presentation and retrieval of values computed in view functions. If you can't figure out how to do it in the template, you may be trying to do too much. Use the view functions as much as possible.
