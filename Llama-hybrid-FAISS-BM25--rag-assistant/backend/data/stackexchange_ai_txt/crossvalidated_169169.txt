Regression analysis of a correlation coefficient

I have a time series of the 250 day historical correlation and I need to determine what causes this correlation to change as different explanatory variables change. Is there a way that I can regress the correlation coefficient on my explanatory variables? I know standard OLS won't work as the Y variable (correlation) is bounded between -1 and 1.
