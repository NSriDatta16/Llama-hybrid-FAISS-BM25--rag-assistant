My recommendation is Applied Predictive Modeling by Max Kuhn. This book covers all the major regression and classification models, as well as some lesser known models, such as Cubist and C5.0 . While the text does not cover deep learning, it does cover caret , which is Kuhn's R package. The caret package contains several deep learning models (e.g. stacked autoencoders) as well as many other classification and regression models.
