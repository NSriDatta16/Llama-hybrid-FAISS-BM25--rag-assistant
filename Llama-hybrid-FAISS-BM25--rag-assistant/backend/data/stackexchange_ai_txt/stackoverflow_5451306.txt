"millions of lines" is not very large unless the lines are long. If the lines are long you might save some memory by storing only positions in the file ( .tell() / .seek() ). If the file is sorted by line.field ; you could use itertools.groupby() . SQLâ€™s GROUP BY might help for average-sized files (e.g., using sqlite as @wisty suggested ). For really large files you could use MapReduce .
