Short answer: you can't. In order to have a PHP script "intelligently" fetch the "most important" content from a page, the script would have to understand the content on the page. PHP is no natural language processor, nor is this a trivial area of study. There might be some NLP toolkits for PHP, but I still doubt it would be easy then. A solution that can be achieved with reasonable effort would be fetch those entire page with an HTML parser and then look out for elements with certain class names or ids commonly found in blog engines. You could also parse for hAtom Microformats. Or you could look out for Meta tags within the document and more clearly defined information.
