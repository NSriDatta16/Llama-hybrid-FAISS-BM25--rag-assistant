If you assume that each dialog occupies one paragraph (usually, it starts and ends with a double-line paragraph break), then there is another way to have \dialogue take just one argument: \newif\indialog \indialogfalse \def\dialogue#1{\ifindialog \end{dialogue}#1\begin{dialog}\else \everypar={\end{dialogue}\indialogfalse \everypar={}}#1\indialogtrue\begin{dialogue} \fi} That code is kind of dirty and un-Latexy —it sets \everypar without caring about its existing content— and Latex has cleaner abstractions for doing it, which I have forgotten, but the principle should be clear.
