@anubhava's answer works, but he's referenced the Spring 2.0 manual, which is 5 years old. In XML config, Spring 3.x has a more elegant approach: . This also enabled a whole other bunch of features that you'll probably want, whereas RequiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor only enables a few. See Spring 3.x manual . If you're using @Bean -style config, then annotations like @Required should already be enabled, since that's how @Bean works. However, it's possible that this is a bug - Spring 3.1 is still in early beta, and big chunks of it are likely to be broken. Unless you really know what you're doing, I strongly recommend sticking to 3.0.x.
