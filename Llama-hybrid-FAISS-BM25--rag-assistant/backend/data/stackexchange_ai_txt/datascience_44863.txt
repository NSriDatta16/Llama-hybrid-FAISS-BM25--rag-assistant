What are the common properties of all machine learning algorithms?

The definitions of machine learning I was able to find are very vague. What are the common properties of all machine learning algorithms? For example, keyword extraction algorithm (that use only statistical formulas) is ML? Language detection algorithm (that use dictionlaries for every language and statistic) is ML?
