Generate multivariate time series

Suppose that I want to generate tri-variate Gaussian time series $\{(X_{1i}, X_{2i}, X_{3i}), i=1,2,...,n\}$ with a correlation structure across the three time series; that is, $(X_{1i}, X_{2i}, X_{3i}) \sim N((0,0,0), \Sigma)$, where $\Sigma= \begin{bmatrix} 1 \ r \ r \\ r \ 1 \ r \\ r \ r \ 1 \end{bmatrix}$. Function mvrnorm() in R can be used to achieve the goal like the following: r However, if I would like to also specify a temporal structure in the time series like, for example, autoregressive model AR(1), how can I do that?
