You can use the estimator $$\widehat{AUC}_k = \frac{\sum_{i:y_i = B}\sum_{j:y_j = A}\mathcal{I}(\hat p^A_i where $\hat p^A_i$ is the predicted probability of observation $i$ belonging to class A, computed for each of the $5$ folds, and then average these to get an estimate of the out of sample AUC as $$\widehat{AUC} = \frac{1}{5}\sum_{k=1}^5\widehat{AUC}_k.$$
