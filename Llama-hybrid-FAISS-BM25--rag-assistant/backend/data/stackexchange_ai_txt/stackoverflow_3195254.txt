I would make the filesystem location configurable - either with a command-line option, or with an environment variable (both of these work just as well with Linux and Windows). The default can be /usr/local/etc/ , but for testing (or on Windows) you can specify a different location. If you are running multiple commands then the environment variable method works particularly well, as you can set the variable once, then just run the commands the same way they would be run if they were using the default storage location. For both methods, it's worth considering whether there are any security implications in having the location configurable - usually there won't be (the executable will only be able to do things that the user could have already done), but if you're running the executable setuid you may need more thought.
