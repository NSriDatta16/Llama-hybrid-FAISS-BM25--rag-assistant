Here's another one of the lurking or confounding variables: time (or instrumental drift, effects of sample storage, etc.). So there are arguments against randomization (as Douglas says: you may do better than randomization). E.g. you can know beforehand that you want your cases to be balanced over time. Just as you can know beforehand that you want to have gender and age balanced. In other words, if you want to manually choose one of your 6 schemes, I'd say that 1100 (or 0011) is a decidedly bad choice. Note that the first possibilites you threw out are those that are most balanced in time... And the worst two are left in after John proposed to thow out also 2 and 5 (against which you did not protest). In other words, your intuition which schemes are "nice" unfortunately leads towards bad experimental design (IMHO this is quite common; maybe ordered things look nicer - and for sure it is easier to keep track of logical sequences during the experiment). You may be able to do better with non-randomized schemes, but you are also able to do much worse. IMHO, you should be able to give physical/chemical/biological/medical/... arguments for the particular non-random scheme you use, if you go for a non-random scheme.
