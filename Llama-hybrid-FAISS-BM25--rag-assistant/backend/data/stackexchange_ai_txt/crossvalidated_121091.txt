It will give valid samples, provided you include the correct Hastings factor in the acceptance ratio. But using the inverse Hessian directly as the variance can be dangerous, and some additional corrections are recommended. For more details, see the paper Hessian-based Markov Chain Monte-Carlo Algorithms . The algorithm presented there is a bit different than the one you described, but many of the same considerations apply.
