Hessian of logistic function

I have difficulty to derive the Hessian of the objective function, $l(\theta)$, in logistic regression where $l(\theta)$ is: $$ l(\theta)=\sum_{i=1}^{m} \left[y_{i} \log(h_\theta(x_{i})) + (1- y_{i}) \log (1 - h_\theta(x_{i}))\right] $$ $h_\theta(x)$ is a logistic function. The Hessian is $X^T D X$. I tried to derive it by calculating $\frac{\partial^2 l(\theta)}{\partial \theta_i \partial \theta_j}$, but then it wasn't obvious to me how to get to the matrix notation from $\frac{\partial^2 l(\theta)}{\partial \theta_i \partial \theta_j}$. Does anybody know any clean and easy way of deriving $X^T D X$?
