Calling functions from previously-loaded JS file

I'm using jQuery. I have a JS file (super.js) containing: $("#content").load("/profile"); function setHash(hash) { location.hash = "#/:-)/"+hash; } "/profile" loads another external JS file (profile.js) containing a call to setHash: setHash('blabber'); But it doesn't seem to work (setHash is undefined). Edit: setHash is called from within a function in profile.js: function changePage(type) { setHash('bla/'+type); } How can I get "global" functions to work in JS files included in dynamically-loaded pages? Thanks, Albert
