Support Vector Machine for Longitude-Latitude data

I am wondering if someone could point me to the direction of support vector machines being used for longitude latitude. It seems logical that the possible complexity in SVM would be great for modelling variables dependent of location. In this case, I am trying to model depression dependent on US zip codes. My idea is to convert these zip codes to longitude/latitude, and then use an SVM. Has this approach been used before, would someone recommend a different approach?
