You can't re-create a list with a specified GUID. But from your comment you're off on a tangent here if the only reason you need to reset the ID to 1 is to help out with your empty list operation. The XML returned from GetListItems() is in the format ... So to 'reliably' loop through that is something like (not tested but you get the idea) // Call GetListItems and setup XmlDocument with results System.Xml.XmlNode nodeListItems = listService.GetListItems (listName, viewName,query,viewFields,rowLimit,queryOptions,null); /*Loop through each node in the XML response and display each item.*/ foreach (System.Xml.XmlNode listItem in nodeListItems) { Console.WriteLine("ID:{0}",listItem.getAttribute("ows_ID")); } See this MSDN article for more inspiration Further - to delete all these records with one call you can do a batch update by sending UpdateListItems by building up an XML fragment something like this in the for loop above. 100 101 Notes the "Method ID='XXX'..." has to be sequential +1 for each batch method. the "Field Name='ID'100..." matches the ID's of the list you found in the for loop above.
