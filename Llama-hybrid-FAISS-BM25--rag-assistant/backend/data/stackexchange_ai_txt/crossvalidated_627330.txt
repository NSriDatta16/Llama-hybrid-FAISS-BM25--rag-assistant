Retrospective cohort study with case:control matching 1:5. Is clogit really appropriate?

I study school grades in children with brain tumors (=cases), using databases. Every case in the database has five healthy controls, matched on sex, birth year and residency. The hypothesis is that cases have worse school grades than controls (this is of course already known, but I will also look at other covariates here). I am not starting by looking at grades, and then trying to determine whether or not the children with low grades were exposed (=had a brain tumor or not) - which would make it a case-control study . No, instead, I look at whether or not a child is a case (=brain tumor) or a control (=no brain tumor), and then find out what grades they have - this makes it a retrospective cohort study . So I do exposure first, then look at outcome = retrospective cohort study. Not outcome first, then look at exposure = not a case-control study. This took me quite some time to realize, and also my statisticians got this wrong, because if you have cases and controls, people (including myself) easily think it is a case-control study. So, my questions here are: Do you agree with me that this is a retrospective cohort study, and not a case-control study (even though it uses the terms "case" and "control")? Since the controls are matched against the cases (on at least some variables that are known to influence school grades, i.e. sex and residency), I have been told to use conditional logistic regression (clogit) when investigating the relationship between being a case (yes/no) and failing a school subject (yes/no). Any thoughts on this, as opposed to using ordinary logistic regression models? When I read more on this, it is usually assumed that clogit is used mainly in case-control studies. Is it not valid in retrospective cohort studies? Specifically, this quote from the following article ( https://www-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.proxy.kib.ki.se/pmc/articles/PMC9188848/ ) gets me thinking: "Matching in caseâ€“control studies can also have other counterintuitive effects because the matching is across outcome groups rather than exposure groups, and thus does not necessarily result in balancing the matching factors across exposure groups. " I would argue that the matching in my study is not "across outcome groups" - the controls are not selected based on school grades - but rather "across exposure groups" - the controls ARE selected based on that they DO NOT have brain tumors, and also based on sex, birth year, and residency. I have asked different statisticians to clarify the above for me, and get mumbling or unclear answers only, or otherwise answers that later turn out to be incorrect. PLEASE, can someone shed a light on this? Or, to put it in more succintly: IS there really a statistical dependency between cases and controls in my particular study, such that I cannot use Chi-square (for simple proportion comparisons between cases and controls), or that I have to use clogit?
