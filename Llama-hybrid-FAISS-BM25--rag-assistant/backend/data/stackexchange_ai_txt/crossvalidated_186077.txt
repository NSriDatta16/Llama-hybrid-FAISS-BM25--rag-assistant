The problem is, that the $2t^2n$ tail is only quite sharp when $n$ is quite small compared to $N$. When it's large, you get an exponent of $\frac{2(tn)^2}{N-n}$, which can be a lot stronger. See https://ahlenotes.wordpress.com/2015/12/08/hypergeometric_tail/ for more details. You could get a general lower bound by simply looking at the largest term in the sum: $$\begin{aligned} \Pr[X > EX + tn] &= \Pr[X > (M/N+t)n]\\ &\ge \left.{M \choose (M/N+t)n}{N \choose (1-M/N-t)n} \middle/ {N \choose n}\right.\\ &\ge ... \end{aligned}$$ But it's not really going to be elegant, unless you know what parameter range you are looking for.
