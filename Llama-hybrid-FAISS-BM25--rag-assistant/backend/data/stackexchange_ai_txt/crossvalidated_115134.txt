Estimate average of a dataset when thresholded

Suppose I have a dataset $x_i$ (with $x_i >= 0$) of N samples. I would like to determine the average of the data when the data is limited to some theshold c: $limitedaverage(x,c) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N max(x_i,c)$ Problem is I don't have access to the actual samples, I only know some aggregate statistics of the data: the sum, sum of squares, etc, up to a certain order k: $\sum x$, $\sum x^2$, $\sum x^3$ ... $\sum x^k$ I'm looking for a way to estimate the above limited average for a given c and given said aggregates. Intuitively I've been able to get a rough idea for k=2: given $\sum x$ and $\sum x^2$ one can calculate the average and the standard deviation and this tells me whether there are any samples that are significantly below c and would become clipped. But also given $\sum x^3$ and $\sum x^4$ I'm sure it's possible to get a more accurate estimate. My idea is that it should be possible to exploit $max(x,c) = \lim_{k \to \infty} (x^k+c^k)^\frac{1}{k}$ but from here I'm stuck. Any hints?
