You should read the original ROUGE paper by Chin-Yew Lin which goes in depth about the various definitions. ROUGE is a score of overlapping words. ROUGE-N refers to overlapping n-grams. Specifically: $$ \frac{\sum_{r}\sum_s\text{match}(\text{gram}_{s,c})}{\sum_{r}\sum_s\text{count}(\text{gram}_s)} $$ I tried to simplify the notation when compared with the original paper. Let's assume we are calculating ROUGE-2, aka bigram matches. The numerator $\sum_s$ loops through all bigrams in a single reference summary and calculates the number of times a matching bigram is found in the candidate summary (proposed by the summarization algorithm). If there are more than one reference summary, $\sum_r$ ensures we repeat the process over all reference summaries. The denominator simply counts the total number of bigrams in all reference summaries. This is the process for one document-summary pair. You repeat the process for all documents, and average all the scores and that gives you a ROUGE-N score. So a higher score would mean that on average there is a high overlap of n-grams between your summaries and the references. Example: S1. police killed the gunman S2. police kill the gunman S3. the gunman kill police S1 is the reference and S2 and S3 are candidates. Note S2 and S3 both have one overlapping bigram with the reference, so they have the same ROUGE-2 score, although S2 should be better. An additional ROUGE-L score deals with this, where L stands for Longest Common Subsequence. In S2, the first word and last two words match the reference, so it scores 3/4, whereas S3 only matches the bigram, so scores 2/4. See the paper for more details
