Can I use associations when using Ruby on Rails w/Amazon SimpleDB?

For a new project my company is considering using Amazon SimpleDB to simplify data storage. The app is a simplistic web dashboard that will be created using Ruby on Rails. What I'm wondering, though, is if I can still use associations like has_many and belongs_to while using SimpleDB as the backend. For instance, the application has users who log in and have messages. In "normal" Rails with MySQL I could easily do this with the built-in associations. Will using SimpleDB as the storage engine prevent me from doing this? Also, will I have to re-implement the login functionality? I was initially going to use the restful_authentication plugin, but I have no idea if I will have to rewrite it to work with SimpleDB.
