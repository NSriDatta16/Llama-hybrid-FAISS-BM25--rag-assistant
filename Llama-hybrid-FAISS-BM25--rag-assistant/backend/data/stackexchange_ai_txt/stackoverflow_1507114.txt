If the properties are not modified by the class, or by anything else, then make them static read only, or const fields, with only getter propperties. This would have nothing to do whether any specific method is static or not. EDIT: A non-static class is a "template" for an object, which you "use" by creating (new) instances based on that template. A static class is just an organizational 'bucket' for methods (functions) that are self contained snippets of code that generally operate only on their passed in parameters. (as well as any other globally scoped variables)
