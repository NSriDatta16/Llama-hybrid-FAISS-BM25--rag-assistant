resize div width on window resize

For a site I'm building now the logo has a centered font with two white lines coming off and extending to the edge of the window, regardless of the window size. I figured out that the easiest way to do it is to get javascript (through jquery) to resize the div whenever the document is loaded or the window is resized. My code looks like this. $(document).ready(cssFix); $(document).ready(stripeSize); $(window).resize(stripeSize); function cssFix() { $('#leftstripe').css({position: 'absolute', top: '84px'}); $('#rightstripe').css({position: 'absolute', top: '35px'}); } function stripeSize() { $('#leftstripe').width($('#logo').offset().left + 110); rightOffset = $(window).width() - ($('#logo').offset().left + $('#logo').outerWidth()); $('#rightstripe').width(rightOffset + 183); } Everything works ... when the window is loaded or resized the bars line up with the logo perfectly. The problem I'm having is that when the window is resized by dragging the line sort of jumps around before settling down once the window size is set. Not a smooth resize, in other words. Is there anyway to avoid this?
