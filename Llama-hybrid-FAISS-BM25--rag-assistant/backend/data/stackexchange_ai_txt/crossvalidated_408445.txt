I think that Random Forest (RF) is a good tool when the functional form of the relation between Xs and y is complicated (because of nonlinear relations and interaction effect). RF categorizes Xs based on the best cutpoint (in term of minimum SSE) and doesn't apply the researcher information about the functional form of relationship. On the oothe hand, OLS regression use this information. In your example, you know what exactly is the type of relationship between Xs and y and use all of this information in your regression model but RF don't use this information.
