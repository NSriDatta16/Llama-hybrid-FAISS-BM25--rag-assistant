This is clearly an SQL injection vulnerability, and it needs to be fixed. There are a few reasons for this in your scenario: Finding out incidental information such as you describe may be useful to an attacker, particulary if they have other attack vectors. An attacker finding this vulnerability would be encouraged to go look for some more. Sloppy here may mean sloppy elsewhere. In security it is important not to be too clever. Your attacker may know a lot more, or something more, than you do. So what may look to you like a contained vulnerability may be an open door to soneone else. So yes, your tool is doing the right thing.
