You can just use: Dictionary > This lets you store a KeyValuePair , which provides your custom class using a BCL type. That being said, I often find myself using a custom class or struct for this, instead. Personally, I find that implementing a custom type for my value storage is often more maintainable over time than using a KeyValuePair , Tuple , or other non-specific type. Usage, a year later, is much more obvious if I have a custom type with an appropriate name.
