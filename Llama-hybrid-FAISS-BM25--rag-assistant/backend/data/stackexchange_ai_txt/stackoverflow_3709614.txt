Compute/plot statistics on a 2d grid

Suppose I have an R data frame with columns that specify location (lat/long), height, and gender of individuals: x I want to bin the data in two dimensions (e.g. into 1000m x 1000m squares) and compute the following (then display on a map): What percentage of individuals in each bin are female What is the average height of males in each bin If possible I'd like to use ggplot2.
