Using General Mixed Effects models to address pseudo replication

A common problem in animal studies is pseudoreplication of data points due to a limit in the number of animals available in a study population. I need to address any pseudoreplication and influence of individual in my study. I had planned to model ID (individual animal) as a random factor in a glmr. In my main study, with a large data set I am using permutation based logistic regressions for whether animals of a certain age class are underweight. Looking at a model : mod1 against (likelihood ratio test) a permuted data set of the same data, this finds Age class predicts tendency to be underweight. To factor in ID into this, I assign individual identity to a subset of my data (was not possible time wise to ID whole data set) I had planned to address pseudo replication as a post hoc assessment on the work with this subset of data. I am confused as to the method for this, would I: a) do a simple LRT test between a model that factors in ID and doesn't, if there is no sig difference then ID has no effect, i.e.: glm1 Or b) Do I also need to interpret ID into some kind of permutation test like the original model?
