How to save this rtmp flash video stream?

My sister wanted me to save http://esewingworkshop.com/video-lesson/overview-zipper-types flash video & couple more for offline viewing purposes and asked me how to save it. I immediately fired firebug in firefox but surprisingly the video source is not in the requests. http://hwcdn.net/m7n9i8d5/fms/videos/5_Standard_Zipper/B_Overview_of_Zipper_Types.flv.smil is the last request that is being made. response being: So, I its using rtmp streaming protocol. I tried to figure out the source of this stream. I used "wireshark" and analysed the traffic and followed the TCP stream POST http://fms006.lo1.hwcdn.net/fcs/ident2 HTTP/1.1 Content-Type: application/x-fcs User-Agent: Shockwave Flash Host: fms035.lo1.hwcdn.net Content-Length: 1 Proxy-Connection: Keep-Alive Pragma: no-cache HTTP/1.1 200 OK Cache-Control: no-cache Connection: Keep-Alive Content-Length: 14 Server: FlashCom/3.5.5 Content-Type: text/plain 209.197.11.150POST http://209.197.11.219/open/1 HTTP/1.1 Content-Type: application/x-fcs User-Agent: Shockwave Flash Host: 209.197.11.219 Content-Length: 1 Proxy-Connection: Keep-Alive Pragma: no-cache HTTP/1.1 200 OK Cache-Control: no-cache Connection: Keep-Alive Content-Length: 17 Server: FlashCom/3.5.5 Content-Type: application/x-fcs Wubmcmj7Q1T-6Tic POST http://209.197.11.219/idle/Wubmcmj7Q1T-6Tic/0 HTTP/1.1 Content-Type: application/x-fcs User-Agent: Shockwave Flash Host: 209.197.11.219 Content-Length: 1 Proxy-Connection: Keep-Alive Pragma: no-cache HTTP/1.1 200 OK Cache-Control: no-cache Connection: Keep-Alive Content-Length: 1 Server: FlashCom/3.5.5 Content-Type: application/x-fcs POST http://209.197.11.219/send/Wubmcmj7Q1T-6Tic/1 HTTP/1.1 Content-Type: application/x-fcs User-Agent: Shockwave Flash Host: 209.197.11.219 Content-Length: 1537 Proxy-Connection: Keep-Alive Pragma: no-cache HTTP/1.1 200 OK Cache-Control: no-cache Connection: Keep-Alive Content-Length: 3074 Server: FlashCom/3.5.5 Content-Type: application/x-fcs and these are HTTP POST requests made by shockwave flash player (plugin-containter.exe) in order http://fms006.lo1.hwcdn.net/fcs/ident2 http://209.197.11.150/open/1 http://209.197.11.150/idle/2BZmcmj6mhTWexFa/0 http://209.197.11.150/send/2BZmcmj6mhTWexFa/1 http://209.197.11.150/send/2BZmcmj6mhTWexFa/2 http://209.197.11.150/idle/2BZmcmj6mhTWexFa/3 http://209.197.11.150/send/2BZmcmj6mhTWexFa/4 http://209.197.11.150/send/2BZmcmj6mhTWexFa/5 http://209.197.11.150/idle/2BZmcmj6mhTWexFa/6 _this continues till /407..._ I don't get it. I'm little confused about how exactly this communication is taking place? I'm unable to find the video source. As far as I understood, from the SMIL request (browser made it) its getting the server address and then shockwaveplayer is taking over the communication and responses to these HTTP POST requests are the video in chunks. But how & where is it identifying which video it wants? Where is RTMP? what is the url? How can I download it?
