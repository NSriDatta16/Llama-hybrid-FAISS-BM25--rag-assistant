There are a few possible reasons for this. It is possible that the default properties were changed and now point to an invalid location. This usually happens when the different components are installed and you select to provide the connection details again rather than to reuse the existing configuration. Another possibility is that the default properties have been changed to point to a different Coordination QMgr. Sometimes people want to run Prod and Dev agents on the same host and set up connectivity to more than one Coordination QMgr. The result is that the default properties can point to only one at a time and so some agent directories are found while others are not. The trick to making this work is to use the -P option to select the proper Coordination QMgr.
