Unless you're writing a NB plugin, you don't want it on the NB boot class path. You want it on your project's class path. First you need to add mail.jar as a library. Tools > Libraries New Library Library name Java Mail Library Type: Class Libraries OK Add JAR/Folder Browse to the javamail.jar Add JAR/Folder OK Now, add the library to your project File > Project Properties Libraries Compile tab Add Library (If you're using NB 6.9, there may be an additional Import Libraries step here) Select Java Mail from the list OK That should be it. Note that you will needs to ensure the javamail.jar is distributed with your application; either directly or through a jnlp file.
