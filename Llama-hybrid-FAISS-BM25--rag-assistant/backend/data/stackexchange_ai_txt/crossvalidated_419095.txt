Could anyone explain the terms "Hypothesis space" "sample space" "parameter space" "feature space in machine learning with one concrete example?

I am confused with these machine learning terms, and trying to distinguish them with one concrete example. for instance, use logistic regression to classify a bunch of cat images. assume there are 1,000 images with labels indicating the corresponding image is or is not a cat image. each image has a size of 100*100. given above, is my following understanding right? the sample space is the 1,000 images. the feature space is 100*100 pixels. the parameter space is a vector that has a length of 100*100+1. the Hypothesis space is the set of all the possible hyperplanes that have some attribute that I have no idea.
