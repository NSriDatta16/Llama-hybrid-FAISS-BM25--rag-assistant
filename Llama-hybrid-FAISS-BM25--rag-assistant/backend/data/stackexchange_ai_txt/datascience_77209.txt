What AI model should I build to find out how similar are the 2 audio files of musical instruments like piano, guitar, synthesizer?

I have a idea for a project in AI, and I want to know how can I build such kind of AI models. I have good understanding of ML, and some beginner level understanding of Deep learning. What should I learn in order to build such projects? I want to compare 2 audio files, of musical instruments being recorded. I want my model to tell, what differences are there in these 2 music/songs. Differences like in reverb, and delay, instruments played in wrong key, improper mixing/mastering, different waveforms in oscillators, improper automation, wrong ADSR values, etc. One of these file will be upload by me, and other will be uploaded by the user/student. And then, my AI model will tell the student what should be improved in his/her music to be able to sound like mine.
