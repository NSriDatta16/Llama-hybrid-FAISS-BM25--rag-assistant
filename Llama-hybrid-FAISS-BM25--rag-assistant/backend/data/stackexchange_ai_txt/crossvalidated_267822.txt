There's multiple things going on here. First, it is not clear to me what your causal quantity of interest is. If it is the ATE of having a female CEO as opposed to having a male CEO, you basically need make sure that you block all back-door paths from the decision to hire a CEO of a certain gender to the firm performance outcome. This is very hard, as the decision is undertaken internally, and the board may have much more information than the researcher. This information drives them to pick a certain CEO and also influences future performance. Also, I am not sure the panel structure helps much in this case, because this unobserved information changes over time and can probably not be captured by firm or time fixed effects. Second, you mention that you adjust for "size , profitability, leverage". Depending on the time at which you measure these, these variables may actually be influenced by the gender of the CEO. If you're interested in the ATE, you must not adjust for them (but it would make sense to adjust for lagged values of them). However, if you're interested in some kind of "direct effect" of CEO gender, you would need to adjust for them, but in general, identifying the direct effect is even harder than identifying the ATE. See the article Neil G referred to, Pearl, Judea. "Interpretation and identification of causal mediation." Psychological Methods 19.4 (2014). Lastly, you mention reverse causality. In your context, this would mean future performance influencing past gender of the CEO. This is physically impossible, and so not an issue.
