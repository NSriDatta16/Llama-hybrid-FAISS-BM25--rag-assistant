A time-series data set is just data collected through time. For calling it a time series, it doesn't matter if futures values are a function of past values or not. So in your moon brightness example, if you measure the brightness and record the time of measurement, it's time-series data. Even the number of road accident deaths for each year is time-series data. Suppose, I roll a die 100 times and note down the outcome of each roll, this data set is also time series. Now, given time-series data, one useful thing to do is to forecast the future values of the series. For doing this, one way is to model the time series as a sequence of random variables and look for correlation among these variables, referred to as autocorrelation in time series terminology. If this correlation exists, it can be used to forecast values ahead even if there may not be a causal relationship between future and past values. Remember, correlation is not causation, but the correlation is still very useful in forecasting. This is a good place to get more information on time series data and what you can do with it.
