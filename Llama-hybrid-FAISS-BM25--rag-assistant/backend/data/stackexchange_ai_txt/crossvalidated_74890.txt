I'm reluctant to post because I don't quite understand what you're looking for here. Maybe this will jumpstart someone else to respond that has a better grasp of what you want. "I would like to draw conclusions about whether Z is in fact a significant factor in the outcome variable via interactions b4 and b5, but I understand that in a logistic regression all coefficients and particularly interactions need to be evaluated in the context of specific values of the independent variable x." The statement above isn't quite correct. Z is significant, the p-value for the interaction term is significant so Z is significant. You don't need to go much further (unless you tested an unreasonable number of interactions/data size small). It does not make a difference that Z is not significant if the higher order interactions are significant. To estimate the effect of Z on the outcome, this needs to be done in the context of specific values of the independent variable x. This is often best done graphically.
