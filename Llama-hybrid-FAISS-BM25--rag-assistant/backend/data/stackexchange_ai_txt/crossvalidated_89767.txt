Given that business is categorical, you can't use correlation. Business score looks like it is a 1-5 rating or something like that. If that is the case, I would recommend ordinal logistic regression In SAS use PROC LOGISTIC . In R there is polr . The dependent variable would be "score" and the independent variable "type of business".
