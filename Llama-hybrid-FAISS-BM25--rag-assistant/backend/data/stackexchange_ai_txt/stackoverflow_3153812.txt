Deploying a jar in Jboss

I have some .jspf files that are fragments which I include in a new .jsp file. The reason they are fragments is that they are reused across multiple jsps with some additional components. My issue now is that I want to use these .jsps in 2 different .war files. So I created a new .jar file which includes these jspf, now I am trying to deploy this jar so that I am then import it in my new jsp which is inside 1 of the 2 wars. I am not able to deploy the jar succesfully in Jboss 4.2. I am using Eclipse ide. Any ideas on this? If there is an alternate approach I would appreciate any ideas. Thanks for this suggestion, I have followed this idea and deployed my war1 which contains my .jspf files. So in my war2 on a jsp I do: However I am not able to render this page with the included fragment, I am not sure how to address the imported jspf. I ahve tried several different ways like: and also using var name like: However it keeps looking inside the current war. How can I tell it to include the newly imported fragment and display it? Thanks in advance.
