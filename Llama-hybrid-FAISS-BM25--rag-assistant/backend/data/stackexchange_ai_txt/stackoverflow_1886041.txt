What black magic does .NET (or Windows?) use to accomplish this? My understanding is that it doesn't. To reference a 32-bit dll, you will need to set the target platform to AnyCPU or x86 rather than x64 when building. If you have a look under %WINDIR%\Microsoft.NET on a 64 bit version of windows you will find 2 runtimes under Framework and Framework64, with the Framework64 starting at 2.0, where it was first supported. After a little more digging, here's a similar question . Why would there be such a large different between the memory footprint when the application is compiled as a x86-64 architecture? Robert is...err was correct (he deleted his answer:), more info thanks to Hanselman , but there are other costs too . From what I found when we were deciding on our approach* most folks seem to report around 20-40% increase in memory usage. * We ended up targeting AnyCPU for .NET, and then for Wix (MSI deployment) compiled once for x86 and once for x64.
