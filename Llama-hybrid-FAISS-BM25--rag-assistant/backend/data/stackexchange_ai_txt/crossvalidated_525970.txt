Classification / learning with one class

My dataset contains a single class, which has noisy examples. Up to now I have been converting this to a binary classification problem and using logistic regression, however this does not feel correct, as the negative class has data which is not truly part of a single class, it is just not in the "positive" class. I stumbled upon and tried OneClassSVM with little success (in terms of classification performance). What are some possible techniques for learning the distribution of just one class? Am I formulating the problem in the correct manner? My specific dataset are document vectors created by a doc2vec model. EDIT: Adding more information based on comments. The task is to classify webpages that will be relevant for certain advertisers based on past performance. We have a positive class, where we know there was a positive interaction. I have been training an LR model based on this positive interaction and a sample of pages where no interaction occurred. EDIT 2: Again based on the comments I would like to provide a simpler contrived example to see if my thinking about this is wrong. Let's say we want to classify webpage as being about football , we could: train a classifier of football VS non-football train a model to learn the distribution of football and treat all other articles as outliers Is the second option an incorrect way of framing this problem?
