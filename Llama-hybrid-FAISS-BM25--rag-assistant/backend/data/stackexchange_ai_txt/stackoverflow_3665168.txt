How to copy and paste script text from SSMS to Outlook or Word without garbling it?

Say, I have a script nicely formatted in SSMS and it's annotated with all kinds of comments in different languages. But when I copy and paste this nice thingy into Word with syntax highlighted I will get a syntax-highlighted message with those comments garbled, as if reading the source text with one code page and pasting it using another code page. Very nasty kinda bug. Does anyone know how to solve this issue once and for all? Thank you! [Update] [Solution] Save → Save with Encoding... → Encoding : Unicode (UTF-8 with signature).
