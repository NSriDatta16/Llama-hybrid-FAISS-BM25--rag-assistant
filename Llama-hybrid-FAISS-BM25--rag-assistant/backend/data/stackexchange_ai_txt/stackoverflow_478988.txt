Good Performance VS Elegant Design They are not mutually exclusive but I can't stand over-designed class structures/frameworks that completely have no clue about performance. I don't need to have a string of new This(new That(new Whatever())); to create an object that will tell me it's 5 AM in the morning oh by the way, it's 217 days until Obama's birthday, and the weekend is 2 days away. I only wanted to know if the gym was open. Having balance between the 2 are crucial. The code needs to get nasty when you need to pump out all the processor do something intensive such as reading terabytes of data. Save the elegance for the places that consume the 10% of resources which is probably more than 90% of the code.
