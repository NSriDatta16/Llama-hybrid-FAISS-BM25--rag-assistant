Use reflection when there is no other way! This is a matter of performance! If you have looked into .NET performance pitfalls before, it might not surprise you how slow the normal reflection is: a simple test with repeated access to an int property proved to be ~1000 times slower using reflection compared to the direct access to the property (comparing the average of the median 80% of the measured times). See this: .NET reflection - performance MSDN has a pretty nice article about When Should You Use Reflection?
