The usual approach for modelling this type of data structure is to use a fractional logistic regression. The canonical paper is this one by Papke and Wooldridge. Further details can be found here and here . Sadly, it does not seem that there is an appropriate model in SPSS, but maybe others can help more here. (The model is, for example, available in R: see here .)
