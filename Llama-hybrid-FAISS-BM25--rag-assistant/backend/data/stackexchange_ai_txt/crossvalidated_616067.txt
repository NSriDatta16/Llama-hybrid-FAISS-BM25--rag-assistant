Using ANOVA for variable selection in Multinomial Logistic Regression

The aim of my project is to find the association between a group of independent variables and a categorical dependent variable (with three levels). For variable selection, my supervisor suggested employing the ANOVA test for each variable separately among the levels of the categorical variable. (he also provided me this link as a reference https://padhokshaja.medium.com/using-anova-and-multinomial-logistic-regression-to-predict-human-activity-cd2101a5e8bf ) But I was wondering if the ANOVA test could be employed before running the logistic regression. As I remember, for the Anova test, the response variable needs to be continuous. So, before conducting a multiple logistic regression, should I perform a univariate logistic regression instead? Thanks so much for your help.
