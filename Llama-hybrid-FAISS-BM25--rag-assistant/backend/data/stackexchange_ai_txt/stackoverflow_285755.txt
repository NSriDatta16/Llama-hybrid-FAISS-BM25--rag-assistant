Referencing and using other libraries, if you're including the source, is accomplished simply by #including the header files for the library into whatever .cpp file you need them in (and then compile the source for the library along with your project). Most of the time, however, you'll probably be using a .lib (static library) or .dll (dynamic library). Most (all?) DLLs come with a .lib file, so the procedure for both types is the same: include the appropriate header files where you need them, then add the associated .lib file during the linking step (in visual studio, I think you can just add the file to the project). It's been a long time since I've created my own libraries for others to use, so I'll let someone else answer that part. Or I'll come back and edit this answer tomorrow, since I'm going to have to create a .lib for work tomorrow :) String stuff is usually accomplished with std::string. Under special circumstances, you may also use the old C-style sprintf() function, but that's generally discouraged. As far as the data structures you're looking for, check out the STL (Standard Template Library). It includes List, Vector, Map, String, etc that should be familiar to you. I'm not sure what you mean by type conversions... I assume you know about casting, so you must mean something more complex than that, in which case it's probably specific to the types you're trying to convert. Maybe someone else can offer more info.
