Smoothing dirty data?

I'm trying to do analysis on revenue data and due to circumstances beyond my pay grade, there are large spikes in the data around the time financial reports are due, followed by corresponding low values immediately after. Is there a preferred algorithm or methodology to compensate for this and get more meaningful data? It would seem that a simple moving average would be inappropriate for the task, given that I know there are discontinuities at time edges. Is there a better smoothing strategy?
