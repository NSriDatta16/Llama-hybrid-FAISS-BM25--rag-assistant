How do I stop jetty server in clojure?

I am writing a web application using ring and clojure. I am using the jetty adapter for the development server and emacs/SLIME for IDE. While wrap-reload does help, run-jetty blocks my slime session and I would like to be able to start/stop it at will without having to run it in a separate terminal session. Ideally, I would like to define a server agent and functions start-server and stop-server that would start/stop the server inside the agent. Is this possible?
