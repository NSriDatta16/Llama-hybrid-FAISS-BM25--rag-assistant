I would prefer that point were an object of object, with time keys storing coordinates, like point = { : { x : ... , y : ... }, : { x : ... , y : ... }, ... } so you can access directly with point.time.x and point.time.y , since x and y are related to a specific time (if I well understood) instead, with a flat array given a specific time you should make offset operation to retrieve x and y, not so elegant
