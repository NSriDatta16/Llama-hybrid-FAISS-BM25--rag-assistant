Sure, there's Spambase , which is as far as i'm aware, is the most widely cited spam data set in the machine learning literature. I have used this data set many times; each time i am impressed how much effort has been put into the formatting and documentation of this data set. A few characteristics of the Spambase set: 4601 data points--all complete each comprised of 58 features (attributes) each data point is labelled 'spam' or 'no spam' approx. 40% are labeled spam of the features, all are continuous (vs. discrete) a representative feature: average continuous sequence of capital letters Spambase is archived in the UCI Machine Learning Repository ; in addition, it's also available on the Website for the excellent ML/Statistical Computation Treatise, Elements of Statistical Learning by Hastie et al.
