Firefox plugin crashes in Chrome

From what I gather, Google Chrome can run browser plugins written using NPAPI . I've written one that does its job just fine in Firefox, but makes Chrome crash and burn as soon as you embed it on a page. I don't even have to call any of my methods, embedding is enough to cause a crash. How do I debug this? I tried attaching the debugger to chrome but the stack traces I get are deep down in Chrome itself and like I said, none of "my" actual code is being run, but supposedly just the NPAPI init code. I'd appreciate some pointers.
