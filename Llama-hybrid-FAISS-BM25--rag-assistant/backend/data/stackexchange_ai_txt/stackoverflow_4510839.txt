You cannot have a single group of form elements be part of two separate forms. It's just not possible to construct a valid document like that. Javascript that dynamically updates the URL in the "action" property of the parent should not be too hard to do. As you suggested, the "class" attribute of the radio button elements can be used to guide the code, making it pretty flexible if you need to add one or more buttons later on. Since you included the jQuery tag: $(function() { var actionMap = { key1: 'http://yoursite.com/some/action/1', key2: 'http://yoursite.com/some/action/2', /* ... */ }; $('input:radio').click(function() { var $rb = $(this); for (var key in actionMap) { if ($rb.hasClass(key)) $rb.closest('form').attr('action', actionMap[key]); } }); }); or something. You could also use an HTML5-style "data-" attribute to store the URLs directly on the radio button elements, or a key fragment of the URL. (Also might want to handle the "change" event the same way, etc.)
