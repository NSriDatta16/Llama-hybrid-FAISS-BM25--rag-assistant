While @propofol's answer is correct for your given scenario with no covariates, if you wish to extend your analysis to include covariates like patient characteristics, contingency table analysis quickly becomes cumbersome. From there, you'd probably use either binomial or logistic regression. Given the relatively high prevalence of recurrence in your data set (~24%), I would probably go with binomial regression, which will provide you with a better estimate. But really, if you want to include covariates like that, my best advice is to go find a statistically-inclined epidemiologist or biostatistician.
