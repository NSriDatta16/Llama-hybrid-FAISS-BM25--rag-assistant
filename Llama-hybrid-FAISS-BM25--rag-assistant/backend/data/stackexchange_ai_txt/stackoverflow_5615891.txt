Trouble Getting s3 set up in Rails 3 Refinery CMS App

I'm trying to get my refinery cms image storage to Amazon s3 and I'm following this guide: http://refinerycms.com/guides/how-to-use-amazon-s3-for-storage But I'm blocked here: There are a number of ways to set these with your credentials, including unix variables or settings them manually through Ruby using ENV. How do I define these credentials. Do I put something like :S3_KEY => "my_key" in my environments.rb file? I tried this and it didn't work. I also tried this: AWS::S3::Base.establish_connection!( :access_key_id => ENV['S3_KEY'] || 'key_goes_here', :secret_access_key => ENV['S3_SECRET'] || 's3_secret_key_here', ) Can't figure out how to do this. Any ideas are greatly appreciated.
