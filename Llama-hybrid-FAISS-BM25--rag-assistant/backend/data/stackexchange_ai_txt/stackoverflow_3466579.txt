As far as I'm concerned, none of the above solutions worked on their own, also this thread didn't help much on its own, but after combining the approaches I managed to reload my models in shell_plus : Make changes to the model (MyModel) remove models.pyc Clean Django model cache (like here ): from django.db.models.loading import AppCache cache = AppCache() from django.utils.datastructures import SortedDict cache.app_store = SortedDict() cache.app_models = SortedDict() cache.app_errors = {} cache.handled = {} cache.loaded = False Reload model like here reload(project.app.models) from project.app.models import MyModel
