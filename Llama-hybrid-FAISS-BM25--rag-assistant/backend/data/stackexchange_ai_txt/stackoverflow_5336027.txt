dynamically hardcode checkbox, dictionary into .cs

This question is about programming approach. I just began developing wpf in c# not long ago and need some help here. Basically right now i have 2 files - 1.Text file call it(Textfile) and 2. Xml file. My program approach is as below: Run the program (this program contains hard-coded checkboxes) Do an xml parsing. I have a dictionary with values and keys hard-coded. If xml's attribute's descendants do not contain these values, new checkboxes will be created in a stackpanel of the program. Do a "Textfile" parsing. Using the "Textfile" as discussed earlier on, if i have certain strings in the textfile, i will check or uncheck the hard-coded checkboxes Build button event. Users will then manually edit as they wish(check or uncheck whichever checkbox they like) and click on the "build" button and this event will write the new copy of "Textfile". If checkbox were checked, individual strings will be written. So let's call a new target found in the xml file as "Exec_newtarget". So what i need to do is this: Run the program Do xml parsing. Compare with dictionary values and keys, if the value "Exec_newtarget" do not exist, this will be hard-coded into the dictionary object in the .cs file and "Exec_newtarget" checkbox will be created in the .cs file Do a "Textfile" parsing. This will check or uncheck the hard-coded checkboxes Build button event. New "Textfile" will be written and if the "Exec_newtarget" checkbox is checked, "Exec_newtarget" will be written as a string into the "Textfile" Run the program again Do xml parsing (To check for new targets such as "Exec_nexttarget") Do Texfile parsing. This time since "Exec_newtarget" was written previously (as in 4.), "Exec_newtarget" will be checked Build button event writes a new "Textfile" ... ... rinse and repeat So my question is, is it possible to dynamically hardcode dictionary values, keys and checkboxes into .cs file? if so how should i do it. Or is there a better way for my program to work? Edit 1: Here i will explain to you why I am doing this. My project is to automate manual processes. Previously users have to go to this "Textfile" and choose the appropriate targets they need and edit manually. For example, if they need "Exec_newtarget", they will go to "#Exec_newtarget" and remove "#". There are over 40 such strings to be edited and it can be a hassle to do it individually. The main process is to run a bat file. When the bat file is executed, the strings found in "Textfile" which will essentially be found in the xml file then perform processes as needed. This xml file is constantly updated with new attributes and descendants. To maintain the structure of .the xml file as well as to simplify things, a copy of the "Textfile" is generated automatically instead of manually adding new strings into the "Textfile"
