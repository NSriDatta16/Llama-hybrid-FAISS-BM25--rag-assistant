jsp:setProperty equivalent for servlet

Is there an equivalent to: for servlets? Something that will auto-populate the bean from inside a servlet using the request parameters? I'm refactoring a JSP-only application and would like to move some of the code to servlets. For a bunch of tragic reasons, we are not able (right now) to use any frameworks to make this easier.
