Comparing test and validation ROC curves statistically

So I have two sets of data my validation set and my test set. I have a neural network model that was tuned on the validation set and then finally tested on the test set and I got similar results in both the validation and test set. I was wondering if there is was a typical way of comparing the ROC curve where essentially I will be using the same model but on two different data sets to show they are similar. The idea being I would like to show I'm not over or underfitting to the validation set. I saw one paper do something along these lines but it was unclear what statistical test they used. Any suggestions on what method I could look at?
