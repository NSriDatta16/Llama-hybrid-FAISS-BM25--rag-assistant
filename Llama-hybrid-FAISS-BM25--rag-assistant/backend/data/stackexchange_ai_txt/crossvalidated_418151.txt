How human beings make daily decisions, which usually involve huge search spaces? We do abstraction, we think hierarchically, we divide and conquer, we search for a solution guided by heuristics that allow us to focus our search in directions that appear most promising. I believe to deal with huge search spaces, the planning algorithms should have the same mechanisms mentioned above. Reinforcement learning is nothing but dynamic programming (sth very basic to planning guys) plus function approximation. If anyone thinks DP+function fitting means strong intelligence that is going to solve complex planning problems, good luck!
