One assumption of fixed-effects general linear models (e.g. "ordinary" logistic regression) is that observations are independent of each other. However, there is likely some dependency in the observations in your study. For example, two people living in the same household are more likely to have similar diets and similar levels of physical activity than two people living in separate households. I would consider modelling the data using either a logistic or Poisson mixed-effects model. The fixed effects would be your measured exposure covariates. The random effect would be the household. I am not particularly famililar with Stata's mixed effects syntax. In R, for a logistic mixed-effects model, I would call glmer(outcome ~ exposure1 + exposure2 + (1|household), data = study.data, family = binomial) . A quick Google search suggests that the equivalent in Stata would be xtmelogit outcome exposure1 exposure2 || household .
