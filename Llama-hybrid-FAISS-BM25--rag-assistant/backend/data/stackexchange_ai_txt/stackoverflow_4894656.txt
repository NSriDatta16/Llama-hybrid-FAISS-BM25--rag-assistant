jQuery UI nested list create new child list

I have set up nested drag and drop with jQuery UI however, I was wondering how it it possible to drag an item in such a way that it creates a new child list. E.g. if I drag item 1.2.2 to the right it will create a new sub-level under item 1.2.1. This is my code: Item #1 Item #2 Item #1.1 Item #1.2 Item #1.2.1 Item #1.2.2 Item #1.2.3 Item #1.2.4 Item #1.3 Item #1.4 Item #3 Item #4 $(document).ready( function() { $("#mylist ul").sortable( { items: "li", connectWith: 'ul', } ); } ); UPDATE: Actually. It's not working properly at all with my example code. I just noticed that when I drag a parent is should drag all it's children as well, which it currently doesn't. I like it to be able to do that as well.
