I gave it a try, I created a new Winform application, I dragged and dropped a DataGridView on my Form, and in the Form1() method, I pasted your code (except the DisplayMember and createCol lines) : DataGridViewComboBoxColumn cbol = new DataGridViewComboBoxColumn(); cbol.HeaderText = "Actions"; cbol.Items.Add("Print Job Card"); cbol.Items.Add("Print Invoice"); cbol.Items.Add("Close Job Card"); cbol.Name = "bcolumn"; dataGridView1.Columns.Add(cbol); It worked perfectly. So my 1st question is: where do you use your code ? 2nd question if the 1st one doesn't help you: you see, in my code, dataGridView1 is not in blue, because it's an instance of DataGridView . In yours, it is capitalized and it's in blue. Maybe there's something in there ?
