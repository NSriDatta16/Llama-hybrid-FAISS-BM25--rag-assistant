It is really depends: What is file size What durability requirements do you have? How many updates do you perform? What is file system? It is not obvious that MySQL would be faster: I did once such comparison for small object in order to use it as sessions storage for CppCMS . With one index (Key Only) and Two indexes (primary key and secondary timeout). File System: XFS ext3 ----------------------------- Writes/s: 322 20,000 Data Base \ Indexes: Key Only Key+Timeout ----------------------------------------------- Berkeley DB 34,400 1,450 Sqlite No Sync 4,600 3,400 Sqlite Delayed Commit 20,800 11,700 As you can see, with simple Ext3 file system was faster or as fast as Sqlite3 for storing data because it does not give you (D) of ACID. On the other hand... DB gives you many, many important features you probably need, so I would not recommend using files as storage unless you really need it. Remember, DB is not always the bottle neck of the system
