Tolerance Interval from the posterior predictive distribution of a ratio of two Normal distributions

I am trying to calculate a Beta-Gamma Tolerance Interval from the Posterior Predictive Distribution of a log(ratio) of two normal (no close form available). In the minimal R code below, assume x1 and x2 are actually posterior distributions generated from an MCMC sampler. I am trying to get a tolerance interval for x3 . Is this possible? x1 = rnorm(1e5, 5, 1) x2 = rnorm(1e5, 5, 1) x3 = log(x1/x2)
