One way to get the result you want is to use String.Format as follow: double x = 20.0e-6; string y = string.Format("{0:0.######}",x); Console.WriteLine(y); Given your example, this outputs the value 0.00002 EDIT I've just realised that this is actually the opposite of your question so in the aim of keeping the answer useful i'll add the following: Given a string, you can parse as double and then apply the same logic as above. Probably not the most elegant solution however it offers another way to get the result you want. string x = "20.0e-6"; var y = double.Parse(p); Console.WriteLine(String.Format("{0:0.######}",y));
