The standard concept for running code inside a web server is the "Servlet API" from Sun. Essentially it provides a few interfaces which the web server uses to invoke your code, and defines how the web server should behave. This allows you to write very generic code that can run in a variety of web containers which implement the Servlet API. See the Wikipedia article for details - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Servlet . They come in all sizes too, depending on your needs. Some small enough for embedding in your own application, some very big. The servlet API allows you not to care. For a beginner, the quickest way to get up and running, is to download the full version of Netbeans which includes full support for doing this kind of work, and has a built in servlet container.
