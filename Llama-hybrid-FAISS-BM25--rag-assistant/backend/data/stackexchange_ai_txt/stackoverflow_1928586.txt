How about a deterministic way (if you do not wish sets to intersect at all): A) Turn sets in H into vertices labeled 1, 2, 3, ... size(H). Create a complete [un] directed graph between them all. Each vertex gets a value - equal to the cardinality / size of the set. B) Go through all elements x in sets in H, create a mapping x -> [x1, x2, ... xm] if and only if x is in H[xi]. An array of sets will do. This helps you find overlapping sets. C) Go through through all sets in this array, for every pair of x1, x2 that are within the same set - eliminate two edges between x1 and x2. D) In the remaining graph only non-overlapping sets (well, their indices in H). E) Now find the non-intersecting path within this graph with the highest total value. From this you can reconstruct the list of non-intersecting sets with highest coverage. It is trivial to compute the missing elements. F) If you want to minimize the cardinality of the remaining set, then subtract 0.5 from the value of each vertex. We know that 1 + 1 = 2, but 0.5 + 0.5
