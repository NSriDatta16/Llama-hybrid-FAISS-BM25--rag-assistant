ModalPopupExtender: How do I retain my position after dragging and firing a post back?

I've already tried Google searching for this and looking at the source for this control, but didn't find the answer. If I was able to link into a drag event I would be able to solver this, but I don't think it exists (see this link for a solution with a DragDropPanel ( http://www.dotnetcurry.com/ShowArticle.aspx?ID=181 ). How can I do this with the modalPopupExtender? The popup is working well, but after dragging it to a different location, then clicking the Test Partial Postback, the dialog is recentered to its default location. Dialog Title Hello!!
