Understanding PCA - How to calculate scores

I'm looking for advice to whether or not the following method is good and is standard for calculating PCA of the data. So the examples that I will give will be small. Given a matrix of $A = [4, 6, 10; 3, 10, 13; -2, -6, -8]$ and Compute the Covariance matrix given as: $$A = \begin{bmatrix} 10.3& 24.6 & 35.0\\ 24.6& 69.3 & 94.0\\ 35.0& 94.0 &129.0 \end{bmatrix}$$ I then compute the Eigenvalues and Eigen vectors of this matrix. In order to calculate the PCA, I then do the following: 1) Take the square root of the eigen values -> Giving the singular values of the eigenvalues 2) I then standardises the input matrix $A$ with the following: $A - mean(A) / sd(A)$ 3) Finally, to calculate the scores, I simply multiply "A" (after computing the standardization with with Eigenvectors This would then give me the PCA scores? Is this correct or am I missing something?
