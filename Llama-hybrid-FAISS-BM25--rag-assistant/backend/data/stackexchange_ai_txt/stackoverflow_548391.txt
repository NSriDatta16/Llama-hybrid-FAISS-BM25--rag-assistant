I would say a definite no. Modern games are certainly impressive, though their software and hardware technology lags significantly behind the state of the art in the academia, industry, and military. After all, they are meant to run on common enough home hardware. I am sure that the military trains their people on more realistic simulations. From a computational standpoint, games are not that interesting either. Modern games (e.g., Fallout 3, GTA4) certainly seem amazing because of their "opened world" and extremely long story, but that has nothing to do with technology, but rather with production value. Popular games now require a larger cast and investment than some Hollywood movies. So sure, you have a model of New York rather than a block, but so what? Even MMORPGS are not that impressive. Yes, they have many interacting agents. However, enterprise applications that include automated agents have way more agents, operate faster, and have higher reliability requirements. Finally, I would say that with the exception of cutting-edge algorithms that are tested out using games such as chess since these serve as benchmarks, game AI is not that advanced. Again, the military (and financial companies) have much smarter applications.
