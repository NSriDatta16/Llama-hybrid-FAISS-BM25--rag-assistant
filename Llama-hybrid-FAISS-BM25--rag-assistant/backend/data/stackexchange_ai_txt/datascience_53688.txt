Standardization After PCA for Kmean clustering

I want to apply Kmean for clustering after PCA dimensionality reduction. I have standardized data with StandardScaler before the PCA, then I want to train Kmeans for finding clusters. However, the variance among the PCA components could not be of the same order of magnitude. It is a good practice to standardize the PCA components before the clustering?
