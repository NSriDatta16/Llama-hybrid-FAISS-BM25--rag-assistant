In a simple regression problem, the slope describes an average increase of y when x increases by 1 unit. What you are showing here is just an equation: y = f(x). Your question seems more about understanding the slope of a line in general. Your interpretation assumes that a small slope indicates a small effect because it is small. However, the effect of a treatment can be a large multiple of your slope. It does not have to be a unit increase. Imagine that x is the amount of seconds spent in training during 10 days and that you train 2 hours per day. Let x=0 before you start training. After training x=10 * 2 * 60 * 60=72 000. Hence, the effect of that short training program on y is 72 000 * (- 0.00344) = -247.68. Now, let's turn back to the kilograms. Let y be the fat gain in kg. Say, we are working with a microscopic animal, weighting 10mg. To get an effect relevant for that animal, we convert the effect to be at the mg scale. A decrease of 0.00344kg corresponds to a decrease of 3440.0mg per unit increase in x. Is that a small effect? In any case, our small animal may soon go extinct. Hope this help a bit.
