For completeness, Effective REST Services via .NET: For .NET Framework 3.5 by Kenn Scribner and Scott Seely exists. DNR or HC or DFB spoke to Scott and I bought it for general WCF coverage. I have yet to read it (or even leaf through it) and will report back if/when I do (though I wouldnt be surprised if it I dont even do that before running to OpenRasta).
