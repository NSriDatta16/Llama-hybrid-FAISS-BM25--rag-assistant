Time series Forecasting in Python - comparing different models

I have a large number of different timeseries and I need to create a forecast for each one of them. Are there packages that enable: Auto tuning of models? Cross validation of different tuned models - both classical models and Neural Nets models (ARIMA, Holt, Holt-Winters, Prophet, LSTM, etc) using a chosen measurement/s (For example MAPE, RMSE) and choosing for each timeseries the prediction of the best fitted model? Editing: I found pyAF which is nice, but it's not well documented and it seems there is still some work on it - hence it's not good enough for me. Thanks.
