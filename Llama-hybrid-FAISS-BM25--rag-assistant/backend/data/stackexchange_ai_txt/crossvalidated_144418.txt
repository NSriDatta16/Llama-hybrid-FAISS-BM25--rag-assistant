Does the sign on a non-significant IV coefficient matter?

I have a logistic regression where I am forcing some IVs into the model. I am getting the "wrong sign" i.e. contrary to what is expected, but the association is not significant. Does the sign matter when the IV is not-significant (I can live with it being not significant)? And does the magnitude of the coefficient matter when the association is not significant?
