Are decision tree algorithms linear or nonlinear

Recently a friend of mine was asked whether decision tree algorithms are linear or nonlinear algorithms in an interview. I tried to look for answers to this question but couldn't find any satisfactory explanation. Can anyone answer and explain the solution to this question? Also, what are some other examples of nonlinear machine learning algorithms?
