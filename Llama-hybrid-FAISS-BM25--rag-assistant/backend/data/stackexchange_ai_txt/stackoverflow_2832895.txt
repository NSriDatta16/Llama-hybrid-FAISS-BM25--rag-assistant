After considering carefully my code, I understand now what's going on. OrganizationFormModelView is the class that is being serialized, and here's its definition. [Serializable] public class OrganizationFormViewModel { public Organization Organization { get; set; } [NonSerialized] public SelectList ParentOrgList = null; public OrganizationFormViewModel(Organization organization, SelectList cList) { Organization = organization ?? new Organization(); ParentOrgList = pList; } } From that, I've concluded that, After each serialization process, ParentOrgList is set to null, so I need to find a way of re-assigning value to it. So, below is what I did: public ActionResult CreateOrganization(string nextButton) { //Omitted for brievety if (formViewModel.ParentOrgList == null) formViewModel.ParentOrgList = repository.CommuneList; //Omitted for brievety } I also, modified the View so that, even if the value of the ParentOrgList is continuously re-assigned, but the DropDownList keeps the user's choice. So, I choose an Helper overload with default value. ... ... Now, everything is working perfectly. However, If someone knows how to proceed differently with the Serialization business, it'd be helpful to share. Thanks
