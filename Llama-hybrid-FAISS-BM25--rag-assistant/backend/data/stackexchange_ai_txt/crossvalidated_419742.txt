Since each sample can have more than one label associated with it one possible solution would be to train $M$ logistic regression models, where the response variable for label $i$ , sample $n$ , is $Y_{i,n}$ where $Y_{i,n}=1$ if sample $n$ belongs to class $i$ and $Y_{i,n}=0$ if it does not. For a new sample $Z$ your model output can be interpreted as the probability $Z$ belongs to each individual class.
