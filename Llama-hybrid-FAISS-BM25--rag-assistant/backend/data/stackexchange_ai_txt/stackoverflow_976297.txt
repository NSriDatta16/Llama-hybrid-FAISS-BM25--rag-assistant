I hate when something is written like that. First I look at the code and think "if cmd is equal to JustifyLeft or JustifyRight... then invert that and... if that's true do the thing.. so that means if it's JustifyLeft...". For me it takes alot of time and I have to re-read the line to be sure I got it right. I think it's better to write. if ((cmd !== 'JustifyLeft') && (cmd !== 'JustifyRight') && (cmd !== 'JustifyCenter') && (cmd !== 'JustifyFull')) It might be a little more verbose but I find it easier to follow. I read it as "cmd can't be any of the Justify-strings". Checking a long boolean expression and then inverting the whole answer is irritating. I like the solution from scragar, just wanted to give my thoughts about inverting a long boolean expression.
