Don't worry about engineering features for a neural network. The point of them is that they learn the features well themselves. In a nutshell, first, make sure you have a representative validation set that you check regularly. Then, build a network large enough to overfit, and one small enough to underfit. The sweet spot is somewhere in the middle; find that based on minimisation of validation loss.
