SVM for fMRI: unbalanced data - leave-one-triplet-out?

I am using SVM (sklearn.svm) to classify fMRI data from two groups of people. One group has n = 25 and the other n = 26. Everyone except for one person has seen 96 trials, so in total I have 2,496 image files in one category and 2,398 in the other. Since the data is slightly unbalanced, I thought of two options: Using a leave-one-triplet-out crossvalidation strategy, where the test data always includes data from two people from the larger group and one from the smaller one (going through all possible leave-outs) therefore using unbalanced test data. Using a leave-one-out crossvalidation strategy with all possibilities meaning sometimes using unbalanced training data. Does anyone have any experience with cases like this? Or general recommendations which option is better or why I should refrain from one (or both!) of these options? I would be very thankful for any comments or recommendations!
