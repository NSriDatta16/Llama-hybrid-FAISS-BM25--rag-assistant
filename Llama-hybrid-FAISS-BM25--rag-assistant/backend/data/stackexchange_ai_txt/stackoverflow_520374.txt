Gtk support themes, this link provide more info to compile a theme http://dt.in.th/2008-08-25.gtk-compile-windows.html . Also you will find a lots of themes for Gtk , see here for example http://art.gnome.org/themes/gtk2 . If you want a commercial solution, for MFC/C++ there's BCGSoft , Codejock , for C#/.Net Infragistics . If you plan to do something very simple any of them can be enough, but if you want to do more complex UI they may start getting too much in the way.
