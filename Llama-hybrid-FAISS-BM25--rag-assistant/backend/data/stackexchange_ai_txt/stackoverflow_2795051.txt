Error codes were designed in an age where the only way for a function to tell the caller that something went wrong was to assign a special meaning to one or more values of those which can be returned, and very frequently only a native integer or so was available for returning that special value. For instance, in C the "get character" routine returns the next character value in ASCII, but returns a negative value if for some reason something went wrong. You are then responsible for returning to YOUR caller in a way so this error situation can be handled, and that must return etc. The Exception mechanism is an elegant way to handle this "this is an emergency, we must return from code until something can deal with the problem". Error codes are inferior to this.
