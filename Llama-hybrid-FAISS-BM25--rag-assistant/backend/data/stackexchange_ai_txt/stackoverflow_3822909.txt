How can I get started with Monte Carlo simulations for financial data in Perl?

I need to create a Monte Carlo simulator for some financial transactions. The inputs would be: the average percent of transactions that end up profitable the average profit per transaction the number of transactions per time period I've looked at the Math::Random::MT::Auto Perl module but am unsure how to formulate the inputs to the simulator. Can anyone offer some advice on getting started given the inputs I'm working with?
