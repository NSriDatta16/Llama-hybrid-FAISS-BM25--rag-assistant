Presumably this is for a regression model, $p = X\beta_h +\varepsilon$, with $\varepsilon\sim N(0,\sigma^2 I)$ Without explicitly specifying the model (which should be in your question, not my answer), you have no hope of proceeding. From that, you should be able to write down the density for $\varepsilon$ and hence for $p$, and from that, the likelihood in terms of $\beta_h$. From that, you should be able to write down an expression for the posterior (up to scaling constant), complete the square in $\beta_h$ and recognize the density. This is pretty standard Bayesian manipulation.
