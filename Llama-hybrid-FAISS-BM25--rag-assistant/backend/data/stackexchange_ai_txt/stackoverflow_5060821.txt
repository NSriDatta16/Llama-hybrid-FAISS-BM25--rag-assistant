Magento - How to link the Configurable Product image to the Simple Product image?

This is the situation: I have a configurable product with several simple products. These simple products need to have the same product image as the configurable product. Currently I have to upload the same image to each simple product over and over again. Is there a way to link the product image of the configurable product to the simple products? Some of my products have 30 simple products in 1 configurable product and it is overkill/annoying to upload the same image 30 times. I hope someone can help me with this problem! Thanks in advance!
