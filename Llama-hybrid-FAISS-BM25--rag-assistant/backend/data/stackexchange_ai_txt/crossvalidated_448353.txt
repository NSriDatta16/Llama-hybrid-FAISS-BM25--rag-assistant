cv.glmnet with Time Series Data

I'm not sure if this has been asked but I can't seem to find anything regarding the question. Is it possible to use cv.glmnet for time series data? I currently have a blocked time series data frame and am using glmnet to determine the system. Wondering if I can use this correctly or need to use a different function for cross validation.
