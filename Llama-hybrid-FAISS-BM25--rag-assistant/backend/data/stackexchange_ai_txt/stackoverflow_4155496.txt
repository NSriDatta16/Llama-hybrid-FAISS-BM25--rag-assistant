Neil's answer is probably the best approach. However, if you want to go ahead replacing the input with a textarea, you can use jQuery's replaceWith() (suggested in patrick_dw's now deleted answer), but you should avoid using events like keyup . The HTML5 oninput event was designed to handle all sorts of text input, like pasting, dragging and dropping, spell checker corrections, etc. $('.info').on('input', function() { var count = $(this).val().length; if (count > 10) { $(this).replaceWith(' ', {value: this.value}); } });
