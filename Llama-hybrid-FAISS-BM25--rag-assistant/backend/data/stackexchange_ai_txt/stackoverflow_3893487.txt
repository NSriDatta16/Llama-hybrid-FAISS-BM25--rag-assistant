ControlTemplate

I am quite new to WPF and have a basic question : Assume the following is xaml declaration in my xaml file *shapes:BaseShape.DragThumbTemplate is coming from some different class. *DesignerCanvas is my own custom canvas for which I want to set value at run time. How can I access ActivitiesCanvasArea in my C# code from the code behind file? Do I need to change the way xaml is declared. I need to apply DragThumbTemplate to my grid so that I can move around grid on main screen.
