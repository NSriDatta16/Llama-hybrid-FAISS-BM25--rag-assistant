Can you share wix fragments between multiple installers?

We are looking to OEM our product complete with separate install paths, exe names, ect... But of course we want to minimize the amount of maintenance overhead we need to maintain the product. I know of course that we can re-use the fragment files, and map them to different directories with the product.wxs file. But is it a good idea to do that as we will be reusing GUIDs fro the files. Now those files will be exactly the same files, but it maybe that they are being installed in different directories. If anyone could point to some good resources for managing multiple OEM installers with WIX, I'd be very appreciative.
