To summarize this thread so far: Cold starts take a long time Google discourages pinging apps to keep them warm, but people do not know the alternative There is an issue filed to pay for a warm instance (of the Java) There is an issue filed for Python. Among other things, .py files are not precompiled. Some apps are disproportionately affected (can't find Google Groups ref or issue) March 2009 thread about Python says I see less talk about Python on this issue.
