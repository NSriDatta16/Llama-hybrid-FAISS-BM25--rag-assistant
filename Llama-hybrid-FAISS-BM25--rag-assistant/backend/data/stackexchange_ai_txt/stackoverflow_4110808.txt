The best method for doing this depends on how your application is organized. If your app is just a collection of scripts, then the best way would be to simply overload the _autoload() function in a script and then include that script at the top of each file. Example: shared.php function __autoload($classname){ //Search through class file locations } script1.php include('shared.php'); The other way of doing this is the best way. I would suggest using an MVC framework of some kind or writing your own basic MVC. This would make things a lot easier. An MVC framework allows you to have a common entry point. This is helpful at times like these because you can very easily overwrite the _autoload() function at the entry point, and it will take effect throughout your application. That way, each time a class is created, you can look through all of your predefined directories to find the correct file to include.
