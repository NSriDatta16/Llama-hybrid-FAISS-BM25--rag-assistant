Think NSValueTransformer. A value transformer is just that... it transforms the value. So you want your image resized (eg. transformed) and value transformers work through the bindings. If you look at the bindings in interface builder you'll see the "Value Transformer" section and that's where you'll hook your transformer in. Transformers have 2 main methods that do stuff, a transformedValue method and a reverseTransformedValue method. The first is used when displaying your data in the image view and the second is used in the opposite direction... when data is written to your core data model. So they're the in-and-out methods that are between core data and the interface. So for your case, you would do your resizing (as Alex explained) in the reverseTransformedValue method. See here for more details and examples of what you need to do.
