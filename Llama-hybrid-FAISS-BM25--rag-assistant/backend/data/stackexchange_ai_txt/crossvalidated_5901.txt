Edit: I made a presumption before where after 27 tries it would then stop searching thus giving a bias on the results # Number of repeats iters = 10000 results = rep(0,iters) # Ball to search for searchNumber = 27 for(i in 1:iters) { # A random permutation: balls = sample(1:27,iters, replace=T) # Number of times picking a ball tries = 1 while(tries Edit: with a mean / average of around 27 Edit: In my example we are looking for 27 but the results are the same, it could be any number between 1-27
