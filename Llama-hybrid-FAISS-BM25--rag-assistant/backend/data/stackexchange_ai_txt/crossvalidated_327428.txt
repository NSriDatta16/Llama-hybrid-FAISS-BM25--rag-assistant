I had a course on Bayesian Data Analysis in the last semester. It assumes no previous background. Here's the course homepage where the instructor has put all of the materials: https://michael-franke.github.io/BDACM_2017/ We used the Kruschke textbook for the course. It worked out fine. I don't think there's much problem with working in R. You still get to understand how things work.
