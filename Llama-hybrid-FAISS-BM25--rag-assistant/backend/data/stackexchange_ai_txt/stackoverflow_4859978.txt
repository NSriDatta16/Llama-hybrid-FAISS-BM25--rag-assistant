The name of the file in your error Fatal error: Call to a member function getArea() on a non-object in {directory}/includes/src/Mage_Core_Model_App_Area.php on line 155 indicates that Magento is operating with the compiler mode on. Installing new modules while operating in complied mode can make Weird Thingsâ„¢ happen. I'd say your behavior qualifies as a weird thing Open a shell and change directories to the root of your application. Then type $ cd shell $ php compiler.php state Running from this shell sub folder is required, as the compiler.php assumes that's the base dire when including some important files. You should see output something like Compiler Status: Enabled Compilation State: Compiled Collected Files Count: 5602 Compiled Scopes Count: 4 To disable to complier, type $ php compiler.php disable You can check to see if this script has done it's job by looking at File: includes/config.php If the two lines of code in this file are commented, Magento won't look for "compiled" code. #define('COMPILER_INCLUDE_PATH', dirname(__FILE__).DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR.'src'); #define('COMPILER_COLLECT_PATH', dirname(__FILE__).DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR.'stat'); If they aren't, then comment then out with the # mark (the enable/disable script uses and looks for a # and a # only). Do that, and your error should go away (or at least change to something different, allowing further debugging)
