C# - Ways to copy excel data into an array

I have written some code based on a specification from my boss. A requirement was to import a lot of Excel data into the program. I did this by copying the used range of the Excel sheet to the Clipboard and then used that to write to the array. This was done using Interop. This does work well, and it's code thats been in use for around 4months without any problems. However, I wrote this code, without thinking too much at the beginning of my internship. I am now re-visiting it, in a quiet moment, and it got me thinking, is there a better (more efficient, elegant) way of doing this? Looking back now, it seems like a bit of a hack. Thanks.
