Randomization Testing help

I am scratching my head over this one...any help would be greatly appreciated. I want to know if the average travel time between Guell Park and the beach in Barcelona using the bus or the metro differ and which one is faster. Since I do not know the distribution of travel time, I can't use a t-test; therefore, I was suggested to use a randomization test (so I don't make any assumptions about the data). Here are the data: Metro (in min): 34, 39, 28, 42, 32, 37, 41, 40, 47, 36, 38, 48, 31 Bus (in min): 40, 44, 49, 50, 48, 45, 47, 46, 39, 55 How would I go about proving there is or is not a different between the forms of transportation (randomization tests)?
