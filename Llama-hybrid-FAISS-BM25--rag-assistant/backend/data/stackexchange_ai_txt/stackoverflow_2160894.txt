data files in an application

We have data files which are encrypted in our wpf app. We would like to save in a location where the user will not be aware just to avoid any modifications/tampering in any way. The datafiles are of sizes nearly 100MB and some of them are zipfiles. One thought is storing them in IsolatedFileStorage but it looks like it only allows to save strings in txt and due to the size being too large there seems to be issues saving them. Another thought is save them in the same folder where the program runs from but set the hidden attributes so they are not visible. Just wondering if you have any suggestions. Thanks N
