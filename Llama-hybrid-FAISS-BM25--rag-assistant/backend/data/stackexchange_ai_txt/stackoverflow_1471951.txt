The garbage collection in .NET is not a counting scheme (such as COM), but a mark-and-sweep implementation. Basically, the GC runs at "random" times when it feels the need to do so, and the collection of the objects is therefore not deterministic. You can, however, manually trigger a collection (GC.Collect()), but you may have to wait for finalizers to run then (GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers()). Doing this in a production app, however, is discouraged, because it may affect the efficiency of the memory management (GC runs too often, or waits for finalizers to run). If the object still exists, it actually still has some live reference somewhere.
