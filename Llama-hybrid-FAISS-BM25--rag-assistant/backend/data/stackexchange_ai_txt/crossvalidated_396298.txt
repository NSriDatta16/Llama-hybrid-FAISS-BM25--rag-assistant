Is it possible for regression model to predict patterns separately from data has multiple patterns?

I want to predict sold number of each drink(hot and cold) without clustering. I have data which contains sold number of hot and cold drinks. I trained it with linear model in scikit, and I thought I can predict the sold number which is different shape based on it's hot or cold. But I got one very horizontal(average?) line. The prediction result are all the same no matter I predict hot or cold drinks. Experiments: Expected result: I can predict pattern of each hot or cold drink. Train X: hot or cold, drink ID, date, week, day(ex:0 for Mon., 6 for Sun.), month. Train y: sold numbers of 6 drinks in a month has 28 days. Fig. of train data: x -> days ex:1,2...28, y -> sold numbers Fig. when I trained with sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression: model = linear_model.LinearRegression().fit(train_X, train_y) Fig. when I trained with sklearn.linear_model.ElasticNet: model = linear_model.ElasticNet(max_iter=100).fit(train_X, train_y) I tried linear_model but it seems only to predict a "average" results. So linear model only can predict one pattern(trend) of data even if I combine all patterns in a dataset? So maybe all regression models can only predict one pattern(trend) of data? or other regression model can reach that ?
