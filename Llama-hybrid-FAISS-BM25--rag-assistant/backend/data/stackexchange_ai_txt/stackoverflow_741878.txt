Objective C makes integer from pointer without a cast passing objects as args

I'm trying to make blackjack in objective C, and am having trouble passing objects around. My Hand class basically takes a deck and draws cards from it, adding them to an array. Here's the Hand methods involved: - (id)init : (Deck*) deck { [self draw: deck]; [self draw: deck]; return self; } - (void)draw: (Deck*)deck; { Card* C= [deck drawFromDeck]; [cards addObject: C]; } Here's the problematic part of main: Deck* deck=[[Deck alloc] init]; Hand* hand=[[Hand alloc] init: deck ]; The second line of that gets the "integer from pointer without a cast" error. Whenever I run the code, the hand never has cards in it because there's no deck to draw from (I think :) ). Do I need to pass or parse the Deck* differently? (if you need me to post any more code, just ask) Thanks guys!! :D Edit with regards to bounty : Although I do believe the answer I accepted is well explained and , this question has gotten an average of over 17 views a day for the past year and a half. This means that this question is probably the first experience many people have with stackoverflow , and improving it will not only show us in a better light, it will probably save a lot of people's time. While it has good answers now, I want to make sure that it is as perfect as possible, especially because we don't really know how many of those people were able to follow it and solve their problem. Go ahead and submit edits to the existing answers or add your own. (Mods, do you think this would be a good candidate for community wiki?)
