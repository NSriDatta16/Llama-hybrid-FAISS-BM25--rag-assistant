An approach along the lines of what you are doing will work only for simple documents (ie those not containing images, hyperlinks, comments etc). To handle these more complex documents, take a look at http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ericwhite/archive/2009/02/05/move-insert-delete-paragraphs-in-word-processing-documents-using-the-open-xml-sdk.aspx and the resulting DocumentBuilder API (part of the PowerTools for Open XML project on CodePlex). In order to split a docx into sections using DocumentBuilder, you'll still need to first find the index of the paragraphs containing sectPr elements.
