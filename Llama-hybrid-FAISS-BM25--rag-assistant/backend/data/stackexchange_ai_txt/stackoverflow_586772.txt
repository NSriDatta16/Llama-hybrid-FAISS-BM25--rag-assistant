I would have to see the code, but it sounds like you are getting a rebind prior to pulling the chosen items. One way to examine this is to add a watcha nd then make sure you code in the various ASP.NET events and then watch. Without seeing what you are doing in code, I cannot tell if this is a drag and drop anomoly or something you have coded in. But the symptoms you are describing fits the typcial bind in Page_Load scenario, which is what jmein was aiming at.
