If your Dog extends Animal, you can create a constructor that takes an Animal and initializes the super(parent) constructor: public class Dog extends Animal { public Dog(Animal animal) { super(animal); } } Assuming you have an Animal class that has a copy constructor in this form: public class Animal { public Animal(Animal animal) { // copies all properties from animal to this } } You can create a Dog from an Animal by doing something like this: Dog newDog = new Dog(myExistingAnimal);
