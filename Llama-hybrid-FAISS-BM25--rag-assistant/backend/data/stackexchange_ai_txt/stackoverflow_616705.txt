Bear in mind that if you do that you're forcing people to login again if they upgrade their browser. This can be OK but just make sure it's your intent. Using the user's remote address is not without problems either. Many people use the same computer from different locations. Mobile devices, laptops being used at home and work, laptops being used at Wifi hotspots and so on. IMHO it's a bad idea to use IP address in such a way that a new IP address requires a login unless you're dealing with highly sensitive information such as online banking. Is that the case? What are you concerned about? External attack? Or in a shared host situation that someone can read your session information? If it's the latter, the solution is simple: just don't store anything sensitive in the session. Anything sensitive should be stored in the database. In terms of creating a secret salt, you need to use something that isn't guessable. I would go for something like a random string that's created when the user is created. If necessary recreate it each time the session is invalidated. As for what it would make it more secure, you said it yourself: there are limited user agent strings (less than a hundred will probably cover 99.99% of users). A salt simply increases the number of possibilities. That being said, if you use the same salt for all sessions then it's only a matter of time before it's found with brute force.
