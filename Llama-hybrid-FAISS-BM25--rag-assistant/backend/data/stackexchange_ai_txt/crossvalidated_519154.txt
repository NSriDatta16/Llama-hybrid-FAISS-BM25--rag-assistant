Well, I think you're misunderstanding a couple things here: Lag and ACF plots don't show if a time series is "random" but instead show significant autocorrelations. Random walks are autocorrelated by definition, since in a random walk, x_t+1 = x_t + e where e ~ N(0, sig) . This means that my best guess for the next value in the series is the current value in the series, up to some random noise. I'm still not sure if I understand what you mean by "the data are random" here
