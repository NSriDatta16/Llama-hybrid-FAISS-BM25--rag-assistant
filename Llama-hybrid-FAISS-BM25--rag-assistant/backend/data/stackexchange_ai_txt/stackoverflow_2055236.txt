Are you making the same page for both devices? Usual practice is to make two separate pages that are optimised for both devices which by their nature have different form actors and characteristics. so code along the lines of $browser = strpos($_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'],"iPhone"); if ($browser == true) { header('Location: http://www.yoursite.com/iphone/'); } //else{echo 'just carry on';} In terms of setting up the iPhone there are quite a few iPhone frameworks see here for list around which will speed the development and if you are developing on a Mac with Snow Leopard and the latest SDK then there is now a built-in project in dashcode to produce one.
