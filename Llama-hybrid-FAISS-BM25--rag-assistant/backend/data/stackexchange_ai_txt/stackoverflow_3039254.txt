WPF: Aligning the base line of a Label and its TextBox

Let's say I have a simple TextBox next to a Label: MyLabel MyText ... This yields the following result: As you can see, the base lines of MyLabel and MyText are not aligned, which looks ugly. Of course, I could start playing around with the margins until they match up, but since this is such a common requirement I'm sure that WPF provides a much easier and more elegant solution, which I just haven't found yet...
