Don't bother with GQL for key-based retrieval -- make a key object from the string: k = db.Key('aght52oobW1hZHIOCxIHTWVzc2FnZRiyAQw') and just db.get(k) . If you insist on GQL, btw, that k -- a suitably constructed instance of db.Key , NOT a string object!-) -- is also what you need to substitute into the GQL query (by :1 or whatrever).
