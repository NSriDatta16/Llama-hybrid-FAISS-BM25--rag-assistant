When you are scrolling your scroll view, a method of UIScrollViewDelegate will be called repeatedly during scrolling. - (void)scrollViewDidScroll:(UIScrollView *)scrollView; You can get the current context offset by scrollView's property. - scrollViewWillBeginDragging and -scrollViewDidEndDecelerating won't be called, if you scroll the view by commands, which are in the UIScrollView class.
