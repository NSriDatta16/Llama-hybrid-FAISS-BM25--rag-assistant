Android/Linux File Permissions Problem

I have created a directory in my app's internal storage (/data/data/com.my_app) and gave global read/write permissions to the directory via the method context.getDir(DATA_DIR_NAME, Context.MODE_WORLD_READABLE | Context.MODE_WORLD_WRITEABLE); Through my app, I verified that the linux file permissions are correct: drw-rw-rw- app_71 app_71 2010-11-16 18:38 app_data And I was able to read/write files in-to/out-of the directory app_data just fine. However, one of my developers suddenly wasn't able to write to the directory anymore. Our application has trouble accessing the directory on his device as well. The strange thing is that the file permission for the directory is still the same. We can't do any sort of writes to the directory, and we can't read any files within the directory anymore either (the files were given global rw permission previously). The only thing we can do is adb shell ls /data/data/my_app/app_data to see our list of files. Doing adb shell ls -l /data/data/my_app/app_data strangely doesn't return anything. And we can't CD into the directory either. Does anyone have any pointer on what the problem is or how to solve this? We are at our wit's end. Much appreciated.
