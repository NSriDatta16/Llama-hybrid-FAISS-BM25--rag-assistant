Modifying GWT's user.agent when releasing

When developing, I set the user.agent property to a single value, to keep compile times down. When releasing, I have a WAR file built for all user agents. I unfortunately seem to keep forgetting to switch the property, either: wasting development time waiting for compiles, or preparing a WAR file with incomplete browser support ( not yet deployed , thankfully ). I want to automate this, preferably using the maven-release-plugin.
