How do you get your sublist from the big array? A simple, already efficient improvement would be to iterate through the array only once, selecting the elements and adding their to an iteratively calculated average. Something like : int sum = 0; int count = 0; for(MyObject object : myBigArray){ if (mustBelongToSublist(object){ count++; sum += object.value(); } } int average = (double)sum/count;
