Test for trend and seasonality in time series

This is my data: x My purpose here is to check whether x has trend or seasonality. What I have done for now is: stlm After I obtain and view the graph, I want to measure whether trend and seasonality are statistically significantly or not. I would like to get something like a $p$-value in regression analysis. How can I do that?
