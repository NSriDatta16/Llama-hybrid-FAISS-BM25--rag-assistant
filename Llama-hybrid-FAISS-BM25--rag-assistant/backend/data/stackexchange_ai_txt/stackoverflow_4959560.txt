There are two main classes of XML databases: those that do "only XML", of which the best known are probably eXist as an open source solution, and MarkLogic as a commercial product; and those that do XML alongside relational data, which is possible with DB2, SQL server, and Oracle. All offer XQuery (sometimes with extensions or restrictions) as the main query language. If your data is naturally hierarchic and already represented in XML, then you should certainly consider these products rather than converting your data into the tabular form required for storage in a relational database - which is basically wasted effort.
