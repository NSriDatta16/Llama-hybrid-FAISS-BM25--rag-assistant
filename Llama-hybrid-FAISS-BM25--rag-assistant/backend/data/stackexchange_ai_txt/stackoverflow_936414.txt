There's a section in the article What Is UVW Mapping? that explains: You might question why you need a depth coordinate like W for a 2D plane. One reason is because it's sometimes useful to be able to flip the orientation of a map, relative to its geometry. To do this, you need the third coordinate. The W coordinate also has a meaning for 3-dimensional procedural materials. In your case, you can simply ignore the W coordinate and only read the first two floats of lines that begin with vt . This assumes that you're not very worried about the extra space taken by the W coordinate since .obj is quite an inefficient file format to begin with. Personally I don't like using .obj in OpenGL because it provides vertex normals per face instead of per vertex. To light an object properly you must either duplicate vertices or calculate normals by averaging the surrounding vertex normals in a face. If you want to explore more efficient alternatives, take a look at binary formats, such as the thoroughly documented .md2 format. Also consider using glDrawElements if you're not utilizing it already.
