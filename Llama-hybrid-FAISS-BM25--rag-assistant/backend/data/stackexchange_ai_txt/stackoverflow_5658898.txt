set php session on only www.website.tld and www.apps.website.tld

I only want the session cookie on www.website.tld and www.apps.website.tld, using ini_set if possible. Also i need to set all cookies i write to both subdomains only. I do not want www.imgs.website.tld to have the cookies. the php session one i'm kinda unsure of. The cookies i set my self my idea was to call SetBothCookie($name,$value,$time) a custom function. function SetBothCookie($name,$value,$time) { setcookie($name, $value, $time, "", "www.website.tld", 1); setcookie($name, $value, $time, "", "www.apps.website.tld", 1); } So i think i have the SetBothCookie part down, but wanted to see what others think of that code. The part i'm stuck on is having php set the session cookie on both sub domains. I'm using session_set_save_handler to override the default php session storage to store sessions in the database, so both servers can use the same session data. From my understanding is if i put Javascript that does http requests on the www.apps.website.tld to www.website.tld it won't allow them to happen, and i want that added security, so thats my reason of running only a part of the site on a subdomain.
