If the jar is an executable JAR (which it seems to be from your example), you should be able to just double-click the JAR file . If this does not work, you shoud associate the java executable as the program with which to open a file with the .jar extension. See Tools > Folder Options > File Types from an explorer window. In order that a program be "distributable", it would normally be packaged (i.e. the JAR file and startup scripts) in some ZIP archive and then extracted to a folder on a user's PC. Your startup script should provide a relative path to the JAR file. For example if you have organized the contents of your ZIP into lib and bin folders: MyProject +--- lib (contains jars) +--- bin (contains .bat script) In this case, the startup.bat file should reference the Jar as: %JAVA_HOME\bin\java -jar ..\lib\myapp.jar This requires that any users: Have a JRE installed on their system (unless you package that up as well) Have java on their path or a JAVA_HOME environment variable set
