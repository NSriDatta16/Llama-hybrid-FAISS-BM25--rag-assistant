The best method in my opinion to practice the skills you have is getting some data (this is the last of your problem, you can find dataset on the internet or you can create your own dataset) and try to figure out if there are relations or difference in some groups of the data (assuming you want to practice with inferential statistics). For example: I'm learning regression or machine learning techniques: can i predict the outcome of an event currently evolving? (the oscars? the end of a tournament?) For inferential statistics, can i analyze some data and find difference between some groups? Associations between variables? Ans so on. The possibilities are endless
