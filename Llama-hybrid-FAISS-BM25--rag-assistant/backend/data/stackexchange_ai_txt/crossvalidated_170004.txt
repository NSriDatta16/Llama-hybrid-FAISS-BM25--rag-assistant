How to graph continuous independent variable and logit of dichotomous outcome in SPSS

First question: I am using SPSS, and I want to graph the logit of my dependent variable on the y axis and my continuous independent variable on the x-axis. I am interested in visualizing the relationship to see if it is linear and meets the assumption for binary logistic regression. Second question: Based on a Box-Tidwell test, the variable meets the linearity assumption. If anyone knows an alternative to Box-Tidwell that the majority of statisticians agree is the current standard, please let me know. If Box-Tidwell will suffice, that would be good to know as well. References are beneficial. Thank you.
