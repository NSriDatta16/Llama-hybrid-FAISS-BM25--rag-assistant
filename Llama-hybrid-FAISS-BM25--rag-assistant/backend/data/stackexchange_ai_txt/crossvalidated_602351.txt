In general, index construction is very complex and should strongly depend on the subject matter background. Institutions like the United Nations have a long history of revising, readjusting, and redefining indexes (such as human development index) over years. I wouldn't generally say that it's not correct to run PCA on 18 variables as suggested; this is not too bad as an initial idea. Some possible issues with it are: Dependence over time works in a different way from dependence between the 6 ratios (as you correctly state), so it may be more appropriate to somehow aggregate the three time points first and then run PCA on the six ratios only, with aggregated times. To what extent this makes sense depends on how the time series actually look like, and also subtleties of the intended interpretation, i.e., what exactly the index is supposed to measure (I know you wrote "profitability" but there may be several intuitive ways to aggregate your numbers and subject matter expertise would be required to say whether implications of whatever approach taken are appropriate here or not; a statistician may understand the implications but not necessarily know whether these are desirable or not in the field). It may be a consideration to logarithmise the ratios, as logs of ratios are actually differences and may behave friendlier with linear approaches such as PCA. Whether and to what extent this applies here requires knowledge of the data and the field, once more. You may want to think about weighting and standardisation; do all the six ratios have the same importance? Are the value ranges and distributions so that if you simply aggregate them, they will be balanced appropriately (if not, what kind of standardisation would be appropriate)? Do you want every company regardless of size have the same impact on your computations? What about outliers and the like? (You should certainly do some outlier diagnostics, because even though PCA is a good tool in principle, it can be strongly affected by outliers.)
