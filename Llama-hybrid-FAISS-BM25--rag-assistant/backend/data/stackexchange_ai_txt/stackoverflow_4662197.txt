How can I use a twitter stream of direct messages as input?

I'm writing a web application in PHP and MySQL. I want users to be able to interact with the site via twitter. If you are familiar with how RememberTheMilk incorporates twitter as a means of creating tasks and other activities, then you have some idea of what I want to accomplish. The interactions would be brief. For example: User_Jay sends a direct message to my twitter account; My application checks the direct message stream every so often, when it sees User_Jay's message, the application recognizes a key phrase and executes a bit of code; when code has been executed, the application sends a direct message to User_Jay. The end. I don't know which twitter library would be best suited to this endeavor. Neither am I sure how to get code executed for a particular user based on their direct message. _ For reference, users will create accounts on the actual site, and there they will be able to declare their twitter username. Also, example code or links to example code accomplishing this sort of thing would be greatly appreciated.
