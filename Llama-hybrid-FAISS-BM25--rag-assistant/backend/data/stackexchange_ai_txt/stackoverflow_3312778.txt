I don't really know how exactly Google does SPAM filtering (but I think it's a business secret after all). If you are interested in how SPAM filtering works, I would recommend looking at Bayesian SPAM filtering ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_spam_filtering ). It's a rather easy to understand method.
