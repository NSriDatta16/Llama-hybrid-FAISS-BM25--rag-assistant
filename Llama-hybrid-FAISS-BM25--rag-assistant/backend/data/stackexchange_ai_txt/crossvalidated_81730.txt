In order to predict any outcome (bus stop in your case), you need some information other than the outcome you want to predict. These variables are often called predictors / covariates / independent variables . So the answer to your question depends on what information you have. 1 . If, the bus GPS signal and door open signal are the only ones you have, your predictor can include historical data on the route bus stop data in the morning (from home to work) to predict after work stop data on the previous stops (if real time) In this case, you can probably find a correlation between pick-up stops and drop-off stops i.e the people from the same pick-up sites are likely to get off at the same drop-off stops. So if a particular pick-up site was not stopped, then the corresponding drop-off site may be avoided. You can use logistic regression for this purpose. You probably cannot model the pick-up stops in this case. If real-time, you can also use the previous stop information on the same route. The method for real time modelling is Markov Chain Monte Carlo but you can use regression if that is beyond your knowledge. 2 .If you have other information such as day of the week time of the day # of people on the drop-off bus they can also be used in a regression as predictors. In short, you need Markov Chain Monte Carlo if you know enough statistics and logistic regression otherwise. Your predictors will be anything you think is relevant.
