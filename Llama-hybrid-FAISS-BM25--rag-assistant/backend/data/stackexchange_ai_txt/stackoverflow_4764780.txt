How can I disable a jquery include for low bandwidth connections

I have a simple website which makes a little use of jquery but it is not essential so I would like to skip the jquery download if the users connection is slow. Ideally I would detect a slow connection but I suppose detecting a mobile phone might be a reasonable proxy for this. If this is possible I would then remove the parts of the page which use jquery and add them dynamically if jquery is loaded. Options I have considered are: Test the connection speed by downloading a small image Download jquery but timeout after a second or so (I searched for cancelling downloads but found nothing) Drop jquery all together and just write the javascript I need (I'll probably get it wrong for some browsers though) Wrap the jquery download in some javascript which checks the useragent for andriod or iphone Try to use css media selectors to control the jquery download but I am not sure which to persue. Also, I can't use server side tricks as it is a static page (to avoid the appengine cold start issue).
