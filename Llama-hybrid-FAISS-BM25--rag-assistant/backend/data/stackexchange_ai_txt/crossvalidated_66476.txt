Sweet irony. Before that paragraph, the same person says "No wonder there is such widespread confusion". "Confidence intervals in an observational setting": what does that even mean? It appears to me that this is once again a confusion between estimation and hypothesis testing . Now I know the CI width should approach 1 with increasing sample size. No, it depends on the context. In principle, the width should converge to $0$. The coverage should be close to the nominal value for a large number of Monte Carlo simulations. The coverage does not depend on the sample size, unless some of the assumptions under which the CI was constructed are flawed (which maybe is what the OP meant to imply. "All the models are wrong", yeah.). The reference is a comment in a post of a personal blog . I would not worry too much about the validity of this sort of reference. The blog, owned by Larry Wasserman, tends to be very well written on the other hand. This reminded me of the xkcd comic: http://xkcd.com/386/
