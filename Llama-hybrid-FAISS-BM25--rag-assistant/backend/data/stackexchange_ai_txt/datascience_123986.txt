Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)+logistic regression model lda_model LDA scores for the training data using the predict function lda_scores_train Train logistic regression model logistic_model Predict probabilities for the test data lda_scores_test predicted_probabilities Convert probabilities to binary predictions predicted_labels 0.5, 1, 0) predicted_probabilities It is giving me the error. So I am unable to calculate the confusion matrix. I am trying to evaluate LDA+Logistic regression model
