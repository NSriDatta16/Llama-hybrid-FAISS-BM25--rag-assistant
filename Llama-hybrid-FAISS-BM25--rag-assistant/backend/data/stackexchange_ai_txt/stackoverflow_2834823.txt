SQL Server Building Software

What are the option in terms of applications that help build SQL statements against a SQL Server database? We have some users that need to build SQL statements, preferably through drag and dropping or linking up tables etc.., against a SQL Server databse who don't have any experience in this area. Any Ideas?
