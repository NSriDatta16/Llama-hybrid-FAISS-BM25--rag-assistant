The Cohen's d's you get are for Consistency1 vs. Consistency2 and Consistency1 vs Consistency3. You get the final d (C2 vs. C3) by changing your reference group: e.g. m2 (There may be a more elegant way that I don't know about, but this at least gives you the final d relatively easily) However, please note that computing effect sizes from multilevel (mixed) models is controversial; see for instance this thread and this thread and this discussion . It may be better to just report the estimated marginal means or contrast estimates along with CIs and/or p-values.
