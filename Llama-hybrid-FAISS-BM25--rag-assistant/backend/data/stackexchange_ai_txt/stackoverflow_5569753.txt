Azure Monitoring and Using Service Management APIs

I am trying to build a programmatic management console for Azure to give stats and analytics for Hosted Service, Storage Service giving info about Health, load, threads for Hosted service and Number of hits etc. for table and blobs. Questions Is Service Management API the solution for it? Any other alternative available other than Service Management API...? What are the details I can get out of the API? Is there any security requirement acting like an hurdle ?
