Estimation of Bayesian Models

I'm trying to get into Bayesian model estimation (I'm interested in posterior parameter distributions). I could get away with Metropolis-Hastings and Gibbs Sampling for models with few parameters ( 100), the algorithms never converge. I'm stuck with the "curse of dimensionality". I was wondering if any of you could recommend some references to face high dimensional models.
