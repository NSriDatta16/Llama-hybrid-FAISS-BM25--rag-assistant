Filesystem links on a FAT32 formatted storage

I know FAT32, as well as FAT16/12 neither support symbolic links nor hard-links . However I came up with this idea: The FAT specification describes that every file is associated with a directory-entry. In my understanding, one could say that a file-entry in a directory somehow or other points to the file's content. So, how can I define two directory-entries which point to the same file-content? Or, what could prevent me from doing so? Use case: I have a USB mass storage device for my car radio, and I want to use directories as playlists since the radio software doesn't support playlists. So it isn't important to me how Windows behaves when doing this.
