Edit and Continue on GDB

I know that E&C is a controversial subject and some say that it encourages a wrong approach to debugging, but still - I think we can agree that there are numerous cases when it is clearly useful - experimenting with different values of some constants, redesigning GUI parameters on-the-fly to find a good look... You name it. My question is: Are we ever going to have E&C on GDB? I understand that it is a platform-specific feature and needs some serious cooperation with the compiler, the debugger and the OS (MSVC has this one easy as the compiler and debugger always come in one package) , but... It still should be doable. I've even heard something about Apple having it implemented in their version of GCC [citation needed] . And I'd say it is indeed feasible. Knowing all the hype about MSVC's E&C (my experience says it's the first thing MSVC users mention when asked "why not switch to Eclipse and gcc/gdb" ), I'm seriously surprised that after quite some years GCC/GDB still doesn't have such feature. Are there any good reasons for that? Is someone working on it as we speak?
