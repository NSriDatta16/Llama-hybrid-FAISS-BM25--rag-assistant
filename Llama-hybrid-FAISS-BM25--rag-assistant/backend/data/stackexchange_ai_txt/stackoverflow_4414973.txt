CSS negative text-indent in lists -- bullet problems with Opera

I'm having problems getting a list formatted the way I want in Opera. I want any text which would wrap around to be indented a bit past the first line, and I have this working in Firefox/Chrome/Safari with the following code: Long first item Second list item So the whole paragraph is shifted to the right by 2em, and the first line is shifted back to the left by the same amount, producing the effect I want: every line except the first indented. However, in Opera this causes the first list bullet to be indented to the left. (The text is displayed as I wish, only the bullet seems incorrect!) Is there another way to get what I want? (And is it a bug in Opera? It seems to me that the styling of an element inside the li element shouldn't effect bullet placement, but I don't have very deep knowledge of these things...) It looked at "list-style-position", but it isn't helpful because I want the second line of text to be indented past the first line. Thanks for any help!
