Should a predictor, significant on its own but not with other predictors, be included in an overall multinomial logistic regression?

I constructed a model via multinominal logistic regression analysis. The final model contains three predictors. All predictors are significant when they are the only predictors. However, the coefficient of one of the predictors is not significant when included all three predictors are included in the model. Should I include this predictor in the final multinomial logistic regression equation?
