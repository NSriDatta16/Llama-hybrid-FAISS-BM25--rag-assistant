C# Remoting classes organization

I'm developing a Remoting classes library so that I can keep database interaction and business object on the server and not on clients. I'd like to be able to return my own objects to the clients so that they can interact with them through the server itself. For example (semi-pseudocode): Server class Database { ... } class Utility { public User getUser(username) { return new User(username); } } class User { public string[] getPerms() { return Database.query("select * from permission where user = " + this.username); } } Client Utility utility = (Utility)getRemotingClass("Utility"); User user = Utility.getUser("admin"); string[] perms = user.getPerms(); How can I organize my classes/namespaces? I'm particularly wondering about class references and scalability of my system. Any kind of criticism/suggestion is really appreciated.
