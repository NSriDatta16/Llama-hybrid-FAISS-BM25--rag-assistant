Using the member function in Scheme

This is my code: (define p (read(open-input-file "starbucks4.sxml"))) (define get-artifacts (lambda (l) (member (list 'opm:artifact) l))) (get-artifacts p) I was told that the member function searches completely throughout a list. In the .sxml document there is a complicated list that has many elements called "opm:artifact" however this method returns #f and no list. Can anyone see what I am doing wrong? Sample of .sxml file: (opm:account ((ref "detailedAccount"))) "\n " (opm:label ((value "Provide other Beverage"))) "\n ") "\n ") "\n " (opm:artifacts () "\n " (opm:artifact ((id "a1")) "\n " (opm:account ((ref "detailedAccount"))) "\n " (opm:label ((value "order"))) "\n ") "\n " (opm:artifact ((id "a2")) "\n " (opm:account ((ref "detailedAccount"))) "\n " (opm:label ((value "cash"))) "\n ") "\n " I'm trying to look for all the opm:artifacts and the associated data (it's sublists).
