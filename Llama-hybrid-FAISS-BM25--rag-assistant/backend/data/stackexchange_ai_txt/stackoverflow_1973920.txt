I'm not an expert, but you can start with the following tips: Try to follow the CakePHP database naming conventions . You don't have to, but it's so much easier to let the automagic happen... Change the primary keys in your tabel to 'id', e.g. users.user_is --> users.id, copies.copy_id -->copies.id. Define a view, just for the sake of debugging. Pass whatever info from model to view with $this->set('users', $users); and display that in a block If this is your first php and/or CakePHP attempt, make sure you do at least the blog tutorial Make CakePHP generate (bake) a working set of model/view/controllers for users and copies and examine the resulting code There's good documentation about find: the multifunctional workhorseof all model data-retrieval functions
