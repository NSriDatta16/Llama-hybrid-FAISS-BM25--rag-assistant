Classic tests for changes in distributions of nominal data (each individual in exactly 1 category, comparing 2 sets of data from different conditions) would be a Chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test . Your data, however, are more like ordinal data , where there is a natural ordering among the 3 categories "decrease," "no change," "increase" (excluding for now the "don't know" category). The link above to ordinal data suggests some ways to examine such data. Your study, however, is just not adequately powered to detect a difference from the situation before the ban came into force. Of the 31 cases in your sample, you evidently found 28 in the "increase" category to get the 91% value. Note that 87% of 31 cases would have been 27 in the "increase" category, only 1 different from the 28 that you found. With errors in count values typically on the order of the square root of the number of counts, you simply don't have enough cases to detect a difference. You need a much larger sample, with careful attention paid to matching the characteristics of your sample to that of the pre-ban study, to accomplish your goal. You should try to find a competent local statistician, and get advice on study design first.
