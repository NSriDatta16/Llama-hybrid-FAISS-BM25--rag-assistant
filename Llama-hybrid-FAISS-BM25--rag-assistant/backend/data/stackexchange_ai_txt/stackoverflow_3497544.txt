HSlider event listener not triggered when value is updated Flex 3.5

I am writing a web application that will serve as a configuration for a random data generator that I have written in Java. The values that I set in this application will write to xml. The xml data is updated by a file called simulationParams.as and that file is added to each child in the "viewStack" so that when I change any of those values the simulationConfig file will be automatically updated. The problem is that when I press the randomizeBtn the proper events are fired and the listeners grab those events. My problem exists when I uncheck the randomize button. For some reason an event is triggered or the listener isnt listening so that when I uncheck randomizeBtn the values go back to their last position or value on the slider. Ex. if my initial value is 0 then press randomize the slider will go to 100. The config file updates and all is well. When I uncheck the randomizeBtn, the sliders value goes back 0 but the config file isnt update. The same thing happens when I press the useDefaultBtn for both selected/unselected, nothing gets updated. [Edited] I have included a test application to help show my problem: snipplr.com/view/39260/testmxml (run this) snipplr.com/view/39259/simulationconfigparamsas snipplr.com/view/39257/organizationpanelmxml snipplr.com/view/39258/organizationtypesetting The functions in question are: randomizeBtn_clickHandler(event:MouseEvent):void useDefaultBtn_clickHandler(event:MouseEvent):void updateLastSliderPosition(currentChild:OrganizatyionTypeSettings):void useSliderPosition(currentChild:OrganizatyionTypeSettings):void creationCompleteHandler(event:FlexEvent):void initSetting(setting:OrganizatyionTypeSettings):void setMinuteCreationDelay(event:SliderEvent):void setDelayVariance(event:SliderEvent)
