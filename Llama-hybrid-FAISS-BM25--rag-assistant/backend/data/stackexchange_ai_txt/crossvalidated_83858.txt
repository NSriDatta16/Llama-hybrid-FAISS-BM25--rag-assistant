It all depends on your goal. Do you want to forecast sales based on defects or Do you want to capture the relationship between sales and defects If you want both There are two options . You can run a simple linear regression A = (Beta0)+ (alpha)*B , without bothering about the time series properties of the series. The better option is to use VAR (Vector Autoregression models) followed by Granger causality to understand which series is affecting which and if the effect is instantaneous or the lagged values also come into play. If your only aim is forecasting , you can also look into neural networks for time series, neural networks dont give you the relationship between the series, but sometime outperform the statistical models in terms of forecasting.
