Problem with mixture discriminant analysis in R returning NA for predictions

I'm trying to do a mixture discriminant analysis for a mid-sized data.frame, and bumped into a problem: all my predictions are NA. After tracing through way too much code, I figured it had something to do with the fact that some of the coefficients in the mda turn out to be NA. I've created a smaller data.frame that still has the problem: dfr When I use this data.frame like so (after loading the package mda): mda(Coverage~.,data=dfr,subclasses=2)$fit$coef I get this result: [,1] [,2] Intercept -0.90574883 -0.42382446 min_GCs_last_3_baseszero 1.80667985 0.85786905 min_GCs_last_3_basesone -0.02302343 0.04884007 cq NA NA What troubles me about this, is: Why are there coefficients for both the values of the factor min_GCs_last_3_bases? Why are the coefficients of cq NA? I'm willing to assume I have completely misunderstood mda. Can someone please enlighten me? Or did I just bump into a bug? (note: I've tried if the names of the columns had an influence: they don't)
