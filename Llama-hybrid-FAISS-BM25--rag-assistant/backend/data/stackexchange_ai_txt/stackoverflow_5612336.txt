TOGAF 9: difference between enterprise continuum and architecture repository

I am trying to understand the core concepts of TOGAF 9. No matter how often I read the explanation in the TOGAF manual, I don't understand the differences and the relationship between the Enterprise Continuum and the Architecture Repository. Some quotes from the documentation: Enterprise Continuum "The simplest way of thinking of the Enterprise Continuum is as a view of the repository of all the architecture assets. It can contain architecture descriptions, models, building blocks, patterns, viewpoints, and other artifacts" "The Enterprise Continuum provides a valuable context for understanding architectural models: it shows building blocks and their relationships to each other, and the constraints and requirements on a cycle of architecture development." (pages 565 and 48) Architecture Repository "This section of TOGAF provides a structural framework for an Architecture Repository that allows an enterprise to distinguish between different types of architectural assets that exist at different levels of abstraction in the organization." (page 593) Assumptions The samples/template-package of TOGAF contains a word document "TOGAF 9 Template - Architecture Repository.doc" , so 1) I think of the architecture repository as a large document, containing all outputs of all projects related to the architecture. 2) The enterprise continuum is another document classifying the contents of the architecture repository from foundation architecture to organization architecture and providing information about the relationship between these objects. What is the difference/relationship between the enterprise continuum and the architecture repository?
