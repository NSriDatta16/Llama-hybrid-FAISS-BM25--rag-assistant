The shift operator cannot be used with a tensor as lag. You should look for some other construction from theano or pymc3.math that does this for you. That's also what the error message is telling you, you are using a naive function (people often try to use max instead of theano.max ) but that doesn't work. As a simple way, you could instead use a for loop and sum the likelihood over all positions in the time series. This should make it easy to account for some interpolation problems you now solved with the shift function, using cval . Or perhaps some simple tensor slicing can be used.
