On the outermost element of your widget, set a relatively unique class name. For example: Put the Javascript and CSS in their own files. For the CSS, structure all of your selectors like this: .my_spiffy_widget P { /* paragraph rules */ } .my_spiffy_widget A { /* anchor rules */ } .my_spiffy_widget UL { /* unordered list rules */ } That ensures your rules do not accidentally get overridden by other CSS rules. Likewise with the JavaScript, prefix your functions with a common, distinctive prefix: function my_spiffy_widget_doSomething() {...} Avoid global variables if possible, but if you cannot, prefix them as well: var my_spiffy_widget_firstTime = true;
