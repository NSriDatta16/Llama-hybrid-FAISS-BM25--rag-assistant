Start at the bottom and assign a probability of 1 to the goal and 0 to other slots. Then for the next row up, assign probabilities as follows: 1) if there is no peg, use the probability directly below. 2) for a peg, use the average of the probabilities in the adjacent columns one row down. This will simply propagate the probabilities to the top where each slot will be assigned the probability of reaching the goal from that slot . No tree, no recursion.
