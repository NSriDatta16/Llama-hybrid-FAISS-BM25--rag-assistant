Can I use PHP4 to interact with an SVN repository without a working copy?

I would like to perform SVN operations on an SVN repository (over HTTP, if it matters) without requiring a working copy. Basically, here are the things I want to do: Check if a directory exists remotely. If the directory does not exist, create it Check if a file exists in the repository if the file does not exist, create a new file in the repository with my content This has to use an author name that I provide, not the authenticated WebDAV author (which is why the WebDAV approach doesn't work for me) If the file does exist, replace its contents with the contents of my specified file. I have been trying to use the autoversioning approach, but that method requires me to set up authentication for the WebDAV server, which is less than ideal in my circumstance. I could use FS operations (the client is SVN 1.6, so shallow working copies + command line would work) but that's both slow and inelegant. Is there a library (which MUST be useable from PHP 4.4!) that can do what I describe?
