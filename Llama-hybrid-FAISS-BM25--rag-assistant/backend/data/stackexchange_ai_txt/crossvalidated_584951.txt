Binary Classification using Machine Learning Models for longitudinal data in R

So I have longitudinal data with a binary target variable, and I'd like to perform binary classification using a random forest, xgboost, and glmnet (ridge/lasso/elastic net) model. Is this possible to do in r? I've skimmed a few articles where some algorithms are being developed but I've yet to see them fully published or available in r. Any help/resources would be greatly appreciated!
