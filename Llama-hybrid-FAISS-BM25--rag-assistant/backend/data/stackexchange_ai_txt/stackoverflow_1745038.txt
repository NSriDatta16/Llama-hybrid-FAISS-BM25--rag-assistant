Code completion based on snippets in Eclipse

I would like to accomplish two tasks at once. First, to move my snippets of code from .txt files and be able to tag them/organize better. Second, assign shortcuts to those snippets that will allow me to type "p" + TAB which will render assigned snippet (I don't care of cursor position etc)
