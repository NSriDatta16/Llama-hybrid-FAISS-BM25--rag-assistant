First, logistic regression is not a classifier, it is about probability estimation. Unbalanced classes per se is not a problem, unless there simple is not enough data in the class with few observations. See for instance Does an unbalanced sample matter when doing logistic regression? for more information. You do not need to make any changes in the estimation procedure, you simply change the loss function used for classification afterwards, if you need a classification. That is, separate the estimation problem from using the estimated model to make decisions.
