Testing set 40x as big as training set?

This website contains numerous datasets that can be used for machine learning projects. I wanted to experiment with one of the datasets, so I took a look at the "Poker Hand Data Set" . However, something seems odd to me when looking at the description : Training set - Total of 25010 instances in a domain of 311,875,200. Testing set - Total of one million instances in a domain of 311,875,200. Why is the training set so small? And why is the testing set so big? I thought that normally these sets should be distributed 80%/20%, but this is 2.4%/97.6%.
