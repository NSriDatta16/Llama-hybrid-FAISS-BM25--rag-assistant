Infragistics has an excel component that can read an excel file from a stream. I'm using it in a project here and it works well. Also the open source myXls component could easily be modified to support this. The XlsDocument contstructor only supports loading from a file given by a file name, but it works by creating a FileStream and then reading the Stream, so changing it to support loading from streams should be trivial. Edit: I see that you found a solution but I just wanted to note that I updated the source code for the component so that it now can read an excel file directly from a stream. :-)
