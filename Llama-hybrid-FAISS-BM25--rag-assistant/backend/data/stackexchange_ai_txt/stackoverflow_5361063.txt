How to generate an unordered list from database table data?

hi i have an unordered list I had made a table to fill the unordered list but how to fetch that data into li and ul the table consists of home, organisation (with children as policy, employeesdetails), and so on.. How do i fill these ul and li 's and children of li 's with data from sqlserver2005 table? I'm not supposed to use any asp.net built in controls like asp.net menu foreach (DataRow row in dt.Rows) { int currentDepth = Convert.ToInt32(row["Depth"]); if (lastDepth "); numUL++ ; } else if (lastDepth > currentDepth) { output.Append(" "); numUL-- ; } else if (lastDepth > -1) { output.Append(" "); } output.AppendFormat(" {0}", row["ApplicationName"], currentDepth); lastDepth = currentDepth; } for (int i = 1;i "); } Literal1.Text = output.ToString(); i have made the navigation bar based on above code my navbar looks like this Home|Organisation|Recruitment|Help|Issues i am getting all the li's properly(like department and users under organisation) i have one prolem how do i get the urls dynamically to the above code my table looks like this ApplicationID ApplicationName ParentKey Depth URL 1 HOME NULL 0 # 2 Organisation NULL 0 # 3 Department 2 1 # 4 User 2 1 # 5 Issues NULL 0 # 6 issuestrack 5 1 # 7 Help NULL 0 # 8 helpneeded 7 1 # thanx in advance
