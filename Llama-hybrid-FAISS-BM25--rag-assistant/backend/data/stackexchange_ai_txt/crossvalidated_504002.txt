Appropriate statistic for describing differences between nested regression models?

I have run a series of nested binary logistic and negative binomial regression models in SPSS examining the impact of an intervention on re-offending outcomes. For example: Model A = Individual characteristics Model B = Individual characteristics + program characteristics Model C = Individual characteristics + program characteristics + sentencing characteristics Outcome A = Likelihood of re-offending (binary logistic regression) Outcome B = Rate of re-offending (negative binomial regression) All models are significant and I have been trying to understand the pros and cons of various statistics to describe the incremental predictive ability of each model. Can I use a chi-square difference test to simply describe whether one model is better (eg. Model B is better than model A, but Model C is no better than Model B), or should I be using an F-Test or adjusted R-square change? Any help would be much appreciated.
