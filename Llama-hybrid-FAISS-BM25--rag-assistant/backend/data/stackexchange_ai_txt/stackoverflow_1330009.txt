In Mercurial, storing unrelated codebases in the same repository is a bad idea because it will Significantly complicate merging. Merges will depend on changes made to all projects, rather than just the project you're trying to merge. Cause storage and checkout overhead -- Mercurial, as far as I know, does not support checking out only subdirectories of a repository. You'd have to branch all projects at once. The solution is to convert your single Subversion repository into multiple Mercurial repositories. Most conversion tools support this.
