Color (syntax highlighting) within an HTML tag

In a code fragment like the following ... class Foo { internal Foo() { for (int i = 0; i ... its various keywords and so on are color-coded when they're displayed in my browsers. When I do "View source", I don't see anything special in the HTML that would implement this color-coding. How and/or where is this syntax-specific color-highlighting implemented, then? For example is it built-in to the browsers, or is it implemented by site-specific JavaScript editing the DOM within the browsers? I find this a difficult question to Google for.
