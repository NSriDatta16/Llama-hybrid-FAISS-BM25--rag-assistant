If your goal is to test your low-level driver code you will likely need to create some sort of test fixture, using loopback cables or multiple interconnected units to allow you to exercise each driver. Pairing a board with known-good software with a board running a development build will allow you to test for regressions in communication protocols, etc. Specific test strategies depend on the hardware you wish to test. For example, ADCs can be tested by presenting a known waveform and converting a series of samples, then checking for the proper range, frequency, average value, etc. I have found this type of testing to be very valuable in the past, allowing me to confidently modify and improve driver code without fear of breaking existing applications.
