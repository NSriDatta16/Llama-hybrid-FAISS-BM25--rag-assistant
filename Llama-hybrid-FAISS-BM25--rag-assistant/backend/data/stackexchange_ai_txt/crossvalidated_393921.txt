This isnâ€™t just the interaction! The comparisons you did involve the effects of Treatment, Year.Sampled, and their interaction. Note for example that the average of the first and last contrasts is the marginal comparison of Treatment, averaged over the two years. Similarly, the average of the 2nd and 5th contrasts is the marginal Year.Sampled difference, averaged over treatments.
