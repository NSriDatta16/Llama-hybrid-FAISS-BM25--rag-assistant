I've always thought that GridBagLayout is a really powerful LayoutManager. Unfortunately the learning curve to master it might be a bit too steep. My first job did not allow us to use any GUI builders so all GUI code was handwritten. I've always felt that this is the best way to learn GridBagLayout, getting your hands dirty. Nowadays, being old and lazy I mostly use NetBeans but I still have never felt the need to consider other LayoutManagers since GridBagLayout can do everything. To me also a grid is a really good way to layout things. It just makes sense to organize your layout that way and think of it in terms of rows and columns.
