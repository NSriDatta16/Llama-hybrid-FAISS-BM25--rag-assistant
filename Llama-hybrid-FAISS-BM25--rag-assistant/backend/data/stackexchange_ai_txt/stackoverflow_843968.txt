Interesting question. At one level, perhaps it was originally seen as a capability device, similar to the user-agent on the request (browscap etc). In reality, neither is really useful in this respect, and most code now uses other means to test for options. And in many ways the server is (indirectly) in control of the requests from well-behaved clients (if has an influencing factor, at least). These days, it is sometimes seen as a security issue, and I know many places that block this header on html traffic. But for non-html (but still http) traffic (such as web-services) it may still serve a useful versioning purpose (although you often see a product-specific versioning header in such cases).
