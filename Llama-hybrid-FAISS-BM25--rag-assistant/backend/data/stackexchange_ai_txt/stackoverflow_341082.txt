A slight con would be that it's not as elegant a handle as some other identifiers (e.g. saying to a colleague please can you look at record 475663 is a bit easier than saying please can you look at 2008-12-04 19:34:02) There is also the risk of confusion over different date format in different locales (e.g. 4th March 2008 - 4/3/2008 in Europe, 3/4/2008 in USA) (My preference is always to use a seperate key column)
