Data augmentation: ImageDataGenerator vs openCV

I would like to increase the data in my dataset to create a CNN deep learning classification model. Which is better for the model, using data augmentation by ImageDataGenerator or using openCV to increase the data? By the way, I am using Keras and floydhub.
