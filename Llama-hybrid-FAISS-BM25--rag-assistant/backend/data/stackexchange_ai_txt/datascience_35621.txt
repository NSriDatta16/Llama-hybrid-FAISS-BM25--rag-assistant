Things Pandas can do, that SQL can't do df.describe() Plotting, e.g. df['population'].plot(kind='hist') Use a dataframe directly for training machine learning algorithms Things Pandas can do, I wasn't aware that SQL can do as well Export to csv: df.to_csv('foobar.csv') . This is important when you want to show something to a business owner who wants to work with Excel. And there is df.to_excel as well. But in SQL, you can do SELECT a,b,a+b INTO OUTFILE '/tmp/result.txt' FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY '"' LINES TERMINATED BY '\n' FROM test_table; (thank you, vy32!)
