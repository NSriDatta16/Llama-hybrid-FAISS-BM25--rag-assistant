Derivation of a Bayesian predictive probability

Suppose a random variable $Y$ is governed by an unknown parameter $p$ . From a set of observations $X$ , I want to draw the probability of $Y=y$ . How can I compute the Bayesian predictive probability $f(Y=y|X)?$ In a reference paper( http://www-stat.wharton.upenn.edu/~edgeorge/Research_papers/Bcollab.pdf ) equation (6), I saw the derivation should be $$f(Y=y|X)=\int_pf(Y=y|p)f(X|p)\pi(p)dp.$$ How could I derive this using Bayes rule?
