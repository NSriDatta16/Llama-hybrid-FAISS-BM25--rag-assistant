To draw a string outside of your window, you'll have to CREATE a new window, set it's mask to some color (say magenta) and then draw text onto it - you can use simple label here. Set your window border style to None, and there you go. In other words, there is no way of displaying 'free text' without window attached. For masking color, use 'transparency color' or similar property (I will look up into it later - have no VS at hand)
