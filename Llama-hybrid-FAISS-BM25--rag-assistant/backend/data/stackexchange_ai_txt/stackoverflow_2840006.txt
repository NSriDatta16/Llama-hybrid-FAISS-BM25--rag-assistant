Well, Magento is customizable, but not ideal for small e-commerce websites, since it has fairly big hardware requirements to work. Prestashop has some messy code and follows strict rules related to the layout, wich makes it kind of hard to change. I've been exploring OpenCart, and despite his "youngness" (sorry if this is not a word), it follows the MVC pattern for both frontend and backend, along with OOP, wich makes it easy to change. Also, his default backend UI is more user-friendly that the other 2 I mentioned. Still, wont put my hands on the fire for it, since I never tried to build anything over it, just checked out his coding practices.
