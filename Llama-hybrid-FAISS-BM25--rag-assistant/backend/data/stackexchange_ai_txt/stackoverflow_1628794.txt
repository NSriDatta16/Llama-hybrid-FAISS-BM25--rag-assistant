I run into this all the time using Eclipse Galileo and m2eclipse 0.9.8 and Tomcat with WTP. I think it is m2eclipse that is the culprit. The problem seems worse after switching from Ganymede. The work around is to run mvn to create the war and then copy the war contents from "target" to WTP's "wtpwebapps" directory. You can conveniently find this horribly long path by double clicking the server in the Servers view, and choosing "Open Launch Configuration" from there click on Arguments(?) tab I think and copy the catalina.home java property that is defined as an argument there.
