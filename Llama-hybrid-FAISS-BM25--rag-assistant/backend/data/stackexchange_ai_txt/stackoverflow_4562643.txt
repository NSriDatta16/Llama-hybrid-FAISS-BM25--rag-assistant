Yes, it's possible only if someone (probably you or me or others) will rewrite setContentView() - since I see root of a problem only there. Let me explain: Layout XML's are stored in res/layout which packaged in APK There's no way to modify APK runtime (at least I've never heard about it) That means basically you can't redefine on-line/runtime customized/internationalized layout XML's in res/layout So you'd need a place where to store customized XML's: either in preferences or in SQLite In both cases one'd need to inflate XML in Activity/Dialog, which can be done through setContentView So in the end - you have to redefine setContentView How to do that? 2 options: Heroic: completely rewrite setContentView in Android sources Less heroic: create your own OwnActivity class which will redefine setContentView(int id) . For instance: OwnActivity.setContentView() looks inside SQLite for known XML id with current locale, if not found it inflates XML from res/layout EDIT1: You can override it like: public class MyActivity extends Activity { @Override public void setContentView(int id) { if(checkPresenceInStorage(id)) //... else super.setContentView(id); } }
