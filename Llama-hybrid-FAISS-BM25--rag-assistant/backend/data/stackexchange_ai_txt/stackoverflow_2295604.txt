Is WPF a safe choice for my application?

I'm maintaing a Windows Forms application which draws map data with overlays. I've been considering a move to WPF for the drawing layer, to take advantage of the graphics card rendering. In the last couple of weeks, however, I've started to have some doubts: The new release of Evernote uses WPF, and doesn't run on Nvidia Quadro cards . A WPF transitions demo from WindowsClient.net stopped rendering part-way through the animations on one of our test portables with Intel graphics (and yes, we had the latest Intel drivers). Stack Overflow questions like this . With the current Windows Forms codebase I can expect the application to run identically at every installation. WPF is much more dependent on the quality of the graphics card drivers, and I don't have the testing resources for comprehensive coverage. I'm particularly interested to hear from people who've delivered a WPF application outside their own company or to a mixed population of machines - did hardware and driver specific bugs cause you a significant support burden?
