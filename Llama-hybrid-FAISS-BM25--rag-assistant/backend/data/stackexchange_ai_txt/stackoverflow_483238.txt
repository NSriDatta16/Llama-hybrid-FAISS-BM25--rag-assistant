Well, I guess it pays to pay closer attention to your site. I inherited this site from a previous employee and it looks like there are multiple pages with the same name. Since migrating from a WebSite to a Web Application Project, the code-behinds are all in the same namespace and so these partial classes are trying to "combine" into one major class and hence the collisions. Always figure out the answer to your problem AFTER asking for help. Thanks anyway. So, to clarify, I just needed to wrap all my code-behinds with appropriate namespaces.
