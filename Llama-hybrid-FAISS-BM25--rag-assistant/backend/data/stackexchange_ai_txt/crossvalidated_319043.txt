Multiple Choice Test: Probability of Identical Incorrect Answers

Setup: We consider a multiple choice test with 30 questions, each consisting of four potential answers. We know that (on average) neighbors answer 50% of all questions jointly correct. Assumption: Let us assume that students pick randomly answers if they do not know the solution. Question: How can we calculate the (expected) average share of identical incorrect answers?
