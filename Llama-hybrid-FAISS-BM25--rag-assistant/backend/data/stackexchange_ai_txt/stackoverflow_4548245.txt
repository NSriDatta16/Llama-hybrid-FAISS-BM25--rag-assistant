Check out the Javascript Navigator object: http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_browser.asp alert(navigator.userAgent); This script may help you for more complicated detection: http://www.quirksmode.org/js/detect.html You should be handling these redirections server-side though. This is particularly true if you have a mobile version of your site. Most mobile browsers do support Javascript just fine, but there are quirks. Server-side, you can send a redirect by sending the 302 status code, and the location: header. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_location Edit: Since you say that you need to detect mobile browsers now in your comments, just use this script: http://detectmobilebrowsers.mobi/
