How to identify the frequencies of periodic peak signals in a noisy time series? (with R)

Suppose to have two time series with peak signals at different frequencies, like these two: signal1 # A tsibble: 96 x 2 [1M] timestamp value 1 2011 Jan 0 2 2011 Feb 0 3 2011 Mar 0 4 2011 Apr 0 5 2011 May 15 6 2011 Jun 0 7 2011 Jul 0 8 2011 Aug 0 9 2011 Sep 0 10 2011 Oct 15 # ... with 86 more rows signal1 %>% autoplot() signal2 # A tsibble: 96 x 2 [1M] timestamp value 1 2011 Jan 0 2 2011 Feb 0 3 2011 Mar 0 4 2011 Apr 0 5 2011 May 0 6 2011 Jun 0 7 2011 Jul 0 8 2011 Aug 0 9 2011 Sep 13 10 2011 Oct 0 # ... with 86 more rows signal2 %>% autoplot() Joining the two signals we obtain this composite signal: tsibble(timestamp = t, value = signal1 $value + signal2$ value) %>% autoplot() Now we disturb this composite signal with white noise: noise $value + signal1$ value + signal2$value) final_ts %>% autoplot() Starting from this noisy time series, I would like to identify the different frequencies of the periodic peak signals buried in the noise, in this case 5/12 and 9/12 (assuming 12 months as the unit of time). How to do that? Is the Fourier analysis the best way to do that?
