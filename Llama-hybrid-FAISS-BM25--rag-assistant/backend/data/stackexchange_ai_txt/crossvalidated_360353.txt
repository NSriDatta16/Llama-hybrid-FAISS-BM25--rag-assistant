Average variability of small data set

I have data for 300 devices and each device has been tested a different number of times so some devices have 2 data points and some have 8. For example, one device scored 5, 6.5, 6.5, 6, 6, 6 whilst another scored 5.5, 6.5, 8, 5.5. I want to calculate the average variability in the data but I believe I have too little data for each device to calculate the variance and the range is thrown out by outliers, for instance the score of 8 on the second example above. Are there any suggested ways to tackle this problem? Thanks in advance Andrew
