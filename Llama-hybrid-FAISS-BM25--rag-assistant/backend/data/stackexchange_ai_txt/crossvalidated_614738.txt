Based on the ADF and KPSS tests, the first-differenced series is already stationary. (Note that presence of autocorrelation does not imply nonstationarity.) Thus you have no reason to take second differences. Differencing is used for accounting for unit roots, not just for any old autocorrelation. The second-differenced series will suffer from overdifferencing and will have a unit-root moving average (MA) pattern. Meanwhile, to deal with autocorrelation that is not due to a unit root, you can introduce autoregressive (AR) and MA terms or seasonal terms such as Fourier terms or seasonal dummies. Thus you get an ARIMA model (possibly with external regressors) or a regression with ARIMA errors. For the model to be statistically adequate, the residuals should be close to white noise.
