Make sure you have a full suite of regression tests! Grab FindBugs, PMD etc. and start looking at what they have to say. I tend to find that the classes that report the most Findbugs errors have many issues and are a good place to start a refactoring effort. Another tool worth looking at is STAN4J, it generates structural metrics showing you where the design of your code could really be improved. It will detect fragile inheritance heirarchies, bad abstractions etc. These should definately be a target of any refactoring effort. It's worth always paying attention to these sorts of tools, they will help you out tremendously if you learn how to interpret what they are saying to you. Also pay attention to the warnings your IDE, they're there for a reason. I am not affiliated with any of these tool providers (even though they're free), I do however use them a lot and am very impressed with them!
