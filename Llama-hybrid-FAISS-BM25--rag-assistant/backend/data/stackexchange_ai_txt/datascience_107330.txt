A few comments: I think that you should first make a precise and realistic list of your goals, especially if you're going to learn on your own. Why? Because data science is a vast domain, nobody knows everything, not even the top contributors on CrossValidated or here on DSSE. Additionally most of them have a degree related to data science and years of experience, so you're unlikely to reach this level in one year. Since the main goal is to have a job, you could start by identifying more precisely which kind of job you want and which skills you need for these jobs. In general I would say that the best way is to actually obtain a formal degree. It offers you guaranteed recognition, reasonably well structured curriculum, easy access to professors and fellow students who can help you learn more efficiently. Don't focus only on statistics. With a maths background, you should probably focus at least as much on your programming skills. In particular you should practice as much as possible on hands-on projects. If you learn on your own these are the skills that you'll need to demonstrate the most to companies in order to get the job that you want.
