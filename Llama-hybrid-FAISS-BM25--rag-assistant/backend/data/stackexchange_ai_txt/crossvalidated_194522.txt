what can I say about the distribution of how often the intervals captures? Treating each interval containing the parameter as a Bernoulli process with each trial having some coverage probability $p$, the number of "coverages" should be $\text{Binomial}(n,p)$. The potential problem is whether the $p$ one actually has is really the $p$ one was hoping for (whether due to the extent of the failure of assumptions or because of approximations involved in obtaining the intervals).
