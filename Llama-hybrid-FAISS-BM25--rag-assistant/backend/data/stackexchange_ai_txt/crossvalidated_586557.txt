Although you are asking if RNN is strictly markovian, I think you should rather ask can I build reinforcement learning for non-markovian process. No one mentioned simple markov process definition - if next state depends only on current state - this is markov process. If that fails (and from what I gather - your states depends on multiple previous states) - your process is Non-Markovian. There are multiple articles on Non-Markovian reinforcement learning.
