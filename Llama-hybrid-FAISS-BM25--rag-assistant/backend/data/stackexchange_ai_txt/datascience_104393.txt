Early stopping based on average val_loss of last ten epoches and with some n partiences

I am training a DNN with CNN in Keras. Though, I can write an EarlyStopping criteria based on val_loss but due to minor oscillations in the val_loss, I want to monitor the average validation loss over last n epoches and with n patience. How can I do this in Keras?
