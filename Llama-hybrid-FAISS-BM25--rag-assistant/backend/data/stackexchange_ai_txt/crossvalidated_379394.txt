Is a kernel function basically just a mapping?

I'm currently studying machine learning (support vector machines to be more specific), and I was wondering how exactly I should understand what a kernel function is. I've read other questions on this community such as: How to intuitively explain what a kernel is? Understanding kernel functions for SVMs What function could be a kernel? However, I'm still having trouble grasping the concept and was hoping somebody would be able to help me out. My initial understanding is that a kernel is essentially just a mapping into a higher dimension. For example, when we want to make better predictions using a linear classifier, we would use a kernel to map the decision boundary to a higher dimension and make better predictions. Is my understanding at least on the right track? Any feedback is appreciated. Thank you.
