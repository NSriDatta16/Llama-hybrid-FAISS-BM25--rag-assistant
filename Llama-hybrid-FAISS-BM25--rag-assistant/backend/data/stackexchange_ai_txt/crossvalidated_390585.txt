Computing a moving average when data points arrive one at a time

I am sure there's a cool python/numpy/pandas way to do this. I am receiving one data point at a time. I would like to compute something like a moving average over the last n observations, even better with exponential smoothing. I could have a circular buffer where I drop the oldest observation, add the newest, and compute the smoothing on that. I'm looking for a more elegant approach.
