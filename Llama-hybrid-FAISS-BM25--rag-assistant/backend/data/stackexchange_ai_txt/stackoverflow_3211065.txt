How to pause and resume UIView Animation?

I have a UIView with several UILabels that is animating from top to bottom and vice versa. A sort of Autoque let's say :) I use 2 functions: -(void)goUp -(void)goDown Those functions start a UIView animation to the required position.They both have an AnimationDidStopSelector defined that calls the other function at the end. This all works smoothly. When touching the screen, using touchesBegan, I would like to pause the current animation and change the vertical position of the UIView using touchesMoved event. In touchesEnded I want to resume the animation to the required end position. What would be the proper way to do so? Thomas
