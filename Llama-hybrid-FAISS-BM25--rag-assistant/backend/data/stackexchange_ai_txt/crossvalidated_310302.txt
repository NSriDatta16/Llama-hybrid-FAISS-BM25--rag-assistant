What is the frequency range for a discrete time series?

We're covering spectral analysis for discrete time stationary processes in lectures, and I can't really get my head around something which seemingly should be easy. "Because time is discrete, we only need to consider frequencies in $[\frac{-1}{2},\frac{1}{2}]$" I have absolutely no understanding of why this is so. From my understanding of frequency, it's the number of observations (i.e. measurements making your time series) per pre-defined time interval. So, for example, if the interval is a day and we take a measurement per hour, frequency would be 24. This seems to agree. I don't know where my misunderstanding lies.
