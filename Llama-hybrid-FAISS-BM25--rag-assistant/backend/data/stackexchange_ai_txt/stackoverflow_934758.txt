Is this a legitimate use of Rails' Single Table Inheritance?

I've just been reading Chad Fowler's blog post about 20 Rails Development No-Nos . On Single Table Inheritance he comments: The storage of a column called “type” which holds a class name is a pretty good indicator that something fishy is going on. It’s fishy but not always bad. I think, though, that any time you use it you should ask yourself more than once if it’s the right solution. Databases don’t do what they do best as well when you have lots of STI and polymorphic associations. I'm writing a blog application and I'm considering using STI for the comments that can be made on a post and for the contact messages that visitors can post if they want to get in touch with me. My Message model will inherit from my Comment model. They both share common attributes, except that Message will have an extra subject field. Another commonality is that both will be submitted to Akismet for spam checking. Rather than just ask myself more than once if it's the right solution as Chad suggests, I thought I'd get some opinions from the Stack Overflow experts as well! Does what I'm proposing sound like a good fit for STI?
