Wind speed in a building, windows and angles as factors: is ANOVA appropriate?

EDIT Is an ANOVA appropriate for rhe following? I have a physical cuboidal building in an open field with a single window (S) or 2 windows (X). 1. Single window cube (S) : I measure a variable (air speed) at 10,000 points inside this cube (blue plane) and compute the average. I then turn the cube a few degrees with respect to the oncoming wind (angle) and repeat the experiment. 2. 2 window cube (X): Repeat with same angles. I'd like to know if there is a way of identifying which factor (angle or window set-up) is more important for varying the air speed inside? I now have a table of values: z= speed angle window 15 0 S 20 0 S 25 0 X 04 0 X 55 15 S 16 15 S 15 15 X 20 15 X ... In R then I do: ACH.aova But I'm not sure if this is the best method or how to interpret the results... Any help would be much appreciated,
