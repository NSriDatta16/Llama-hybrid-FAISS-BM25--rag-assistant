Extraction from a string in R or Python

I have a csv file with addresses that include ',', empty space, numbers. I have two other files with city and zip codes. I want to read the address file and extract the city name and zip codes. As you will see below the addresses have no easy pattern and is randomly sprinkled with ',' spaces etc.Here is an example. Address file 123 Riverside Drive Riverside CA 12034 Santa clara CA 93453 231 Monroe drive, OR 43 Mystic cove, O'Fallon 63045 City file riverside O'fallon santa clara Morgantown Zip code file 02343 23454 12034 93453 Expected output file (corresponding to the input address file) in two columns City Zipcode Riverside 12034 Santa clara 93453 Missing Missing O'Fallon Missing Note that the matching shouldn't be case sensitive. I am more familiar with R but will be happy with any help in python too. Thank you in advance.
