I think that you can use median or average AIC of a group of models in comparison to another group for internal analysis or during the selection of model specifications for further consideration. There is an interpretation of the difference between AIC of two models in terms of likelihoods, see here . In a similar somewhat informal way you could compare the groups of models represented by their summary AIC.
