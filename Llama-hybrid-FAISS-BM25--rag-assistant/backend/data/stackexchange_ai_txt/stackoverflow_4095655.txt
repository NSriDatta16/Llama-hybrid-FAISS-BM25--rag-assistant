Your design violates the design principle known as Dependency inversion, because clients depend on concrete classes instead of abstract ones. You should reconsider implementing your clients in a way they work with the abstract type (Application::File). If there's absolutely no way to do that, then you should redesign the class hierarchy. Think about it. If an abstraction is seldom used then it is probably useless. Robert Martin terms this as the Stable abstractions principle.
