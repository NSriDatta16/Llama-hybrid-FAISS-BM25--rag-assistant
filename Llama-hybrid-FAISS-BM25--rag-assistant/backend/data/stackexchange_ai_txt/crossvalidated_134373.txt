So as I hate to leave something unanswered that I asked but later found an answer for myself. Here is a quote from Christopher M. Bishop's "Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition" that seems to perfectly summarize the interchangability of regression and classification: In the case of regression problems it is the regression function we wish to approximate, while for classification problems the functions which we seek to approximate are the probabilities of membership of the different classes expressed as functions of the input variables. So effectively, the problems can be seen as functional mappings of one another.
