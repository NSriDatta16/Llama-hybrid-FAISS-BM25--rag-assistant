Can I assume that the expected value of this log ratio is 0?

I am taking two measurements from subjects: measurement A and measurement B. I have some strong theoretical reasons to think that my measurements of A and B should on average be the same as each other within any individual subject. However, there's considerable natural variation. Some people are high on A and low on B, and vice-versa. I have been instructed to calculate $\log\frac{A}{B}$ for each person in the sample, and then average those $\log\frac{A}{B}$ values across the whole sample. I know it's a mistake to assume the expected value of a ratio is the ratio of the expected values. So even if I assume that A and B are on average the same as each other, I can't assume that the expected value of $\frac{A}{B}$ is 1. However, I thought that maybe I could get around this by taking the log. I thought that if I could assume A and B have the same expected value, then the expected value of $\log\frac{A}{B}$ really would be 0. Am I wrong about this? If so, why? And is there any other transformation I could have done that would have created the desired effect of producing an expected value of 0 for the outcome variable? I've repeated this process with several samples, and so far I've always ended up with a mean $\log\frac{A}{B}$ above 0.
