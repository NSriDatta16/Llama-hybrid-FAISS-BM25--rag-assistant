The procedure given in the quote is part of the Box-Tidwell procedure, see Is there formal test of non-linearity in linear regression? Comparing coefficients in logistic regression with curvilinear effects and search this site. A better reference is An R Companion to Applied Regression which has a detailed treatment. But there are probably better ways: Use visualization of residuals, see for instance Diagnostic probability plots in logistic regression and search this site. But, since you have large data, why not model upfront with modern, flexible models using splines? As an example, in the logistic regression models I see, there is often a predictor age . If this variable covers an appreciable part of a normal human lifelength, there is no chance its effect will be linear. I do not test that, I spline it from the start. This is consistent with the good advice at When to check model assumptions
