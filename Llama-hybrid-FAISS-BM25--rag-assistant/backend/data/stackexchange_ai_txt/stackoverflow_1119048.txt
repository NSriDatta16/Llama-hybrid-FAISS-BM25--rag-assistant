Warning create_function() has been DEPRECATED as of PHP 7.2.0. Relying on this function is highly discouraged. Builtin loops in PHP are faster then interpreted loops, so it actually makes sense to make this one a one-liner: $result = array(); array_walk($cats, create_function('$value, $key, &$result', '$result[] = $value->id;'), $result)
