You should really check out Ragel . It's a framework to embed state machines in your regular source code. Ragel supports C, C++, Objective-C, D, Java and Ruby. Ragel's great for writing file and protocol parsers as well as stepping through external DSL stuff. Chiefly because it allows you to execute any kind of code on state transitions and such. A couple of notable projects that use Ragel are, Mongrel , a great ruby web server. And Hpricot , a ruby based html-parser, sort of inspired by jQuery. Another great feature of Ragel is how it can generate graphviz -based charts that visualize your state machines. Below is an example taken from Zed Shaw's article on ragel state charts .
