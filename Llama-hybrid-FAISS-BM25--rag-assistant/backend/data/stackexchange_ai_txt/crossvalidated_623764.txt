Comparing reduced, intermediate and complex model in logistic regression?

How should I compare my logistic regression models? My study is about the association between diabetes (dia), and a genetic variation (GV) I'm adjusting for confounders such as gestational age (GA) and gender (GE). I have these models: the simpel, reduced model dia ~ GV half complex, intermediate model dia ~GV + GA The full complex model dia ~GV + GA + GE All three models are testet from the same dataset. But I don't know how to present my models in my project. Can I compare the reduced model and the full model? Or should the "half" model be included in the project as well? I'm only interested in the coefficient for GV. So is it important to include all models? I'm asking because that would be a lot of forest plots to show, and I hope that it is okay to compare only the reduced and the full model. But if that does not make sense, then I will include all three. Hope you can help and clarify things for me Thanks in advance!
