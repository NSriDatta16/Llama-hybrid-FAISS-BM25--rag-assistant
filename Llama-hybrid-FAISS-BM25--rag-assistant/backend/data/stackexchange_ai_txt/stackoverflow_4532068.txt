Internet Explorer Compatibility Issues (CSSPlay Menu)

I've been running into the age-old problem of cross-browser compatibility ever since I began making websites, but this time I'm stumped. I have a pure-CSS and HTML menu that I used from CSSPlay. It works flawlessly in Firefox but not in Internet Explorer. Can somebody help me figure out why? It works fine in IE9 Compatibility Mode, ironically. Edit: Forgot the link. http://jsfiddle.net/Xh9Kz/ Also, I've been running into a lot of trouble with percentage differences between webkit and Internet Explorer browsers in general. While Webkit browsers also percentages to add up to 100%, IE seems to not do so. Does anyone have a resource for this so I can code to avoid it? Thanks in advance. Merry Christmas everyone!
