Look at this blog post: http://sdesmedt.wordpress.com/2006/09/04/nhibernate-part-4-mapping-techniques-for-aggregation-one-to-many-mapping/ If you want a concrete example, check the samples of this nice tutorial. Look at the summaries that are not entities and have custom mapping logic: http://www.codeproject.com/KB/architecture/NHibernateBestPractices.aspx Or do a google search on SetResultTransformer that is available just for that, transform results in another objects or collections. Including IDictionnary.
