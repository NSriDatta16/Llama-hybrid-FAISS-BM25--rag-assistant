How to backup a Caffe (DL framework) project? The Caffe folder (downloaded from GitHub) can't be copied or compressed

I am using Ubuntu18.04 and Caffe deep learning framework to do my project. However, when I tried to backup my project, I found that the Caffe folder (downloaded from GitHub) can't be copied or compressed. Here is what I did: Download Caffe from GitHub, and install it. Do some modification to the source code for my project. Backup the whole Caffe folder. However, if I copy the folder to a USB flash drive, I will have a folder that misses files (I compared the size and number of files of two folders). If I compress the folder then copy it to the USB flash drive, then I get error says I can't open the compressed file. I wonder if I did anything wrong, what is the correct way of backup Caffe project? Thanks.
