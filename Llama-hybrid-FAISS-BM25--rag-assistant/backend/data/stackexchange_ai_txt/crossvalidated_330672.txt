So it sounds like you have a logistic regression model that spits out the chance of a given team winning against a given opponent. I would re-think that approach entirely and instead treat the problem as one of classification. A match between team A and team B could be labeled as "Win for A", "Win for B", or "Draw". In that case, your model should give you values that indeed add up to 1.
