Running Visual Studio and sites inside a VMware RAM Disk

I have a machine with 24 GB so I was planning to install Vista 64-bit and nothing on it but VMware workstation 6.5 Vista Image, that will be installed on a RAM Disk that I will make on the main Vista. The whole VMware Image will be in RAM, so I will install Visual Studio 2008 in it and put all my sites there as if it was a real disk. I have done a few tests of running applications from RAM Disk and the performance was blazing, but I have some concerns. How can I make continuous backups? Since it’s a RAM disk, once the PC is restarted, everything will be gone: Visual Studio, SQL databases, my sites, and everything else. As long as my main host Vista doesn’t have anything installed, is leaving 8 GB of RAM for it is enough? The VMware Image is one file, so should I defrag the host drive or the drive inside the VMware image?
