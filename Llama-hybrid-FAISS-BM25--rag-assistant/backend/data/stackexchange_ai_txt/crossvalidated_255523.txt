Comparing two time series, not sure which model

I searched multiple entries with similar topic, but couldn't find suitable answer. I want to compare two time series, interest rate and investment grade corporate bond yield over 15 years. I have quarterly data for interest rate. And I want to also control for other variables like GDP, inflation and so on. Which statistical model will suite the best? My guess is ARIMA, but any input will be appreciated very much. Thank you.
