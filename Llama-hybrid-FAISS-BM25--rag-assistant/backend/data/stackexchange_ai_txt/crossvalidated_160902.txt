Is it possible for test error to be lower than training error

Is it possible to have test error lower than training error? I have a classification problem with 2000 samples, 500 of which are positives, 1500 are negatives. I split my data into 70% training data, 30% test data. Run random forest with 200 estimators and cv=10. I did this several times and compared the recall and precision score and notice the scores for my test set is significantly better. Is this possible?
