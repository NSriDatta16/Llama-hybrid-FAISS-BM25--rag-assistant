Is building an application in Java different than making one in C#?

I mean using and IDE of course. Does Java come with a toolbox like control that has drag and drop controls, that you can move around, etc? Also, if I make an application in Java, will it run on any machine that has the Java Runtime Environment? I wouldn't mind learning some Java because of this single trait. :) Say I build a simple calculator, will it run on Linux/Mac/Windows?
