First, make sure you move your bind() methods inside the $(document).ready() event. Since they are being called before the DOM is ready (namely before those DOM elements even exist) there is no way for an event to be bound to them. Also, passing in objects to bind() isn't supported until jQuery 1.4. (You can use the code I have below, or upgrade to 1.4 to use your bind() methods as is. (you'll still need to move them to inside the ready() event. $(document).ready(function(){ // enable sortable on all columns // this will add drag-and-drop functionality as well $("#mypage_column1").sortable({ items: '.gadget', // the type of element to drag handle: 'h2', // the element that should start the drag event opacity: 0.9, // opacity of the element while draging connectWith: ["#mypage_column2"] }); $("#mypage_column2").sortable({ items: '.gadget', // the type of element to drag handle: 'h2', // the element that should start the drag event opacity: 0.9, // opacity of the element while draging connectWith: ["#mypage_column1"] }); $("img.btn_delete").bind('click', function() { alert("Removing this gadget"); }); $("img.mypage_add_gadget").bind('click', function() { alert("Adding a new gadget"); }); });
