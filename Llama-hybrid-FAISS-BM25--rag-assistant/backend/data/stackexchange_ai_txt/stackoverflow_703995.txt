Here's a triple threaded version that I hacked together quickly that will do the trick. This can be dropped in anywhere in a visible form (or could be modified for program.cs) and will spawn a new, centered, modal dialog box with a smooth scrolling progress bar that will dominate user attention until FinishedProcessing in the parent thread is set to true. //Update to true when finished loading or processing bool FinishedProcessing = false; System.Threading.AutoResetEvent DialogLoadedFlag = new System.Threading.AutoResetEvent(false); (new System.Threading.Thread(()=> { Form StockWaitForm = new Form() { Name = "StockWaitForm", Text = "Please Wait...", ControlBox = false, FormBorderStyle = FormBorderStyle.FixedDialog, StartPosition = FormStartPosition.CenterParent, Width = 240, Height = 80, Enabled = true }; ProgressBar ScrollingBar = new ProgressBar() { Style = ProgressBarStyle.Marquee, Parent = StockWaitForm, Dock = DockStyle.Fill, Enabled = true }; StockWaitForm.Load += new EventHandler((x, y) => { DialogLoadedFlag.Set(); (new System.Threading.Thread(()=> { while (FinishedProcessing == false) Application.DoEvents(); StockWaitForm.Invoke((MethodInvoker)(()=> StockWaitForm.Close())); })).Start(); }); this.Invoke((MethodInvoker)(()=>StockWaitForm.ShowDialog(this))); })).Start(); while (DialogLoadedFlag.WaitOne(100,true) == false) Application.DoEvents(); // //Example Usage //Faux Work - Have your local SQL server instance load here for (int x = 0; x Customize to taste. Also, if you do use this in a production app, wrap the new thread contents in try...catch blocks to CYA . One last thing, I'm releasing this code to you under the "Coderer Public License / SO v1.1", as follows: Coderer Public License / SO v1.0 I, Person known "Coderer" on the community "Stack Overflow", agree to thoroughly consider switching to a sane project management methodology that allows extra classes to be added to projects in the Executing phase. I understand that nazi-like change control is unhealthy for all parties involved.
