Using logistic regression to detect fraudulent transactions

I am using logistic regression (with R) for detecting fraudulent transactions. So far I am achieving a relatively good ratio of success (f-score). However I have noticed something, once I have my model built, the threshold that gives me the best f-score is to consider something as fraudulent if the logit function is bigger than 0.059 (I started with 0.5). For the record, I am using 7099 observations as training examples and 3042 as testing data, in total I am using 6 features/columns for prediction (planning to add a couple more) Now my questions are the following Am I doing something terribly wrong so that I have to use such a low limit to start labeling transactions as fraudulent? That said, the vast majority of transaction are legitimate, does it justify the low threshold for the labeling (again, 0.059) ? Would it be worth to explore other algs such random forest or neuronal networks?
