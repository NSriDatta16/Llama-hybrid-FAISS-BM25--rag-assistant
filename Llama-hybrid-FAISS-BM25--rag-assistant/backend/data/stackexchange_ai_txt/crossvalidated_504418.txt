Built-in reproducible environments If R were designed from scratch, it would be great to have a built-in way to reproducibly use packages and have multiple versions of the same package installed, and bundle information about which packages the code was run with in a single file that could be used to rerun this code with identical packages. Ideally without requiring you to install the same package multiple times. There are plenty of packages out there to create reproducible R environments, which causes fragmentation, and users do have to use one for their code to be properly reproducible.
