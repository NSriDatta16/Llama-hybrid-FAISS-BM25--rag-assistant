Take a look at Small Memory Software - Patterns for Systems with Limited Memory . You don't specify what sort of memory constraint, but I assume RAM. While not Ruby-specific, I think you'll find some useful ideas in this book - the patterns cover RAM, ROM and secondary storage, and are divided into major techniques of small data structures, memory allocation, compression, secondary storage, and small architecture.
