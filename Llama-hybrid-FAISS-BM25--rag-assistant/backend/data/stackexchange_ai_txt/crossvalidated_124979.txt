Investigating interaction

Please I need to check for interaction before building an explanatory model (logistic regression). I have 16 interaction terms in total. Please how what is the best way to go about it. Will I need to put all the interaction terms together with the main effects at once, then drop the insignificant interaction parameters and do the likelihood test (model including all interaction parameters compared to model with all insignificant interaction parameter removed). Or I need to put in each of the interaction terms in different models and compare model with no interaction parameter with model with each interaction parameter separately.
