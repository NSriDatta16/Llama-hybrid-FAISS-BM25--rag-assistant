This control does not exist as an API. You will have to make your own. You might want to look into UIScrollView for the paginated row of icons. As for the drag and drop behavior, you can track a user's touch events. This will probably involve subclassing UIControl. So, in the end you'd probably set up a paginating UIScrollView with a UIControl inside. For looking into UIScrollView, there's a session from the most recent WWDC (2010) on the topic. Of course, a little Googling will get you plenty of information on most of these topics. Good luck!
