jQuery UI Droppable: Detect which draggables are dropped on an element?

I have the jQuery UI framework's draggable and droppable elements working. I would like to programmatically determine which draggable elements are currently dropped on which droppable elements. Is there an easy way to do this? I thought of using event listeners to detect drop and out events, then keep a dictionary or something in memory to keep track, but this seems contrived. Better ideas?
