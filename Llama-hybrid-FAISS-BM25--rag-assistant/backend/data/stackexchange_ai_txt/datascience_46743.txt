Use output of K-Mean for Logistics regression

I've created a binary classifier using K Mean, which predicts fraud and legitimate accounts, 0 and 1. This uses two features, let's say, A and B. Now, I want to use other features like C and D, to predict fraud and legitimate accounts. Can I use output class predicted in Kmeans, and use it as a label for logistics regression using features C and D? Sorry, if this sounds like dummy questions, I'm just starting into Data Science, so please let me know if I missed something fundamental.
