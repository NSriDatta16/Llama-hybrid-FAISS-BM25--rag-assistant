Estimating intercept term in simulation study

I am working on a simulation study in which I have generated data to mimic a scenario with treated and untreated members of a population along with a number of baseline covariates. I am using those covariates in a logistic regression model to determine treatment status, but need to set an intercept term for that model to induce a set, desired treatment prevalence in my study population. Through researching the best way to do this, it seems as though other simulation studies have used a bisection approach (or possibly a grid search) to achieve the same ends, but I am unclear on how to implement those methods for this purpose. I've been beating my head against this for days, any help would be greatly appreciated. Reference In the bottom of this paper, he reads in a value which he claims would be derived from a bisection approach, but does not detail how. This is what I am attempting to replicate.
