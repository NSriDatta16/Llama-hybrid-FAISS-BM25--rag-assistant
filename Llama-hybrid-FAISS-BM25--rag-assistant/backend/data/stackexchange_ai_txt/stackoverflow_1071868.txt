If you're not going to use this new XIB for navigation, there's no point in making a navigation controller. In interface builder, simply drag a UINavigationBar to the top of your view, and add a "Done" Button. Now, add an IBAction to the done button to dismiss the view controller. Your ViewController code for the dismiss IBAction should look something like this: -(IBAction)dismiss { //Any logic before dismissing the modal view [super dismissModalViewControllerAnimated:YES]; }
