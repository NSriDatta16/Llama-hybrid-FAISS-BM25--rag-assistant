Jeff's ultimate developer rig series is great, but it's out of date. If you want to build your own ultimate developer rig, you can do hours of research to get the perfect list or use the tricks below to come up with a great component list in a short time. Credits : Mehul taught me this method and it's a huge time-saver. The Basic PC Builder Shopping List Start with the basic system builder shopping list: Computer case Power supply Motherboard CPU Video card RAM Hard Drive DVD-ROM Monitors Optional: Extra fans Optional: Windows (This list is good for most of us. Add/remove for your specific needs.) The Short Version Make a wish list at NewEgg.com to track your component choices and estimate price. For each item on the shopping list above, go to the NewEgg.com category and list the top sellers sorted by most reviews. Read some reviews on the top 3 items listed and add one to your wish list. You may want to check Dell.com and deal sites for monitor options. When you're finished you'll have a solid list of great components that have been well reviewed by a large group of talented system builders. The Detailed Version Start at Gear Geek Heaven : Go to NewEgg.com, create an account and start a wish list to keep track of your selections. NewEgg.com selection, prices and service are good, but you don't have to buy at NewEgg.com. You're going to use the site to keep track of your component choices and get a good price estimate. Let the Wisdom of the Geeks Narrow Your Options The biggest problem with spec'ing a new developer rig is that there are too many options. To narrow your options, observe the behavior of a large group of hardware enthusiasts, record their preferences and use that data to guide your decision. (Everyone who comments at NewEgg.com isn't an expert, but there are many intelligent buyers here who write helpful reviews.) In other words, find the top selling and best reviewed items on NewEgg.com, a popular hardware site for system builders. Score = (Sales-Rank + Review-Count) * Rating * Price NewEgg.com is the right place to learn what the system builders are doing, but it's not obvious at first glance how to do that. You'll have to drill down a bit to see the top selling items. You also need something more helpful than just the top selling items, you want gear that's been used and reviewed by a large group of active and enthusiastic gear geeks so you'll want to factor in customer reviews, too. Find Top sellers in the item category, then sort by Most Reviews Use the NewEgg.com top level menu to navigate to the category for that item type. Then use the left sidebar menu to drill down to a little more specific sub-category. Click the Top Sellers link on the left sidebar to list the top selling items for that category. Then sort by "Most Reviews" by selecting the dropdown next to the search box on the upper right part of the page. Don't input any search text. Hands-On Example Example: On the top menu bar of NewEgg.com, select Computer Hardware/Motherboards then click a sub-category linke on the left sidebar like Intel Motherboards.In the sub-category, you should see an option on the left sidebar for "Top Sellers" select that link to list the top selling items in that category. The search listing should now show the top selling items in the category. Sort this listing by "Most Reviews". At the top of listings on the upper right is a search box, next to the search box is the dropdown box with the option, "Most Reviews". Leave the search box blank and select the "Most Reviews" sort option from the dropdown box. Down to the Finalists One of the 2 or 3 products at the top of the list should be a good choice for your new system. Scan the reviews to see if the general buzz makes you comfortable with the component. Use the sidebar links and search to filter the results if the top sellers are out of your price range or you need to refine the specs. Judge the Judges When you scan the item reviews look at the range of ratings, you want to see more than 100 reviews with mostly 4 and 5 star ratings. Steer clear of items that have a high average but also have a lot of low ratings. Avoid very new items and watch out for older items that are on special and may be closing out. You want something that's been out for 6 months or a year. The price will be lower and the reviews will be more realistic. Pro-Choice When you're satisified that the item is what you want and the price is right, add it to your wishlist. Foreach component in system-shopping-list do Repeat this process for each item. It's fast and fun. If item == Monitor { search("Dell.com") }; Dell often has good monitor specials, so you might want to check that site for monitors. The best Dell deals are usually found on sites like techbargains.com and DealFire.com. Go Forth and Multi-buy When you're finished you'll have a solid list of popular components that are favored by enthusiastic system builders that frequent NewEgg.com. Order them from NewEgg.com or your favorite dealer and get building!
