installing Lingotip translate on Magento; php version conflict; would like to override

I have just installed Magento ver. 1.4.1.1 on our Ubuntu dev server and am trying to install the Lingotip translation extension . I am receiving the error: magento-community/Lingotip_Translate requires PHP (version >= 5.0, version I think there must be a fairly simple way to comment out this check code to allow the .2-2 patch to work, but I am completely new to Magento and am unable to find it anywhere in the codebase. My question is, can someone show me either: 1) how to "override" this blocking code, or 2) how to install this "ready2paste" version of the lingotip code I found at the freegentoo site. Thank you!
