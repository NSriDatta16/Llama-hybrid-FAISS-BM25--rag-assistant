There are certain feature extraction algorithms in opencv library. Some of them are SURF or SIFT, HOG in opencv. Local Binary Pattern(LBP) in sklearn library in Python. One more technique is to create Bag of visual words. There also exists BOW class in opencv. To understand the concept of bag of visual words you can look for some of the research papers. SURF in opencv Python: surf = cv2.SURF(400) kp, des = surf.detectAndCompute(img,None) You can see the opencv documentation for more details. Similarly you can know about all other feature extraction methods. Here is one more blog regarding HOG feature extraction. Once you extract all your features from your training data-set images, you can use svm library of sklearn to train your classifier. There are plenty of resources out there that will help you start with ML in python.
