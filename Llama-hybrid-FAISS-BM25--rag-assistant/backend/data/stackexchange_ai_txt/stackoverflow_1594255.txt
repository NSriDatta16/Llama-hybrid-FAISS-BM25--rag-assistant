If your colleagues are clueless, then you might be able to convince them that ALL CAPS takes more storage, uses more power, and is more likely to get deleted. However, if they are as knowledgeable about filenames as you, there's little you can to get them to side with your preference . In this situation, I like to take the absurdist approach, to help my colleagues want to have a reasonable approach. I suggest you start naming files with CrAzY cAsE . After a few directories of CrAzY cAsE, your ALL CAPS colleagues and your lowercase colleagues will come to you and ask you to stop. You then say, Well we should have standard naming convention, I'm impartial to the results if we can agree on a standard . Then nudge the discussion toward lower case names, and declare that as the binding compromise.
