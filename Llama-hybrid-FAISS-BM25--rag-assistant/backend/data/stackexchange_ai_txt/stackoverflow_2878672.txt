Use a plain: download zipfile link. Then it'll work fine (“bullet proof” even) without JavaScript available. It also offers more of the traditional affordances users might expect from a download link, such as right-click-save-as, or drag-and-drop. You can of course use CSS to make it look like a button instead of a link. But what it actually is, is a link. So that's how it should be marked up.
