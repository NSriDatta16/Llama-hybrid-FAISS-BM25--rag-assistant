$q$ is the proposal distribution. I've only ever seen symmetric $q$, but it's okay to make it asymmetrical since you're dividing the ratio out in $\alpha$. It's normal to choose $q$ so that the chain converges more quickly. If $q$ is too wide, then you have a lot of rejected points, and if it's too narrow, it takes a long time to explore the high probability areas. $q$ has nothing to do with your $\pi$ or $f$ or $M$. The $f$ in step 3 is your Bayesian posterior (likelihood times prior). Changing $q$ should not affect your sampled distribution (if it does, that's a bad $q$, and you would have to pick a weird $q$ for that to happen.)
