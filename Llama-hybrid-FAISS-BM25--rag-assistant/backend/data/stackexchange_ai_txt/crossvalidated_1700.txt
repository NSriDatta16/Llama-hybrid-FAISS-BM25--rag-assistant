What you're discovering is a degree of instability in either the algorithm or the data itself. The approach termed 'consensus' or 'ensemble' clustering is a way of dealing with the problem. The problem there is: given a collection of clusterings, find a "consensus" clustering that is in some sense the "average" of the clusterings. There's a fair bit of work on this topic, and a good place to start is the clustering ensembles paper by Strehl and Ghosh .
