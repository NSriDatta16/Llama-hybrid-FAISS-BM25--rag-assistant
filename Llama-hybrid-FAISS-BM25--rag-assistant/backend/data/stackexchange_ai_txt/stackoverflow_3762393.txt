I use a builder that contains the default values, just like this: http://elegantcode.com/2008/04/26/test-data-builders-refined/ . Then the test only specifies the value it cares for: Customer customer = new CustomerBuilder() .WithFirstName("this test only cares about a special ' ... first name value"); After reading the other answers, I want to clear that its not for database data. Its to build the instances/data you pass to the classes you are unit testing. Its a matter of convenience/keeping the tests simple, plenty of times you are testing very specific behavior that depends on 1-3 fields and you don't care about the rest of the fields.
