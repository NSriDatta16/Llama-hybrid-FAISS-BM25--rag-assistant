Derek, there are several ways in which one can create a federated database. One is by using the federated database capability that is built in to DB2 Express-C. However, DB2 Express-C can only federate data from specific data sources i.e. other DB2 databases and industry standard web services. To add Sybase to this list you must purchase IBM Federation Server product. The other way is to leverage DB2 capability to create User Defined Functions in DB2 Express-C that use OLE DB API to access other data sources. Because OLE DB is a Windows-based technology, only DB2 servers running on Windows can do that. What you do is create a table UDF that you can then use anywhere you would expect to see a table result set e.g view definition. For example, you could define a view that uses your UDF to materialize the results. These results would come from a query (via OLE DB) of your Sybase data (or any other OLE DB compliant data source).
