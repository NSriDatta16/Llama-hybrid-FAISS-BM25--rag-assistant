Base32 encoding (and Base64) encoding is motivated by situations where you need to encode unrestricted binary within a storage or transport system that allow only data of a certain form such as plain text. Examples include passing data through URLs, XML, or JSON data, all of which are plain text sort of formats that don't otherwise permit or support arbitrary binary data.
