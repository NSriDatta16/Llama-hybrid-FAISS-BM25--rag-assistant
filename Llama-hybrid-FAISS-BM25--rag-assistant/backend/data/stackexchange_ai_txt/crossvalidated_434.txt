Very crudely I would say that: Frequentist: Sampling is infinite and decision rules can be sharp. Data are a repeatable random sample - there is a frequency. Underlying parameters are fixed i.e. they remain constant during this repeatable sampling process. Bayesian: Unknown quantities are treated probabilistically and the state of the world can always be updated. Data are observed from the realised sample. Parameters are unknown and described probabilistically. It is the data which are fixed. There is a brilliant blog post which gives an indepth example of how a Bayesian and Frequentist would tackle the same problem. Why not answer the problem for yourself and then check? The problem (taken from Panos Ipeirotis' blog): You have a coin that when flipped ends up head with probability $p$ and ends up tail with probability $1-p$ . (The value of $p$ is unknown.) Trying to estimate $p$ , you flip the coin 100 times. It ends up head 71 times. Then you have to decide on the following event: "In the next two tosses we will get two heads in a row." Would you bet that the event will happen or that it will not happen?
