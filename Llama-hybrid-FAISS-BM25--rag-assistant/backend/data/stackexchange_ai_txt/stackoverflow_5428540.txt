It should also work if you make this adjustment to your code where you re-assign the value of nextNode back to (*node)->next since you passed that value by reference to the recursive function call (and therefore it was modified during the later recursive calls): void addRecursion(lnode **node, lnode *newNode) { if(*node == NULL) { *node = newNode; return; } lnode *nextNode = (*node)->next; addRecursion(&nextNode, newNode); (*node)->next = nextNode; //Add this line to re-connect the link } Chris's version above is a bit cleaner though since it axes out two assignments and in doing so also saves some space on the stack since there is no storage required for the local pointer variable nextNode .
