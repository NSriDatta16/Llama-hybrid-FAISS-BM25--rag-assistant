Flurry does it automatically (if you have it running). However, the error reporting is lame. They only catch the message w/o giving you the stack trace, so you may end up seeing (for example) that people are getting lots of NullPointerException s, but you won't have any idea where, or how, they're happening. If you try to do it yourself with the FlurryAgent.onEvent() method you'll quickly discover that they limit you to 255 characters. If you need detailed error reporting it really is better to roll your own right now.
