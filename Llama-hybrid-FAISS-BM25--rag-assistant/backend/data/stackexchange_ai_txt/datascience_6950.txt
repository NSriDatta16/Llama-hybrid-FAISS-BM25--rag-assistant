How does Performance function classify predictions as positive or negative? Package:ROCR

I'm performing a logistic regression on my training data. I used the glm function to get the model m . Now using the below codes from this link , I calculated AUC $test\$score $pred $perf where score is the dependent variable ( 0 or 1 ). To score the tpr (True positive rate) and fpr (False positive rate), you have to classify the predicted probabilities into 1 or 0. What is the cutoff used for that? how can we change it? Could not find anything useful in this main documentation as well.
