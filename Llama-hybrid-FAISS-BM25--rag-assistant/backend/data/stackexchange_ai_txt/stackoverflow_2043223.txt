The worm had several approaches to infecting new systems, including the sendmail and finger vulnerabilities, but also password guessing. (The sendmail vulnerability was not a code vulnerability, but a backdoor that could be enabled in the sendmail.cf file.) The original goal appears to have been to have a low, stealthy attack which ended up with the program running on many different servers without the owners realizing what was happening. The coding error wasn't the pleasequit variable, but the fact that the worm re-infected systems that even appeared to be already infected. This caused infected machines to get multiple infections and then to crash. Therefore, the answer that has been accepted as correct (by T.E.D.) is actually not correct, because the worm continued to infect systems that were uninfected. What caused the infection to stop was that systems which were vulnerable were taken off the Internet. Unfortunately, many organizations at the time responded by cutting their Internet connections, which actually made it harder for them to find out what was going wrong and fix the situation. It is also incorrect to say that the system could only infect "old Sun3 systems or Vaxen." At the time of the Worm it was infecting the state-of-the-art systems that were in use. The worm was particularly clever in that it carried machine-language exploits for two different architectures (Sun3 was 68K, Vax was its own architecture). The worm attacks the current versions of the operating systems---what we would call "0 Day" vulnerabilities today. Morris had previously publicized one of the vulnerabilities that the worm exploited on a mailing list and people had pretty much ignored him, saying that the vulnerability was not significant. It appears that the worm was done as a publicity stunt to get people's attention on some important computer security problems. After the worm was released and got out of control it appears that he publicized information on how to stop it, but that information could not get out fast enough because the internet was clogged.
