Starting programming Mac OS X

I'm starting a Mac OS X app that will connect to a small website I'm currently developing. The idea is that the app will store a number of snippets on a local database and then sync with the website whenever it can. So my questions are: Carbon or Cocoa? SQLite for local storage / another solution? Is there any decent free text-editor control with basic syntax highlighting to embed on the app?
