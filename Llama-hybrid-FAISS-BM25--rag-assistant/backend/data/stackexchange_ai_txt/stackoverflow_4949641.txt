What about the averaged difference of the two? I would recommend giving the difference in height a higher weight since 6" of difference is much more drastic than 6 lbs of difference. Example: SELECT * FROM table ORDER BY ABS(weight - @weight) + ABS(height - @height)*3 This is just me taking a swing at trying to make the difference in height more important. In this example I am giving it a weight of 3. This example assumes a person's height is in inches... If you have it in centimeters or something it might work better.
