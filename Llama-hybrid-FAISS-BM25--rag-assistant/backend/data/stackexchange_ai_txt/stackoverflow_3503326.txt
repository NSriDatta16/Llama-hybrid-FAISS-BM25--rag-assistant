I worked at a place that had several hundred tables (near 1k) and no one really knew what was going on in the system, company was growing and hiring a lot. A guy was tasked with doing a diagram, and he auto-magically created a gigantic tiled poster that contained every table with lines connecting various tables (going all over the place). I'm not sure what he used, it was Unix and Oracle years ago (way before Linux and open source). There was no real rhyme or reason to the layout of the the tables in his diagram. He had successfully created a diagram of every table. The "poster" was put on a wall in a common area, and got a few looks, but no one ever really used it, it was unusable, too cluttered, too unorganized. As a result, I used MS-Word to create a single page diagram containing the 20 main tables (it went through a few iterations as I "discovered" new main tables) with lines for each foreign key and each table located in a logical manner. I showed the column name, data type, nullability, PK, and all FKs. I put my diagram up on my wall by my monitor. Eventually everyone wanted a copy of my diagram, including the person that made the "poster". When I left that job they were still giving my diagram to new hires. I recommend that you work like an explorer, find the key tables and map them as you go, making as many specific diagrams as necessary as you discover the system. Trying to make a gigantic "poster" automatically will not work very well.
