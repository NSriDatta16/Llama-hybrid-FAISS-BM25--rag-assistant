R u looking for end of day data. If that is the case, you can compose url for bhavcopy or historical data between two dates (there is a limit for duration. I think 3 years or so). Interesting thing is, while you download historical data from nseindia, pay attention to the link they have provided while downloading zip data, copy it, modify it to fit your date range, hit it. this way you can automate the download of historical data from nseindia. In fact we are using the same for http://kakup.com ofcourse, we convert it to metastock format also. its working fine.
