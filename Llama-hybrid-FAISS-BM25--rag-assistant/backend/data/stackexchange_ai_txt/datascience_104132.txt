Since your text data is sequential in nature best is to opt for sequential classification, below papers and tutorial for more information. A Brief Survey on Sequence Classification : This paper discusses on several extensions of (conventional) sequence classification Sequence Classification with LSTM Recurrent Neural Networks in Python with Keras : Sequence classification is a predictive modeling problem where you have some sequence of inputs over space or time and the task is to predict a category for the sequence. Here LSTM model is used for sequence classification. Time-evolving Text Classification with Deep Neural Networks : paper explores evolutionary neural network models for time-evolving text classification Sequential Pattern Mining Algorithm Based on Text Data: Taking the Fault Text Records as an Example this paper has used sequential mining text algorithm to mine fault sequential patterns in text data. You can use this Sequential Learning of Convolutional Features for Effective Text Classification : this paper proposes Sequential Convolutional Attentive Recurrent Network (SCARN). The proposed SCARN model utilizes both the advantages of recurrent and convolutional structures efficiently in comparison to previously proposed recurrent convolutional models.
