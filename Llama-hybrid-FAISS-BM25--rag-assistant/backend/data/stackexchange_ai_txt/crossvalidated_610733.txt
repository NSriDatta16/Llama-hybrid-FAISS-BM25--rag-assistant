How Can One Test for Significance of a Particular Lag of Coefficient of ACF and PACF of Time Series Data Using R

I have this time series data presented in the R code below, I want to test for the significance of the first and second lag of auto-correlation and partial auto-correlation coefficient. ts I understand that one can test for the significance of the whole group of lags of and as follows: forecast::ggAcf(ts) + ggplot2::theme_bw() forecast::ggPacf(ts) + ggplot2::theme_bw() The reason why I need this is to specifically check if the second lag coefficient of PACF is actually significant because the auto.arima() function of the forecast package suggests that the model is ARIMA(0,0,1) while the interpretation of the ACF and PACF suggests ARIMA(2,0,1) (ts_mod
