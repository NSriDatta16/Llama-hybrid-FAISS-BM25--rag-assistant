I haven't seen your repost on Cross Validated or Data Science, so I'll offer an answer here. Your problem seems like a good fit for Bayesian modeling. A priori, you start off with a distribution over $\lambda$, the parameter for your Poisson distribution, representing your beliefs in what number of tweets are likely. As you receive information, you can use Bayes rule to update your beliefs in $\lambda$, allowing you to incorporate events or a particularly active week. $$P(\lambda | events) = \frac{P(events | \lambda) P(\lambda)}{P(events)$$
