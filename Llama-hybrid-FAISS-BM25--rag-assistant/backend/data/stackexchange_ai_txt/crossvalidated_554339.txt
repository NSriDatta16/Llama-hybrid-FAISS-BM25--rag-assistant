Can I compare the output probabilities of two machine learning models?

I'm sorry if this is a silly question. Suppose there are two logistic regression models $M_1$ and $M_2$ trained on the same (or similar) dataset, and their outputs of given input $x$ are $P_{M_1}(y \mid x)$ and $P_{M_2}(y \mid x)$ , respectively. What I feel confused about is, for any given input $x$ , could I determine which model's prediction is more reliable by comparing this output probability? For example, if $P_{M_1}(y=k \mid x) > P_{M_2}(y=k \mid x)$ , then the output of $M_1$ is more reliable? If cannot, how to compare these two models and make a decision that which one should be chosen?
