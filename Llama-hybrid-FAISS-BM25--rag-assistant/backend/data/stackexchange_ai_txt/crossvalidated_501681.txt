The meta-regression model fitted via rma() assumes that there is one common $\tau^2$ value within the subgroups, while metagen() with byvar allows $\tau^2$ to differ between subgroups. An illustration: library(metafor) library(meta) dat $sei vi) First, we fit the meta-regression model with rma() . I will remove the intercept term, so that the model coefficients are the estimated average effects for each level of the moderator: rma(yi, vi, data=dat, mods = ~ 0 + alloc) These are the results: Mixed-Effects Model (k = 13; tau^2 estimator: REML) tau^2 (estimated amount of residual heterogeneity): 0.3615 (SE = 0.2111) tau (square root of estimated tau^2 value): 0.6013 I^2 (residual heterogeneity / unaccounted variability): 88.77% H^2 (unaccounted variability / sampling variability): 8.91 Test for Residual Heterogeneity: QE(df = 10) = 132.3676, p-val Now the same analysis using metagen() : metagen(yi, sei, data=dat, comb.fixed=FALSE, method.tau="REML", byvar=alloc) These are the results: Number of studies combined: k = 13 95%-CI z p-value Random effects model -0.7145 [-1.0669; -0.3622] -3.97 We see minor differences between the Model Results versus the Results for subgroups output. One can fit a meta-regression model that allows for different $\tau^2$ values across subgroups with: rma.mv(yi, vi, data=dat, mods = ~ 0 + alloc, random = ~ alloc | trial, struct="DIAG") The results are then: Multivariate Meta-Analysis Model (k = 13; method: REML) Variance Components: outer factor: trial (nlvls = 13) inner factor: alloc (nlvls = 3) estim sqrt k.lvl fixed level tau^2.1 0.1326 0.3641 2 no alternate tau^2.2 0.3925 0.6265 7 no random tau^2.3 0.4003 0.6327 4 no systematic Test for Residual Heterogeneity: QE(df = 10) = 132.3676, p-val These results are now identical to the ones from metagen() .
