Armed with the extra bit of information from ysth, I was able to see the differences in the docs: The base pragma does the following things: adds the named package to @ISA loads the module with the same name as the named package using require (unless it detects that the package has already been loaded) won't fail if a module with the same name as the package doesn't exist dies if there are no symbols in the named package if $VERSION does not exist in named package, base sets it to "-1, set by base.pm" initializes the fields of the named package if they exist does not call the import function of the named package The parent pragma does the following things: adds the named package to @ISA loads the module with the same name as the named package using require accepts an option that tells it not to die if a module with the same name as the package doesn't exist
