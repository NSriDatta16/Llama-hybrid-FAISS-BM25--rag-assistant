Randomized studies are prospective studies whereas you are describing a retrospective study. To answer your question: no. When you randomize, you have to ask what somebody is randomized to/for. Randomization involves administering some sort of experimental condition, such as receiving an intervention, or a drug, or a survey prototype versus some appropriate form of control: no intervention, standard care, or the usual survey instrument. There is however, some very advanced work about the relationship between retrospective studies and randomized studies in this regard. If the experimental condition is a binary 0/1 effect, and you have information on the predictors of whether a participant receives the condition or not, propensity matching achieves an analysis sample that has all the properties of a randomized cohort: balanced predictors, no lurking variables, and so on. This is as close as you can get to a "randomized retrospective study". There are a lot of assumptions with that method: virtually all such analyses devote significant attention to the predictors to the receipt of experimental condition: through a scientific (not statistical) approach and across several studies before justifying propensity weighting as an appropriate analysis.
