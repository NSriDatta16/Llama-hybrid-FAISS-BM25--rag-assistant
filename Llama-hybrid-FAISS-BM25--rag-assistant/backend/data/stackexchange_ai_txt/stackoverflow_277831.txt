FWIW, it’s also print 4 x 4 in Perl. In general, in Perl, operators are monomorphic, ie. you have different sets of operators for string semantics, for numeric semantics, for bitwise semantics, etc., where it makes sense, and the type of the operands largely doesn’t matter. When you apply a numeric operator to a string, the string is converted to a number first and you get the operation you asked for (eg. multiplication), and when you apply a string operator to a number, it’s turned into a string and you get the operation you asked for (eg. repetition). Perl pays attention to the operator first and the types of the operands only second – if indeed it pays them any mind at all. This is the opposite of Python and most other languages, where you use one set of operators, and the types of the operands determine which semantics you’ll actually get – ie. operators are polymorphic.
