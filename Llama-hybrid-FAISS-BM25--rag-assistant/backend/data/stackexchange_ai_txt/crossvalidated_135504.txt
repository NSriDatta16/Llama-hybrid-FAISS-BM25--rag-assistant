I have been searching for a while for a LTA implementation in R, so this is what I found: LTA is the name for a particular class of discrete-time Hidden Markov Models where both the latent and the manifest variables are categorical. So, as a matter of fact, you could use R-packages dealing with these class of models, in particular "depmixs4". However, I recently found package "LMest" which is specifically designed for LTA. It includes some of the latest results on this specific field (see e.g. recent works of Vermunt or Bartolucci). For example: Both the manifest and latent distributions can be parameterized so as to include individual covariates, Mixed LTA can be estimated (i.e., a mixture of Markov Chains as mixing ditribution instead of a simple Markov Chain), Viterbi's algorithm is implemented in order to estimate the highest posterior latent statuses The only con I have found is that it seems to me a little slower than proc lta in SAS
