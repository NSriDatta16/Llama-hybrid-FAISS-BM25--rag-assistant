Resizable Textarea Like on SO using Vanilla Javascript

I'm basically looking to duplicate the functionality of the draggable resize function of the textareas here on SO. I know SO uses the jQuery plugin TextAreaResizer to accomplish this, but I want to use straight vanilla javascript so that I can learn how it actually works.
