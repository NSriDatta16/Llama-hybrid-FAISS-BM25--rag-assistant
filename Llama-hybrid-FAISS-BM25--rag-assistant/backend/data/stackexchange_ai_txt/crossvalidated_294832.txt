You know without a doubt that at time $t=1$ the person is not infected, so $P(Y_1 = N) = 1$. Maybe you are used to seeing a Markov chain start with an initial distribution that's not just a point mass at one value but a deterministic start is perfectly reasonable. For the transition matrix, let $\Omega = \{I, N\}$ denote the set of possible values. You have one conditional distribution per value in $\Omega$, each distribution specifies $|\Omega|$ probabilities, and the distributions do not change over time, so you'll need to have $|\Omega|^2$ probabilities specified which is what is accomplished by your $2 \times 2$ transition matrix. So there's no way that does not involve specifying 4 probabilities. This matrix is unique up to relabeling of the states. Finally, you need to compute $P(Y_4 = N)$. Here is how I would do it: you know that $Y_t = I \implies Y_k = I$ for all $k \geq t$ so the event $\{Y_t = N\}$ is equivalent to the event $\{Y_1 = N, \dots, Y_t = N\}$. This means $$ P(Y_4 = N) = P(Y_1 = N, Y_2 = N, Y_3 = N, Y_4 = N) \\ = P(Y_4 = N | Y_3 = N)P(Y_3 = N | Y_2 = N)P(Y_2 = N | Y_1 = N)P(Y_1 = N) \\ = (0.8)^3 \times 1 = 0.512 $$ which agrees with your computation. You got the right answer but if I can avoid computing powers of matrices by hand I try to do so, and since we have $P(Y_t = N | Y_{t-1} = I) = 0$ the computations simplify to the point that we can get away with this more direct approach. But in total generality you would indeed need to compute powers of matrices.
