Magento Block Injction via module.xml Files

In a module I am writing I want to use using mymodule.xml to insert my own block after this block: which is nested within as can be seen in app/design/frontend/base/default/layout/catalog.xml I have tried many variants such as: and just and but I cant seem to find the correct combination. the only one that renders my block is: but obviously it is not placed where I wanted it to be placed.
