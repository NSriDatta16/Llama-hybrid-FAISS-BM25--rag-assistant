If you can get some javascript into the masterpage, I came up with this little hack. It does have a couple downsides in that MS could potentially releaase a hotfix or service pack that either: changes the name of the "Use a Meeting Workspace to organize attendees, agendas, documents, minutes, and other details for this event" checkbox such that the string "CrossProjectLinkField" is no longer in the name, or... they could use that same string in the name of some other input element on some other OOTB markup In the ladder case (which I'm not entirely certain is false right now), these inputs would get disabled if they were sporting a masterpage that ran this script. But this is a risk I can deal with. You run these risks anytime you depend upon client ids and names being emitted by someone else's control. var anchors = document.getElementsByTagName('input'); for(var i=0;i What this does is find the checkbox that allows users to create meeting workspaces and disables it so that they cannot check it. Problem solved!
