As Dave mentioned above, ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) might be a starting point for what you're looking for. This technique will help you identify differences between the variances by looking at the variation both between and within groups. To help you get started, I generated some data with three directors (A, B and C) with random cut counts, with some variation among the directors: > set.seed(123) > n = 100 > cuts = rpois(n, 2) > dirs = factor(sample(paste("Director", LETTERS[1:3]), n, replace = TRUE)) ## Introduce variation by adding random counts to directors A and B with different expected values. > flag_dir_a = (dirs == "Director A") > cuts[flag_dir_a] = cuts[flag_dir_a] + rpois(sum(flag_dir_a), 5) > flag_dir_b = (dirs == "Director B") > cuts[flag_dir_b] = cuts[flag_dir_b] + rpois(sum(flag_dir_b), 1) ## Create a dataframe using the simulated data above. > dat = data.frame(director = dirs, cuts = cuts) > head(dat) director cuts 1 Director A 6 2 Director B 3 3 Director A 8 4 Director B 4 5 Director A 7 6 Director C 0 If we look at the mean cuts by director, we will observe some variation (by construction): > with(dat, tapply(cuts, director, mean)) Director A Director B Director C 7.538462 2.846154 2.171429 The standard deviations also vary: > with(dat, tapply(cuts, director, sd)) Director A Director B Director C 2.453255 1.581779 1.635735 We can check this visually as well: with(dat, boxplot(cuts ~ director)) You could then run an ANOVA analysis. The output below tells you that a significant effect has been detected (p-value associated with the F-statistic is less than 0.05) - i.e. there is a significant evidence to reject the null hypothesis that all directors' average cut counts are equal (of course, we already knew this). > aov(cuts ~ director, dat) Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(>F) director 2 491.6 245.80 70.85 Finally, since ANOVA is just a type of linear model, you could fit a linear regression model to assess the model fit. > mod_lm = lm(cuts ~ director, data = dat) > summary(mod_lm) Call: lm(formula = cuts ~ director, data = dat) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -3.5385 -1.1714 -0.1714 1.1538 5.4615 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 7.5385 0.3653 20.64 Hope this helps. Edited : Using your data, we can see: and the ANOVA output is: Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(>F) director 6 79.87 13.312 4.977 0.000444 *** Residuals 51 136.40 2.674 --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 Now, whilst the cut/minute isn't distributed normally, I think ANOVA is fairly robust against non-normality as long as there are no gross outliers in the data. If you're concerned about non-normality then you could consider an alternative, non-parametric test such as Kruskal-Wallis. The null hypothesis (against which we have significant evidence below) here is that cut/minute are identically distributed among the directors. > kruskal.test(cuts ~ director, data = dat) data: cuts by director Kruskal-Wallis chi-squared = 16.995, df = 6, p-value = 0.0093
