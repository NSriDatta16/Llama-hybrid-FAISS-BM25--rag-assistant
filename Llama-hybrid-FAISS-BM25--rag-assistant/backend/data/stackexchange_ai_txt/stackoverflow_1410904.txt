If you are talking winforms; simply drag the radio button controls into the GroupBox in the forms designer. If you want to add them programmatically, something like this should work: RadioButton rb = new RadioButton(); rb.Text = "Some text"; myGroupBox.Controls.Add(rb); rb.Location = new Point(someX, someY); // repeat as necessary
