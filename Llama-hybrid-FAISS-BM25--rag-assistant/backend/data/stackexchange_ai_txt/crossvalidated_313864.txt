Rationale behind Spencer’s and Henderson’s weighted mov­ing average weights

I saw Spencer’s and Henderson’s weighted mov­ing averages described in several places, but neither of the sources went into details. As I understand, both methods are designed in such way, so that if the underlying series could be described as polynomials up to 3-degree, then the smoothing procedure would lead to least possible distortion in the values (e.g. Hyndman, 2009, in short Moving averages paper). Could someone describe this in a greater detail? How the weights were derived? Why would we consider them as optimal? When shouldn't we use them?
