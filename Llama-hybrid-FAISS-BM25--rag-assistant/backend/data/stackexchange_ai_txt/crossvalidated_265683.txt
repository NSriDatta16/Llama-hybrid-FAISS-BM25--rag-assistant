I'd be really uncomfortable with a correlation between a(n average of) continuous variable and a percentage, because the percentage is bounded by $[0,100]$. So if the percentage is near these boundaries, the relation (i.e. correlation) between the two is bound to be non-linear. A more suitable way of associating one continuous and a categorical variable is, for example, through regression.
