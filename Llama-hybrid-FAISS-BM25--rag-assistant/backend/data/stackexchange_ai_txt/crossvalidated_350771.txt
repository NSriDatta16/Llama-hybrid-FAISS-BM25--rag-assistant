This is really to broad, you did not even tell us what is your purpose in modeling, and an answer surely must depend on that! There is a lot of relevant Q&A here, a short list: Stabilize variance: Why do we stabilize variance? Transforming and then using a linear model might be simpler to present to certain audiences than using a GLM: Why is GLM different than an LM with transformed variable Time series modeling is simpler with constant variance: When to log transform a time series before fitting an ARIMA model Many reasons to use a log transform: In linear regression, when is it appropriate to use the log of an independent variable instead of the actual values? and When (and why) should you take the log of a distribution (of numbers)? Some ideas on transformations and machine learning: Why aren't power or log transformations taught much in machine learning? To satisfy modeling assumptions: Practically speaking, how do people handle ANOVA when the data doesn't quite meet assumptions? Why (or not) use the square-root transform: Why is the square root transformation recommended for count data? Is it really a good idea to arcsine-transform binomial data? Are ecologists the only ones who didn't know that the arcsine is asinine? or Can I use a binomial model with logit link function when dealing with continuous proportions? Why using Box-Cox transform: How is the box cox transformation valid? and Box Cox Transforms for regression Transformations and principal component analysis: Why log-transforming the data before performing principal component analysis? A good alternative to transform predictor variables in regression models is the use of splines . Examples can be found from Help me fit this non-linear multiple regression that has defied all previous efforts ... and certainly a lot of other reasons. To get some more specific answer you will need to tell us more about your situation!
