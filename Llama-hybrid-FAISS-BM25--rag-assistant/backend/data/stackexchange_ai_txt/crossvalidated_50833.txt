Bacon answered this question a few centuries ago in Novum Organum . To paraphrase: To do science is to search for repeated patterns. To detect anomalies is to identify values that do not follow repeated patterns. "For whoever knows the ways of Nature will more" easily notice her deviations and, on the other hand, whoever knows her deviations "will more accurately describe her ways." One learns the rules by observing when the current rules fail. In summary, build a model for your data using both user-specified variables and variables that can be suggested by residual diagnostic checking (in time series that would be level shifts, local time time trends, seasonal pulses, changes in parameters, or changes in variance). After forming a useful model, evaluate/scrutinize the residuals for unusual patterns; perhaps activity before and after known events. In this way you can iterate to identifying anomalous data.
