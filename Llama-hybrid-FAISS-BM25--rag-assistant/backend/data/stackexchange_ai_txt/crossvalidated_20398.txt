I would not necessarily assert that those are the subdivisions present in statistics. If pressed, I'd argue that Frequentist versus Bayesian is the most clear division, although even that gets somewhat fuzzy at the edge cases and most people in practice seem to be a mix of the two. Robust and parametric/non-parametric aren't really divisions as much as different tools for different problems. Admittedly, there are people who only work in problems that lend themselves to one or the other, but that's people, not the actual statistics - and I'd argue not even most people. To use an example, I'd argue there's no "Subdivision in carpentry" between hammers and screw drivers, even though I know a guy who hates using nails. I'd say the far more profound division in statistics is how its viewed from the perspective of a mathematician versus a dedicated statistician versus a statistically-literate applied researcher. To answer the second bit of your question: Sometimes There are times when you must use one method - because that method was designed to work when others fail. Exact statistics come to mind. But there are many, many questions where multiple approaches work. For example, a project I'm working on could be approached using either Bayesian or Frequentist methods, and use either a parametric, semi-parametric or non-parametric approach. That's six possible combinations of tools, and credible arguments for each. In the end, I chose the method that would be the most useful for me, in this project .
