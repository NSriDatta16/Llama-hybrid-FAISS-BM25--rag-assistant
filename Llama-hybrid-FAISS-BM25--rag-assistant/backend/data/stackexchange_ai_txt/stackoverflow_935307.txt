Im not sure what is happening, since I'm not familiar enough with mySql, but I always prefer to name columns like SystemID and OrganizationID and not gernically like "ID". Naming your columns this way, would result in PK-FK combinations that have the same name: bad PK-FK names good PK-FK names system system id SystemID systemName systemName idOrganization OrganizationID
