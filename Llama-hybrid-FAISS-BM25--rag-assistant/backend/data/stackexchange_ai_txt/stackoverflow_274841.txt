How can I correctly downcast the pointer from void* to TMemo* in C++Builder2009?

I am writing multi-thread socket chat in C++Builder 2009. It is almost complete in accordance with what I need to do but I have a little problem. I need to pass the TMemo* pointer into CreateThread WinAPI function which upcasts it to void*. I tryed this way: HANDLE xxx = MemoChat->Handle; hNetThread = CreateThread(NULL, 0, NetThread, xxx, 0, &dwNetThreadId); //... and then, in NetThread function, TMemo* MyMemo((HANDLE)lpParam); TMemo* MyMemo((TMemo*)lpParam); but it didn`t work:( The question is how I can really downcast it correctly so I can use my Memo Component in this new thread?
