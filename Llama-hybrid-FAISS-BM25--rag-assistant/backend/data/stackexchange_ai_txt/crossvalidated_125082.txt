Machine learning : learn feature value range for a classification

Which domain the problem belongs to? Given a set of products some are classified as cheap and some not. The task is to determine the price range (probablistic) for cheap products ? Supervised classifiers arrive at a function and can classify a new instance but does not provide the range of feature values. This seems like a pattern recognition problem but I am not able to get which class of problems it belongs to. reading more about this, could this be a rule mining problem?
