Passing youtube video id from video feed to flash

I'm working on a flash web application (Actionscript 2.0) for my honours project but am having trouble embedding youtube videos. Basically the user selects symbols which queries the youtube api with certain tags depending on the symbols chosenand a random video is then picked from the first 30 videos. I have this working using the following code: on (release) { url="http://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/videos?q=danger+passion&orderby=published&start-index="+random(30)+"&max-results=1&v=2" getURL(url); } but this just displays a webpage with a link to the youtube video. This is the code I'll be using as the foundations for the player: // create a MovieClip to load the player into var ytplayer:MovieClip = _root.createEmptyMovieClip("ytplayer", 1); // create a listener object for the MovieClipLoader to use var ytPlayerLoaderListener:Object = { onLoadInit: function() { // When the player clip first loads, we start an interval to // check for when the player is ready loadInterval = setInterval(checkPlayerLoaded, 250); } }; var loadInterval:Number; function checkPlayerLoaded():Void { // once the player is ready, we can subscribe to events, or in the case of // the chromeless player, we could load videos if (ytplayer.isPlayerLoaded()) { ytplayer.addEventListener("onStateChange", onPlayerStateChange); ytplayer.addEventListener("onError", onPlayerError); clearInterval(loadInterval); } } function onPlayerStateChange(newState:Number) { trace("New player state: "+ newState); } function onPlayerError(errorCode:Number) { trace("An error occurred: "+ errorCode); } // create a MovieClipLoader to handle the loading of the player var ytPlayerLoader:MovieClipLoader = new MovieClipLoader(); ytPlayerLoader.addListener(ytPlayerLoaderListener); // load the player ytPlayerLoader.loadClip("http://www.youtube.com/v/pv5zWaTEVkI", ytplayer); can anyone help me on how to get the id of the video (for example: pv5zWaTEVkI) from the feed? Or how to send a query from flash which will return the video url/id as opposed to the url of a feed. Any help would be much appreciated as my hand in rather soon. Thanks
