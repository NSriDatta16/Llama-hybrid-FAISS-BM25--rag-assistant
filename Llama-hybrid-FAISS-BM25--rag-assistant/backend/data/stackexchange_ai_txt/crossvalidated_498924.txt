Simply put the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) tries to model a time series where your time series in question, y, can be explained by its own lagged values (Autoregressive part) and error terms (Moving Average part). The "Integrated" part of the model (the "I" in "ARIMA") refers to how many times the series has been differenced to achieve stationarity. Stationarity is a must before you can model your data: what stationarity refers to is constant mean and variance. Think of these two moments as not being time dependent. The reason for this is quite simple, it's difficult to model something which changes over time. So your ARMA model or order (1,12) is an AR(1)+MA(12) model: it is modelled by 1 lagged value and 12 error terms. I can't speak about your data but I think it sounds like a lot of parameters (possibly overfitted). Hope this helps.
