Mysql improve SELECT speed

I'm currently trying to improve the speed of SELECTS for a MySQL table and would appreciate any suggestions on ways to improve it. We have over 300 million records in the table and the table has the structure tag, date, value. The primary key is a combined key of tag and date. The table contains information for about 600 unique tags most containing an average of about 400,000 rows but can range from 2000 to over 11 million rows. The queries run against the table are: SELECT date, value FROM table WHERE tag = "a" AND date BETWEEN 'x' and 'y' ORDER BY date ....and there are very few if any INSERTS. I have tried partitioning the data by tag into various number of partitions but this seems to have little increase in speed.
