Stationarity in quarterly overlapping data

If I have a time series of quarterly default rates (e.g. of mortgages), by definition they will be 75% correlated, thus leading in non stationarity. What should I do in this case? Can I ignore lags up to 4 due to the structure of the data? Or should I handle it differently due to the fact that they are non stationary?
