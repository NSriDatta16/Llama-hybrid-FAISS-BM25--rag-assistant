How to deal with the difference in the range of Dependent variable in Train and Test data

I am training a XGBoost model for predicting number of applications and the minimum number of applications in training data is 40 and the maximum number of applications is 2000, while in test set minimum number of applications in training data is 400 and the maximum number of applications is 800. Hence the model is getting confused while predicting the value. Any suggestions on how should I solve this issue?
