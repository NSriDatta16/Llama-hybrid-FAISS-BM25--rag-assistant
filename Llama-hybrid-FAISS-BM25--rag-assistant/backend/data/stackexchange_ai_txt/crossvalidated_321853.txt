Many sparse and many dense features in Random Forest

I have a large dataset (approx. 400,000 rows, 650 columns). Out of this 650 columns, 500 are dense (nonzero over 10%) and 150 are sparse (nonzero less than 10%). As expected, the random forest has difficulty selecting the sparse features for any splits, while they are expected to hold at least some predictive power (A forest with only these features can obtain a gini of 0.2). My initial thought was to apply another algorithm than a random forest, but e.g. a neural network seems to perform worse than a forest based algorithm here. (I am still considering to try other models, but curious if I can tackle this in some way with a RF.) A second thought was to apply PCA to the sparse features to obtain a smaller set of features, and include those together with the dense features in a random forest. However, because of the large amount of zero's, one component already captures >99.99% of the variance. Does anyone have other suggestions for approaching this issue? Thanks, Florian
