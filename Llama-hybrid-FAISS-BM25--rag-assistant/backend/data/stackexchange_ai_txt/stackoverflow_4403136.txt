Vertical alignment not working in composite mode

The following should work according to the documentation but it's not working for me. Am I missing something? PdfPTable rs1 = new PdfPTable(1); PdfPCell c = new PdfPCell(); Paragraph p = new Paragraph("some text to align"); c.AddElement(p); c.VerticalAlignment = Element.ALIGN_MIDDLE; rs1.AddCell(c); rs1.AddCell("more text"); return rs1;
