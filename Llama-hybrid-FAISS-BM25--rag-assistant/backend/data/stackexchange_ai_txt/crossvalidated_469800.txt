In case it's of use to anybody in future, the two changes that finally helped the model both avoid mode collapse and converge were: 1) adding more filters to my Generator, and 2) adding dropout (0.2) to my Discriminator. I'd seen the general advice of strengthening the Generator in several articles/posts on GAN training tips, but I only found one post that specifically mentioned adding dropout, which turned out to be the most significant change.
