The query will inevitably return duplicate data as you say, you have to organize them after you get the result like this $buildings = array(); foreach ( $result_object as $organization ) { $building_data = array( 'building_name' => $organization->building_name, 'address' => $organization->address, ); $buildings[$organization->organization_name][] = $building_data; } this way organizations will be "compacted" in the first key of the multidimensional array, and one level deeper you will have info about the buildings. Hope this helps.
