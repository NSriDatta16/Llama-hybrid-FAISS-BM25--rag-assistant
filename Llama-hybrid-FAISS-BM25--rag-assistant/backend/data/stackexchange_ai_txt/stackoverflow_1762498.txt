I would get them to implement something themselves, then experiment with different variations until they understand it. Learning by doing is almost always the better option with programming. For example, get them to make a template which compares two values and returns the higher one. Then have them see has passing ints or doubles or whatever still allows it to work. Then get them to tweak the the code / copy it and have it return the minimum value. Again, experiment with variations - will the template allow them to pass an int and a double, or will it complain? From there, you can have them pass in arrays of whatever type (int, double etc), and have it sort the array from highest to lowest, again encouraging experimentation. From there, start to move into templated class definitions, using the same kind of ideas but on a larger scale. This is pretty much how I learnt about templates, ending up with complex array manipulation classes for generic types.
