Usually frequency domain analysis is done with the autocovariance function of time series. Autocovariance function is an time domain tool for analyzing structure of your time series. Frequency domain analysis transforms this autocovariance function. Here is discussion: http://sfb649.wiwi.hu-berlin.de/fedc_homepage/xplore/ebooks/html/csa/node58.html In frequency domain, spectra tells you something about the concentration of components of series variation. It might be that long run trend dominates variation of series but in other series cyclical factors might rule. For example ice cream factory might produce most output just before summer and during summer.
