A specific marginal effect for logistic regression

For the logit estimate of the slope parameter,I would like to obtain the marginal effect of the regressor ndisease evaluated at $\Lambda (x'\beta)=\bar{y}$ . I obtain the logic estimation as follows: How can I calculate this marginal effect by using Stata?
