Further to the answer/comments elsewhere on this page, I'd like to post another answer to my own question drawing attention to the type of screen resources that can be introduced. I'm not convinced this is made clear in the Android docs, but so far as drawables are concerned you can add screen size tags to drawable files on top of the dpi tag. For example, adding a folder called drawable-large-mdpi is valid and devices with large screens and medium resolution will pull resources from here if they can. Warning though, switching the order of the tags matters: declaring drawable-mdpi-large is an error.
