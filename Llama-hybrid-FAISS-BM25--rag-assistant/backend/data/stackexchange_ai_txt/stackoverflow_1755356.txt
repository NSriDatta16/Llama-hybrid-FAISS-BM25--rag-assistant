I've seen file deletions on Windows take as long as a minute, but not file creation. I'd check to make sure you've defragged recently, and also that you have a reasonable number of files in your home. Once you get past 1,000 files (including hidden ones) Windows has a real hard time. What happens if you don't specify c:\ and allow Java to place the file in it's default location?
