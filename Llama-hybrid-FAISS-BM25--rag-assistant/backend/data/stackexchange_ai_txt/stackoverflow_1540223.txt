You're using contravariance here. Basically, you need to have a comparator which can compare any two items in the list. If the list is of type T , that means that it has to be able to compare any two items of type T - but if it can compare any two items of some type X where T is a subclass of X, then that's okay too. To give my favourite example, if you have a comparator which can compare any two shapes by area, then you could clearly use that to compare any two triangles - so it's okay to sort a List using an AreaShapeComparator . I'm not sure what you mean by "when I tried it" in your last paragraph... if you could give a short but complete example which doesn't work, we can try to explain why. EDIT: Okay, you can't use ? extends X or ? extends Y within a new expression - you can only use them as part of a declaration, either of a method, a type or a variable. When you construct a new object, you need to specify the exact type.
