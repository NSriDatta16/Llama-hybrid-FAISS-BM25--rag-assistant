CSS gone wild - how to stop a style from going too far

Is there any way in CSS to put a limit on how far something will cascade? I'm running into a situation where my CSS is just going out of control because of how many classes I have to make, because of inheritence. For instance.. .menu a:hover { background : #XXXXXX; } Hyperlink Another Hyperlink Now, Another Hyperlink inherits the same style. Now I have two options... I can change my .menu implementation to this.. .menu > a:hover { // ... } Which makes only the top-level anchor elements effected. But this isn't always what I want. Usually, In a lot of cases, I end up having to write more specialized styles for deeper down in various hierarchies. In this one instance, I know the solution, but what about more complicated scenarios? I've got a really bad case of "CSS Gone Wild". I have over 20 .css files now, and while they are well organized and planned out, it's just so much to handle. Is that normal? Do most huge websites have that many css styles to deal with?
