First, depending on the implementation, reduction might be better than using atomic. I would try both and time them to see for sure. Second, if you leave off the atomic, you may or may not see the problem (wrong result) associated with the race. It is all about timing, which from one run to the next can be quite different. I have seen cases where the result was wrong only once in 150,000 runs and others where it has been wrong all the time. Third, the idea behind pragmas was that the user doesn't need to know about them if they don't have an effect. Besides that, the philosophy in Unix (and its derivatives) is that it is quiet unless there is a problem. Saying that, many implementations have some sort of flag so the user can get more information because they didn't know what was happening. You can try -Wall with gcc, and at least it should flag the oh_my_god pragma as being ignored.
