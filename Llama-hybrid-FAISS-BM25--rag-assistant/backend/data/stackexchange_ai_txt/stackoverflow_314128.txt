Is it possible to use Netbeans for working on VB6 projects?

I have to work on several VB6 legacy projects and despite some good VB6 plugins (CodeSMART for example) I hate the IDE more and more, especially now where I have the opportunity to work with Java/Netbeans on a new project. Unfortunatly it will stay that way at least the next few years. So I'm asking myself: Can the Netbeans IDE be extended via plugins to support VB6 projects? This is what I dream of: Better code navigation (Ctrl+Click for example) Better code highlighting Code folding Simple refactoring Organizing the source files in a hierarchy My own VB6 specific warnings ("Missing option explicit for example") Code generators (like in Java for getters and setters) Integrated debugging (But I assume this is virtually impossible) Auto-formatting of code Can it be done? Has someone experience with Netbeans and a custom language? What's the best way to start? EDIT: I want to do this myself as I'm aware that this is a highly specialized feature request :)
