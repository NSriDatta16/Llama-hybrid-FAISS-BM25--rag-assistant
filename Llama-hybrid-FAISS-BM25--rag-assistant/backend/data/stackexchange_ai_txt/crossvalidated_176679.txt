The Algorithm of Support Vector Machines

I think that so far I understand the crucial concepts of Support Vector Machines: That we represent our data as points in some n-dimensional space, and in the binary case try to separate them by an optimal maximal margin hyperplane (optimality defined with regards of the bias-variance trade-off, see hard or soft margin SVMs). What I do not know yet is how exactly this hyperplane is found - so what is the algorithm? Given we have two datasets, does an algorithm randomly tries out one plane after the other to determine which plane is the optimal one? What does it mean, that for the calculation of the hyperplane only the support vectors are considered?
