OK, so Church and Turing provied it is possible , but how do we actually do something? Rewriting imperative code in pure functional style is an exercise I frequently assign to undergraduate students: Each mutable variable becomes a function parameter Loops are rewritten using recursion Each goto is expressed as a function call with arguments Sometimes what comes out is a mess, but often the results are surprisingly elegant. The only real trick is not to pass arguments that never change, but instead to let-bind them in the outer environment.
