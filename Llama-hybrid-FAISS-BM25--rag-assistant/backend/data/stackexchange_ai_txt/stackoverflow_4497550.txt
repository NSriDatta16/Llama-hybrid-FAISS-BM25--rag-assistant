I don't think it is possible to do the live event as you want it. The best option you have is to use a callback function when you add a new element to the list and reenable the new object to be draggable each time there is a new element. Something like this: // Call to add a new element $.ajax({ url: 'addElem', success: function(data) { $( "#newDraggableObject" ).draggable({ connectToSortable: "#sortable", helper: "clone", revert: "invalid" }); } });
