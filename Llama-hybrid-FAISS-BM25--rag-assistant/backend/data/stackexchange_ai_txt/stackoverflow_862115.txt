iPhone SQLite File management

I'm developing an application and I'm using SQLite as my database storage. I want to add and update the sqlite database throughout my application duration, so i copied it to the documents directory so i can do all kinds of stuff with my database except only selecting from it. But since I'm developing "time", my database changes frequently (the database architecture is made by another developer) through the process On the iPhone i'm checking if the database exists in the documents directory (if not) copy it to it. use that database but when i want to update my database ( i made in a separate sqlite manager ) it fails through the process of copying the newer version because i'm only checking if the database exists. Does anyone of you guys experienced the same kind of problem ? and what did you do to pass this kind of problem .. my only idea was to create a settings table and hold a row that check's for a version number of the database.. Is there also a way to edit the sql file from the documents directory in any sqlite management tool ? or are there better solutions ?
