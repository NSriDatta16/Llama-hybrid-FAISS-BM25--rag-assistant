How can I get a collection for a DTO member with nhibernate?

I need to get a collection property populated in a DTO and I'm having trouble finding any information on doing this. I tried to do it like this: ICriteria selectCriteria = Session.CreateCriteria () .SetProjection(Projections.ProjectionList() .Add(Projections.Property("SomeCollection"), "Collection")) .SetResultTransformer(Transformers.AliasToBean ()); but MyDto.Collection is always null. Am I doing this wrong, is this even possible? Also, I had originally planned on doing this with a SubQuery so I could just fill my DTO's collection with other DTOs but this will not work because the result of the subquery has more than 1 row (as it should) and Sqlit does not like that (throws an exception). what is the right thing to do here?
