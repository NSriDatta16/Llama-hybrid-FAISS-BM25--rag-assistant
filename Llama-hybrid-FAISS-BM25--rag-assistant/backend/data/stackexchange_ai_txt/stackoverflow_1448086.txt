Mysql will never be as fast as PHP variables, even if using a memory storage engine. You still have the overhead of the mysql client/server connection protocol, etc... However, it should be fast enough for many cases where you have an advantage of using SQL for some datasets, for example. Keeping that in mind, use it only when appropriate. Also, you should look at memcached and (php extension ) It doesn't support SQL, but it's a simple memory caching system with great features, and all your processes/servers can share the same cache
