Determine Optimal CNN Complexity: Achieve ~100% Training Accuracy, Then Add Regularization?

I was just wondering whether it is a decent idea to first try to make a CNN complex enough to achieve close to 100% accuracy on the training dataset, and then slowly add regularization, augmentation etc to make sure that the network doesn't overfit completely but instead is able to generalize better.
