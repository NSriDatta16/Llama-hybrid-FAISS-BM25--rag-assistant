Try adding a moving average MA(q) term, it looks like a spike upwards in your errors is followed by a sharp drop in your errors. An MA(1) would add the term $\theta$ε$_{t-1}$ which would factor in the error from the day before. This might smooth out large movements in your trend. AR(1),MA(q): TS$_{t}$ = β$_{0}$ + β$_{1}$*TS$_{t-1}$ + β$_{2}$*TS$_{t-15}$ + $\theta_{1}$ε$_{t-1}$+ ...+ $\theta_{q}$ε$_{t-q}$ + ε
