@Nuoji i am using nonblocikng-io and yes i am using a Selector, as for when i write to a channel i do the following: Since what i wrote in the second paragraph in my post is true, i assume that the channel is ready for writing in most cases, hence i do not at first set the interest set on the key to write, but rather try to write to the channel directly. In case however that, i can not write everything to the channel (or anything at all for that matter), i set the interest set on the key to write(that way the next time i try to write to the channel it is ready to write). Although in my testing where i got the results mentioned in the original post, this happens very rarely. And yes i can give you samples of the code, although i didn't really want to bother anyone with it. What parts in particular would you like to see, the selector thread or the write thread ?
