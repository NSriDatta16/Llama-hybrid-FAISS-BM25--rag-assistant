Either (as mentioned in a comment by @Glen_b) use Bayesian methods, or some kind of borrowing strength , that is, analyzing multiple data sets with a common model, with some common parameters (that can be seen as a way of empirical bayes.) You say It sometimes happens that code has zero defects in the early stage of review The estimated (mle) parameter of zero leads to predictions of zero future errors, though one could make prediction intervals (of the form $[0, .)$ ) for number of future errors, in some model. But borrowing strength by modeling multiple datasets together seems to me better. This is now a deveoped field, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_software_reliability_models and this google scholar search
