The idea is that Doc2Vec is an average of all your word vectors. Your document embedding will be the same size as any other word vector you have. If you average 10 word embeddings of size 100x1 or if you average 20 word embeddings of size 100x1 you will in both cases get a document embedding of 100x1 . So then, the size of the sentence doesn't matter and no padding is applied. You can then take that 100x1 vector and pass it through a CNN like you would for any other type of input into a CNN.
