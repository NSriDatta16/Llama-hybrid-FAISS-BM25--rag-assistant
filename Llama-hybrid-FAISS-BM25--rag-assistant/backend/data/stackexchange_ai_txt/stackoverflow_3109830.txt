I personally wouldn't use regex for this. I don't know if you can have an alternative but if you can load the HTML fragment into some kind of DOM then you should be able to easily just find all tags and children and strip them out. I can't see your examples but if you do have the special case where your outside text is always at the beginning or end of the text then something like this should work: ^(.*?) (.*?)$ with the first and second brackets matchign the text you want. If however you can have text HTML text HTML text And of course worse scenarios of multiply nested HTML where you want the output to be "texttexttext" then regular expressions are likely to be very complicated I'd think.
