Is it safe to say if features are generated once for a dataset, it may be used for any relevant algorithm?

If I have generated features using state of the art feature engineering methods of a dataset, can I use it for any kind of algorithm to build the model apart from few modifications in the features so as to plug in different algorithm? Is there any dependency of algorithm while building features from dataset?
