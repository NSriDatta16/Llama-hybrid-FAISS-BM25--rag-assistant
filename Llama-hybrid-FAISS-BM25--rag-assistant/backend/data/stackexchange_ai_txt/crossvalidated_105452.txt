Logistic regression model fit assessment

I have run logistic regression on data. The concordant percentage is coming out 45. That is too low. However, Hosmerâ€“Lemeshow test is coming out insignificant. It means we cannot reject the null hypothesis stating model fits the data well. That's good! The ctable also shows 70% of the data correctly predicted. How contradictory results of concordant and Hosmer-Lemeshow test should be considered? How should I interpret this model?
