Not sure if you can predict with many categories. Nevertheless, some categories could be transformed into numbers that would ease the predictions. For instance, the cost could be converted into 0: Totally Free, 1: Free with pass, 2: less than 10USD, 3: less than 30USD, etc. (Or just use the average money spent on the game per player, if you have it) And you can also apply the "other factors" option: # Python m = Prophet(weekly_seasonality=False) m.add_seasonality(name='weekly_on_season', period=7, fourier_order=3, condition_name='on_season') m.add_seasonality(name='weekly_off_season', period=7, fourier_order=3, condition_name='off_season') future['on_season'] = future['ds'].apply(is_nfl_season) future['off_season'] = ~future['ds'].apply(is_nfl_season) forecast = m.fit(df).predict(future) fig = m.plot_components(forecast) Or other regressor: # Python def nfl_sunday(ds): date = pd.to_datetime(ds) if date.weekday() == 6 and (date.month > 8 or date.month Source: https://facebook.github.io/prophet/docs/seasonality,_holiday_effects,_and_regressors.html
