After a bit of digging it turns out that the TextBlock actually doesn't call ToString on whatever is passed in. To work around this you must use a Converter to call a ToString for you. Here's the rub though, TemplateBinding doesn't support Converters. You have to add the TemplateBinding to the DataContext and then use normal Binding in the Text property along with the converter. So the TextBlock markup becomes My custom converter: public class NumberTypeToStringConverter : IValueConverter { public object Convert(object value, Type targetType, object parameter, CultureInfo culture) { if (value == null) { throw new NullReferenceException(); } return value.ToString(); } public object ConvertBack(object value, Type targetType, object parameter, CultureInfo culture) { MethodInfo methodInfo = targetType.GetMethod("Parse"); if (methodInfo == null) { throw new MissingMethodException("The targetType to convert back to a Number must implement a Parse method"); } return methodInfo.Invoke(null, new object[] { value }); } } This seems like a bit of a work around and i'd be interested to hear if it has any adverse implications. Also if anyone is reading this and there is anything wrong with my converter please let me know. Cheers
