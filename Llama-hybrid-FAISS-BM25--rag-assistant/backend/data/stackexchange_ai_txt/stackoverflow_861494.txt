What's the best way to collaborate and distribute project and release documentation within an organization?

It's a continual problem: allow collaboration (and versioning) among developers who are creating project plans, requirements, functional specs, design docs and test plans. Then, publish for others in the organization (IT, Customer Service, Technical Support) to use this information. What systems are people using to track project documentation? How do you roll up change information per release and present it to end users?
