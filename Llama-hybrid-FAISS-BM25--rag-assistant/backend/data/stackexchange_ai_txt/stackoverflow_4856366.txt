I don't know of any way to hand touches off to a newly created view, though that doesn't mean there isn't a way to do it. It looks like you really only want your draggable view to handle the touches, I would probably create each draggable view with with an alpha of 0 at the same time you create the non draggable views, and in touchesBegan set it to 1. If your non-draggable views don't need to handle touches, then it doesn't make sense to make them handle touches just to pass them along.
