Java web start does nothing more than it downloads the jars in you JNLP file and execute the main-class ensuring all the referenced jars are on the classpath, properties are set via -D... and max-heap-size is set via the VM parameter -Xmx256m . If you have a project with the jars listed in the JNLP files as dependencies create a run configuration and specify your main-class as Main Class to be run. You should also add the properties to you run configuration. Do this by adding -Djava.naming.factory.initial=weblogic.jndi.WLInitialContextFactory etc. as command line parameter. Finally add -Xmx256m as JVM option. Good luck! :)
