I like the /pattern/ syntax in Ruby, inspired from Perl, for regular expressions. Python's re.compile("pattern") is not really elegant for me. The syntatic sugar in Ruby and the fact that regular expressions are a separate re module in Python, makes me lean towards Ruby when it comes to Regular Expressions. Apart from this, I don't see much of a difference from a normal Regular Expression programming perspective. Both the languages have pretty comprehensive and mostly similar RE support. There might be performance differences ( Python traditionally has has better performance ) and also Python has greater unicode regular expressions support.
