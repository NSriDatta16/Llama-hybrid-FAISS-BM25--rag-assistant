Here's a somewhat related question: How small a quantity should be added to x to avoid taking the log of zero? This looks like a very relevant paper that uses Bayesian regression with LOD censored predictors: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6241297/ One simple and maybe less than ideal option is to add an indicator variable for whether an observation is below the LOD or not.
