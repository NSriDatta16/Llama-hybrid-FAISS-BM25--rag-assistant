ASP.NET MVC send an email attachment which is a password encrypted PDF file

I am working on document storage and retrieval application. In which i display the pdf document as an png image , but i have a email button on the top. On clicking that the user would be able to provide an email address to which the document needs to be sent, and I need to send this pdf as an attachment. I need to password protect the file for security reasons. I have no clue on how i can do this in asp.net mvc.
