ThreadAbortException, Classic ASP and ASP.NET MVC apps

I am also getting that "Thread was being aborted" error message. I know that this is an old issue but I don't think it's a redirect thing (at least no inside .NET because I don't have Response.Redirects there - only RedirectResults that would call Response.Redirect(url, false) internally)* and I don't think it's a recycling issue due to inactivity either. It's happening in different scenarios but one that called my attention was: I have a window.open(url) being called inside a classic asp page. This url maps to a ASP.NET MVC controller action**. SOMETIMES when this window.open occurs I am getting a ThreadAbortException. Could someone help me? * http://support.microsoft.com/kb/312629/EN-US/#top ** I have two apps in the same server: Classic ASP and ASP.NET MVC
