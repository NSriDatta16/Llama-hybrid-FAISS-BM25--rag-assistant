SNMP agent in c#

I am looking for various solutions for creating SNMP agent in c#. I found several companies that offer some products, but most of them use their own server. However, I found one solution that uses an agent extension. Two questions: Does anyone know other solutions in c# that use the framework of the SNMP service and create an extension agent? Does someone knows about a tool that convert mib files to C# classes?
