Test if semantic triple occurs more often than by chance

I have a large table (more than 9,000,000 rows) of semantic predications (i.e., triples of subject-predicate-object) extracted from sentences of scientific abstracts. The data are organized in the following form: Subject Predicate Object Frequency ---------------------------------- A TREATS B 12 A TREATS C 3 B CAUSES C 10 B TREATS D 1 D PREVENTS E 5 etc. ---------------------------------- Subjects and concepts are typically biomedical concepts (e.g., Aspirin, Dementia) but for simplicity, I use letters in the table above. Question: I would like to test if a particular predication occurs more often than by chance. I would be grateful for any suggestions or ideas. I think that my problem is similar to finding significant collocations, as explained in Manning and Sch√ºtze (p. 160); however, in the case of collocations, we only have two variables (e.g., Subject and Object) and frequency of their co-occurrence, a problem that is solved by applying chi-square test of independence.
