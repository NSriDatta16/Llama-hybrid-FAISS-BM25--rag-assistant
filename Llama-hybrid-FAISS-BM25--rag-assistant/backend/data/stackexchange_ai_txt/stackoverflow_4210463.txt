How do I get SQLite to run faster with PRAGMA synchronous = OFF by default

I just created a new SQLite database from the command line and I have a ODBC connection to the SQLite database. If I issue it queries, by default, the synchronous seems to be "ON" which is really slowing down INSERT performance big-time. How do I get a SQLite database to default to PRAGMA synchronous = OFF without needing to send a SQL command for it to do so? Can i create a .INI file or something to enable it?
