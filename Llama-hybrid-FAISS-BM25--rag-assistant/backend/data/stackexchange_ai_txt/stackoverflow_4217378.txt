theoretical Question about multithreading (scaling)

I need to answer following question: A server needs to do 15 ms of work per request for a file. if the file is not in cache, the harddisk must be accessed and thread sleeps for 75 ms. This happens in 1/3 of the cases. a) How many request can the server process per second with 1 Thread? ->15 ms + 1/3 * 75 ms = 40 ms per request -> 1000/40 ms = 25 Request per second b) How many with multiple threads? Is there a formula for this? For 2 threads I got 40.625 Request per second: 25 ms pause on average -> 25/40 = 0.625 -> 25 * 1.625 = 40.625 Requests per second What about 3 or more threads?
