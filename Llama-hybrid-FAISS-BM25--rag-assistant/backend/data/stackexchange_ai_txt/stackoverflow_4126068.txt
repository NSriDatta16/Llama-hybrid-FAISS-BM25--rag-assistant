asp.net mvc. Passing a list via viewData

Hi does anyone know how to pass a list throught the "ViewData". This is what I'm trying but I think I'm missing a cast some where. List galleryList = new List (); galleryList.Add(new GalleryModel() { isApproved = true, uri = "www.cnn1.com" }); galleryList.Add(new GalleryModel() { isApproved = true, uri = "www.cnn2.com" }); ViewData["SomeList"] = galleryList; here's my aspx page code: galList = ViewData["SomeList"]; %>
