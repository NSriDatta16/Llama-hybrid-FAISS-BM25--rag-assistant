It is hard to compare these approaches. PCA is parameter free. Given the data, you just have to look at the principal components. On the other hand, t-SNE relies on severe parameters : perplexity, early exaggeration, learning rate, number of iterations - though default values usually provide good results. So you can't just compare them, you have to compare the PCA to the best result you can achieve with t-SNE (or the best result you achieved over several tries of t-SNE). Otherwise, it would be equivalent to ask "why does my linear model performs better than my (not tuned) gradient boosting model?". Edit After seeing many questions related to the differences between these two approaches, I wrote this blog post summarizing the pros and cons of each method.
