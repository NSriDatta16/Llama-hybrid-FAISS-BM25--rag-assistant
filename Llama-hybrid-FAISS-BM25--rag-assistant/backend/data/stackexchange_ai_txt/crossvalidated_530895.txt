If machine learning, in general, is about ‘learning’ patterns, is it correct to say its branches differ based on the type of pattern being learnt?

If machine learning, in general, is about ‘learning’ patterns, is it correct to say its branches differ based on the type of pattern being learnt? I.e. in supervised learning the pattern is a target function, in unsupervised learning, it’s some structure like clusters, in RL I guess it’s a reward-maximising action given a state.
