In the article you cited, the author first used cluster analysis to classify the most recent vs. most inactive customers. This was then followed by running both a logistic regression and XGBClassifier with a view to determining whether a customer will make their next purchase in less than 90 days after their last (in which case, a value of 1 was set). For a purchase made after 90 days, a value of 0 was set. In your case, you are saying that prospects have signed up but haven't actually made purchases yet . This is distinct from the case in the article you cited - whereby the goal was to determine whether a customer would make a purchase within 90 days from their last purchase. In the event that you wish to formulate this as a classification problem - but using a 30-day cutoff instead - you firstly need to determine appropriate explanatory variables that will be used in the analysis. For instance, do you have data on customers that are signing up? e.g. age, gender, product preferences? The goal in this case would be to predict whether a customer would make a purchase within 30 days given similar attributes to those customers who already made a purchase within 30 days of signing up. In the absence of this, you could also choose to take a more macro-based view of the problem and formulate as a time series. For instance, if you have four years of data on customers who signed up and made purchases - it would be possible to analyse both seasonal and trend factors of this time series, and then use a forecasting model such as ARIMA to predict customer purchases over a given period.
