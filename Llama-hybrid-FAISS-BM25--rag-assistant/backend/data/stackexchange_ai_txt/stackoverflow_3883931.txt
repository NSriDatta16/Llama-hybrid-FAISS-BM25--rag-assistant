Any way to direct 'returned' emails for various errors?

We manage a website which gives agents the ability to enroll members across the country. At times, the member or agent will enter a bad email address during the enrollment process and important PDF'd information cannot be delivered to the member. Similarly, an agent may try and recruit a sub-agent and have the same issue. Is there anyway to automatically redirect returned emails (Delivery Status Notification (Failure)) to the responsible party instead of to our primary email? i.e. Agent 1 recruits Agent 2. An email is attempted to send from recruit@domain.com but the address for Agent 2 is invalid. The system automatically recognizes the message type, formats and sends Agent 1 a note saying the email he/she entered was bad. Note: I am using Google Apps Standard for all of our mail delivery currently while our platform is built on php and mysql.
