Is it possible to find hyperparameters and evaluate final model on test data, while training on all data?

How would I go about tuning my neural network hyperparameters, getting an estimate of its performance on unseen data, while finally training on the entire dataset? The only way I can think of is maybe using nested cross validation but for a neural network that can be unfeasible to do computation wise. Is there any other method?
