How to automate vertical scrolling in Flex AdvancedDataGrid when dragging item below bottom of visible rows?

I have an AdvancedDataGrid with XML dataProvider. Drag and drop in enabled, and works within the visible rows of the ADG. HOWEVER, if I attempt to drag an item past the bottom-most visible row of the ADG, the ADG does NOT scroll to display the next rows, which makes it impossible to drag and drop beyond the immediately visible rows. Although this would seem to be logical default behaviour of a datagrid (drag to bottom and keep dragging to reveal subsequent rows), Flex evidently doesn't Do Things That Way. I'm flummoxed how to implement this programatically. Can anyone help?
