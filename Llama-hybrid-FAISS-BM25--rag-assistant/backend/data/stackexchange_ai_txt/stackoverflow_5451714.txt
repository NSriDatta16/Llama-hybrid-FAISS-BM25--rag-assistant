I am trying to save my View states in my fragment but I am concerned I make be leaking my Activity. Use onSaveInstanceState() (in the fragment) and onRetainConfigurationInstance() (in the activity) for maintaining "View states" across configuration changes. I am not quite certain what other "View states" you might be referring to. I am concerned because I know all Views hold onto a context and I don't know if it is the Activity context or Application context if inflated from the inflater. Since using the Application for view inflation does not seem to work well, you should be inflating from the Activity . And, hence, the views will hold a reference to the Activity that inflated them.
