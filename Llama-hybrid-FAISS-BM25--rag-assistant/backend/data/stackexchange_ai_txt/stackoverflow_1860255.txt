Data storage in PHP Frameworks

Actually, I'm looking for a framework which helps me using a "Data Mapper" pattern. I have noticed that a lot of PHP framework propose an "Active Record" implementation... I found the "Active Record" too poor for managing "functional data"... It also seems simpler to handle "complex transactions" with this pattern, or to handle non-DBMS backends... Does anybody know of a PHP framework which handles "Data Mapper" pattern ? Or a PHP framework which handles "Transactions" independently from DBMS ?
