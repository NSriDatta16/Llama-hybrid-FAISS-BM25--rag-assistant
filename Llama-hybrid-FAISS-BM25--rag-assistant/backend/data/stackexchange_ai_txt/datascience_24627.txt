The further exploration of your data would help. Are there, for example, some clusters where relative frequencies of your classes are much different from average? Now I see two ways to increase sensitivity of your algorithm toward class 2: Use probabilistic prediction. Maybe what you really need is to estimate the probability that the current example belongs to class 2. If identical observations are sometimes marked as 0 and sometimes as 2, you cannot do much better then say "with probability X this is the second class". Use class_weights and increase them for class 2. This will lead to more predictions of 2 and less predictions of 0 and 1. With imbalansed datasets it sometimes helps.
