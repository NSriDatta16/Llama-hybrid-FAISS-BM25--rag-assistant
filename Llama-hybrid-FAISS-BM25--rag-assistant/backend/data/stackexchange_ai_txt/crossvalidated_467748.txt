Disagreement between p-value and confidence interval hypothesis test

I have a question about a disagreement between a hypothesis test through a p-value and a test through a confidence interval. I thought they weren't supposed to disagree. The problem is the following (I think its from a textbook from Rice Uni): "Registered nurses earned an average annual salary of 69,110. For that same year, a survey was conducted of 41 California registered nurses to determine if the annual salary is higher than $69,110 for California nurses. The sample average was 71,121 with a sample standard deviation of 7,489." Issue : based on a 0.05 significance , we reject the null that the nurses average anual salary is 69110 because the p-value is 0.0466 but based on a 95% confidence Interval we don't reject it because the interval is given approx. by: (68,757; 73,485) . What's going on here?
