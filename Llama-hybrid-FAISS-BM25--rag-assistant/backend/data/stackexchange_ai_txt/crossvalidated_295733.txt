Modeling the system as a Markov chain, the maximum likelihood estimate for the $A \rightarrow B$ transition probability is simply the number of times you saw $B$ following $A$, divided by the number of times you saw any state following $A$. The transition matrix is a matrix $P$ where $P_{ij}$ contains the $i \rightarrow j$ transition probability. A simple way to calculate this is to construct the transition count matrix $N$, where $N_{ij}$ contains the number of times you observed an $i \rightarrow j$ transition. Then, calculate $P$ by dividing each row of $N$ by its sum.
