Regularization - Combine drop out with early stopping

I'm building a RNN (recurrent neural network) with LSTM cells. I'm using time series to perform anomaly detection. When training my RNN I'm using a dropout of 0.5 and I'm early stopping with a patience of 5 epochs when my validation loss is increasing. Does it make sense to use early stopping in combination with dropout?
