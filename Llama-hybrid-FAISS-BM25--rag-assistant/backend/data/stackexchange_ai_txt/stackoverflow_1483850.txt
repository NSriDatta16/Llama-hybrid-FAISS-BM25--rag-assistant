Well, that depends... if you ever want to migrate to Flex4 and use Maven2 to automate the build, you might want to organize your project as follows: project-folder |- common | |- CommonModule.fla | |- src | |- test |- platform1 | |- Platform1Module.fla | |- src | |- test |- platform2 | |- Platform2Module.fla | |- src | |- test |- ... I unfortunately didn't organize it this way, and have recently been clobbered when trying to switch away from Adobe's over-priced IDE that doesn't even support building from the commandline. (How on earth is one supposed to perform integration testing or define pre-/post-commit hooks without commandline builds?)
