I don't use CodeWarrior, but I use PocketStudio instead and the "same problem" happens to me a lot. Each unit is a "segment of code", so when your compiled unit grows larger than 64k of code, the compiler warns you and don't link your code. Try to move some code from that unit to other one. Or You can use #pragma: #pragma segment Seg1 ... code ... #pragma segment Seg2 ... code ... Regards, Christian.
