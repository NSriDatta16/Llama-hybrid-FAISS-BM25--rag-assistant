Designer Rejecting User Control

I have a C++ 'Control Library Project' compiled using /CLR. Inside this project there is a User Control that makes a call to a native DLL. This user control appears in the designer toolbox as it should, but I cannot then drag it onto a form. Without the reference to the DLL the user control can be used fine, but with the reference I just get the message "Failed to load toolbox item" when trying to use it. The native call is functional and not harming the User Control in anyway. The User Control can be viewed fine in the designer by itself with the DLL call included. Also if the control is added manually to a form and executed as a program, it will also display fine. This makes me suspect that the problem is just a matter of Visual Studio Designer needing to know where that native DLL is located. But I'm not sure how to tell it, or where to put the DLL so that it can find it. As far as I known there is no way in the project settings to reference a native DLL. So it makes sense to me that designer is just complaining because it can't fine it. Is there a way to make this work?
