P4 protect is probably the right answer for most people as explained in other answers. However in my organization I can't be the admin so way of doing this is to have a trigger script in perforce that reads a text file that non-admins have write access to and check whether branch appears on the list. This way admin access like p4 protect would need is not needed.
