Priors on variable ordering and/or percentile ranking

Consider a set of variables $\mathbf{X}$ = $X_1 \ldots X_n$ where each variable is $\in [0,1]$. I am modeling an inference problem on these variables. Among other things, I have the following prior knowledge about these variables: I know their relative ordering. For example, for a set of 5 variables I may know that: $X_5$ I would like to capture this with a multi-variate prior when I estimate my posterior on $\mathbf{X}$. Are there any well-known parametric distributions, and hopefully one that is easy to sample from (e.g. for MCMC, or for ABC) that can help capture this relationship?
