Assuming you can use the NOT operation, you can rewrite any Boolean expression with only ANDs or only ORs. In your case: (A OR B) AND (D OR E) AND F I tend to use engineering shorthand for the above and write: AND as a product (. or nothing); OR as a sum (+); and NOT as a single quote ('). So: (A+B)(D+E)F The corollary to arithmetic is actually quite useful for factoring terms. By De Morgan's Law : (A+B) => (A'B')' So you can rewrite your expression as: (A+B)(D+E)F (A'B')'(D'E')'F
