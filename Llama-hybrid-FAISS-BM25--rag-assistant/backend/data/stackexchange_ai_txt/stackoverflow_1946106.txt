Rails: How do I send an object along with a form?

I have a Post model object that has reference to a parent object. The edit , new and reply methods all use the same partial template. The posts_controller methods: def edit @post = Post.find(params[:id]) end def reply @post = Post.new @replypost = Post.find(params[:id]) @post.title = @replypost.title @post.parent = @replypost end The partial template code: If I look at the source HTML generated by the partial template, I can see that I'm passing some sort of object id to my create method. The problem is that when I try and save this new object I've created, I get a warning that it was expecting a Post and got a String. I'm sure that I can work around this by setting and getting the parent_id and passing that with my form, but I'm wondering if there isn't a better way to do this, something more elegant and Rails-esque.
