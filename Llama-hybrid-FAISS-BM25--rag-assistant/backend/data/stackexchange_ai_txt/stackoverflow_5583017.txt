MVC3 StorageSessionStateProvider - Do I need it?

I notice in the azure examples they are using: Can someone explain what this is used for with MVC3? I'm very confused about session state. Do I really need to use it if my application does not have anything like a shopping cart? Is it needed if I just want to do simple authentication? I removed the code from my web.config and my authentication still seems to work.
