Which controller should I use?

I have knowledge of both UIViewController and UINavigationController. But I am very confused about which to use and when? Can anyone clear up my confusion? Also please let me know if there is any difference in memory and speed of BOTH.. (I only know about their storage procedure that one supports heap and the other stack)..
