Calculating limit law for matrix

I my notes on Markov chains, I am presented with the following matrix: $$\mathcal{P} = \begin{bmatrix} 0.97 & 0.03 & 0 & 0 \\ 0.008 & 0.982 & 0.01 & 0 \\ 0.02 & 0 & 0.975 & 0.005 \\ 0.01 & 0 & 0 & 0.99 \end{bmatrix}$$ I am then told that the limit law is $\vec{\pi} = (0.2715, 0.4546, 0.1826, 0.0913)$ . How was this limit law calculated? I would greatly appreciate it if people would please take the time to clarify this.
