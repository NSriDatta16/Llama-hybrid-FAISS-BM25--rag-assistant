Best way to get started with Facebook and Ruby on Rails

I'm looking to develop my first Facebook application and therefore looking for some advice on where to get started. I've spent a few hours browsing Facebook's Developer Wiki, Facebooker library, looking at the sample chapters in "Developing Facebook Applications with Rails" by Pragmatic Programmers, etc. Since FB is constantly changing their API, and Facebook Connect is newer than the aforementioned book, does anyone have any advice on where to get started?
