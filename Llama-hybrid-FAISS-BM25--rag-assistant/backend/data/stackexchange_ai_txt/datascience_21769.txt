Categorize observations with inconsistent text descriptions

Given data table with inconsistent item descriptions, how could I most effectively assign an item category using R (i.e. dplyr ), MySQL, or Python? An R based solution is preferred. MySQL is the data source. As is, case-when logic assigns an item category based on an item description. There is no common key or category to aggregate the items, hence the need to create one. However, not all like items are named the same. These are the same items, but sold across different locations. The is little to no consistency for item descriptions between locations. Real world data provides plenty of unstructured learning opportunities. For example, consider an item like 'Whole Cheese Pizza'. This item exists with multiple descriptions such as 'Whl Cheese Pizza', 'Pizza Chs Whole', 'Cheese Pizzza Whole', 'Whole Cheese' etc. Ideally these all roll into one category named 'Pizza'. Case-when logic uses finds item descriptions like '%Pizza%' or 'Whl Cheese%' or 'Whole Cheese%' to assign the 'Pizza' category. Clearly not ideal nor really scaleable. More pragmatic than programmatic. Without seeing the catalog, are there any suggestions on how to apply a more programmatic method to catalog items with inconsistent text descriptions for aggregation? Can provide additional context or details as needed. Thank you for time and expertise! edit: Sample file here with item descriptions and rollups attached. Goal is to recreate the rollup category without case-when logic. Note the missing rollup category is the default case. edit: fixed link to file
