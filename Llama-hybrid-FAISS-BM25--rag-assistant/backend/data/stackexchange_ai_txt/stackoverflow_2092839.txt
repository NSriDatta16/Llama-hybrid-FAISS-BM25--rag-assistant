Include file (header) using htaccess

I want to include a certain file with every page-call. For simplicity, assume I have a header which should be pre-pended to every file. (Eg. a php script which checks all sorts of user agent stuff.) I could use mod_rewrite to send all requests to this file, and then use PHP to include the requested page into the file, but that could be a headache with paths and whatnot, and I would rather not use mod_rewrite if not needed. I recall there being a 'include' call in htaccess, but the only thing I can find in a search is ServerSideIncludes - which is not what I need. SSI (I gather) scans the document looking for a call, whereas I need to include this file before going onto the file being called.
