Basically in a factorization model you usually incorporate both bias and interaction terms. Bias terms describe the effect of one dimension on the output. For example, in the Netflix challenge example, the bias of a movie would describe how well this movie is rated compared to the average, across all movies. This depends only on the movie (as a first approximation) and does not take into account the interaction between an user and the movie. Similarly an user's bias corresponds to that user's tendency to give better or worse ratings than the average. Finally the interaction term ($p_i \times q_j$ in your notation) describes the interaction between the user and the movie, ie. the user's preference for that movie. The point of integrating bias terms is to remove the "bias" given by users (or the bias for a movie) : for example if Alice tends to rate all movies 1 star too high, in order to compare her ratings to other users, you must remove 1 star to all of her ratings. Similarly, if you want to predict the rating Alice will give to a movie, you have to add 1 star to the score you would get if Alice was an "average" user.
