if you do a google on "html encryption" you'll get a lot of hits. http://www.developingwebs.net/tools/htmlencrypter.php The question I have is why you would want to do this? You're going to have a performance hit for what gain? You can also do the same for javascript but unless your html or javascript has organisational sensitive data then... And if they do then perhaps that's not the best place for it.
