How many organizations use vendor-supplied SOA stacks?

My work place recently started a SOA initiative. After a year-long examination of the biggest vendors (IBM and Oracle) they have decided which one to use and are now in the process investing quite a lot of money in the whole SOA stack (application servers, BAM, process servers, ESB, UDDI-like solution etc). How many organizations are really using a fully-blown SOA stack? Did this technology show any proofs of being better? I'm afraid of a 'Silver Bullet' syndrome.
