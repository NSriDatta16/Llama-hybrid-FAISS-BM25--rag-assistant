In 'C' you would use a union to force the alignment if you don't want to rely on compiler options or directives: #include typedef union _foo { uint64_t align; double d; } foo This will guarantee that your doubles are 64-bit aligned, it just makes accessing them a bit more tedious. Alternatively, if you you don't mind relying on the compiler, gcc supports the #pragma pack(64) directive which enforces 64-bit alignment for everything.
