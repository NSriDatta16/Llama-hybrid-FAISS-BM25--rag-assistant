Multi-label classification ( Wiki ): Given $K$ classes, find a map $f:X \rightarrow \{0, 1\}^K$ . Fuzzy classification (a good citation is needed!): Given $K$ classes, find a map $p: X \rightarrow [0, 1]^K$ where $\sum_{k=1}^{K} p(k)=1$ . In multi-label classification, as defined, there is no "resource limit" on classes compared to fuzzy classification. For example, a neural network with a softmax layer does fuzzy classification (soft classification). If we only select a class with the highest score, then it will become a single-label classification (hard classification), and if we select top $k$ classes, it will be a multi-label classification (again hard classification). Fuzzy classification: [0.5, 0.2, 0.3, 0, 0] Single-label classification: [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] Multi-label classification: [1, 0, 1, 0, 0] As another example for multi-label classification, we could have $K$ neural networks for $K$ classes with sigmoid outputs, and assign a point to class $k$ if output of network $k$ is higher than 0.5. Outputs: [0.6, 0.1, 0.6, 0.9, 0.2] Multi-label classification: [1, 0, 1, 1, 0] Practical considerations As demonstrated in the examples, the key difference is the "resource limit" that exists in fuzzy classification but not in multi-label classification. Including the limit (in the first example), or ignoring it (in the second example) depends on the task . For example, in a classification task that has mutually exclusive labels, we want to include the "resource limit" to impose the "mutually exclusive" assumption on the model. Note that the $\sum_{k=1}^{K} p(k)=1$ restriction in fuzzy classification is merely a "definition", there is no point in arguing about a definition. We can either propose another classification, or argue when to use - and when not to use - such classification.
