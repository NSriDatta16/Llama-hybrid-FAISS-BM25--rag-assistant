Gaussian Process Regression vs Kalman Filter (for time series)?

I'm curious about the similarities and differences between Kalman Filter (KF) and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). From various sources, I've pieced together that the KF is analogous to a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) but where both X and Y are continuous. If this is accurate, I'd assume that the KF makes two assumptions the Markov assumption that $P(x_{i}|X[1:i-1]) = P(x_{i}|x_{i-1})$ and that each observed emission is influenced only by the current latent state, $P(y_{i}|x_{i})$ . GPR, on the other hand, uses a covariance function to determine the relationship between any two points. Various kernels exist, such as the radial basis kernel, where the closer to points are, the greater the relationship. (Others exist, for example, more sensitive to seasonal patterns.) My question is- Which of these methods are better for time-series data? Say it's time to forecast sales, for example, and there's no more data available. In either case, I imagine that the further into the future you project, the wider the confidence/credible intervals become. But my intuition says that since GPR does not make the Markov assumption, the variance around its predictions will be tighter longer for any arbitrarily long forecast window when compared with the KF. Thoughts?
