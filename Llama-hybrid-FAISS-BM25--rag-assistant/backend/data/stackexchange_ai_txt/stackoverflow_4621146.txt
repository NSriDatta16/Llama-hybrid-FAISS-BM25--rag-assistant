least square means for dataset with missing data

I am writing for some help in R. I am doing a simple RCBD analysis using the following script to compare genotypes (Name) for the trait "X". library(stats) data_1=read.table(file="test.txt", head=TRUE) result_X =aov(X~Block+Name, data=data_1) sink("result_X.txt") summary(result_X) sink() My data has missing data ("NA"). So, after calculating the LSD, I would like to compare the genotypes in descending order. I do not think the averages are good since some 'blocks' for some 'names' are missing. So, the question is, what is the script to print out the 'least square means', which I think are the best to compare with LSD than simple averages. Thank you for your help, Oswald
