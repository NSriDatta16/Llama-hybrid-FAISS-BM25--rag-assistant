sort Magento collection AFTER load

The Magento collection sorting functions (e.g. Mage_Eav_Model_Entity_Collection_Abstract::addAttributeToSort ) work by adding an ORDER BY clause to the SQL select statement. However, there are times when a collection has already been loaded and it is necessary to sort the collection. It is certainly possible to use the toArray($fields) function and then PHP array sorting functions (either native or user-defined), however this is a little clumsy. It also means that the objects in the collection are converted to "dumb" rows of values without magic getters/setters which can/are be implemented with algorithms, etc. I'm wondering if there are more elegant/Magento-esque methods of sorting the collection. Thanks, Jonathan
