Jquery.com is well organized and has many great examples. You don't need to buy a book. I found it easy to pickup on the fly by just referencing website's documentation. If you're someone who learns best by doing, I'd suggest this approach. And yes, it's absolutely worth learning. It'll save you a lot of time and you'll actually look forward to doing JavaScript work!
