Are there any results on the distribution of the posterior mean across data sets?

I know that this question borderlines on Bayesian and frequentist philosophy, somewhat related to this question . Bayesian point estimation sometimes uses the mean of the posterior distribution. That is, the mean of the distribution of a parameter conditional on the data. True Bayesians would update the posterior when new data become available. However, I am interested in the alternative situation when a new data set (let's say of equal size as a first data set) is used to compute a second posterior mean. If we repeated this process with many new samples of equal size, we get a distribution of posterior means. Are there results on the form of this distribution? In particular, is this distribution normal (can we apply something like a central limit theorem on the posterior means)?
