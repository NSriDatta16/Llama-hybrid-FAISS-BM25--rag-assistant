This paragraph from the FptWebRequest class reference might be of interest to you: The URI may be relative or absolute. If the URI is of the form " ftp://contoso.com/%2fpath " (%2f is an escaped '/'), then the URI is absolute, and the current directory is /path. If, however, the URI is of the form " ftp://contoso.com/path ", first the .NET Framework logs into the FTP server (using the user name and password set by the Credentials property), then the current directory is set to /path.
