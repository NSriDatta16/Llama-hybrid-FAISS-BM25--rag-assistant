detect mobile browser and javascript support

I want to detect if the request is coming from a mobile browser (i m using java/jsp) Now when i access the page from my samsung mobile phone i get the user agent header as: - SAMSUNG-GT-S5620/S5620DDJE1 SHP/VPP/R5 Dolfin/1.5 Nextreaming SMM-MMS/1.2.0 profile/MIDP-2.1 configuration/CLDC-1.1 should i check that the header contains iPhone,BlackBerry,Android,webOS,iPod,Samsung or there is some more simple way... How can i make sure that the browser supports javascript and by the way does mobile browsers suppport hashchange or anything js " advanced " If javascript is not supported by the mobile browser then i would like to redirect to some simple page with a single form... or i have to make a simple page for mobile browser such that it runs well with or without js support thanks
