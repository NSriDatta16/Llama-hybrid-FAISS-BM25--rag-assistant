A segmentation fault couldn't possibly occur when you compile. Unless, well, the compiler violates memory safety, which is unlikely. I'll take it that it happens when you run the program :D. The problem is here: *filename = argv[1]; It should be: filename = argv[1]; Why? You declared a pointer to char , unitialized, poiting nowhere in particular. Then, you dereferenced that pointer and assigned data to that memory position. Which is, well, who knows where! Edit: you also dereference filename in the printf() call. Remove that * :). Also, didnt' the compiler shoot a warning when you assigned *filename? Making integer from pointer without a cast, would be my guess? Pay attention to the warnings , they provide useful information! Cheers.
