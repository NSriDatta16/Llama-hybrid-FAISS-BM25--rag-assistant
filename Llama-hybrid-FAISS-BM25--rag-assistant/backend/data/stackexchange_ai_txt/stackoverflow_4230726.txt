Event tracking in UIScrollView blocks the main thread. Any fixes?

Event tracking in UIScrollview blocks the main thread. I'm using the main thread to run a timer that drives some animation -- the result is that any user interaction with the scrollable view (dragging it up or down, etc) causes the animation (running on the main runloop) to freeze. Is there a way around this? I've tried to RTFM about NSRunloop (CFRunLoopAddCommonMode et al), but it's pretty terse, leading me to believe that tinkering with event priorities / thread priorities is better avoided. Anyone have any insight?
