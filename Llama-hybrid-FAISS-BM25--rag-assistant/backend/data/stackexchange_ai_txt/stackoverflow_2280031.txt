Online storage: Google Spreadsheet v.s. GAE Bigtable

As an online storage, two of them can be a choice, with officially supported API. Both of them have its advantage and weakness. Google SpreadSheet supports RSS feed, but has limited no. of rows. GAE Bigtable is more scalable, but harder to be remotely accessed by external party. Any other comparison? and what's your favorite?
