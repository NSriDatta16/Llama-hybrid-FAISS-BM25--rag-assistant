IKImageBrowserView images won't show in OS X 10.5

The Apple Demo IKImageViewDemo does not seem to work correctly in 10.5. The control is there, but there are no visible images. The images are there because when you click and drag where an image is supposed to be, the ghost of the image appears and drags. Is there an alternative to using the IKImageBrowserView for users on Leopard 10.5-10.5.8, or is there an alternative "gallery" style control? Anything I need to do special in Interface Builder? Any option that needs to be / not be checked?
