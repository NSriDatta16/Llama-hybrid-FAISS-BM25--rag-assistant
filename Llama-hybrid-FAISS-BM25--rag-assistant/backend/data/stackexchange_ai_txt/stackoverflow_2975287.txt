As @Agent_9191 and @partick mentioned you should use $('tbody :visible').highlight(myArray[i]); // works for all children of tbody that are visible or $('tbody:visible').highlight(myArray[i]); // works for all visible tbodys Additionally, since you seem to be applying a class to the highlighted words, instead of using jquery to alter the background for all matched highlights, just create a css rule with the background color you need and it gets applied directly once you assign the class. .highlight { background-color: #FFFF88; }
