Do you know a free or open source website spell-checker?

We are looking for a free to use website software for spell checking our sites before they go to production. A basic search online took me to these pages: Net MECHANIC Text Trust Orango I did the trial in NetMechanic and I got a bogus email with no result and encouraging me to buy their paid subscription. Any suggestions are appreciated.
