Was trying too hard to get django to do what I wanted. I had two apps with a common name. Obviously a big no-no, but I had them organized in to subapps subapp1.appname and subapp2.appname . Anyway when it comes down to it Django only cares about the appname*, and when I ran syncdb it came across both apps in my INSTALLED_APPS setting and tried to install the m2m model twice. Anyway, solved by renaming one of the apps (funny enough to a more well suited name). * In Django 1.2 there is better support for `app_labels` which can be used instead of the app name when referencing.
