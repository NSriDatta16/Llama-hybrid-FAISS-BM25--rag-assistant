Time series linear regression vs Linear regression

Is it okay if my outcome for time series linear regression and linear regression is the same? I have time series data with 756 observations and for each year there are 252 observations. The time series data is from 2015-2021. It is an individual data type. All my independent variables are categorical and I categorized them. I created a time series linear regression model and a linear regression model. My goal is to find the best model that fits the time series data from the two models. The outputs are the same. Isn't it supposed to be different?
