After working on a few different approaches to this problem, I think I have something that works well enough. I basically went with #2, because it leverages the fundamental behavior of an AutoResetEvent for pausing and resuming. My threads run state machines that are derived from Stateless, so I was able to put all of the pause and resume functionality in the base class, which makes my code nice and clean. I can also have client-specific functionality by overriding methods in the derived class. In the end, there were tradeoffs between granularity of pausing and elegance of code. I sacrificed the granularity so I didn't have to pepper WaitOne() s everywhere.
