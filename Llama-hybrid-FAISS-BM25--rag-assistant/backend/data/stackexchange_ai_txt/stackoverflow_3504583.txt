Feed it to DOM loadHTML function and getElementsByTagName('p') , make a reference with ->item(i) based on the ->length , get the nodeValue and just make a new paragraph with document.createElement , set the nodeValue to your string of nodeValue s that you retrieved from the loop after concatenating them with \n or something. You shouldn't use regex for this.
