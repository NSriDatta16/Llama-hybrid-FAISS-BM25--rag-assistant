Writing the question came to my mind... Can a union do the job? Is there another clever way to automatize the task of adding another member? Yes, a union can certainly do the job: union { values v; /* As defined by OP */ int array[6]; } u; You can use a pointer to u.values in your API, and work with u.array in your code. Personally, I think that all the other answers break the rule of least surprise . When I see a plain struct definition, I assume that the structure will be access using normal access methods. With a union , it's clear that the application will access it in special ways, which prompts me to pay extra attention to the code.
