I solved part of the problem. I deleted the WebDav module in IIS for the site and then the PUT began to work. (I think it has to do with WebDav handling the PUT and DELETE verbs) However the POST verb is not working. It is returning a 400 Bad Request error. I will try solving that in a separate question.
