How to wisely choose machine algorithm for the given data set?

I have a data sample of RSSI value from three different devices and based on the RSSI sample, it should tell from which location the data sample is arrived. Below are the sample data set, device_1 device_2 device_3 location -45 -56 -78 drawing_room -48 -51 -82 drawing_room -41 -59 -73 drawing_room -71 -59 -59 conference -69 -60 -65 conference -73 -60 -52 conference -33 -68 -64 kitchen -32 -66 -63 kitchen -37 -67 -61 kitchen -63 -48 -48 lab -62 -48 -46 lab -59 -48 -54 lab I will have "n" No.of data samples for "m" No.of location. The actual data set can be find here . I want to predict "location" from the d1 d2 d3. Based on what parameters (i.e., correlation matrix or visualization), the machine learning algorithm can be chosen for the given data set? The visualization chart for the considered data set is From the visualization chart, Does it mean only the column "device_1" and "device_2" has a good separation among the location compared to other columns? Note: If required, the data samples can be considered as positive.
