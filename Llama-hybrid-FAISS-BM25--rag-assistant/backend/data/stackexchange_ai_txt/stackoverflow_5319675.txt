ASP.NET GridView examples - Using code-behind - no wizards - no drag/drop

I am looking to implement and learn more about the ASP.NET GridView control. However, all the examples I have found seem to focus on setting up a SQL Datasource within the ASPX page. I prefer to keep markup as seperate as possible from code and therefore all datasource binding I like to do in the code-behind. So it would be great to see an example that setup the GridView in that manner. Also, most of the examples, I have seen, step through using the Visual Studio IDE and wizards to implement the GridView. I would like to see how it is done from a pure code point of view. Does anyone have any examples or perhaps know of some resources that describes usage of the GridView control in the manner in which I described? It would be great to see an example(s) that cover sorting, paging, and CRUD operations. Thanks for your time.
