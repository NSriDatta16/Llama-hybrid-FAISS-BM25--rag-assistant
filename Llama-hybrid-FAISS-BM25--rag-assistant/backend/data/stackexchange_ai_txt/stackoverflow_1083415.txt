In the BizSpark contract the liability is expressly limited to $100 on each side. So if you fall completely out of their coverage and they realize it, you have to pay the $100 and they cancel your subscriptions, but that's it. And really as long as you keep the startup as a technical entity, I don't know that they care whether or not it has (for instance) at least 30 hours a week total work being done. (Nor how they could find out.)
