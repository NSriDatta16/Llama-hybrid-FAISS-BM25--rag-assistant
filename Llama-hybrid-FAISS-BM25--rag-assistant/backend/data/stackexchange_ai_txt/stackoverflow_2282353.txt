The current directory is part of the module search path. So you can put modules directly into your project's tree. The problem is that . comes last in the list of directories to search. So if another version of some module is installed on a system, you will get unexpected upgrades/downgrades. This is obviously not desirable. Fortunately there are many ways to work around this issue. You could: use PAR to manage bundles of modules. use the lib pragma to add additional directories to the list of directories to search. set the PERL5LIB environment variable to alter directory search behavior. invoke perl with the -I option to add directories to the module search path.
