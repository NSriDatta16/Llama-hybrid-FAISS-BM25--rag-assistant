As mice works the goal is NOT to choose the best imputation (in your case out of the 5 you have performed above) for replacing the NA values in your variable. You rather find the appropriate number of imputations and iterations and then get a pooled value. That pooled value could be a pooled coefficient for example on a regression model based on all m imputations or even the average of m imputations for replacing the NA in your variable. The links below I think will give you the needed codes and understanding of the steps: Codes: http://dept.stat.lsa.umich.edu/~jerrick/courses/stat701/notes/mi.html Detailed PDF: https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v045i03
