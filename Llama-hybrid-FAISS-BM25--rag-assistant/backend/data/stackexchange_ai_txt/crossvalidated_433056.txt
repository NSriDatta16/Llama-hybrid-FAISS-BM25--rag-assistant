Terminologies: Generative models for discrete data

I am reading Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective. The title of chapter 3 is 'Generative Models for Discrete Data'. The introduction is short, but I do not understand why the word 'generative' is used. What is being generated? (And as opposed to what other forms of models?) Any insights?
