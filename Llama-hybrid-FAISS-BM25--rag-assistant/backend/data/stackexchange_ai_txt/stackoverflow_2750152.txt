I've always found Andrew Moore's Tutorials to be very useful. They're grounded in solid statistical theory and will be very useful in understanding papers if you choose to read them in the future. Here's a short description: These include classification algorithms such as decision trees, neural nets, Bayesian classifiers, Support Vector Machines and cased-based (aka non-parametric) learning. They include regression algorithms such as multivariate polynomial regression, MARS, Locally Weighted Regression, GMDH and neural nets. And they include other data mining operations such as clustering (mixture models, k-means and hierarchical), Bayesian networks and Reinforcement Learning
