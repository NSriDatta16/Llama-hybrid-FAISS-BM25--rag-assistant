python re.compile strings with vars and numbers

Hi I want to get a match for the following: test = re.compile(r' [0-12](am|pm) [1-1000] days from (yesterday|today|tomorrow)') with this match: print test.match(" 3pm 2 days from today") It returns none, what am i doing wrong? I am just getting into regex and reading the docs I thought this should work! ANY HELP APPRECIATED chrism -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I am asking a new question about the design of a sytem using similar process to above in NLP HERE
