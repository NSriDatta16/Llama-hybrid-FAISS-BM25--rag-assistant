Yes, one single file seems like a bad choice in a moderately-sized app or bigger :-) We basically use this approach: each webform has its own local resources for buttons, labels and so forth there are a number of global resources, organized by topic - e.g. a "general" resource for things like "yes", "no", and so forth; one for error messages that keep popping up all over the place, and so forth - a few global resources based on area of use any other code (more business code rather than ASPX/ASCX code behind) has their own resource files It's always a balancing act between having hoodles of files vs. having files with way too many entries, though :-) Marc
