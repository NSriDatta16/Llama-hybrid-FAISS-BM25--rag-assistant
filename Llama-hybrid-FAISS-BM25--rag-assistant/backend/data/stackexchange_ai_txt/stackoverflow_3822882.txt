The xdebug extension is not loaded

I've got xdebug installed fine (showing up in phpinfo()) but I'm trying to get it to work with PHPUnit's code coverage functionality. It keeps telling me "The XDebug extension is not loaded". I've got phpunit working fine with WAMP. When i run php -m i don't see xdebug listed in neither php modules nor zend modules which points as to why phpunit is not find the xdebug extension Does anyone have any idea of this problem? My detailed configuration is as follows: Windows 7 php 5.3.0 Apache 2.2.11 Zend Engine v2.3.0 Xdebug v2.1.0 Thanks, Krishnen
