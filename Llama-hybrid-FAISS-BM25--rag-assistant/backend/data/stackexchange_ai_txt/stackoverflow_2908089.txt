Its hard to say which language would be easiest, there are lisp , C++ , C# , etc libraries to accomplish this, so alot if it has to do with personal preference. I would speculate Matlab is the most tailored and elegant solution specifically for these types of tasks, and it has a lot of built in support for ODEs ... Lisp may be on the slow side... and I can't speak for OCaml.
