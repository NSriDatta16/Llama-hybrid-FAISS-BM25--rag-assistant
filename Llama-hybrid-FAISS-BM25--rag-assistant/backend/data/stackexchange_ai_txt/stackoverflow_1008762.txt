I have a blog post that details what an HTTP request looks like and how a GET request compares to a POST request. For brevity's sake, GET: GET /?page=123 HTTP/1.1 CRLF Host: jasonmbaker.wordpress.com CRLF User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_5_6; en-us) AppleWebKit/525.27.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/3.2.1 Safari/525.27.1 CRLF Connection: close CRLF and POST: POST / HTTP/1.1 CRLF Host: jasonmbaker.wordpress.com CRLF User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_5_6; en-us) AppleWebKit/525.27.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/3.2.1 Safari/525.27.1 CRLF Connection: close CRLF CRLF page=123 (The CRLF is just a newline) As you can see, the only differences from the standpoint of how a request is formed* is that a POST request uses the word POST and the form data is sent in the body of the request vs the URI. Thus, using HTTP POST is security by obscurity. If you want to protect data, you should use SSL. * Note that there are other differences .
