As @nobugz said - seems I found side-effect using Adobe Reader ActiveX control. I think I've found workaround for that. Not very elegant - but works to me... :) Here is how I archive focusing control back using Timer and browser document Completed event: private void webBrowser1_DocumentCompleted( object sender, WebBrowserDocumentCompletedEventArgs e ) { timer1.Interval = 100; timer1.Start(); } private void timer1_Tick( object sender, EventArgs e ) { if (this.textBox1.Focused) { timer1.Stop(); return; } this.textBox1.Focus(); }
