in binary classification where class labels are {-1, 1} is preprocessing needed?

In machine learning we convert labels using LabelEncoder to convert string ex:{"malignant", "benign"} -> {0, 1} I am wondering if converting Labels to any other numbers matter, in my scenario to {-1,1}. If it matters, reason provided will be helpful (or direction of helpful resource)! Thanks in advance!
