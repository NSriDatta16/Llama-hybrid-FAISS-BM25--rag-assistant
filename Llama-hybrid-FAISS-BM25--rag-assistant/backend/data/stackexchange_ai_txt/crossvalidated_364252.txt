To determine significance you need to look at the whole distribution for a particular coefficient and look for high-density regions that exclude 0. For example, if the $\beta > 0$ for 95% of the samples then you can say that $\beta > 0$ with 95% probability (under the model and prior assumptions, etc.). Usually, if this distribution crosses zero near its mode, we would consider it to be insignificant, but since Bayesian methods allow for exact statements of probability, you should state your results within this framework (i.e. there are no p-values). Also note that these regions don't have to be contiguous; $\beta \in (-\infty, -1] \cup [1, \infty)$ could also be an interval that excludes 0 with high probability, but makes inference on the exact direction of a relationship difficult.
