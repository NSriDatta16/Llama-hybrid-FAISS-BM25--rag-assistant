Applying a weighting function to a curve over a definite integral

I am trying to replicate a sensor's output by modeling the spectral signal it receives and weighting that curve by the sensor's non-uniform spectral response curve. Here are what the two spectral curves look like: The red curve is my modeled signal. The black curve is the instrument response curve. In layman's terms, I need to weight the red curve for each v based on the black curve. The goal of which is a comparison between weighted and unweighted curves. I've tried a few methods (see a couple below) but am having trouble applying the sensor response function to my modeled spectral curve. L( v ) is the signal curve and w( v ) is the weighting function: Method 1 $$ \frac{\int L(v)w(v) \, dv}{\int w(v) \, dv} $$ This is initially what my advisor did - but this is just a weighted average (so it remains spectral). Method 2 $$ \int \frac{ L(v)w(v)}{\overline x} $$ where $$\overline x \text{= average spectral response over the waveband.}$$ But this gives different curves depending on the size of the waveband: In my mind, the weighted curve should stay the same as I expand the waveband beyond the what the sensor responds to - since those wavelengths do not contribute to the signal. This seems so simple to me in theory, but I can't seem to figure it out. Am I ignoring something obvious?
