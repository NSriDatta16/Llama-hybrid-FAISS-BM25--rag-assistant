Optimal time window to consider in a time series analysis

I am currently doing a time series analysis problem wherein I have forecast sales units for a particular commodity. Assuming I have 5 years monthly data, is there any mathematical/statistical way to choose how much should I choose for the purpose of building the model. I am confused in the following : In general it is said that the more data you take, the better it is, does it hold in case of a time series as well? Patterns change a lot over time, so it may not be wise to consider data points that are too old, say older than 2 years. As already mentioned, I am looking for a statistical method (if one exists) to find an optimal time window for training.
