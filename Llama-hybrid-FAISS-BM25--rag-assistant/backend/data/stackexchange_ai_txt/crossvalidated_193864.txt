If I understand you correctly, you essentially want to "predict" what product the customer would most interested in purchasing next? Approaches with classifiers such as Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression may be a good place to start. These can output the probability of an event occurring given previous historical data. For example you could have product A, and run a classifier that will output the probability that a customer will buy product A, based on their previous purchases. Here is a sample chapter on classification from an "Introduction to Data Mining". It helped me understand some of the basic concepts of classification and prediction http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~kumar/dmbook/ch4.pdf Witten & Frank's (2005) "Data Mining: Practical machine learning tools and techniques" is also a very good book that I've gotten a lot of good information from. I'm currently doing research into this area for my masters, so if this seems like it's of relevance to you, I can give you some more of the literature I've found so far
