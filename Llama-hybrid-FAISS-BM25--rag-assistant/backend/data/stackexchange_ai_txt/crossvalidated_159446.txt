Rote calculation of p-values for tests of uninteresting null hypotheses ought to be discouraged; & much more often than not, tests that intercepts—as well as first-order terms when higher-order (interactions & non-linear) terms are included in the model—are equal to nought are uninteresting. If there's an interesting hypothesis about the intercept in any particular case, by all means test it; but you're not obliged to perform a hypothesis test at all. Why do we often see p-values reported for tests of uninteresting null hypotheses? Software's to blame for spitting out p-values for every test of $\beta_j=0$ by default. (There may be more to it—see The abundance of P values in absence of a hypothesis .)
