Should you use international identifiers in Java/C#?

C# and Java allow almost any character in class names, method names, local variables, etc.. Is it bad practice to use non-ASCII characters, testing the boundaries of poor editors and analysis tools and making it difficult for some people to read, or is American arrogance the only argument against?
