Neural Network Forward Propagation

I'm trying to solve this neural network problem found here: How do I go ahead and calculate the forward propogate in this example? I've see examples of how to calculate the expected output but that is given here, and I'm note quite sure what I even need to do or start doing to calculate the forward propagate
