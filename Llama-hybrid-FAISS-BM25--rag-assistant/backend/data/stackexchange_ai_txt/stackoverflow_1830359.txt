Have you tried scrollViewDidEndScrollingAnimation: ? It may have the same issue as your other delegate method, but it's worth a shot. The docs specifically say it's called at the end of setContentOffset:animated: and scrollRectToVisible:animated: , which I have a hunch may be used to implement scrollToRowAtIndexPath:atScrollPosition: . Edit: it's been confirmed that scrollViewDidEndScrollingAnimation: gets called at the end of scrollToRowAtIndexPath:atScrollPosition: . Thanks Ian!
