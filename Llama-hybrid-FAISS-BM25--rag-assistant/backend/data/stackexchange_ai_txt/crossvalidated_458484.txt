What is the current highest dimension for efficient Bayesian Optimization

It is frequently stated that BO can only be efficient for under 10 dimensions, or thereabouts. By efficient, I mean that the optimum is reached in an acceptable time, say less than a day given all data. Please give the open source package and the maximum dimension for your best guess at the most efficient BO implementation. A comment has been put forward with an argument incorporating the time for function evaluation. Let's assume that function evaluation is 0 time. I just want to know about the crunch time, disregarding function evaluation. Perhaps a better metric is the time it takes to compute the next point to measure give the latest function evaluation. Let's suppose that you only require that the computation of the next point to measure must return in less than one day. What is the maximum dimension?
