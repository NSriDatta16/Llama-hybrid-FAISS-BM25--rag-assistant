Clojure - 611 chars (not minimized) I tried writing the code in as much idiomatic Clojure as I could so late in the night. I am not too proud of the draw-chart function, but I guess the code will speak volumes of the succinctness of Clojure. (ns word-freq (:require [clojure.contrib.io :as io])) (defn word-freq [f] (take 22 (->> f io/read-lines ;;; slurp should work too, but I love map/red (mapcat (fn [l] (map #(.toLowerCase %) (re-seq #"\w+" l)))) (remove #{"the" "and" "of" "to" "a" "i" "it" "in" "or" "is"}) (reduce #(assoc %1 %2 (inc (%1 %2 0))) {}) (sort-by (comp - val))))) (defn draw-chart [fs] (let [[[w f] & _] fs] (apply str (interpose \newline (map (fn [[k v]] (apply str (concat "|" (repeat (int (* (- 76 (count w)) (/ v f 1))) "_") "| " k " ")) ) fs))))) ;;; (println (draw-chart (word-freq "/Users/ghoseb/Desktop/alice.txt"))) Output: |_________________________________________________________________________| she |_______________________________________________________________| you |____________________________________________________________| said |____________________________________________________| alice |_______________________________________________| was |___________________________________________| that |____________________________________| as |________________________________| her |_____________________________| with |_____________________________| at |____________________________| t |____________________________| s |__________________________| on |__________________________| all |_______________________| for |_______________________| had |_______________________| this |_______________________| but |______________________| be |_____________________| not |____________________| they |____________________| so I know, this doesn't follow the spec, but hey, this is some very clean Clojure code which is already so small :)
