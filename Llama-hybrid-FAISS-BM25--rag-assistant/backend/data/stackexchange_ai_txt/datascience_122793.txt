Normalization is not typically necessary for target encoded variables. However, whether you should normalize depends on the specific machine learning algorithm you are using. Some algorithms, like linear regression or k-nearest neighbors, can be sensitive to the scale of the input features, and normalization can help in these cases. Other algorithms, like tree-based methods, are not sensitive to the scale of the features, so normalization is not necessary. In general, it's a good practice to try both with and without normalization and see which gives better performance on your validation set.
