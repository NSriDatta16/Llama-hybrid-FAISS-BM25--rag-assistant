That said, I ran your user agent through the script provided on the page you linked to and it came back as Explorer 7, so I'm not sure why it is failing on the page itself. Regardless, check your Registry for additional User Agent information that could be removed at [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\ Internet Settings\5.0\User Agent] (yes, it resides under '5.0' even if you have Internet Explorer 7). Note that this is the location in Windows XP, I'm assuming it is the same in Windows Vista.
