I'm having a very similar problem except that my form uses "GET" request not a "POST" request. So, my URL is something like: http://localhost:4502/form.jsp?query=d%C3%A9jeuner request.getCharacterEncoding() = ISO-8859-1 response.getCharacterEncoding() = UTF-8 request.getParameter("query") = dÃ©jeuner So should the HttpServletRequest use UTF-8 to decode the request param (which clearly it's not) or is this simply a browser error because the browser does not set any character encoding header (which again doesn't make much sense because it's not doing a post request). Here is the full set of headers and notice the %C3%A9 in the URL. http://localhost:4502/form.jsp?query=d%C3%A9juerne GET /form.jsp?query=d%C3%A9juerne HTTP/1.1 Host: localhost:4502 User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-GB; rv:1.9.0.17) Gecko/2010010604 Ubuntu/9.04 (jaunty) Firefox/3.0.17 Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: en-gb,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7 Keep-Alive: 300 Connection: keep-alive This problem I'm having is that I actually copied and pasted the query into the browser form and it incorrectly encoded it. Both in chrome and firefox.
