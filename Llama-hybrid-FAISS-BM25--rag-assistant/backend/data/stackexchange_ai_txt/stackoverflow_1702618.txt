It it probably caused by the bug Anurag linked to, but you should be aware that the two examples you used are not precisely identical from a XAML point of view. If you convert this to element property syntax Value="{x:Type whatever}" what you get is: What you wrote in your question actually corresponds to Value="{x:Type Type={x:Type whatever}}" Because of the semantics of TypeExtension, both ought to produce the same value in every situation I can think of. But for other purposes they may be different, and they may tickle different bugs in WPF. Because of this, it is possible that Value="{x:Type Type={x:Type log:FranchiseAiring}}" might work for you. You may want to try it and find out.
