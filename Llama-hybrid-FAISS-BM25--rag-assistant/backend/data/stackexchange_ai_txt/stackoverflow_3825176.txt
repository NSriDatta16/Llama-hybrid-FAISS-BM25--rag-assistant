It depends what you mean by 'fastest' path. If you knew the average speed you could travel on on each segment of the road, then you could just convert your graph so the edges contain "time taken to travel" instead of "distance". Then you can do a shortest-path algorithm over the new graph. It seems like you mentioned that's not good enough, though. I think the problem is that you have to define what 'fastest' means. How does road quality affect speed? What about traffic lights? These are all variables you have to find a way to account for. If you as a human don't know the metric you'll be using, it'll be hard to get the computer to do it.
