I'm going to steer you away from power calculations so that you can reconsider your procedure. Your situation involves 2 independent variables--day and time--, so you need to replace Chi-square with a 2-factor, multivariate model. Which type you use depends on how you operationalize your dependent variable (DV). Rather than response rate , which applies to groups, your DV, if measured at the individual level, would be response/nonresponse. And to test for days and times that relate to this it would be natural to use logistic regression. As part of this you could build in a term to test for a day*time interaction, i.e., for specific combinations of days and times that have especially high or low response. If you prefer or need to measure response at the group level via response rate, then I'm guessing loglinear modeling would be your choice.
