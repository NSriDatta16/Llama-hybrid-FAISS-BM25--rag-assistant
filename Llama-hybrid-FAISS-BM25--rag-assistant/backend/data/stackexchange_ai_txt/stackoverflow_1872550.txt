A simple "greedy" method, avoiding the combinatorial explosion For reconstructed signals q_i and ground truth s_j , let NxN matrix M[i,j] = abs(corr(q_i,s_j)) with "corr()" some correlation function giving results in [-1,1], e.g. pearson moment-product (MATLAB: corrcoef() ) or spearman rank-corrrelation. Step 1) Find (i,j) = argmax(l,m) M[l,m] . This is a pair of reconstructed index i,j. Push it on a list. This is the best matching pair of what's currently eligible. Step 2) Blank out row i and column j with NaN's or something. Step 3) If you haven't done N of them yet, (matrix is not all NaN's) go to Step 1. (equivalently you can delete a row & column, remembering the original indices). For all the pairs in the list, average the original M[i,j]. This is the average correlation (absolute valued) of the pairs you found with the greedy algorithm .
