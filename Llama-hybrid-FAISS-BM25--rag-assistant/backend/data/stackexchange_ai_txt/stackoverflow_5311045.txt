How to override default search in Magento?

I am working on a Magento site, and i would like to edit the default search result. Editing search result is not editing the appearance of search result but the actual search results generated. The idea is, if the Magento search does not return any value then i need to do a search in my custom table to fetch some relative products. Could anyone help me to edit the default Magento search?? Thanks a lot in advance.
