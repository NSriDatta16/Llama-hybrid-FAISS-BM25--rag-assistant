I resolved this in the end by removing the doctype from the ASP.NET page. It seems that the way that the grid is laid out does not work properly with IE in standards mode. It looks like mainly an IE problem. Infragistics have said that they are working on a new grid that doesn't have these problems but unfortunately it does not yet have the flexibility of the standard grid.
