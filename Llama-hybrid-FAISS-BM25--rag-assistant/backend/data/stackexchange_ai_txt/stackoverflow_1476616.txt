External RoleProviders and compiling?

I've built a custom RoleProvider which uses an already existing datasource (from a web service) to dtermine roles. It's written in C#, and I want to be able to compile it as a DLL so I can distribute it to others within the organisation and they can use it too. When compiling, how do I reference the web service? Currently getting this error: SedRoleProvider.cs(4,15): error CS0234: The type or namespace name 'sedservice' does not exist in the namespace 'com.sed' (are you missing an assembly reference?) SedRoleProvider.cs(38,24): error CS0246: The type or namespace name 'SEDServices' could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?) SedRoleProvider.cs(40,24): error CS0246: The type or namespace name 'SEDServices' could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?) Alternatively, is there a better way to accomplish what I'm trying to do? Only been at this C#/.Net/ASP.NET lark for a couple of months now.
