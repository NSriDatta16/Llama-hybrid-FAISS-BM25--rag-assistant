How to change the color of the disqus textarea

I simply want to change the color of the textarea in disqus where one can write his comment in disqus. I spent the last 3 hours in failing to do. With firebug I was able to change it, and I know what css tags I need to use. #dsq-content .dsq-post-fields .dsq-input-wrapper { background: #2A2A2A none no-repeat scroll left top; } Everywhere I added this, it just got ignored. ATTENTION I mailed disqus and they sayed that they will introduce a new theme manager soon, bot until then it is not possible .
