I am not sure I understand the question 100% correctly, but I interpret it as the output from rstan being unfamiliar and that by "effect sizes", the answer that is sought is similar to the regression coefficients from a "traditional" frequentist analysis. The effect sizes are displayed; when using a Bayesian analysis, you do not get a single point estimate for each effect size, but a posterior distribution of plausible effect sizes. The posterior distribution is the "full" answer, as it includes the uncertainty of the parameter, but it is often summarised using simpler methods - e.g. the mean or median value is often used more or less similarly to the point estimate from frequentiest methods, and the 95% central values of the posterior distribution is used as a Bayesian credible interval , which is the Bayesian analogue of a frequentist 95% confidence interval When you use a frequentist analysis (which are the statistical analysis most commonly used), you get a point estimate for each regression coefficient (= effect size) and a standard error that you can use to calculate a confidence interval for that effect size. Fitting the same model using a frequentist methods leads to the following results: fit_freq An abbreviated output of the summary call above is included here: Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 0.9089 0.8888 1.023 0.3133 group 3.2573 1.2569 2.591 0.0137 * time 0.2537 1.2569 0.202 0.8412 group:time 1.4082 1.7776 0.792 0.4334 As you can see, for this simple model, the estimates from the frequentist analysis are very similar to the corresponding mean values from the posterior distribution from your Bayesian analysis above. You can calculate the frequentist 95% confidence intervals using the estimates and standard errors: confint(fit_freq) With output: 2.5 % 97.5 % (Intercept) -0.8331139 2.650871 group 0.7937913 5.720889 time -2.2098693 2.717229 group:time -2.0758296 4.892139 This is once again very similar to the results from your Bayesian analysis; the standard distributions (SDs) from your Bayesian analysis are also almost identical to the standard errors frm the frequentist analysis. The inclusion of the corresponding frequentist analysis here hopefully makes it easier to understand the interpretation; when using other models or priors that are more informative or not centered on 0, the results may differ substantially. Remember that the entire posterior distribution from the Bayesian analysis is the answer; while a mean value of this distribution is a useful summary measure, it does not convey as much information.
