I can recommend looking at these (Note: PDFs): http://pragmaticstudio.com/rails (Rails TextMate Cheat Sheet) http://www.g-design.net/textmate.pdf (HTML/CSS/Javascript/Other TextMate Cheat Sheet) It would also be beneficial to look at the bundle editor (Cmd+Opt+Ctrl+B) and just look around at how the general bundles are setup. I did that, then shortly after started making little snippets in my own bundle to expedite things which I do most often. Hope this helps, and good luck!
