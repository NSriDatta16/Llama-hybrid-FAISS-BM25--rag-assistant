The issue of whether, when and how to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of single case reports is an interesting one. For further guidance, you may refer to Sampayo-Cordero et al , Murad et al , and Jackson et al , just to name of few interesting references. Your scenario is however somewhat different, in the sense that you have both aggregate data from some studies and then some case reports. Indeed, you cannot generate estimates of precision unless you have repeated measures from the same subject reported in a given case report. Yet, pragmatically, you may simply generate another hypothetical study (which we may call study X) which combines the different case reports. Such study X will be then easy to manipulate for inference with the other published studies. However, as also stated below, consider that only very weak (at best hypothesis generating) evidence can stem from small studies and this is even truer for case reports, as external validity will be minimal. Regarding your questions: 1) The larger the sample of each study and the larger the overall sample of the meta-analysis the better, but what matter most are precision (within-study and overall) and between-study consistency. 2) I would recommend as stated above to cumulate all single reports as a single hypothetical study X to be analyzed together with the other published studies. 3) This is a key limitation. You may still procede but the potential bias cannot be adjusted altogether. However, plan a subgroup analysis according to institution. 4) It depends on what is your endpoint and your outcome. Single-arm studies are common for epidemiologic assessments (eg prevalence, incidence, proportion), but of course their informativeness for comparative effectiveness research of therapeutic interventions is quite limited.
