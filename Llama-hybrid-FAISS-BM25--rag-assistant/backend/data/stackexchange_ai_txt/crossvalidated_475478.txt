My understand of this is that when using Chi2 for feature selection, the dependent variable has to be categorical type, but the independent variables can be either categorical or continuous variables, as long as it's non-negative. What the algorithm trying to do is firstly build a contingency table in a matrix format that reveals the multivariate frequency distribution of the variables. Then try to find the dependence structure underlying the variables using this contingency table. The Chi2 is one way to measure the dependency. From the Wikipedia on contingency table ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contingency_table , 2020-07-04): Standard contents of a contingency table Multiple columns (historically, they were designed to use up all the white space of a printed page). Where each row refers to a specific sub-group in the population (in this case men or women), the columns are sometimes referred to as banner points or cuts (and the rows are sometimes referred to as stubs). Significance tests. Typically, either column comparisons, which test for differences between columns and display these results using letters, or, cell comparisons, which use color or arrows to identify a cell in a table that stands out in some way. Nets or netts which are sub-totals. One or more of: percentages, row percentages, column percentages, indexes or averages. Unweighted sample sizes (counts). Based on this, pure binary features can be easily summed up as counts, which is how people conduct the Chi2 test usually. But as long as the features are non-negative, one can always accumulated it in the contingency table in a "meaningful" way.
