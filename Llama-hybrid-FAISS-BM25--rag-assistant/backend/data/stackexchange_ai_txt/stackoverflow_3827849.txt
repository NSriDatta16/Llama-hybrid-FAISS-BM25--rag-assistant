one workaround is to put the service agent (web reference) in its own DLL and reference it from the main project. it won't touch your service agent config in your web.config when you do Update Referene and as a bonus you'll have a project with up to date serviceagent config if you ever need to compare the default configuration with what you actually have in web.config also has the benefit that if you have one service agent referencing another it will share the types MAIN DLL > ServiceAgent1 DLL > ServiceAgent2 DLL If ServiceAgent1 and ServiceAgent2 have shared types you won't get two generated duplicate classes
