The manual page Data Type Storage Requirements describes the storage requirements of each datatype for the MyISAM engine in more detail. Data Type Storage Required CHAR(M) M Ã— w* bytes, 0 *w is the number of bytes required for the maximum-length character in the character set So in conclusion the number of bytes of storage required to store a string in a TEXT column depends on the length of the string. This differs from CHAR(100) where the same amount of storage is required regardless of the length of the string stored.
