If you have more than 50% of values as missing across any columns you should impute only when you are an SME of the domain or know the reason for missing(Honestly I would drop that column rather imputing). Not only XGboost most of the algorithm would penalise for Missing values and one can increase the performance by imputation. Tip may be try Catboost
