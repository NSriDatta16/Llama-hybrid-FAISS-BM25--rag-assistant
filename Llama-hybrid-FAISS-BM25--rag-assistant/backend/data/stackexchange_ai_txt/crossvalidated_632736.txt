In a comment you wrote N is the sample size for each year in the data. Rate is the percentage of that N that undertook an activity. This changes things a lot. Your sample size is not six (one for each year) but N (100 to 200 per year). I think the best approach is then logistic regression, with year as the predictor variable (and, probably, year kept as particular years).
