Can the same CNN architecture be used for different data sets?

I have a CNN architecture that works well on 32x32x3 images. Can I use that same architecture for a data set made up of 28x28x1 images? (Both data sets have 10 classes). If this is possible, what changes would I need to make to the architecture I have?
