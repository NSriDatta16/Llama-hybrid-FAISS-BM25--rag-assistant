remote image embeds: how to handle ones that require authentication?

I manage a large and active forum and we're being plagued by a very serious problem. We allow users to embed remote images, much like how stackoverflow handles image (imgur) however we don't have a specific set of hosts, images can be embedded from any host with the following code: [img]http://randomsource.org/image.png[/img] and this works fine and dandy... except users can embed an image that require authentication, the image causes a pop-up to appear and because authentication pop-ups can be edited they put something like "please enter your [sitename] username and password here" and unfortunately our users have been falling for it. What is the correct response to this? I have been considering the following: Each page load has a piece of Javascript execute that checks each image on the page and its status Have an authorised list of image hosts Disable remote embedding completely The problem is I've NEVER seen this happen anywhere else, yet we're plagued with it, how do we prevent this?
