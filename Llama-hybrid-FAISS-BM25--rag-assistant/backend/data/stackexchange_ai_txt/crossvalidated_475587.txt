Converting Continuous variable to Categorical

When should one consider converting continuous variable into categorical variable ? Are there guidelines ? Is it justified to bin skewed variable ? How should I determine the range / binning when I do the conversion ? For example, if I have Annual Income per year as a predictor how do I decide the the range / bins as 20k to 50k, 51k to 80k and so on. Do the bins have to be equally spaced (fixed width) ? Is binning know to improve models like Random Forest ?
