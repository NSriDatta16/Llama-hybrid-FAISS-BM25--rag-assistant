CSS Framework - off the shelf or homegrown?

Is there an existing framework that satisfies the needs of your projects with minor modifications, or have you developed your own along the way? What do you recommend for someone trying to make that decision with these priorities: CSS reset Attention to typography; baseline grid Semantic classes Accessibility Lots of "Helper" classes: e.g. .demphasized, .errormsg, .readmore etc. Grid system, unless it conflicts with #3 Not a priority: - Fluid/Elastic layout support - Type in ems/%s Thanks in advance.
