Having migration scripts, models, controllers and route additions in a rails plugin

i'm developing a modular application on RoR. Ideally, i'd like to make a very generic kernel, and then to be able to code specific plugins around it (Placed in vendor/plugins, or in lib and then only install the ones used by one set-up versus another set-up). So my question is, is it possible to have any arbitrary model / controller / database migration script in a plugin, as well as additional routes? If it is possible, then how would it be organized in my application's folder hierarchy? Also, if it's possible, it would mean that upon installation, my plugin would have to tell rake to migrate, and upon uninstallation it would have to have some "backup-and-drop" tables logic. How would that be doable? Thanks a lot, Pierre.
