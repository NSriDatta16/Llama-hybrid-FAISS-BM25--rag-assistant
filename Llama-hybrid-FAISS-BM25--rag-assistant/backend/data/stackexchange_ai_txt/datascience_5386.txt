Identity covariance matrix, decorrelated data?

Why would you want to decorrelated data? As I am reading about PCA and whitening on image data for DNN, I wonder what is the purpose of achieving the identity covariance matrix in your data is? Is it to remove interaction between variables, thus allow simpler models to express interactions without having to compute x1*x2?
