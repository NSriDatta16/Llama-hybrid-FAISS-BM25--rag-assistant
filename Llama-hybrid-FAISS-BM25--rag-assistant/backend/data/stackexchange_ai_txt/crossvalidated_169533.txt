Good question. In most situations there is an estimand of primary interest, e.g. treatment effect or group difference. We seek an unbiased (usually) estimate that has high precision, so a Bayesian credible interval or frequentist confidence interval will often be of major interest. The width of these intervals, for the most part, take into account the data's information content (sample size, variation, etc.). So in many cases that's enough. Still, validation of the overall model can help quantify the volatility/reliability of the whole model, and especially whether the non-target variables are being overfitted so that you might worry about over-adjustment of covariates. The same type of optimism bootstrap validation that you might use for a predictive model may just as well be used here. If the adjustment variables were not pre-specified but determined by data dredging, you really need to use a bootstrap procedure to penalize the target variable's confidence interval. Otherwise it is been shown that all the variables in the model will have confidence intervals that are too narrow.
