Machine learning framework for SVM, Random Forest

I need an library, or something that is already done for SVM and Random Forest algorithms. Can you give me some ideas? I don't have experience and I don't know what to choose. The restriction of my classification problem is: 27 dimensions, 9 classes, 50.000 entries in the training set, 150.000 in test set.
