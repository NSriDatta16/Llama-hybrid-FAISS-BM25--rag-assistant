Just in case you want to pull data from Yahoo... Here is a simple function. This does not scrape data off a normal page. I thought I had a link to the page describing this in the comments, but I do not see it now - there is a magic string appended to the URL to request specific fields. import urllib as u import string symbols = 'amd ibm gm kft'.split() def get_data(): data = [] url = 'http://finance.yahoo.com/d/quotes.csv?s=' for s in symbols: url += s+"+" url = url[0:-1] url += "&f=sb3b2l1l" f = u.urlopen(url,proxies = {}) rows = f.readlines() for r in rows: values = [x for x in r.split(',')] symbol = values[0][1:-1] bid = string.atof(values[1]) ask = string.atof(values[2]) last = string.atof(values[3]) data.append([symbol,bid,ask,last,values[4]]) return data Here, I found the link that describes the magic string: http://cliffngan.net/a/13
