Dont. I personally think it is extremely risky to have everyone on the team working in a brand new technology. You must have atleast a few people (minimum 1 - but real number depends on the size of your team) who has working experience in designing / develolping using the technology. Working experience - means that they have used the technology atleast in one real life project successfully. The people who have experience with the technology must set some standards and guidelines for the team to follow to ensure that the team is following accepted best practices and standards for the technology in question. Also, encourage open discussions within the team on design decisions / standards / technical issues to ensure that the noobies understand the rationale and can even challenge it if needed to weed out bad practices / improve existing ones.
