Intercept and indepenent variable's t-value is 0

Unfortunately for privacy reasons I cannot disclose the original data , but I'm running a regression model like this on R. Call: lm(formula = Score ~ Agent * Target, data = .) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -3.1997 -0.4643 0.2133 0.6034 2.5762 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) -7.831e-16 6.930e-02 0.000 1.000 Agent 2.820e-01 6.949e-02 4.058 6.05e-05 *** Target 5.863e-16 9.801e-02 0.000 1.000 Agent:Target 1.094e-01 9.827e-02 1.113 0.266 --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 Residual standard error: 0.9426 on 366 degrees of freedom Multiple R-squared: 0.1164, Adjusted R-squared: 0.1091 F-statistic: 16.07 on 3 and 366 DF, p-value: 7.847e-10 Both Agent and Target are dummy variables, being 0 and 1, with DV being continuous variable. The variables are standardized. This is actually a repeated measure, meaning one data (one ID) has variables for both when Target = 0 and Target = 1. As you can see, both intercept and Target showing t-value of 0 and p-value of 1, which makes me suspicious about this analysis. I have checked VIF for multicollinearity, but it seems to be fine (agent and target are dummy variables and should have no correlation anyways). I have intentionally omitted this analysis in the above for simplicity, but since this is a repeated measure, I also have run mixed-model analysis accounting for ID, which again, shows the same t-value & p-value for intercept and Target. Linear mixed model fit by REML. t-tests use Satterthwaite's method [ lmerModLmerTest] Formula: Score ~ Agent * Target + (1 | id) Data: . REML criterion at convergence: 880.3 Scaled residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -2.79766 -0.43321 0.06451 0.38941 2.29075 Random effects: Groups Name Variance Std.Dev. id (Intercept) 0.6433 0.8020 Residual 0.2452 0.4952 Number of obs: 370, groups: id, 185 Fixed effects: Estimate Std.

If you know any potential issues I would really like to know. Thank you in advance. Edit: Added the snippet of the original data for the data structure id Agent Target Score 1 1 1 1 71 2 1 1 0 56 3 2 1 1 70 4 2 1 0 58 5 3 1 1 69 6 3 1 0 36 7 4 1 1 52 8 4 1 0 46 9 5 1 1 73 10 5 1 0 71 There are Scores of Target 0 and Target 1, and they are nested below ID (repeated measures).
