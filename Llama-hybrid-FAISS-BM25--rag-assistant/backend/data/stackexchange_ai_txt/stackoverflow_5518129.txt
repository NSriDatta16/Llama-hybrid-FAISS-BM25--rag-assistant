What's a need for union { } in C++?

Possible Duplicate: C/C++: When would anyone use a union? Is it basically a remnant from the C only days? Hi all. What are the reasons for unions to exist in C++? And what are they, actually? I found this code: #include using namespace std; union mixture { short number; char symbol[2]; main() { mixture m1, m2; cout > m1.symbol[0] >> m1.symbol[1]; cout > m2.symbol[0] >> m2.symbol[1]; cout.setf(ios::hex); cout m2.number ? m1.number : m2.number) But actually, what I win from using union { struct1, struct2 } instead of writing struct { struct2(struct1}: a(struct1.a), b(_struct1.b {}} struct2? to transparently support both types? I do some embedding stuff (Arduino etc), but never seen the real usage for structs. Examples, please.
