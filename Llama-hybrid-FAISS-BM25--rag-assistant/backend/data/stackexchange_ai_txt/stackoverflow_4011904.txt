There's a very simple and elegant little regular expression compiler in C that Rob Pike wrote and Brian Kernighan describes in Chapter 1 of O'Reilly's Beautiful Code . It's pretty easy to learn from. Also compiler courses cover it: token types can be defined with regular expressions. So I imagine this knowledge isn't terribly rare.
