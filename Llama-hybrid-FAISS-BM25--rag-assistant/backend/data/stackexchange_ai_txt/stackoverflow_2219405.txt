whats the best way to faciliate collaboration within a software org

we have an org of around 300 people and certain people are very good at sharing articles, tips, blogs, etc but it usually happens within sub teams (between 5-15 people). whats the best way to scale this up to facilitate a culture of collaboration across a larger set of folks. Post to central WIKI instead of email links? Reward contributors and encourage bottom up organic collaboration ? "Force" collaboration top down ?
