Using binary dummy to control excess of zeros in continuous data

I'm running an OLS and one of the explanatory variables accounts the sewage coverage, which is zero in 42% of the observations (these are true zeros). I'm worried that the linear effect is not going to be captured very well. Does it make sense to insert a dummy in the model that equals 1 if the sewage coverage is nonexistent and 0 if it exists?
