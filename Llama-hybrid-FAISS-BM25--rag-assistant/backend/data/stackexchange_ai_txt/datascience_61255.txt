Can a decision tree learn to solve a xOR problem?

I have read online that decision trees can solve xOR type problems, as shown in images (xOR problem: 1 ) and (Possible solution as decision tree: 2 ). My question is how can a decision tree learn to solve this problem in this scenario. I just don't see a way for any metric (Information gain, Gini Score, ...) to choose one of the splits in image 2 over any other random split. Is it possible to solve the presented problem with a decision tree? Would using a random forest solve the problem in any way? Thank you in advance.
