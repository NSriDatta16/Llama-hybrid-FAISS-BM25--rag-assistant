Testing a SOAP web-service will be quite the same than testing a "local" method : you'll have to call that method, passing it some parameters, and chechink the return value, to verify that it corresponds to the parameters you gave. Of course, with web-services, the call will be a bit more complicated, as you'll have to work with SoapClient to call the method, but the idea will still be the same. The biggest problems I see are : Web services calls are slow (they go though a network) , which means your tests will take time to execute -- which means you won't be able to execute them as often With a webservice, you potentially have more than one possible reason for failure ; which means you'll have more troubles finding out why a test failed : It can fail because there is a bug -- that's the ideal case But it can also fail because the remote server is down Or because the network is down And probably quite some other possile reasons Of course, as the code will be executed on a remote server, and not on the machine that runs PHPUnit, it'll be much harder to get code-coverage (for instance)
