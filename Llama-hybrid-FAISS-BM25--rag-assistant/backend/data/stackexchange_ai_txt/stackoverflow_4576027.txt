No, it is not : Simply creating an element and assigning an ID will not make the element accessible by getElementById . Instead one needs to insert the element first into the document tree with insertBefore or a similar method, probably into a hidden div. And besides that, a DocumentFragment only implements methods of the Node interface and getElementById is not part of that. There are no other ways to get an element by ID.
