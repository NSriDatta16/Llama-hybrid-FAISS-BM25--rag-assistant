Number of parameters in Bayesian Classifier

Problem Assume we have a Bayesian classifier with the three following features to determine whether a software user is a student , an admin , or an infiltrator (3 classifications). LoginFrequency = { Never, Daily, Weekly } LoginLocation = { Home, InCity, InState InCountry, OutOfCountry } LoginDuration = { Seconds, Minutes, Hours, Days, Weeks } Assuming the features aren't independent , how many parameters need to be estimated, in total, to classify amongst the 3 types of users? What about if we assume the features are independent ? Attempt I'm having problems understanding how to count the number of estimated parameters in either case. My guess for (2) is ${\displaystyle \prod_{i=1}^{3} X_i}$ , where each $X_i$ is the number of values per feature, giving us $ 3 \times 5 \times 5 = 75$ , which seems pretty wrong. As for (1), I don't know where to begin. Notes I'm only 2 weeks into a graduate ML course as an undergrad, and we've missed a lecture due to a snow storm so, as you might assume, I'm still much of a beginner. Hence, any help would be greatly appreciated.
