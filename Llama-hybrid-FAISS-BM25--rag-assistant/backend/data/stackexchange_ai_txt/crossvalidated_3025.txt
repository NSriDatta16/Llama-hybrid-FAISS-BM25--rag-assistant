Great discussion here, but I think of cross-validation in a different way from the answers thus far (mbq and I are on the same page I think). So, I'll put in my two cents at the risk of muddying the waters... Cross-validation is a statistical technique for assessing the variability and bias, due to sampling error, in a model's ability to fit and predict data. Thus, "best" would be the model which provides the lowest generalization error, which would be in units of variability and bias. Techniques such as Bayesian and Bootstrap Model Averaging can be used to update a model in an algorithmic way based upon results from the cross validation effort. This FAQ provides good information for more context of what informs my opinion.
