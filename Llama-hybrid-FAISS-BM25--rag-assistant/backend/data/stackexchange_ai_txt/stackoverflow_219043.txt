OpenMP . It handles threads for you so you only worry about which parts of your C++ application you want to run in parallel. eg. #pragma omp parallel for for (int i=0; i the above code will run the for loop on as many threads as you've told the openmp runtime to use, so if SIZE is 100, and you have a quad-core box, that for loop will run 25 items on each core. There are a few other parallel extensions for various languages, but the ones I'm most interested in are the ones that run on your graphics card. That's real parallel processing :) (examples: GPU++ and libSh )
