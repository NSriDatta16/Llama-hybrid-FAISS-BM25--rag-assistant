Is there a medium-size Clojure sample application available?

Is there a medium-sized Clojure sample application that could be used as a "best-practices" example, and a good way to see what such an application would look like in terms of code and code organization? A web application would be particularly interesting to me, but most important is that the program do something commonly useful (blog, bug-tracking, CMS, for example), and not something mathematical that I've never ever had to implement in the real world (solving the N-queens problem, simulating Life, generate Fibonacci sequences, and such usual fare of function programming languages).
