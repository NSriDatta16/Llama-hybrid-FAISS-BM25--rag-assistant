ARIMA: Understanding how time series analysis is focused on mathematical properties as opposed to best forecasts

Rob Hyndman states : " The paper describing the competition [M] ( Makridakis et al, 1982 ) had a profound effect on forecasting research. It caused researchers to: ... treat forecasting as a different problem from time series analysis " and " The paper describing the competition (Makridakis et al. 1982) had a profound effect on forecasting research. It caused researchers to: focus attention on what models produced good forecasts, rather than on the mathematical properties of those models ; ...; treat forecasting as a different problem from time series analysis . These now seem like common-sense to forecasters, but they were revolutionary ideas in 1982 . Even today, I often have to explain to other academics why forecasting is not just an application of time series analysis. ". The author indirectly states that time series analysis is focused on the mathematical properties of models rather than on models that produce the best forecasts. Restricting our focus to univariate time series analysis with ARIMA, what does it mean for ARIMA time series analysis to be focused on the mathematical properties of models (as opposed to focused on best forecasts)?
