There are two types of clustering: hard and soft. Hard is when you assign a specific data point to a single cluster/category. So if there are $k$ clusters, a data point $x$ can only be assigned to one cluster in $\{1,..., k\}$. Soft/fuzzy is when a data point is assigned to multiple clusters, and the assignment is represented with membership weights, such that all the weights add up to 1. So for example if there are 3 clusters, a datapoint $x$ can have weights $w = [0.1,0.6,0.3]$ such that $0.1 + 0.6 + 0.3 = 1$. You can also use the weights representation in the hard clustering case, so you'd only have $w = [1, 0, 0]$, where one component is 1 and the rest are zero (this is also referred to as one-hot encoding). Any sort of dimensionality reduction, linear or non-linear, reduces the dimensions of the input features from $n$ to say $m Assuming I understand your question correctly, your question is whether with an auto-encoder the components of $x'$ can represent cluster membership weights, i.e. $x' = w$. However, this is extremely unlikely to be the case. Typically, to obtain clusters, you can later run any clustering algorithm on the dimensionally reduced data, regardless whether it was obtained from a linear or non-linear dimensionality reduction technique.
