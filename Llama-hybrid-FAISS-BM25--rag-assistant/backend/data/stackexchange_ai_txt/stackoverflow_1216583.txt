In lieu of a nice solution the following hacky approach works in the viewWillAppear:animated for( MyMapAnnotation *aMKAnn in [myMapView annotations]) { //dodgy select then deselect each annotation [myMapView selectAnnotation:aMKAnn animated:NO]; [myMapView deselectAnnotation:aMKAnn animated:NO]; } the selectedAnnotations array does have 1 value but deselecting that value still did not close the call out? So I simply iterate through all annotations and select and deselect. I don't have many annotations so probably not too bad a performance hit? I would appreciate an elegant solution if anyone has better ideas?
