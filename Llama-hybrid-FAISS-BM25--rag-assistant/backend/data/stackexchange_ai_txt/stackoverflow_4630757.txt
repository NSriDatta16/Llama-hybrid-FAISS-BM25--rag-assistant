MYSQL different conditions in a single query

Hello I have following columns in mysql table: rating1, rating2, price, cond, approved Is it possible to select results like this: select average rating1 + rating2 as total_rating, average rating1 as rating1, average rating2 as rating2, average price if cond = '1' as price_used average price if cond = '2' as price_new where approved = '1' So far I have: SELECT (AVG(t.rating1) + AVG(t.rating2)) / 2 AS total_rating AVG(t.rating1) AS rating1, AVG(t.rating2) AS rating2, ---- price statements?? ---- FROM t WHERE 1=1 AND t.approved = '1' Many thanks and excuse me for my English
