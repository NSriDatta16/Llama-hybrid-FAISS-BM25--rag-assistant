Is there a simple way of populating dropdown in this Access Database schema?

I have 3 tables which look like this: Location Node Sektor ----- ------- ------- PK: ID - Autonumber PK: ID - Autonumber PK: ID - Autonumber Name NodeName Sektor Height Aksess Frequency Latitude Tag Coverage Longtitude IP Each location is connected with multiple nodes which is connected with multiple sektors. Now the interesting part. In Microsoft Access you can make schemas which allows users to easily add data. I have the final table looking like this which I want to use my schema to insert data into: Customers ------- PK: CustID Name Subscribtion Sektor This is where I want the magic to be done. I want the user to be able to first select a location, then be presented with available nodes (preferably in dropdown) and finally he can pick the correct sektor for the customer hes adding. Anyone know a fairly easy way of doing this? I started making a macro for this, but my memory of macros are really bad atm, and I dont have the correct literature with me atm to look it up. Any help appriciated =)
