Let's imagine a randomized experiment for the effect of treatment $A$ on outcome $Y$ with measured covariate $X$ . (You can also imagine a sample that has already been matched or weighted so that it resembles a randomized experiment based on the adjusted-for covariates; everything I say here applies.) We'll define the conditional ATE (CATE) at $X=x$ as $$ E[Y|A=1,X=x] - E[Y|A=0,X=x] $$ and the marginal ATE (ATE) as $$ E_X[E[Y|A=1,X]] - E_X[E[Y|A=0,X]] $$ If you fit the linear model $$ E[Y|A,X] = \beta_0 + \tau A + \beta_1 X $$ then $\hat\tau$ is an estimate of the CATEs, which are assumed to be equal no matter what value $X$ takes. It also happens to be equal to the estimate of the ATE. If the true CATEs differ across $X$ , then your estimates of the CATE will be biased. However, your estimate of the ATE will be unbiased. If you instead fit the linear model $$ E[Y|A,X] = \beta_0 + \tau A + \beta_1 X + \beta_2 AX $$ then the estimated CATEs are allowed to vary as $\text{CATE}(x) = \hat\tau + \hat\beta_2x$ and the ATE is the average of the CATEs across the sample, which is equal to $\hat\tau + \hat\beta_2\bar X$ . In this case, it is possible to estimate CATEs and the ATE when adjusting for covariates. If the true model is linear and the CATEs vary across $X$ , then your estimates of the CATEs and ATE will be unbiased. What if the true data-generating is not linear, but instead has a curvilinear shape that is not captured by your linear model, and the true CATEs differ across $X$ ? We already know that your estimate of the CATEs will be biased if you fit the first model when the true CATEs vary across $X$ . If we fit the second model, the estimates of the CATEs will still be biased. You have to get the form of the model right to validly estimate CATEs . However, no matter what form the true outcome model takes, the estimates of the ATE will be unbiased regardless of which model you use; the model exists solely to increase the precision of the estimate. This is the reason many causal inference-focused statisticians prefer to estimate the ATE over CATEs. Given the conservative assumptions that CATEs vary across levels of covariates and that the relationship between the covariates and outcome is nonlinear, many believe it is impossible to validly estimate CATEs without making extreme modeling assumptions, and one's estimates of the CATEs will vary largely based on the modeling choices you make. However, none of that is so with ATEs. In a randomized experiment (or a sample that has been adequately matched or weighted in such a way that the simple difference in outcome means is unbiased for the causal effect), no matter what assumptions you make on true outcome model, your estimate of the ATE will be unbiased. Frank Harrell's criticism of this outlook as described in the comments to OP is that the ATE is always estimated with reference to some population, but in the absence of a probability sample, that population is ambiguous or nonexistent, in which case it doesn't matter that your ATE is unbiased for the population in which it is estimated. In contrast, if you somehow get the true outcome model correct and can estimate the CATEs, they will be valid no matter what the source of the sample is or whether it is representative. In addition, CATEs provide more useful information about the prognosis for individual patients, which is more useful in medical decision making. My impression is that researchers who prefer the ATE would argue that the assumption that the study population is representative of some meaningful population is more tenable than the assumption that the outcome model is correctly specified, which is necessary for valid interpretation of the CATEs.
