Random Forest and Cross Validation

If I use cross-validation for the training and evaluation of a Random Forest model, do I NOT bag the data? If cross validation is used and not bagging (assuming this is a correct approach), are the trees in the forest constructed using one fold at a time per forest construction (bagging is done prior to the construction of each tree in the forest)? CV performance is determined by taking the average of the fold results. How is the final model determined? The forest constructed from each fold will be different. Which forest (or combination of forests) is used for predictions?
