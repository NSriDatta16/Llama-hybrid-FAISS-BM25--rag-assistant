What does this software quote mean?

I was reading Code Complete (2nd Edition), and came across a quote in the margin on page 87 by Bertrand Meyer. Ask not first what the system does; ask WHAT it does it to! What exactly is the point Mr. Meyer is trying to get across here. I have some rough ideas, but I would like to make sure I really understand.
