Do we need fixed effects in Neural Networks?

I have a background in econometrics, and generally when we are working with panel data (i.e. there's a time-series as well as a cross-sectional dimension), we would include fixed or random effects. Usually this is in the context of working with linear methods though. I recently started working with some of the ML methods such as Neural networks and random forests. I was wondering how fixed-effects fit into this framework? E.g. do we still need them?
