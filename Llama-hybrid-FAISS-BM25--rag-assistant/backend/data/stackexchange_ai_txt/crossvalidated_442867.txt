Difference between Bayesian Optimization and Bayesian Statistical Inference

Can someone give a lucid explanation pointing out how are Bayesian Optimization and Bayesian Statistical Inference different to each other? Can they be seen as complementary to each other or are they overlapping with each other? Any interesting insight regarding their intersection is welcome. I understand Bayesian Optimization generally refers to Gaussian Process and fitting GPs on your data. Bayesian Statistical Inference involves computing posterior from your data and then use that posterior to compute various expected quantities, or one can just refer to Gelman's book . I have to talk about these terms to a researcher and I don't want to come off as amateurish.
