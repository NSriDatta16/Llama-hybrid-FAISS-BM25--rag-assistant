Is there a firm mathematical foundation for a multi-variate clinical trial?

In a traditional clinical trial, there is normally one variable under investigation. Are there any existing mathematical foundations for testing two or more variables in a clinical trial setting? The reason I ask? There are many diseases that require multiple biomarkers to be pushed back into the optimum range before the symptoms of the disease will recede. The answer not only has to be mathematically correct, it must be simple enough to persuade non-mathematical people in a healthcare regulatory setting to accept a multivariate clinical trial. The perfect answer would be a simple, compelling paragraph, with appropriate references to well respected peer-reviewed papers. As existing clinical trials usually operate under a frequentist assumption, the ideal answer would make minimal changes to the traditional methods. p.s. This answer could save millions of lives , and improve the health of millions more, by allowing clinical trials that can deal with health interventions that involve more than one variable.
