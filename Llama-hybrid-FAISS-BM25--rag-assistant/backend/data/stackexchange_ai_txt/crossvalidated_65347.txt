A possible solution is to pick a set of Z data available from other campaigns and use it for this one. If you believe that there is a relationship between Y and Z and there are theoretically sound reasons for it, then the particular sample of Z you use is irrelevant, assuming the sample is large enough. Now, if this bugs you and you don't want to pick a set of Z data arbitrarily, just use an average of all sets available. Hope this helps, Arman
