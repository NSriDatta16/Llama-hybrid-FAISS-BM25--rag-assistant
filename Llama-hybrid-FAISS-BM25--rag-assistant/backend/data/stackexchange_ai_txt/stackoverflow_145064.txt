YUV Conversion via a fragment shader

I have implemented a YUV to RGB conversion via a fragment shader written in Nvidia's shader language. (Y, U and V are stored in separate textures that are combined via multi texturing in my fragment shader). It works great under OpenGL, but under Direct3D I just can't get the output image to look right. I'm starting to suspect that Direct3D is somehow modifying the Y, U and V samples before I get a chance to do my YUV conversion thing. Does anyone know if Direct3D makes any modifications to the values stored in textures before the fragment shader is run and how to disable them>?
