UISearchBar delegate not called when used as UINavigationBar titleVIew?

I have a UITableViewController that I have specified as a UISearchBarDelegate. Up until now, I had programmatically added the UISearchBar to the headerView of the table, and there were no problems. I began to run out of screen real estate, so I decided to kill my normal UINavigationController title (which was text), and added the following code, moving my SearchBar from the table to the UINavigationBar: // (Called in viewDidLoad) // Programmatically make UISearchBar UISearchBar *tmpSearchBar = [[UISearchBar alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0,0,320,45)]; tmpSearchBar.delegate = self; tmpSearchBar.showsCancelButton = YES; tmpSearchBar.autocorrectionType = UITextAutocorrectionTypeNo; tmpSearchBar.autocapitalizationType = UITextAutocapitalizationTypeNone; [self set_searchBar:tmpSearchBar]; [tmpSearchBar release]; self.navigationItem.titleView = [self _searchBar]; This code works as expected - my UINavigationBar is now a UISearchBar. However, my delegate method: /** Only show the cancel button when the keyboard is displayed */ - (void) searchBarDidBeginEditing:(UISearchBar*) lclSearchBar { lclSearchBar.showsCancelButton = YES; } ...is no longer being called. I've breakpointed, and I've confirmed that the UISearchBar's delegate is indeed self, the view controller. Oddly, this delegate method is still called just fine: /** Run the search and resign the keyboard */ - (void) searchBarSearchButtonClicked:(UISearchBar *)lclSearchBar { _deepSearchRan = NO; [self runSearchForString:[[self _searchBar] text] isSlowSearch:NO]; [lclSearchBar resignFirstResponder]; } Any ideas why UINavigationBar is swallowing my delegate calls?? What am I missing?
