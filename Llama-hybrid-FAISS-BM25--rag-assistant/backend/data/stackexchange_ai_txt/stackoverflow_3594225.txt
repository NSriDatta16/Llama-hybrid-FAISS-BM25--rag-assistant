Making php very fast on shared hosting

im using shared hosting and would like to use some kind of opcache library like eaccelerator etc. The problem is i have no permissions to install some of these on server. im looking for some way of optimizing php without having to use PEAR/installing etc. has anyone been able to optimize php on shared hosting and if so, how did you do it. im open to all answers. thanx
