First, you are making a prediction for a Frankenstein of hypothetical case when calculating for the average person. For example, your average person in this dataset in half female and half male! This does not make much sense. If you set the categorical variables to their base values, this would work somewhat better (especially coupled with carefully chosen base levels): margins, at((mean) _continuous (base) _factor) Personally, I would just calculate the average of the predictions (rather than a prediction for the average person) with: margins This will give you the same prediction from both models: .1696667. The difference you see with your code is both because you have a different average person and a different model when you take distance into account. You can get much closer predictions if you evaluate at own value of distance, keeping other variables at their means. This is much more of an apples-to-apples comparison (though a slight difference remains since by including distance you are changing the variance and the coefficients are scaled by the standard deviation of the error): . use http://www.stata-press.com/data/r13/margex, clear (Artificial data for margins) . qui logit outcome i.sex age i.group distance . margins, at((mean) sex age group (asobserved) distance) Predictive margins Number of obs = 3,000 Model VCE : OIM Expression : Pr(outcome), predict() at : 0.sex = .4993333 (mean) 1.sex = .5006667 (mean) age = 39.799 (mean) 1.group = .3996667 (mean) 2.group = .3726667 (mean) 3.group = .2276667 (mean) ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | Delta-method | Margin Std.
