Two iPhone Dev Licenses on one Mac?

I have an odd situation. I have a macbook that I use for work and I am an approved iPhone developer, etc. I would like to build iPhone apps to put out under my name (they should be kept and tracked separately from the work license I have, since that really belongs to the organization and not me), but I don't want to buy another mac. Can I create another admin user account on my Macbook that would be used with another (personal) developer certificate, or can there only be one dev license per machine?
