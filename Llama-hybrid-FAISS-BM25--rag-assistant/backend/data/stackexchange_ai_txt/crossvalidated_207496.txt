Proposal distribution - Metropolis Hastings MCMC

In Metropolis-Hastings Markov chain Monte Carlo, the proposal distribution can be anything including the Gaussian (according to the Wikipedia). Q: What's the motivation for using anything other than Gaussian? Gaussian works, it's easy to evaluate, it's fast and everybody understands it. Why would I consider anything else? Q: Since the proposal distribution can be anything, can I use an uniform distribution?
