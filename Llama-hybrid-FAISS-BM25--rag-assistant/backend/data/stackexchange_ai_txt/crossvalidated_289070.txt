Just want to make sure that the weak linear relationship has been established visually as well? See post on datasaurus package in R that uses the anscombe data to show that it's possible to get same summary statistics on completely different data. If from domain knowledge or by intuition you know some variables should impact the outcome and yet the model performance does not improve I would suggest a couple of things: Feature engineering: In one of the famous R datasets - heightweight , a square interaction term of weightLb describes the heightIn better than the column without an transform Model selection: vary say linear model to linear mixed effects model or GAM etc
