Damerau–Levenshtein distance for language specific quirks

To Dutch speaking people the two characters "ij" are considered to be a single letter that is easily exchanged with "y". For a project I'm working on I would like to have a variant of the Damerau–Levenshtein distance that calculates the distance between "ij" and "y" as 1 instead of the current value of 2. I've been trying this myself but failed. My problem is that I do not have a clue on how to handle the fact that both texts are of different lengths. Does anyone have a suggestion/code fragment on how to solve this? Thanks.
