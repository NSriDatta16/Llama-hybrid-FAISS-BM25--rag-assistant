I usually use a variant on: arg0=$(basename $0 .sh) error() { echo "$arg0: $@" 1>&2 exit 1 } [ -f $FILE2 ] || error "$FILE2 not found" [ -f $FILE1 ] || error "$FILE1 not found" There's no particular virtue in making the shell script have a single exit point - no harm either, but fatal errors may as well terminate the script. The only point of debate would be whether to diagnose as many problems as possible before exiting, or whether to just diagnose the first. On average, diagnosing just the first is a whole lot easier.
