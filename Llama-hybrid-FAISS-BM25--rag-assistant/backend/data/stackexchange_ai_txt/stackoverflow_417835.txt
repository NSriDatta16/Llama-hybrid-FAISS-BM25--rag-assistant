Lost decimal precision and scale using LINQ and stored procedure with output parameters

I have a stored procedure that uses output parameters like this: ALTER PROCEDURE [GetAmount] ( @orderID [int], @totalcost decimal(18,2) OUTPUT ) SELECT @totalcost = cost FROM mytable WHERE orderID = @orderID When I drag the stored procedure onto the designer, the resulting code in the designer.cs file ends up losing the precision and scale, like this: [Parameter(DbType="Decimal")] ref System.Nullable totalcost This is a problem, because things like product prices and order totals are being rounded up (i.e. 19.95 becomes 20). Now, I can manually correct the .cs file, but I'd have to remember to do it every time an update is made. Am I doing something wrong? Is there a way to change my stored procedure that would enable LINQ to automatically detect precision and scale?
