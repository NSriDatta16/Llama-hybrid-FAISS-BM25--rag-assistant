In this case, where your data is simply overwhelmed by the number of zeros, IMO it makes the most sense to split this into a frequency model and a severity model. I.e. something like a logistic regression (or whatever such model you prefer) for whether the data is non-zero, and then a separate model on the severity conditioned on the weight being non-zero. (Edit: removed my misunderstanding of the problem). What exactly are you trying to do?
