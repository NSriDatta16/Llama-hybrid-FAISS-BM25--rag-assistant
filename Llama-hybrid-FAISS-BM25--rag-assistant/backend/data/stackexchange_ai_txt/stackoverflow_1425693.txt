Switching back from horizontal view causes iPhone application to crash

Here is my problem: - I have one navcontroller and inside it one tabbar controller with 4 view controller. - I want to add following functionality: - On landscapeRight to dismiss navcontroller, tabbar controller and everything and load whole new controller - this one goes ok, here is the code: - (BOOL) shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation:(UIInterfaceOrientation)toInterfaceOrientation { MyAppDelegate *appDelegate = (MyAppDelegate *)[[UIApplication sharedApplication] delegate]; // Just delete the lines for the orientations you don't want to support if(toInterfaceOrientation == UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeLeft) { [appDelegate ToHorizontalAverageResponseView:self]; } return YES; } Here is the code in the App Delegate: - (void)ToHorizontalAverageResponseView:(id)sender { HorizontalResponseViewController *tempController = [[HorizontalResponseViewController alloc] initWithNibName:nil bundle:nil]; [self setHorizontalResponseViewController: tempController]; [tempController release]; //[UIApplication sharedApplication].statusBarOrientation = UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeRight; // View rotation transformation CGAffineTransform landscapeTransform = CGAffineTransformMakeRotation( M_PI * 90.0 / 180.0 ); [[horizontalResponseViewController view] setTransform:landscapeTransform]; [window addSubview:[horizontalResponseViewController view]]; } The question is how to transfer back to portrait view and all those navbar and tabbar controllers? Thx, Mladen
