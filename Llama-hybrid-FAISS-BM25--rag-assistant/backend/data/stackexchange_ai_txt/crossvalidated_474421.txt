Question about Marginalizing Distributions from CMU 10-701, HWK3, Problem #3

I have a question about a pseudocode write-up from an online course that I've been following. Currently I am going over the Bayes Nets section. Here are the links to the homework and it's solution key: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/10701_sp11/hw/3/hw3.pdf http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/10701_sp11/hw/3/hw3_sol.pdf Specifically, question 3(a). In my initial writeup, I had began my algorithm construction as this: In the numerator, I converted this to a nested sum over $X_2,\dots, X_{(n-1)}$ of the joint probability distribution $P(X_1,\dots,X_n)$ . Then we could use our Conditional Independence assumptions for Bayes Nets to break up this joint distribution: In which case, our pseudocode would just be undoing this summation and dividing by our prior $P(X_1 = 1)$ . However this didn't seem to be completely correct. In the homework solution for 3(a), the author only sums over $X_{(n-1)}$ . What rules of probability are being used here that allows us to ignore the other summations?
