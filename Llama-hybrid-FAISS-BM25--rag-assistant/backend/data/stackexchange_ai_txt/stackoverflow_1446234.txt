I would go with a mixed web & local storage approach. 1) The users answers would be stored locally on the iphones using the Core Data capabilities. 2) Once the phones are collected at the end of the conference, you will navigate to a password protected "Admin" view that will allow you to "Upload Results" to your web server for aggregation. Once the results are sent to the web server, they can be deleted from the iphones storage. The storage capabilities exposed with Core Data are very stable and reliable, I would not worry about losing data if the app crashes. Feel free to comment if you have any questions.
