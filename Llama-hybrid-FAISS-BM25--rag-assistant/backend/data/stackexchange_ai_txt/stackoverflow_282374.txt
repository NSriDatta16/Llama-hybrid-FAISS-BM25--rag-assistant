You could also do it with a temp table: SELECT TOP 3 Name FROM PuppyNames ORDER BY NumberOfVotes DESC becomes CREATE TABLE #RowNumberTable ( RowNumber int IDENTITY (1,1), PuppyName varchar(MAX) ) INSERT #RowNumberTable (PuppyName) SELECT TOP 3 Name FROM PuppyNames ORDER BY NumberOfVotes DESC SELECT * from #RowNumberTable ORDER BY RowNumber DROP TABLE #RowNumberTable If you'll notice, your SELECT statement is in there. It is just surrounded by stuff that makes the row numbers work.
