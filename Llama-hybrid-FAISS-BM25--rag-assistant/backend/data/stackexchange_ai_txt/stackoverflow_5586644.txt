Is there a "Code Coverage" equivalent for SQL databases?

I have a database with many tables that get used, and many tables that are no longer used. While I could sort through each table manually to see if they are still in use, that would be a cumbersome task. Is there any software/hidden feature that can be used on a SQL Server/Oracle database that would return information like "Tables x,y,z have not been used in the past month" "Tables a,b,c have been used 17 times today"? Or possibly a way to sort tables by "Date Last Modified/Selected From"? Or is there a better way to go about doing this? Thanks edit: I found a "modify_date" column when executing "SELECT * FROM sys.tables ORDER BY modify_date desc", but this seems to only keep track of modifications to the table's structure, not its contents.
