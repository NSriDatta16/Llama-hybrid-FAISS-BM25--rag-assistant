Something to try... When a SSRS subscription is create a job gets created under SQL Server Agent\Jobs. The job name looks like a guid so it's not easy to tell one subscription from another. But you can right click on the job and the "Script Job as" options are available. I'm sure someone with more T-SQL could come up with a neat little script that does everything for you. But that would be a whole new question. :) Note: I know this for sure with SSRS 2005 I would image 2008 is similar.
