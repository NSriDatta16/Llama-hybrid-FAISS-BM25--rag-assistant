For 5 point Likert scale questions and binary dependent variable, which regression analysis should I use?

For 5 point Likert scale questions and binary (0 or 1) dependent variable, which regression analysis should I use? Can I use a binary logistic regression on SPSS? There are two or three questions to measure one independent variable. I run a factor analysis after that two questions are tied together. Now should I make another column in SPSS data sheet to find average value of both tied questions? And use that average value in regression analysis? If do average then average will come into points for example, 2.5, 3.5 etc. Is this points coding OK to run regression analysis?
