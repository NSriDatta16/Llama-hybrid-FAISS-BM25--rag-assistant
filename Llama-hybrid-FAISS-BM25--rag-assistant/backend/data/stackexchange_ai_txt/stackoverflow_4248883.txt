I don't think there is 100% secure way to prevent the users from downloading whatever they see on their devices (like the flash videos). There are ways to make it hard on average users, but it won't prevent the expert users from doing it. One way to make it annoying/hard for people to download your flash movies is by splitting the flash movie into smaller parts, which (each part) on loading delete the previously loaded part.
