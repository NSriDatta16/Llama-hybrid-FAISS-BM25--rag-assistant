The x and y in equation 4 are the predictor and response variables so it's the ratio of standard deviations in predictor and response. That doesn't help you much though because these formulas are for an ordinary regression analysis and do not apply to logistic regression. There is no equation for logistic regression to derive the correlations directly from coefficients because you don't calculate Pearson's r for logistic response data (just 0's and 1's). You can calculate things that look like it from the data—usually using a modified t-test where you flip dependent and independent variables—but it's probably best to just interpret the t-ratio directly since that's already a standardized value.
