It is hard to tell what you are doing, so I will make an assumption that "CHASERS", "DEALERS", and "RICH" each stand for one unit. Yes, it would make sense to say that "CHASERS" was \$263.33 below average and that the other two were above average. You also can calculate the z-score by dividing that value by the standard deviation of those three numbers, giving you a z-score of $-0.6983416$ . With so few observations, I have difficulty interpreting this, but a z-score should give some idea of how far from the mainstream of the rest of the data a given point is.
