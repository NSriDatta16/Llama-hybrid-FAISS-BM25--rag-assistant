The Dickey-Fuller test has the null hypothesis $$\text{H}_{0}\text{: The time series has unit root},$$ with the alternative hypothesis $$\text{H}_{\text{A}}\text{: The time series is stationary.}$$ Caveat: evidence in favor of 'stationary' in the alternative hypothesis is agnostic regarding weak or strong stationarity. You fail to reject $\text{H}_{0}$ of the Dickey-Fuller test for r2 because r2 is a random walk and has a unit root (i.e. was generated by a process conforming to $\text{H}_{0}$ ). You fail to reject $\text{H}_{0}$ of the Dickey-Fuller test for lin because each observation of lin at time $t$ 'looks like' the value of the observation at $t-1$ plus a perturbation. The Dickey-Fuller test as you have specified it tests whether the estimated value of $\beta=0$ under the null in: $$\Delta y_{t} = \alpha +\beta y_{t-1} + \varepsilon _{t}$$ As the value of $\Delta y_{t}$ in lin is uncorrelated with the value of $y_{t-1}$ , there is no evidence to reject a hypothesized value of $\beta=0$ . You fail to reject $\text{H}_{0}$ of the Dickey-Fuller test for cons because there is no variation in the outcome. Here $\Delta y_t = 0$ at every point in time, and while it does not matter whether $\alpha = 0$ or not, $\beta=0$ for sure. The missing test statistic results from not having any variance estimate ( $\varepsilon=0$ also). These results, (along with the test rejecting the null for r1 ) are consistent with Stata's dfuller working correctly.
