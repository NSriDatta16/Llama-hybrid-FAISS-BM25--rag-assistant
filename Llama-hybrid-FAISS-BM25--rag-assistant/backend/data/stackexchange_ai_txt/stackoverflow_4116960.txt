The stage and document object will have a loaderInfo property. LoaderInfo has a parameters attribute which is an object of the query-string parameters passed to the script via the file reference (file.swif? query=string ). For a larger parameter length, you can use query=string " /> as it can contain any length of characters (vs the cap of 65535 chars for a path). You may need to listen for the Event.ADDED_TO_STAGE event to fire before the stage and parameters are accessible via ActionScript. There are a number of ways to get cookies in flash. You can request data from a the server using a URLLoader . The data can contain the cookie information. You can request data from JavaScript using ExternalInterface.call() . This will allow you to get/set the current cookie information with JavaScript. You can use ActionScript's native LocalSharedObject aka "Flash Cookie" to store information. Be very careful of how much data storage you need and what information you store about a user.
