Problem sharing domain model between WCF and Silverlight Project

I am writing a Large Scale Silverlight Application. I am currently writing the data retrieval elements. I have now encoutered and issue. I have a common Project that hold objects, this project is referenced by both the UI and the WCF service. The UI requires INotifyPropertyChanged for binding purposes. Now the WCF must use the same objects, but I am getting a compiler error saying "The type 'System.ComponentModel.INotifyPropertyChanged' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced." EDIT: The error is in the WCF service. I want one object class, how do I solve this problem? diagram http://www.pcbuyersguide.co.za/picture.php?albumid=19&pictureid=1708 Thanks -Oliver
