One approach is for your Spring configuration file to be composed of fragments related to specific layers in your application. One such fragment could contain your DataSource defintion. For production, this fragment would use a jee:jndi-lookup . And then for test, have a different fragment would use a DriverManagerDataSource ? Update: If you want to change the datasource after deployment, then you can use this technique, along with changing the which datasource is injected into your other beans using a PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer as explained in an old post I wrote eg: ... # the properties file the.datasource.to.inject = jndiDataSource #the.datasource.to.inject = driverManagerDataSource
