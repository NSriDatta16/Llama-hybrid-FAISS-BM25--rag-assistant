What is the meaning of the "." (dot) in R?

I'm just reading the book "R in a Nutshell". And it seems as if I skipped the part where the "." as in "sample.formula" was explained. > sample.formula Is sample an object with a field formula as in other languages? And if so, how can I find out, what other fields/functions this object has? (Type declaration) EDIT: I just found another confusing use of the ".": > svm(formula = is_spam~., data = spambase.training) (the dot between ~., )
