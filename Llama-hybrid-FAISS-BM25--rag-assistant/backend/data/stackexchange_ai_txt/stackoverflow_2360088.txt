Stripping HTML in SOLR for storage, not indexing

I have managed to strip HTML from content when indexing data in SOLR. But is it possible to strip HTML from data when simply storing data? This is my field: And, the field type "textNoHTML" implements the solr.HTMLStripCharFilterFactory: As I said, this works fine for indexing, but is it possible to apply a similar filter for storing? cheers!
