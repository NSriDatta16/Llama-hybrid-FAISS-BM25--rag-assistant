Which subject is more advanced and useful

I know this is an open-ended question but I'd like to leverage wisdom of the crowd to make an optimal decision. The case is, I never learned statistics until 2 years ago. Since then, I'm quite attracted to it and want to solidify my knowledge on the field by looking for some courses to enroll in. I came across these three which sound interesting. The problem is I can only afford to do one of them. So, if you have to choose, which one would you go for: This course uses Statistics: The Art and Science of Learning from Data , 4th Edition 2017 Alan Agresti, Christine Franklin, Bernhard Klingenberg as texbook. Upon successful completion of this subject students should be able to: Identify and justify statistical concepts and tools to analyse a real-world research problem. Use appropriate statistical techniques to conduct exploratory data analysis and present numerical and graphical summaries. Apply inferences from sample data to populations. Explain and relate the assumptions underlying the use of particular statistical techniques and check whether they are appropriate for a given data sample. Conduct statistical analysis and interpret associated computer output. This course uses K.Borovkov, Elements of stochastic modelling . and E. Platen, D. Heath, A benchmark approach to quantitative finance as textbooks. Upon successful completion of this subject students should be able to: Define and illustrate the terms used in probability and stochastic processes; Discuss and demonstrate the techniques of proof used in probability and some of the mathematical derivations that are important in the theory of stochastic processes; State and apply the basic limit theorems of probability; Demonstrate an ability to use mathematical techniques to analyse the behaviour of various stochastic processes, especially the long-run or steady state behaviour; Formulate and solve applied and theoretical problems involving probability and stochastic processes. This course is called Advanced Bayesian Methods. The subject outline doesn't spell out specific outcomes and no textbook nominated. Ideally, I want to learn how to learn something practical and useful for my role as safety analyst. I want to be able to use machine learning to model something such as how many accidents will happen given the historical data. Your advice would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance.
