On-ramps The on-ramps are web service based receive port but they are a bit different as they accepts generic XML messages. The messages will however have a very special SOAP header (a "envelope" if you will) with all the necessary properties to make for example message itinerary possible, You'll find all the possible header by having look in "EsbEnvGeneric.xsd" itineraries I like NealWalter reply on this on. I however just like to add the message itinerary approach can potential save a lot of time and development effort. It can make an organizations more agile and ease change in their processes. If we don't have to develop and deploy a whole new orchestration but only change some configuration and use our existing bits that can of course save a lot of time. And this is the big value in a ESB and message itinerary as I see it. Message Box Messages in BizTalk always have to go via the message box. In the next version MS have been hinting about a low latency scenario in BizTalk - maybe then we can gain a bit more control, But more but for now messages get persisted many times on their way through BizTalk and there is nothing to about that.
