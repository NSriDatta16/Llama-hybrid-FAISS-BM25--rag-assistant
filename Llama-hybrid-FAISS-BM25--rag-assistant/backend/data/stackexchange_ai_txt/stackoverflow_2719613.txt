Obviously someone didn't pay attention in programming class when they covered Arrays... $this->adressline1 = $result['FastAddressResult']['Results']['Address']['Line1']; or convert the array to an stdClass first: $data = (object) $myarray; but you'd have to do that for all the arrays in that too, so no.
