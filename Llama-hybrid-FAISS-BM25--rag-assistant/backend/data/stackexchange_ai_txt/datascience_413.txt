Dimensionality reduction is typically choosing a basis or mathematical representation within which you can describe most but not all of the variance within your data, thereby retaining the relevant information, while reducing the amount of information necessary to represent it. There are a variety of techniques for doing this including but not limited to PCA , ICA , and Matrix Feature Factorization . These will take existing data and reduce it to the most discriminative components.These all allow you to represent most of the information in your dataset with fewer, more discriminative features. Feature Selection is hand selecting features which are highly discriminative. This has a lot more to do with feature engineering than analysis, and requires significantly more work on the part of the data scientist. It requires an understanding of what aspects of your dataset are important in whatever predictions you're making, and which aren't. Feature extraction usually involves generating new features which are composites of existing features. Both of these techniques fall into the category of feature engineering. Generally feature engineering is important if you want to obtain the best results, as it involves creating information that may not exist in your dataset, and increasing your signal to noise ratio.
