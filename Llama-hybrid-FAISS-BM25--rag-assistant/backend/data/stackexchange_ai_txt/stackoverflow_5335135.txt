A fantastic example of EAV in MySQL is Magento's database architecture. They have recently started replacing tables with flattened versions, but up until 1.2 nearly all of the tables were EAV-based. Magento utilizes InnoDB heavily for transactions, and MyISAM where appropriate for fulltext indexes.
