Canvas is inappropriate for adding to Swing components. Use JComponent instead (and setOpaque(true) ). Swing components should always be manipulated on the AWT Event Dispatch Thread (EDT). Use java.awt.EventQueue.invokeLater ( invokeAndWait for applets). You shouldn't do any blocking operations from the EDT, so start your own threads for that. By default you are running in the main thread (or applet thread for applets), which is quite separate from the EDT. I suggest removing any dependence from your MyCanvas to JFrame . I also suggest keeping code for applications using frame separate from that using applets. Adding a component to a JApplet is the same as for JFrame (in both cases there is shenanigans where actually what happens is that add actually calls getContentPane().add which can cause some unnecessary confusion). The main difference is that you can't pack an applet.
