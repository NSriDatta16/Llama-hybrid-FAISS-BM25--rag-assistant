Opera Dragonfly vs. Firebug

I'm Opera user for browsing and Firefox user for developing. Simply I can't work without Firebug and any other tools doesn't fit for me. Geeks from Opera often offers to use Dragonfly which purpose is almost the same like Firebug (JS debugger, DOM/CSS inspector, JS console, page load analysis, etc.). I've tried Dragonfly but returned to Firebug because of these reasons: Firebug loads faster than Dragonfly (ex. when inspecting element); Dragonfly doesn't have (or I have not found) how quickly disable some property of css. On FB you simply need click an icon next to prop. It already has. I'm interested does anyone uses Dragonfly instead ob FB or any other tool? Why (not)? What main differences you see between these both tools?
