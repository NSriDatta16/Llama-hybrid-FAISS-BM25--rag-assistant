Pseudoreplication & mixed effects with highly unbalanced dataset

I have a dataset with ~250 data points. When I regress Y on X1 and X2, X1 is a significant predictor of Y. However, about half the 250 points are pseudoreplicated; they come from locations with >1 observation and are not strictly independent. Normally, I would include a random slope for X1 and X2, but the half of the data that come from sites with just 1 replicate preclude that possibility. If I do the brute force approach of averaging Ys and Xs within sites, sample size is crushed and the effect is gone. Am I just out of luck without more data, or do I have any more options I haven't uncovered?
