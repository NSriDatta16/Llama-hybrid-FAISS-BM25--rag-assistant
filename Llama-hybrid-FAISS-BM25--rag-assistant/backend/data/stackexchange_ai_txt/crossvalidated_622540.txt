In games (e.g. poker) where luck/chance is a factor, should the more skilled player play more games with a lower stake?

I'm not sure if this is the right site for my question. In games (e.g. poker) where luck/chance is a factor, should the more skilled player play more games with a lower stake? Intuitively, yes, if you play a game that is 25% (or 75%) luck, luck will even out over many games, and the skilled player will win. Indeed, chat gpt agreed with me on that. But equally, this is mind blowingly important, if you are ever to take risks and gamble, and I've never seen it said, as a gambler's maxim make many small bets, if you are good at betting Part of my incredulity stems from wondering how much luck is involved in a million games of anything involving any skill?
