I would like to differ from what you think about Chi-Sq test. It is applicable even if the data is not binomial. It's based on the asymptotic normality of mle (in most of the cases). I would do a logistic regression like this: $$\log \frac {\hat{\pi}} {1-\hat{\pi}} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times D_1 + \beta_2 \times D_2$$ where $D_1$ and $D_2$ are dummy variables. $D_1 = D_2 = 0 \implies A, D_1 = 1, D_2 = 0 \implies B, D_1 = 1 D_2 = 1 \implies C$ $$H_o : \beta_0 = \beta_1 = \beta_2 = 0$$ Is the ANOVA equivalent if there is a relation or not. $$H_o : \beta_0 = 0$$ Is the test is A has some effect. $$H_o : \beta_1 - \beta_0 = 0$$ Is the test is B has some effect. $$H_o : \beta_2 - (\frac {\beta_0+\beta_1} {2}) = 0$$ Is the test is C has some effect. Now you can do further contrasts to find our what you are interested in. It is still a chi-sq test, but with different degrees of freedom (3, 1, 1, and 1, respectively)
