Creating a reference group to have equal sample sizes for Wilcoxon signed rank test

I am analyzing three years' worth of data. For some descriptive analysis, I want to know if there is a difference in the median between, $year_1$ and $year_2$ compared to $year_3$ . To do this, I planned to average $year_1$ and $year_2$ , creating a comparable 12-month reference group with $year_3$ . I would then use the Wilcoxon signed rank test. Would this be a fair way to understand the data? The data is considered paired. Thank you for your feedback. Let me first state, this is a preliminary analysis for a larger interrupted time series analysis in which autocorrelation is account for (using ARIMA). Knowing this, would you still suggest the the Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney two sampled ranked sum test (from this initial phase)? And if so, it is acceptable to have unequal groups ( $n=24$ and $n=12$ )?Also, the rate are coming from one distinct location, which is why I first instinctively considered them paired. Edit: or is the creation of the (pre 12-month reference group still applicable) I appreciate your continued input and support.
