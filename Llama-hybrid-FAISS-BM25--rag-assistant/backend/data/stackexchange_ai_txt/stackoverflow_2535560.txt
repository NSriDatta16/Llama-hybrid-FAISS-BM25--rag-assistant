No matter what, you'll need to iterate through the array to find the match. This said, use the String.search() method to look for your word: var searchTerm:String = "whatever word you're looking for"; var foundItems:Array = new Array(); for each(var paragraph:String in paragraphArray) { if(paragraph.search(searchTerm) != -1) { foundItems.push(paragraph); } } return foundItems; EDIT : I tested with the following code, and it seemed to work ok. Edit #2 : I modified the previous snippet so it looked more like what you had in your comment. I broke out "searchF" and pointed to it from searchTerm in filterArray() .
