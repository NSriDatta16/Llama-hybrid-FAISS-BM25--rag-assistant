Any interesting OCR/NLP related projects for CS final year project?

I am a final year CS student, and very interested about OCR and NLP stuffs. The problem is I don't know anything about OCR yet and my project duration is only for 5 months. I would like to know OCR & NLP stuff that is viable for my project? Is writing a (simple) OCR engine for a single language too hard for my project? What about adding a language support for existing FOSS OCR softwares?
