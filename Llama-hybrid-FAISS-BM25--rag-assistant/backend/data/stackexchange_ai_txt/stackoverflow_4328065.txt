The disadvantages: devices with no flash but JS enabled will completely fail As @Lars pointed out in his comment, I think detecting Flash via JS is a failsafe way to inject different content(swf) for different platforms(OS, Browser, Flash Player version). The devices which have both Flash and JS disabled are the devices where all hell might break loose but that would be a very small percentage. I can't think of an easy way to circumvent that. people get lazy and don't provide fallback content. This obviously is very subjective. I have had very little experience using SwfObject but in my case, we were falling back to a pure HTML DOM based solution using lots of JS to simulate the module when we detected a NO FLASH situation. My point is that with SwfObject, providing alternative content is very easy and I dont see why any good developer wont do that. code is a mess if it needs to be cross-browser compatible. there are various bugs with common embed ( even youtube's ) and the "best" cross-browser seems to be nesting an object in an object per this. I realize though, I can use a server-side method and define the embedding code once and change it in one area, but this makes it not embeddable/usable in CMS textareas. I think i would agree on this one to an extent. Different embedding methods are a mess. There is this thread on StackOverflow discussing this issue: Best way to embed flash in html There are situations where there is no alternative but to use Flash, for instance: a File Uploader with upload percentage feedback (as the regular INPUT tag Type FILE is just too archaic). Granted there is the new way to do upload progress bar using just javascript but it wont work in you know IE :) In such situations, there is no way to get rid of Flash IMHO.
