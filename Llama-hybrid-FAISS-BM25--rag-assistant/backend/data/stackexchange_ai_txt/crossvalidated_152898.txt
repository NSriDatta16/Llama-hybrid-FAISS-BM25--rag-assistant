Take a look at Network science: Network properties at Wikipedia: Network density (i.e. ratio of edges to maximal possible number of edges, given the number of nodes) Average degree (i.e twice the average number of edges per node) See also: Densely connected networks - network-science.org and dense graph - Wikipedia . If you can scale your network, you can look at the behavior $E = a N^b$, searching for $a$ and $b$. For $b=2$ a network would be dense, for $b=1$ - sparse, and in between - opinions/definitions can vary.
