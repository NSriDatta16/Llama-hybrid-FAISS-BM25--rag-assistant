You can use dynamic_cast , as long as the vector contains Animal pointers. vector stuff; for(int i=0;i (stuff[i]); if(pDog) { // do whatever with the dog } Cat *pCat = dynamic_cast (stuff[i]); if(pCat) { // and so on } } but you should be aware that this is generally not the best practice. You should try to work with polymorphism, not against it. In other words, try to write a virtual Animal function that Dog and Cat override, and let the compiler automagically call the right one. (Also, dynamic_cast is relatively slow, so too many of them will hinder performance; whereas a virtual function call is general just a single instruction.)
