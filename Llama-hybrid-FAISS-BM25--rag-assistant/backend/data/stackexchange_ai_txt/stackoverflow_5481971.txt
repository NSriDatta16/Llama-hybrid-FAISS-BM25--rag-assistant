Without knowing more details it's hard to properly answer your question. Going to take a shot in the dark about a common issue. If you did it in Dreamweaver you probably used its interface to drag and drop div elements around to place them in exactly the right positions. The problem with this method is that DW will use positioning relative to your screen size and it might not show up too well on other resolutions. The solution to this is to make sure you code your containers correctly and not have a look at DW's CSS to fix it. Without the HTML of your page (post it in pastebin and link it here), can't give a better answer.
