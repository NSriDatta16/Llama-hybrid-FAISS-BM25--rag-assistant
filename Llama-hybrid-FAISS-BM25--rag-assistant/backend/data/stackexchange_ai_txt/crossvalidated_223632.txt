I'd suggest starting with "partial dependence" plots which essentially show the effect of each feature (or set of features) with all other effects averaged out. A gbm can capture complex multivariate feature interactions so this won't tell the whole story but it is a good place to start. Assuming you used the gbm package via carret the gbm.plot function can be used to make such plots.
