Are nested Try/Catch blocks a bad idea?

Let's say we have a structure like so: Try ' Outer try code, that can fail with more generic conditions, ' that I know less about and might not be able to handle Try ' Inner try code, that can fail with more specific conditions, ' that I probably know more about, and are likely to handle appropriately Catch innerEx as Exception ' Handle the inner exception End Try Catch outerEx as Exception ' Handle outer exception End Try I have seen some opinions that nesting Try blocks like this is discouraged, but I could not find any specific reasons. Is this bad code? If so, why?
