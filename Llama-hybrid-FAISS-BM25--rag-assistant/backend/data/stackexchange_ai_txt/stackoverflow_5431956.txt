How to access to the discount price in Magento?

I'm trying to rewrite a template for the cart. I need to retrieve the discount amount but I was not able to find where. Ie If my coupon code gives me $10 discount I want to retrieve 10, if I have a discount of 5% I want to retrieve 5 if the total price is $100. Thank you.
