Regression for an outcome (ratio or fraction) between 0 and 1

I am thinking of building a model predicting a ratio $a/b$, where $a \le b$ and $a > 0$ and $b > 0$. So, the ratio would be between $0$ and $1$. I could use linear regression, although it doesn't naturally limit to 0..1. I have no reason to believe the relationship is linear, but of course it is often used anyway, as a simple first model. I could use a logistic regression, although it is normally used to predict the probability of a two-state outcome, not to predict a continuous value from the range 0..1. Knowing nothing more, would you use linear regression, logistic regression, or hidden option c ?
