How does an associated database acquire its foreign key?

I did a bunch of gutting to my default controllers and now I can't get my user_id to populate on create. I was curious how that gets populated. If you're interested, take a look at my routes, and model assocations, and then at then end I'll show you the resulting params..The end result is no user_id being added. routes resources :users do resources :posts do collection do get :view end end end models #Post.rb belongs_to :user, :touch => true #User.rb has_many :posts I navigate to this url.. http://localhost:3001/users/1/posts/new and place my post, and the params return this : {"commit"=>"save", "post"=>{"name"=>"hell hath no furry", "category"=>"vegan", "url"=>"www.reddit.com", "text"=>"", "is_link"=>"1"}, "authenticity_token"=>"aYnSLgJ9E6MaM6iSkRrCyyiMZj06oLdybTMkNqss8FA=", "utf8"=>"âœ“", "action"=>"create", "controller"=>"posts"} This was working before, not sure why its not associating them anymore. Any ideas?
