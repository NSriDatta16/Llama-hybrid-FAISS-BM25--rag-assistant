Swiping a row in a tableview, clicking other, selects swiped

I have a tableview, and whenever I swipe a row in section A and after that select a row in section B, it thinks I selected the swiped row in section A! I placed a breakpoint to verify and am 100% sure that it thinks it's that cell AND that it calls it when I select the row in section B. By swipe I mean that you place your finger one some part of a cell, then drag it across (left or right, doesn't matter) and then release it. This doesn't call didSelectRowAtIndexPath, since it is not a tap. Example: Swipe on indexpath A.1 Tap on indexpath B.4 OS calls tableView:didSelectRowAtIndexPath: A.1 Am I doing something wrong? What could go wrong? Full code that handles touches in the specific cells: - (void) touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { RDLogString(@"(%p) Received touches began", self); moveCount = 0; UITouch * touch = [touches anyObject]; touchBegin = [touch locationInView: nil]; [[self nextResponder] touchesBegan: touches withEvent: event]; } - (void) touchesMoved: (NSSet * const)touches withEvent:(UIEvent * const)event { RDLogString(@"(%p) Received touches moved", self); moveCount++; [[self nextResponder] touchesMoved: touches withEvent: event]; } - (void) touchesEnded: (NSSet * const)touches withEvent:(UIEvent * const)event { RDLogString(@"(%p) Received touches ended", self); if(![self checkUserSwipedWithTouches: touches]){ [[self nextResponder] touchesEnded: touches withEvent: event]; } } - (BOOL) checkUserSwipedWithTouches: (NSSet * const) touches { CGPoint touchEnd = [[touches anyObject] locationInView: nil]; NSInteger distance = touchBegin.x - touchEnd.x; // This code shows an animation if the user swiped if(distance > SWIPED_HORIZONTAL_THRESHOLD){ [self userSwipedRightToLeft: YES]; return YES; } else if (distance
