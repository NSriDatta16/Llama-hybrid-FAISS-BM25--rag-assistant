GLM for proportion data in r

I have proportion data on the percentage of female employees in 500 organizations. I want to use GLM to explain this dependent variable using other independent variables such as company size, industry, etc. I used a GLM regression in Stata as recommended here . The stata model looks like this: glm PercentageFemale othervariables, link(logit) family(binomial) robust nolog However, when I try to replicate my results in R I get different results. My model in R looks like this: fitglm Where successes is the number of females in the company and failures the number of men. I know I can't use the percentage directly in R as I did in Stata, so I used cbind . I tried using glmrobust but an error saying the system is exactly singular occurs. Any ideas on how I can replicate my Stata results in R? Am I doing something wrong when I use cbind in R?
