Why is the variance of a Bernoulli distribution the product of its probability of 'success' and 'failure'?

Can anyone explain in simple terms why the variance of a Bernoulli distribution is: Var[X] = p(1 â€“ p)? More generally, why is the binomial distribution's variance the product of the number of trials, probability of success, and probability of failure, i.e. Var[X] = npq? Thank you for explaining this in the most pragmatic way possible. It's very appreciated
