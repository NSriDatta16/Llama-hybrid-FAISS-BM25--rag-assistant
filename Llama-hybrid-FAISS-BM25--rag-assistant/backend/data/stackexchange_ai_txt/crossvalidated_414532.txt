I would try a CNN architecture like U-net with following input planes : - one plane for signal strength with negative value for unknown value - N planes to encode the terrain type (with one-hot encoding) - one plane to encode towers (the float value can indicate the power of the antenna and 0 for no tower) All input planes have same dimensions than the area of interest.
