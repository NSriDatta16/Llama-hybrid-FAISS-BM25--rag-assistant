You're asking a very broad question. I like to compare scripting languages similarly to how I'd compare spoken languages, so in this case; what are the major differences and similarities between Spanish and Italian? If you ask that question, you're going to either get very varied or very long answers. Explaining differences between languages are difficult at best, as it's hard to pinpoint key factors. This is proved by the responses here so far, as well as the links other people have linked to. They're either varied or very long. Going back to the Spanish vs. Italian analogy, I could say that the languages are similar but still very different. If you (only) know one of them, you might be able to understand what's going on in the other, though you would probably not be able to use it very well. Knowing one definitely makes it easier for you to learn the other. One is used by a larger number of people, so you might benefit more from learning it. All of the previous paragraph can be applied to Java vs. Ruby as well. Saying that both are object oriented is like saying Spanish and Italian both are members of the Romanic language family. Of course, all of this is irrelevant. Most probably, your underlying question is whether it's "worth" learning Ruby instead of or in addition to Java. Unfortunately, there's no easy answer to that either. You have to weigh advantages and disadvantages with each language, such as popularity, demand and career opportunities. And then there's naturally the question of which language you prefer . You might like one language more than the other simply because it has a nicer syntax. (Similarly, you may prefer Italian because you think it's more "beautiful" than Spanish, even though the latter is more widespread and you'd have more "use" for it.) Personally, I prefer Ruby. For many different reasons. Just like I prefer Italian.
