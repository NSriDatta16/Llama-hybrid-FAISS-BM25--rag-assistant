Adjusting p-values (mixed effects logistic regression)?

Quick question regarding adjustung p-values.... I preformed a logistic mixed effects regression model and used Wald likelihood ratio test to select model parameters. I received comments back from a journal reviewer stating that I should use Holm-Bonferroni correction for p-values due to multiple comparisons.... I did not think that adjusted p-values were required when performing mixed effects logistic regression.... am I incorrect in my assumption? any comments/suggestions greatly appreciated, thanks
