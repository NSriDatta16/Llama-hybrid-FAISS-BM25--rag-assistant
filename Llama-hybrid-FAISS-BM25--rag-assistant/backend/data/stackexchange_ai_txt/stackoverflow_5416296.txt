Reading XML element with XmlSlurper in Groovy

I'd like to parse an XML document (SOAP request message) for a particular element. The document is stored in requestContent and looks as follows: 1 1 3 My Groovy code looks like this: def request = new XmlSlurper().parseText(requestContent) println request.ProvideUDBIdentityInformationRequest.RequestID However the output is empty whereas I would have expected a "1". Thanks, Robert
