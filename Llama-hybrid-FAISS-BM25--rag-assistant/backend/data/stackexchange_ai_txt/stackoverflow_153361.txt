PHP will support closures natively in 5.3. A closure is good when you want a local function that's only used for some small, specific purpose. The RFC for closures gives a good example: function replace_spaces ($text) { $replacement = function ($matches) { return str_replace ($matches[1], ' ', '&nbsp;').' '; }; return preg_replace_callback ('/( +) /', $replacement, $text); } This lets you define the replacement function locally inside replace_spaces() , so that it's not: 1) cluttering up the global namespace 2) making people three years down the line wonder why there's a function defined globally that's only used inside one other function It keeps things organized. Notice how the function itself has no name, it's simply defined and assigned as a reference to $replacement . But remember, you have to wait for PHP 5.3 :)
