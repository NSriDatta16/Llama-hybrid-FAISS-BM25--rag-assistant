I am not entirely sure if I follow your terminology. A SEM involves two parts: a measurement model and a structural model . If there is no measurement model then the method is called Path Analysis . If there is no structural model then in most cases it is just Factor Analysis . One of the most popular ways to set up a measurement model of an unobserved construct is through the latent common factor. Thus, Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) is an example of an analysis that uses a common latent factor but does not require a "SEM analysis". You are right in seeing composite scores and the common factor model as equivalent, as the first is just the latter with specific constraints and assumptions . One of these assumptions concerns the difference between formative indicators and reflexive indicators . In the first case, indicators form the underlying construct, i.e. they entirely determine it. In the second case, the indicators reflect an unobserved variable that causes them. Statistically speaking, this is usually associated with the assumption regarding the measurement of the construct: in the first case indicators have no measurement error, in the latter there is measurement error assumed. Regarding your example, using the weights of a PCA to compute a weighted average as a score would correspond to a formative construct: the resulting score is fully determined by the indicators, and not the other way round. When dealing with reflective indicators, in lavaan you can use the function lavPredict() if you want to estimate latent factor scores for each subject. Note the emphasis, as this is a prediction involving error: the indicators are used to imperfectly measure the underlying latent variable that is assumed to cause them.
