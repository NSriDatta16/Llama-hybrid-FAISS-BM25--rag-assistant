Which dimensionality reduction technique for mixed data?

I have a binary dependent variable and 18 independent variables which I want to use as regressors in a logistic regression. Prior to that, I want to reduce the dimensionality of the data set to shield my model against overfitting. Which dimensionality reduction technique do you recommend me given that 8 regressors are categorical, 1 is ordinal scaled, 9 are count variables and 1 is interval scaled? The size of the data set is roughly 50000. I'm working with RStudio.
