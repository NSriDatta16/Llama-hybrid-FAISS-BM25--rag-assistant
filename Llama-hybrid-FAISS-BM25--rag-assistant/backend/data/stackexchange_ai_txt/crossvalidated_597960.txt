Feature engineering for anomaly detection when feature is directional

I want to train an anomaly detection model for intrusion and fraud detection. I have several features I know are correlated with sketchy behavior. However, those features are "directional" and anomalies should only be considered relevant if the feature value is high. For example, if velocity of transactions was a feature were the bulk of the mass was at "average" velocity, I imagine the anomaly detector would return outliers with both low and high values. Is there a good way to encode directionality in the features or in the model, such to enforce that a feature value should only be considered anomalous if the value is high?
