Script to convert unicode characters in format to their ASCII equivalents

Im doing some changes in Linux locale files /usr/share/i18n/locales (like pt_BR), to change the default format of dates, time, numbers, etc. But since unicode chars are presented as strings in the format, text is very hard to read. Here is a snippet of it: LC_TIME abday " ";" ";/ " ";" ";/ " ";" ";/ " " So, how to make a simple script (may be bash, python, pearl, whatever) to convert this text replacing the codes to their ASCII equivalents? (yes, they are all ASCI chars below 255, most even below 127) If several answers are received, Ill accept the most elegant and/or the more detailed explained one (like options and flags used in comands) As an example, the above text would be converted to: LC_TIME abday "Dom";"Seg";/ "Ter";"Qua";/ "Qui";"Sex";/ "SÃ¡b" Bonus points for another script that could do the opposite: convert all chars of a given string to format. Thanks!
