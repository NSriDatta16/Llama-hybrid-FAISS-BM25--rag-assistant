I'm beginning to think the only way to pull this off is to write a suite of vertex/fragment shaders and do it all in OpenGL ES 2.0. I'd prefer not to incur the restriction of limiting the app to iPhone 3GS but I think thats the only viable way to go here. I was really hoping there was some CoreGraphics approach that would work but that does not appear to be the case. Thanks, Doug
