Is there an equivalent CSS declaration to "width: auto" for elements?

I'm trying to create a that doesn't exceed a certain width (let's say 500px), even with borders of any size. Normally, if I do: (HTML) This is a test. (CSS) div { width: 500px; } table { width: 100%; border: 10px solid #000; } I'm going to end up with a that is 510px wide, since half of the left and right borders will end up on the outside of the . What I want is a that is 500px wide total (i.e., that doesn't exceed the width of its parent/container). So, the left and right borders would each be 10px wide, set inside the 500px-wide containing - therefore the table's remaining content area would be 480px. I can easily do this type of thing to a by using the CSS declaration "width: auto." I can fake it with a table by adding an extra around it that uses "width: auto" with the border set on that , not the . However, I'm hoping that a more elegant solution exists (must be cross-browser). Is there one that I'm not aware of?
