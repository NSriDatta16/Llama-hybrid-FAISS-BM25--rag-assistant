Formatting Text Data Stored in SQLite3

I have paragraphs stored in SQLite cells, of which I wish to make a few important words bold-face . I take it I must make this formatting while entering the data into the database; how do I accomplish this? Also, when retrieving the data in Objective-C, how do I ensure it retains its formatting (programmatically) for use in a UITextView? Edit: So not necessarily UITextView, but whatever works to display formatted text.
