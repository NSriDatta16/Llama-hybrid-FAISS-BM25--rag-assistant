What's wrong with autovacuum? When autovacuum does it's job, you don't have to use CLUSTER to cleanup dead tuples. CLUSTER isn't made for this, it's VACUUM. If you change the proces to UPDATE duplicates, things might get even better when you use a lower FILLFACTOR: HOT updates. These are faster, reclaim space, keep the same order in storage and no need for VACUUM nor CLUSTER.
