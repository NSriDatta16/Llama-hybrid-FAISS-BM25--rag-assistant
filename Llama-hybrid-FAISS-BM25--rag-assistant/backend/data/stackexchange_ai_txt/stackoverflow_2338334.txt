Clojure macro to collect strings in constant

I've got a Clojure file with a lot of string constants. I want to collect these strings in a collection by wrapping them in a macro. After several tries I succeeded, but my solution looks fairly hideous. (ns Memorable) (def MEMORY (atom [])) (defmacro memorize [s] (swap! MEMORY conj s) s) (prn (str (memorize "hello") " brave new " (memorize "world"))) ; test (defmacro make-memories-constant [] `(def MEMORIES ~(deref MEMORY))) (make-memories-constant) Are there more elegant solutions for this problem?
