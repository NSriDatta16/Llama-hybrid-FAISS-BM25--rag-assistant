With fewer events, it's easier for predictors to perfectly predict or come close to perfectly predicting the outcome, which implies larger coefficients. It's often a good idea to correct the bias in your logistic regressions using a Firth correction, which is especially helpful with smaller samples and fewer events. The unadjusted logistic regression coefficients are known to be (sometimes badly) biased.
