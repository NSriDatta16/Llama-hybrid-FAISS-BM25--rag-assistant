I cannot say much about the market for Ubuntu. And since business is your primary concern, the programming language is, as you say yourself, secondary. I would say that in any business, choose the language and tools that solves the business problem most effectively. When release comes do your end users really care? That said, if you can do it with Mono/C# I would encourage you to do so since you already have C# and .Net experience. But knowing a second language and development environment will only make you stronger.
