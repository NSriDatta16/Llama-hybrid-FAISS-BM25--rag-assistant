Smaller countries can get an advantage in two ways. Systematic advantage because the number of athletes per country is limited. Large countries like the USA and China, who have populations 25 and 100 times larger than Hungary, are not sending an equivalent amount of athletes or teams. For instance, in many team sports there is only one team per country competing and in individual sports the number of entries per country is limited. Stochastic advantage because variations are larger for smaller countries. The coefficient of variation for the number of medals will be smaller when the expected value is larger. Example if every athlete rolls a six sided dice. Then the countries with the largest (but also the smallest) average dice roll will often be countries with a smaller amount of athletes. See the simulation below where we have hundred countries with 50 athletes and hundred countries with 200 athletes. Idea for the image from vondj 's YouTube video: Kleine Schulen sind besser! Lügen mit der gefährlichsten Formel der Welt I imagine a graph of number of medals versus population might show some interesting insights. (There are several on the internet, but they are often for only a single year and with some noise, am average of several editions might give a good view of the relationship between medals and population)
