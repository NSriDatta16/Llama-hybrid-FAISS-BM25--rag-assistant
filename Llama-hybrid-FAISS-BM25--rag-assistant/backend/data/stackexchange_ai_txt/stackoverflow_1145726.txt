What is NoSQL, how does it work, and what benefits does it provide?

I've been hearing things about NoSQL and that it may eventually become the replacement for SQL DB storage methods due to the fact that DB interaction is often a bottle neck for speed on the web. So I just have a few questions: What exactly is it? How does it work? Why would it be better than using a SQL Database? And how much better is it? Is the technology too new to start implementing yet or is it worth taking a look into?
