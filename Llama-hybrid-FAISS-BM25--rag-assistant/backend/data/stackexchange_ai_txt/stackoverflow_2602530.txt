Allowing users to define columns is generally a poor choice as they don't know what they are doing or how to relate it properly to the other data. Sometimes people use the EAV approach to this and let them add as many columns as they want, but this quickly gets out of control and causes performance issues and difficulty in querying the data. Others take the approach of having a table with user defined columns and give them a set number of columns they can define. This works better performance wise but is more limiting interms of how many new columns they can define. In any event you should severely restrict who can define the additional columns only to system admins (who can be at the client level). It is a better idea to actually talk to users in the design phase and see what they need. You will find that you can properly design a system that has 90+% of waht the customer needs if you actually talk to them (and not just to managers either, to users at all levels of the organization). I know it is common in today's world to slough off our responsibility to design by saying we are making things flexible, but I've had to use and provide dba support for many of these systems and the more flexible they try to make the design, the harder it is for the users to use and the more the users hate the system.
