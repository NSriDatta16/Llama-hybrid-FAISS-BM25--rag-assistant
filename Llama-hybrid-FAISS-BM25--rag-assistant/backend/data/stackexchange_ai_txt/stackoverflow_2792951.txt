Firefox DOMParser problem

For some reason DOMParser is adding some additional #text elements for each newline \n for this url http://rt.com/Root.rss ...as well as many other RSS I've tried. I checked cnn/bbc feeds, they don't have newlines and dom parser handling them nicely. So I have to add the following before parsing it var xmlText = htmlText.replace(/\n[ ]*/g, ""); var xmlDoc = parser.parseFromString(xmlText, "text/xml"); Server is returning text/xml. var channel = xmlDoc.documentElement.childNodes[0]; this returning \n without my code above and channel with correction.
