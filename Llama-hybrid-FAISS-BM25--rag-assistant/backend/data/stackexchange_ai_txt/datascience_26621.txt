Your network has 28 x 28 = 784 (normal MNIST size) inputs, 16 + 16 hidden nodes and 10 outputs. This is not enough for an enough accurate model as a result. This question suggests to use 256 x 256 hidden nodes and Wikipedia page on MNIST gives for 2-layer reference the values: 784-800-10 meaning 800 x 10 nodes. Wikipedia gives error rate 0.016 for that 800 x 10 solution. Sidenote: For 6-layer Deep Neural Network the numbers are : 784-2500-2000-1500-1000-500-10 so the new numbers I gave aren't that big. Of course the error rate on DNN is 0.0035 so it needs those layers. edit: Do I have to change the learning rate which I now defined to be 0.3? Answer in the referred question says 0.0001 is more appropriate value. Edit of question author I marked this as solved because now it is working. I implemented it again and after tweaking the hyperparameters it worked. So this is, in a way the solution to my problem. Because I asked why this problem occurs in the first place, my implementation error aside.
