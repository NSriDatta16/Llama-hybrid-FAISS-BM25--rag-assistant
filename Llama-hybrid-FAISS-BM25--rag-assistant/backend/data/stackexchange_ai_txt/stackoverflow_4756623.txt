Eric Lippert has a detailed blog post about this: Why no var on fields? Summary: Even if it were feasible, it would require major compiler upheaval Determining the type could be very complex in some cases, and end up with some weird situations - what would be exposed for a public variable using an anonymous type? I'd love it for simple cases, but the balance of "simple" may well be hard to decide in an elegant way which "feels right".
