QT Designer: Using .ui files for other components created with QT Designer

I have created a bunch of widgets with QT designer. What I would like to know is if these widgets can be used (drag and dropped) with other components I create with QT Designer, without having to export them and compile them as a custom widget, since it seems that the .ui file already contains most of that functionality that I would be exporting with the custom widget interface. Is this possible, or am I thinking about how components created with the Qt Designer can work together wrong? Thanks all.
