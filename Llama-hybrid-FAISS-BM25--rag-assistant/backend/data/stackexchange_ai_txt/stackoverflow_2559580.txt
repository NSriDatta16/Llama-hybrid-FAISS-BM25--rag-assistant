Grails: Services VS Groovy classes

Documentation says: The Grails team discourages the embedding of core application logic inside controllers, as it does not promote re-use and a clean separation of concerns. I have one API controller and a few Groovy classes in src/groovy folder. Those classes just implements my application logic so actions in API controller works in this way: //index page def index = { render new IndexApi().index(params) as JSON } I'm curious - is there any reason to move my application logic from plain groovy classes into services ?
