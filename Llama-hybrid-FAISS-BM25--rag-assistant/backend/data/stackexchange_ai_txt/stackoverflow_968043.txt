I think to fully realize the potential of arrays, you must somehow mention two things: 1) Array Algorithms Sort, Find, etc. All the basics. Equate this in your business brief as structured data that can organize itself. No extra query language. No variable naming conventions. All you need is good standards. 2) Multi-Dimensional Arrays The power of arrays seems fully realized to me with matrices. With these you can practically hold limitless data. Plus, depending on the power of the propriety language you are using, arrays can store objects.
