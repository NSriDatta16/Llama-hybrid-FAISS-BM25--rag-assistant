Sessions in PHP (and every other web platform I know) work this way: Client makes first request / sends login data PHP creates session for client, a random session ID is generated PHP script marks that session as "logged in" PHP sends generated session ID to client (usually through a cookie) Client makes subsequent requests and always sends along the session ID PHP recognizes the client by the session ID and loads session data If your client makes a request without sending the session ID some way, it will always be "not logged in" - the session ID is what makes the PHP script "remember" its state. If your WebApp library doesn't handle session cookies (I'm not familiar with vb.net programming and libraries), look for a library that can, or - maybe easier - have the PHP script print out the session ID on successful login. Catch that printout in your app, and add the following GET parameter: ?PHPSESSID=123456 (123456 being your session ID) to every subsequent request you make from your app to PHP. That way, PHP should be able to recognize the correct session. As I said, I'm not familiar with VB.NET so there may be more elegant, ready-made solutions for this. But this is definitely going to work if there are none.
