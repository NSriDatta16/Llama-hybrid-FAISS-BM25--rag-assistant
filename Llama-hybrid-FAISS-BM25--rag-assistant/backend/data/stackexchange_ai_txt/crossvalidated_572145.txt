I'm not sure what books you have read, but I personally enjoyed both the explanatory approaches of Ben Lambert (A Studentâ€™s Guide to Bayesian Statistics) and Richard McElreath (Statistical Rethinking A Bayesian Course with Examples in R and STAN). McElreath even provides a source code example of the Metropolis algorithm and HMC in R.
