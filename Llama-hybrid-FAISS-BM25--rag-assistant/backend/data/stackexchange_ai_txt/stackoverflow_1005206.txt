Does SQLite lock the database file on reads?

I'm investigating SQLite as a storage engine, and am curious to know whether SQLite locks the database file on reads. I am concerned about read performance as my planned project will have few writes, but many reads. If the database does lock, are there measures that can be taken (such as memory caching) to mitigate this?
