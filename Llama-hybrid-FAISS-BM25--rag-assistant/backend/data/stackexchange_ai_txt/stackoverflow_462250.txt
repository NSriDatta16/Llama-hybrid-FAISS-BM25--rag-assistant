I had similar trouble with an application used by a workforce with a good proportion in their 50s. I learnt an amazing amount just by sitting with them while they used the application. If they tried to do something I thought was daft or missed something I thought was obvious, I'd ask them what they were trying to do, and what made them think that was the way to solve it. It's very true, lots of things more experienced users would think are benefits and useful features can just be distractions. Be sure to take the users feedback very seriously. If you have also got savvy users, they could have an advanced mode that turns on auto-complete etc. But don't ever try to think you know best because a certain way of working allows you to work more efficiently when you use the UI. Also. Remember to use big plain fonts, high contrast, and big buttons that are easy to hit with a mouse. I know you say you haven't got accessibility problems, but your users might appreciate these things and see it as an improvement to the UI. One issue I had was that the users didn't seem to understand the meanings of icons, text seemed to work better. Or if you've got space, include text next to existing icons. Be very careful when you come to add new features... these can confuse this type of user massively. It's taken them a long time to work out how to do something and now its changed! So ensure new features don't upset old ones too much or at all if possible. Another good thing to consider is the workflow. If you can organize screen elements so that users can work from top to bottom in a linear manner to achieve a task, this may improve the usability.
