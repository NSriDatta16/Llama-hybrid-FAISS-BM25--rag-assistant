New Quicktime Look for Embedded mp3s

With the release of Snow Leopard, Apple has also unveiled a newer, slicker looking version of the quicktime controls for when html links to an mp3. I'm working on a site with embedded mp3s, and would like them to show up inside Quicktime's newer skin, but I can't figure out how to do it. Everything I've tried results in the same older gray skin. Interestingly enough however, if I simply link to the mp3 file, so it opens in a new window instead of embedding it directly in the page, the newer skin appears. Does apple have a new codebase implemented for this new skin that I can use, or is there some other way to embed mp3s with this newer skin? Does anyone even know what I'm talking about? Any help would, as always, be greatly appreciated. Thanks! PS: Upon inspecting apple site more closely, they seem to be able to do what I'm talking about, though looking at the site's source was no help. If you go to http://www.apple.com and, on the main page, click "Watch the iMac Video", it streams a movie using the new quicktime skin. Still no clue on how to implement it though.
