Interpretation of the ratio of two estimated population means

I have two datasets. Lets say average of 1st dataset is 10, and average of second dataset is 12. Is it acceptable to divide 12/10 and say that the relationship between both datasets is 1.2? I am interpreting 1.2 as, for one event in 1st dataset 1.2 events happen in 2nd dataset. Is this a correct interpretation? Note: values of 1st dataset happen 1st. 2nd dataset is not dependent on the 1st one.
