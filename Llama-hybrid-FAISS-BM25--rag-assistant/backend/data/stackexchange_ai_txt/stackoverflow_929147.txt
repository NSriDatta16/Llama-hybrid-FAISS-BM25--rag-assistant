I would suggest beginning your research by focusing on SQL Server Analysis Services via the Books Online Documentation, in particular the "Analysis Services Information Worker InfoCenter" as the information presented is mostly for the attention of data analysts. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms174577(SQL.90).aspx Using the reference you can choose further readying into specific subjects such as "Data Mining Concepts", which will subsequently lead you onto the various Data Mining Algorithms that are available to you. Then to get hands on with the technology, take a look at the Microsoft Data Mining Tutorial: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms167167.aspx
