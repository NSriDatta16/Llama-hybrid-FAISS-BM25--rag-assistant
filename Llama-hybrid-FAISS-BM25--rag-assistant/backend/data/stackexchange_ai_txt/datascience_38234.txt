RNN-based Predictions of Sine Waves with Frequency Different From Training Data

I am wondering if I can generate a sine wave with a frequency different from training data using RNN. For example, Using two training data of two time series, say 0[sec] ~ 10[sec] each: sin(t) and sin(2t) If we feed these two data to RNN, can we possibly predict a sine wave of sin(1.5t) with some amount of initial data? I would be very appreciated if you could tell me the possibility of this, and perhaps some examples of implementation. Thank you in advance
