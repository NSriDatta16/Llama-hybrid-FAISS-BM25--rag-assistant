MDX: use dimension values on columns

I wanted to use dimension properties on columns. So, in the mdx query, I dragged in those properties from the dimension "member properties". But, for some reason, the values for those properties are nulls only. However, if the dimension members are used on rows, they have legitimate values. Is there any other way, I can pull in those dimension values on columns?
