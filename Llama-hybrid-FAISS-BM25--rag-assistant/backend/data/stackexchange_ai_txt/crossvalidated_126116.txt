Is a weighted average of two correlation matrices again a correlation matrix?

Let $R$ and $Q$ be two correlation matrices of the same size and let $p\in[0,1]$. I'm trying to show that $pR+(1-p)Q$ is still a correlation matrix. I claim that $\sqrt pX+\sqrt{1-p}Y$ is a random vector that has correlation matrix $pR+(1-p)Q$. Here, $X$ is the random vector with correlation $R$ and $Y$ is the random vector with correlation $Q$. Also, $X$ and $Y$ are independent. I can get the covariance part to match but I can't get the standard deviation in the denominator to match. I'm not sure why. Can someone show me how to do this?
