Train a neural network to find position of altered pixels?

I have a series of images, all of which have been altered in the same way. A circle of radius, r, containing a face or other object has been edited out of the pictures and replaced with a best attempt at a background or blurred out entirely. The only information I've been given is the x,y coordinates of the pixel at the center of the edit, and the radius of the circle, r, though I've been advised that this might not be necessary. I need to create a neural network such that, given a photo edited in this way, can detect the x,y coordinates at the center of the edited disk. I think a CNN would do the trick? But whenever I do research on object classification or detection, it's always adjacent to what I'm looking for.
