Can I average out a constant (intercept) in OLS regression?

I have a OLS regression in the form: $$Y_t=\alpha +\beta X_{t-1}+\varepsilon_{t}$$ Can I average out the constant during the OLS estimation/derivation and report, $$y_t=\beta X_{t-1}+\varepsilon_{t}$$ Could I explain this as "I have averaged out the constant during the OLS procedure?" So the intercept is there, the estimation procedure I use (code I have) averages it out, is there some correct technical jargon for this?
