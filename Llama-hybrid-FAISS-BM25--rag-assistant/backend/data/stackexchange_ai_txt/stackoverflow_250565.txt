"but really, how many apps really have that many changes?" Honestly, every app I have worked on has gone through serious workflow and/or logic changes from concept until well after deployment. It's the number one reason for "maintenance" programming... The reality is that you can't think of everything up front, hence the reason for Agile processes. Further, the BA's always seem to miss something vital until it's found in testing. Rule Engines force you to truly separate business logic from presentation and storage. Further, if using the right engine, your BA's can add and remove logic as necessary. As Chris Marasti-Georg said, it puts the onus on the BA. But more than that, it allows the BA to get exactly what they are asking for.
