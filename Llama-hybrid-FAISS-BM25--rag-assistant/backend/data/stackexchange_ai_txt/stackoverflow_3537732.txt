There's a metric called CRAP which combines complexity analysis with coverage http://blog.businessofsoftware.org/2007/09/alberto-savoia-.html Basically, each function has a score of how bad it is where functions get worse if they are complex or don't have coverage. This means that you can't really lower your score by testing get/set methods -- you have to look at the complex functions. You can either break them down (refactor) or test them to get coverage. The video explains why it's a hard metric to game. It won't help with Null tests, but it will help focus the testing on where you get more out of it.
