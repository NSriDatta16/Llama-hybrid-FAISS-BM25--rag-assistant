I am still finding it hard to believe, but our experiments show that a round trip from and EC2 instance to simpledb is averaging out to 300milliseconds or so, on a good day! On a bad day we've seen it go down to 1.5sec. This is for a single insert. I'd love to see somebody replicate the experiment to verify these results, but as it is... simpledb is no solution for anything but post processing- in the request/response cycle it would just be way to slow.
