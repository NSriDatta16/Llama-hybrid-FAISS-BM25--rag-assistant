This is all asp.net 3.5 http://dropthings.omaralzabir.com/ The book you need is called: Building a web 2.0 portal using asp.net It includes drag and drops...etc etc http://www.amazon.com/Building-Web-2-0-Portal-ASP-NET/dp/B0026OR2SQ/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1256568264&sr=8-2 [Edit adding to your comments] 1) No DL and BL can still be compiled assemblies / dlls in other projects. It doesn't change whether they are web service or not. You may want to pick up a book and understand what AJAX is. I assumed you knew it..visit the asp.net / ajax.net website and get up to speed on it.
