There is not so elegant but quite user-friendly method. It is an Organizer. Yes, I know, it is a part of Xcode. You can blame me for the fact that my answer is supposed to reveal some xcodeless method but you can use the method described below even if you have no source code. It could be useful in some cases. So, here is the method: Open Xcode. Select Window -> Organizer menu item. Select your plugged iDevice there. On your iDevice check that Settings -> Developer -> Logging switch control is on. Launch the app. In Organizer select Device Logs tab. There are all the logs of your device to the moment. If there are no logs at Device Logs tab check #4, then reconnect the device. In some case you should then restart Xcode.
