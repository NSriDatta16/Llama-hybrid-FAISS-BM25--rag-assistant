Lines are cheap. Processor power is cheap. Developer time is very expensive. As a general rule, unless I am developing some absolutely resource / speed critical application, I would always err on the side of writing code that is (a) Easy for any other developer to follow what I am doing (b) Comment specific parts of the code that may need it (c) Easy to debug if something goes wrong (d) Easy to modify if it needs to be in future (i.e. adding / removing code) The speed or academic elegance of the code is secondary to these factors from a Business perspective. This is not to say I set out to write clunky or ugly code, but this is MY order of priority. By omitting curly braces in most instances, it for me makes (b), (c) and (d) more difficult (note not impossible however). I would say that using curly braces or not has not effect on (a).
