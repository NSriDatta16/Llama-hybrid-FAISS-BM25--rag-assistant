The appropriate use of multiple stylesheets on one page

I came across this primer on coding HTML: http://css-tricks.com/examples/CleanCode/Beautiful-HTML.png . Among other things it recommends using one stylesheet per page . I have my CSS styles organized in different stylesheets: Global (for all pages) Forms (for all forms) Customers (for all pages related to customers) ...and so on. If I have one stylesheet per page, wouldn't that lead to huge redundancy? Wouldn't I end up with tens or hundreds of stylesheets, many of which contain the same definitions? What are your opinions on this practice? What are your opinions on the primer? ------UPDATE------ I understand that saying 'one stylesheet per page' doesn't necessarily equate to having many stylesheets across the site, so here's a simple follow-up question. Based on your responses, is it appropriate to have one stylesheet that covers my entire site that may therefore include thousands of rows and hundreds/thousands of unused rows for a particular page it is loaded with? (My stylesheets are high on rows because I tend to put each style for a given class on a new row.)
