How do you create inputs for custom options in the Magento admin

I've created a new custom option type and inserted it into the Magento back end. I've got the front end portion of this working rather nicely. However, I can't figure out how to customize the interface for the new option type. To be more specific as to what I am doing, I created non-displayed categories that contain products which represent options. I did this so I could use the excellent image resources Magento's products have. I have a nice little lightbox displaying these options, and it updates the form fields as required. What I need is a way to select the base level category that the lightbox will display using a drop down. Right now the default "text" form shows up, but only after I save the product, prior to that it shows an empty div. Does anyone know how I can get code for a custom input to display? Thanks.
