How to constrain weights of some layer to be binary?

Is there any way to constrain weights of some fully connected layer of CNN(classification task) to be binary (0,1) or near binary(and then just threshold to binary)? Update: I want to use binary features from this layer to search similar images using hamming distance, something like {1}.
