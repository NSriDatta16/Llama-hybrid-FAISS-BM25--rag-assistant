Refactoring and source cleanup may cause your source files to be reorganized, including comments. I would suggest you do not do that since that comment may end up somewhere completely unrelated. Another thing you may want to try instead is to use your IDE to reformat your source. Eclipse allows for doing that every time you save a file. This will give all your code a consistent look allowing for easier reading.
