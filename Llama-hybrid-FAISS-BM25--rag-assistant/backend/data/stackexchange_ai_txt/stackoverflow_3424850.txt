The basic idea is to store some state in the URL fragment (the part of the URL after the #) -- for example your-site.com/app#page-1 To listen for changes to the fragment, use GWT's History class. The fragment will change when the user goes back/forward, or refreshes the page. So you could have your app do different things when the URL has #page-1 vs #page-2 , etc. A more generalized and scalable solution to this is something like gwt-platform 's Place architecture (along with Presenters, which are also a good idea for large apps)
