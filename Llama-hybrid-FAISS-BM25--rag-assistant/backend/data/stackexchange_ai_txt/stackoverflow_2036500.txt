This is a part of code which I'm working on. You can find this method when you created a new project. -(void)applicationDidFinishLaunching:(NSNotification*)aNotification { [window registerForDraggedTypes:[NSArray arrayWithObjects:NSFilenamesPboardType, nil]]; } I'm newbie too. Anyway, this worked for me. And then, this is important. We have to connect this object to window object to handle drop messages in this object Open MainMenu.xib, and Interface Builder will pop up. In Interface Builder, connect 'App Delegate'(this object) to 'delegate' outlet of 'Window'. (You can find 'delegate' outlet in Inspector panel) Now, 'App Delegate' receives event messages of 'Window'. And then, adds more method at the same class file: -(NSDragOperation)draggingEntered:(id )sender { return NSDragOperationGeneric; } -(BOOL)prepareForDragOperation:(id )sender { NSPasteboard* pbrd = [sender draggingPasteboard]; // Do something here. return YES; }
