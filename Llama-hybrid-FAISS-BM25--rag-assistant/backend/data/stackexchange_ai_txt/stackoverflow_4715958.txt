From the specification point of view, a fragment can contain the following characters (Iâ€™ve already expanded the productions): fragment = *( ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "." / "_" / "~" / "%" HEXDIG HEXDIG / "!" / "$" / "&" / "'" / "(" / ")" / "*" / "+" / "," / ";" / "=" / ":" / "@" / "/" / "?" ) So, no, the fragment must not contain a plain # ; it must be encoded with %23 . But it is possible that some browsers display it differently just as sequences of percent-encoded octets, that represent valid UTF-8 characters are replaced by the characters they represent.
