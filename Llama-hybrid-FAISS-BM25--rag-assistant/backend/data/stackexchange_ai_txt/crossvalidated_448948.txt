Time series with long "idle" periods - is it safe to eliminate those periods?

Suppose that I have as input a time series $T = \{ t_1, t_2, ..., t_M \}$ where each point is sampled at a fixed time interval (e.g. every 10 ms). The problem is that $T$ contains a lot of periods with constant values. For example, the values from timestamp 50 (ms) to timestamp 10000 (ms) are the same. Then the data fluctuate from 10010 (ms) to 10200 (ms), then it remains constant until 15000 (ms). So, the series is generally idle until a change happens. Seeing that keeping these "idle" periods will not bring any insights to the analysis I want to do afterward (for example, clustering or motif discovery), I think those periods can be eliminated from my data, such that any consecutive data points in $T$ are now different. But I still keep the timestamp of each data point to know their arrival time. My question is: is it safe, or correct, to do so? After the elimination, $T$ will no longer be an evenly spaced time series. Is this going to affect the analysis? I want to note that mostly I want to do shape-based analysis on the series, e.g. clustering, motif discovery, anomaly detection, etc. Forecasting is not of my interest. Many thanks in advance!
