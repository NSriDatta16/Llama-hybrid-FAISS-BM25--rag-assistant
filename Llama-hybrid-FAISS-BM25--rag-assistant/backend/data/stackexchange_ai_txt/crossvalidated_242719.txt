Suggestion on algorithm for forecasting a time series

I have the following data available with me. DayOfWeek | #fruitsSold(in kilos) Monday | 25 Tuesday | 32 Wednesday | 18 Thursday | 31 Friday | 30 Saturday | 55 Sunday | 48 Monday | 20 Tuesday | 35 Wednesday | 15 Thursday | 26 Friday | 50 Saturday | 34 Sunday | 15 Monday | 22 Tuesday | 40 Wednesday | 25 Thursday | 32 Friday | 44 Saturday | 45 Sunday | 54 Monday | 24 Tuesday | 33 Wednesday | 22 Thursday | 34 Friday | 38 Saturday | 58 Sunday | 12 I want to predict #fruits sold for each day of the next week. That is, currently we have 4 weeks data (#fruits_sold/day) available with us and we need to predict #fruits_sold/day for each day of 5th week. Also due to memory constraints, when predicting for 6th week, only recent 4 weeks may be taken into consideration. There may be noise/out of bound values (like 0 when shop closed or 98 due to a non-relevant event only on one particular day). These extremes may be ignored for simplicity. Can anyone please suggest a relevant algorithm(s) which can provide prediction with promising accuracy? (Planning to implement in python)
