This is the level or type of transformation, not actually the assumed level of an input variable. Ordinal or Spline ordinal level of transformation means simply that the transformation will be monotonic (potentially nonlinear). Numeric level means that it will be linear. Etc (read Help and Case studies for more). See a good reply by Jeromy Anglim on implications of different levels for the problem of overfitting. Numeric level is more constraining and is equivalent to classic (linear) PCA performed on discretized data. Ordinal is less constraining but at the same time less parsimonious. Spline ordinal is probably the best tradeoff choice. My advice would be "try both" and compare the amount of variance explained and Cronbach alphas. For binary variables it makes no difference, because with two categories any monotonic transform is but linear. This is usual result, it means that some adjacent categories are indistinguishable. You could merge those if you wish to operate with original variables rather than with the scaled (transformed) ones in the future. You can request all 2D loading plots for 4 dimensions via syntax. Or plot it (the loading matrix entries) yourself. Multiple nominal level of transformation is equivalent to recoding a categorical variable into a set of dummy 0-1 variables and use this set as one whole: each category creates its own point on a plot. If all your variables are multiple nominal then CATPCA becomes identical to Multiple Correspondence analysis, or HOMALS.
