Network analysis - Correlation is positive and significant, but coefficient of simple logistic regression is not significant?

I have an adjacency matrix and another which represents whether the two nodes share an attribute. Consider it like an homophily test. We want to test if the likelihood to form a connect depends on the fact that the two nodes have an attribute in common. Now, using R and SNA package, I run a correlation and test is significance through a QAP test: g The correlation is 0.7479487, and the p-value is 0 QAP Test Results Estimated p-values: p(f(perm) >= f(d)): 0 p(f(perm) Then I fit a logit to that data nl but its coefficient is not significant. How is that possible? Network Logit Model Coefficients: Estimate Exp(b) Pr( =b) Pr(>=|b|) (intercept) -2.940634 5.283224e-02 0.000 1.000 0.00 x1 21.506702 2.188981e+09 0.519 0.481 0.97 Goodness of Fit Statistics: Null deviance: 17234.41 on 12432 degrees of freedom Residual deviance: 4617.118 on 12430 degrees of freedom Chi-Squared test of fit improvement: 12617.29 on 2 degrees of freedom, p-value 0 AIC: 4621.118 BIC: 4635.974 Pseudo-R^2 Measures: (Dn-Dr)/(Dn-Dr+dfn): 0.5036986 (Dn-Dr)/Dn: 0.7320989
