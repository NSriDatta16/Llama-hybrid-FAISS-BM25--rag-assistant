How to get a row rank?

HI, I actually posted similar (or same?) question yesterday, but I thought I need to post a new question since I have short, but clear question. I have the following table. id point 1 30 2 30 3 29 4 27 5 28 6 26 what I want: get all the users order by rank. user #1 and #2 should have 1 as their rank value because they both have 30 points I want to query a rank by user id. I like to get 1 as the result of my rank when I query user #1 and #2 because both of them have 30 points Added on: 3/18 I tried Logan's query, but got the following result id point rank 1 30 1 2 30 1 3 29 3 4 27 5 5 28 4 6 26 6
