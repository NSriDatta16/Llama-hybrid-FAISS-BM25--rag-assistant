The error you are seeing is because you are trying to have an @AfterMethod depend on a @BeforeMethod, which doesn't make sense. You can have configuration methods depend on each other, but they need to be all of the same type (e.g. all @AfterMethod or all @BeforeMethod). As for your other problem, the solution given by Valchris is what I recommend. If you know your tests or configurations are fragile but they shouldn't interrupt the test run, catch the exception yourself so that TestNG will never see it.
