Do need to calculate PCA every time I add new item to dataset?

I want to visualise dataset of high dimensional data. And there comes PCA with dimensionality reduction. When I upload a new image and want to see where it is placed compared to images that are already in my dataset. Do I need to calculate PCA every time I add new image? My intuition says yes, because when I add high volume of new images I'm going to drastically change properties of dataset thus change PC1 and PC2 directions. I'm using python with scikit-learn PCA and I'm talking about fit_transform method. Or should I change approach to achieve my goal?
