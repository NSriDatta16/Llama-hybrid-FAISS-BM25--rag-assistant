Variable font height via tables in LaTeX

I've been looking for a more elegant solution to the following typesetting problem. Consider those banners found in print media where the text is aligned like: B I G T E X T small text small text small text m o r e m e d i u m t e x t The font sizes are adjusted so that the height is scaled down for longer lines of text such that each line has equal width. I've written a small script that runs each line separately, compiles, crops the resulting pdf and then \includegraphics each in a table. This gives the desired effect but requires an both an outside script and pdfcrop (which only crops to a white bounding box). Since much of LaTeX is self-aware, I imagine it would be possible to have it recognize the width of a box and scale it appropriately so that any text fits exactly into the desired width. Any thoughts or ideas on how a pure LaTeX implementation might work? EDIT As a supplement to the suggested solution by AVB (since large code in comments looks awful), I've posted below the code used so that others may find it easily. \documentclass[]{article} \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx} \begin{document} \begin{table}[l] \resizebox{10cm}{!}{BIG Text} \\ \resizebox{10cm}{!}{small text small text small text} \\ \resizebox{10cm}{!}{Medium Text Medium Text} \end{table} \end{document}
