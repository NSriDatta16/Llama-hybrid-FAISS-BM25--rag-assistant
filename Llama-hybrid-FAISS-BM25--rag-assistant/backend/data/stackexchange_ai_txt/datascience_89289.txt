Any machine learning algorithm can be used as a weak learner for gradient boosting. Certain algorithms will work better and certain algorithms will work worse. Linear regression tries to minimize the sum of square errors (SSE). The first linear regression model might not leave any errors for subsequent linear regressions models to fit, thus there would be no advantage to gradient boosting in that case.
