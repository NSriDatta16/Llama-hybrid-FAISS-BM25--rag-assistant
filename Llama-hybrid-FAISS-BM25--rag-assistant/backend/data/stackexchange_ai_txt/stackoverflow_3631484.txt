Relational databases are designed for a specific category of use cases, particularly in business applications. As such, they have certain capabilities that are valuable in these scenarios. Data retrieval is often accompanied by sophisticated search and analysis. If you use NoSql or object databases, you may be giving up some of these capabilities in favor of others, such as the handling of huge, distributed datasets, a task at which NoSQL databases typically excel. In other words, you may need more capabilities than just data persistence, capabilities which relational databases already provide. Relational databases are a mature, well-known and predictable technology, with many experts having abundant expertise in them. All of these reasons are good reasons for continuing to choose relational databases over more "exotic" solutions.
