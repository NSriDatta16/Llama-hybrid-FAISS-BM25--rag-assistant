POST data not being received from iPhone

I've got an iPhone App that is supposed to send POST data to my server to register the device in a MySQL database so we can send notifications etc... to it. It sends it's unique identifier, device name, token, and a few other small things like passwords and usernames as a POST request to our server. The problem is that sometimes the server doesn't receive the data. And by this I mean, its not just receiving blank values for the POST inputs but, its not receiving ANY post data at all. I am logging all POST inputs to my server into some log files and when the script that relies on the POST data from the device fails (detects no data) I notice that its because NO POST data was sent. Is this a problem on the server, like refusing data or something or does this have to be on the client's side? What could be causing this? iPhone Code: NSString *post = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"deviceIdentifier=%@&deviceToken=%@",deviceIdentifier,deviceToken]; NSData *postData = [post dataUsingEncoding:NSASCIIStringEncoding allowLossyConversion:NO]; NSString *postLength = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%d", [postData length]]; NSMutableURLRequest *request = [[[NSMutableURLRequest alloc] init] autorelease]; [request setURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"http://website.com/RegisterScript.php"]]; [request setHTTPMethod:@"POST"]; [request setValue:postLength forHTTPHeaderField:@"Content-Length"]; [request setValue:@"application/x-www-form-urlencoded" forHTTPHeaderField:@"Content-Type"]; [request setValue:@"MyApp-V1.0" forHTTPHeaderField:@"User-Agent"]; [request setHTTPBody:postData]; NSData *urlData = [NSURLConnection sendSynchronousRequest:request returningResponse:nil error:nil]; NSString *response = [[NSString alloc] initWithData:urlData encoding:NSASCIIStringEncoding];
