Plotting Scientific data in .net

Does anyone have any recommendations for plotting scientific data in .net (c# winforms). Some of my requirements are: real time plotting, 3D (waterfall), multiple axis, ability to accept BindingList as a data source and recognize any changes to the data. I also need a high level of user interactivity such as the ability to graphically select 1 or more series, draw regions. highlight part of a series, etc. So far I've looked at Nevron, Synchfusion, Infragistics, TeeChart and a few others.
