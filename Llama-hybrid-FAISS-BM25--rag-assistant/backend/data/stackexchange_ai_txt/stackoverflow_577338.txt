First, #pragma once is the wrong way to go about it, learn about header include guards. Related question on SO explains why using #pragma once is the wrong way to go about it. Wikipedia explains how to use include guards which serve the same purpose without any of the downsides. Second, you are calling the constructor of std::exception with a parameter it does not know, in this case a pointer to a character array. #include #include class WrongParameterException : public std::runtime_error { public: WrongParameterException(const std::string& message) : std::runtime_error(message) { }; }; Would probably be what you want. For more information on exceptions, check out C++ FAQ Lite article on Exceptions and the exceptions article at cplusplus.com. Good luck!
