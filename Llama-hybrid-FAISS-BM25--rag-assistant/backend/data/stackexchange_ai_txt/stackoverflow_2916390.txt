Centralized way of organizing urls in Jersey?

Forgive me if I am asking an obvious question (maybe I missed it in the docs somewhere?) but has anyone found a good way to organize their URLs in Jersey Java framework? I mean organizing them centrally in your Java source code, so that you can be sure there are not two classes that refer to the same Url. For example django has a really nice regex-based matching. I was thinking of doing something like an enum: enum Urls{ CARS ("cars"), CAR_INFO ("car", "{info}"); public Urls(String path, String args) ... } but you can imagine that gets out of hand pretty quickly if you have urls like: cars/1/wheels/3 where you need multiple path-ids interleaved with one another... Any tips?
