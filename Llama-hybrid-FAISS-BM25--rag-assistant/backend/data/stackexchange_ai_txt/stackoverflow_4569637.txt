Look at RuleML http://ruleml.org/ RuleML (Rule Markup Language) is a unifying family of XML-serialized rule languages spanning across all industrially relevant kinds of Web rules. It accommodates and extends other recent rule languages, building interoperation bridges between them. The Specification of RuleML is currently being developed from Version 0.91 to Version 1.0. also The goal of the Rule Markup Initiative is to develop RuleML as the canonical Web language for rules using XML markup, formal semantics, and efficient implementations. RuleML covers the entire rule spectrum, from derivation rules to transformation rules to reaction rules. RuleML can thus specify queries and inferences in Web ontologies, mappings between Web ontologies, and dynamic Web behaviors of workflows, services, and agents. This should avoid you reinventing the wheel. Also the XML is only part of it, if you roll your own you also have to build the toolkit. EDIT: Also look at Drools (Java-specific) http://www.jboss.org/drools
