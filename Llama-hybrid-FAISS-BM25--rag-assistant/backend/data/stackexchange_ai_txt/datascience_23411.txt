Variable Importance Random Forest on R

I am currently using a random forest model for classification, however I am unsure how the feature selection technique "varImp" works on R. I understand the context of variable importance, however when I implement it in R it doesn't seem to produce the results I expect. When removing the most important variable (of 31 features), the model's accuracy does not decrease. I would expect it to as it should be contributing the most to the model's ability to classify. Could someone please explain what this function is doing?
