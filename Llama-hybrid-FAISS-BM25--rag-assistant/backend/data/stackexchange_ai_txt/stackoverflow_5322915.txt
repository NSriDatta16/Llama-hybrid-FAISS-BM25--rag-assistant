Send an Intent for the user to select a file on Android

Is there a default activity in Android that handles the opening of files? For example in Quickoffice, you can open a file, but it doesn't allow you to navigate directories. This might be an old-school type of request, but in an application I'm developing, I want to send an Intent to request the user to select a file. My application will then process that file. Ideally, this will end up as a Settings configuration for a service that will be used by other applications. Edit: I'm browsing the documentation at http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/data-storage.html , but in my case, I want to store and retrieve data that doesn't fit in any of the categories: Music/ - Media scanner classifies all media found here as user music. Podcasts/ - Media scanner classifies all media found here as a podcast. Ringtones/ - Media scanner classifies all media found here as a ringtone. Alarms/ - Media scanner classifies all media found here as an alarm sound. Notifications/ - Media scanner classifies all media found here as a notification sound. Pictures/ - All photos (excluding those taken with the camera). Movies/ - All movies (excluding those taken with the camcorder). Download/ - Miscellaneous downloads.
