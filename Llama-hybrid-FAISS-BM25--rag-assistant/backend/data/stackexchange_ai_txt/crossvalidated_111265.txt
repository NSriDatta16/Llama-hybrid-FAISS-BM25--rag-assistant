Case-crossover method with conditional logistic regression for poisson model generated data

I would like to run a semi-symmetric bi-directional case-crossover method on some generated data using conditional logistic regression. I generated data from Poisson distribution Poiss(lambda) with $\textrm{log}(\lambda)=\lambda_0 \textrm{exp}(x\beta), $ where $\lambda_0$ and $\beta$ are known and $x$ is a known time series. Then for each timepoint I split generated value into pairs: case in this timepoint and control in referent period (that is if in generated data there are $5$ cases at day $11$, I get $10$ observations for this timepoint: $5$ $(1$, $x$ at day $11)$ and $5 (0$, $x$ at reference period for day $11)$). Now I run conditional logistic regression on this data, with separate stratum for each pair. The question is, should the parameter estimates that I get from CLR be $\beta$ from parametrer of Poisson distribution? I found few articles with this procedure applied, but I can't figure out why estimetes from CLR and $\beta$ from Poisson distribution should be the same.
