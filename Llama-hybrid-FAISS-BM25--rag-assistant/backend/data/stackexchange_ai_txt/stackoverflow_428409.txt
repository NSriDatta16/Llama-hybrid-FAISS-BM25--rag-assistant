The Telerik controls does seem a bit bloaty, but I doubt you would be able to achieve something similar in JQuery without a lot of efforts. It really depends on how much bloat you can tolerate. If it's for an Intranet application, then it doesn't really matter, but as you specified external-facing, then this might be a problem, it really depends on the average connection speed of your users and on the speed of their computer/browser which will ultimately run the controls. The other important question is: do you want to standardize your web application in a proprietary toolset that is used far less than JQuery? I doubt JQuery will go out of business anywhere soon.
