Similarity between two samples of spacialized data ignoring local fluctuations

I have data from a set of sensors, and would like to measure similarity between two samples of data ignoring local fluctuations. My problem is, my sensors are not regularly placed : some are quite alone, others are many in the same area, there is no regular pattern in their locations. I want to measure similarity in terms of large scale, local fluctuations (even of high amplitude) are much less important as long as they are balanced by other nearby fluctuations. I though about computing average values of a point and its neighbours, and making my indicator as the sum of absolute value of differences between the local averages of my two samples, but I have not idea whether it's a good approach or not.
