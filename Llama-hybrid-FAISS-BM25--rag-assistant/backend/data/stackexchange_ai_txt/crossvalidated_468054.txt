How does one compute a variational derivative?

The expected regression loss is given as: $$E[L]=\int\int \{y(\mathbf x)-t\}^2 p(\mathbf x,t)d\mathbf xdt$$ To minimise the expected loss,Euler Lagrange equation is used which goes like this in the general form: $$ \frac{\delta F}{\delta y}=\frac{d}{dx}\left( \frac{\delta F}{\delta y'}\right)$$ where $F$ is the functional i.e function of function $\mathit y(x)$ . In our case $F$ would correspond to $E$ and $\mathit y$ to $L$ . Please show a step wise application of this equation to yield the following expression $$\frac{\delta E[L]}{\delta \mathit y(\mathbf x)}=2 \int\{\mathit y(\mathbf x)-t\}p(\mathbf x,t) dt=0.$$ Also, please suggest a good reference for all the calculus used in Machine Learning.
