setting "Modal" at runtime

C# WinApp: if I am creating a form at run time How can I tell it to be "Modal" ... I tried mFrmPersons.Modal = true but compile error was saying it is a read only property. so what can I do? Thanks EDIT: I cannot use Show or Show Dialog! I have a form that some other application is embedding inside it. so the only way I can call my form is like this: moPersons.NonClinDocDialog.ShowDocs(DocContext); The only thing I have control over it is moPersons that is the form I am defining in my Application... rest of it a call to other apps...so I want to set the Modal for moPersons
