If I remember correct, you have to include the [csDisplayDragImage] flag in the "ControlStyle" of controls of which you want drag images to be seen when sth. is being dragged over them.. Update: setting "AlwaysShowDragImages" of the DragObject causes the drag image to be displayed all across the desktop.
