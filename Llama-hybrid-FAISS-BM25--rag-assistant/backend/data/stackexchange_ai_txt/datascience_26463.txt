Namely: Discovering statistics with SPSS/R - Andy Field R Beginner and R for Everyone Predictive Analytics - The Power to Predict Who Will Click, Buy, Lie or Die Data Science for Business and many more If you cannot find these books online, do let me know will share the link, I have them on my drive.
