There is a simple but not-elegant way of doing it. 1) Save the css from FB on a local file, load your stylesheet and as the LAST ONE load the fb css you saved. OR 2) Also, you can just move the reset elements to be applied using jquery and avoiding the FB elements by using the selector :not $("span:not([class^=FB])").css('background-color','#F00'); Im not saying you should show it arround, but it might do the work.
