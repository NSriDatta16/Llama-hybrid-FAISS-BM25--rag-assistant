SQL - convert data to a date/source/value "grid"

I have data in an MYSQL database that looks like this: Project Date Time A 2009-01-01 15 A 2009-01-02 10 B 2009-01-02 30 A 2009-01-09 15 C 2009-01-07 5 I would like to produce output from this data like this: Date Project A Time Project B Time Project C Time 2009-01-01 15 0 0 2009-01-02 10 30 0 2009-01-07 15 0 5 Can this be done with an SQL query, or do I need to write an external script to itterate through the DB and organize the output? (Also, if someone has a better suggestion for a subject line let me know and I'll edit the question; I'm not sure of the proper terms to describe the current and desired formats, which makes searching for this information difficult)
