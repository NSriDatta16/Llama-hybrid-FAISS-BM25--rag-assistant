(I just saw this, so if this response is too late, I am sorry.) Yes, your data is non-vector data. Since you are able to compute similarities between instances you can cluster them. Once you can cluster them, you can do a number of things (from simplest to more complex): -Cluster and use centroids for classification: e.g. http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4401090/ -Use RBF Networks where the RBF units use your similarity function instead of the regular Gaussians. -Use SVMs with your similarity measure in the kernels. ... Hope this helps.
