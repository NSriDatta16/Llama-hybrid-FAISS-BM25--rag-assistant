I'd avoid bar charts here. A dot chart like this scores more highly on most criteria for such data. The term "dot chart" (or "dot plot") is overloaded in statistical graphics. This flavour is often called a Cleveland dot chart after William S. Cleveland, who promoted its use from the mid-1980s on. See a link to Cleveland's website here Key points: Bars can just take up a lot of space and a lot of ink. Here the grades and the averages are all more than 50%. We can give up the less important idea that the scale should start at 0 in favour of the more important idea that we should do justice to the interesting variation. We can use sorting to help see some patterns. You said semester was important, so that we can respect that. Within each semester we sort first on the grades. We could sort on the averages or the differences. Using open or hollow circles o and plus signs + as two symbols means that we can see where values differ (easy) and also where they are close (more difficult). o and + don't occlude each other even when values are identical. As a bonus, some typos in course names were corrected. It seems that you care about the Departments, course numbers and course names. In other problems, such text descriptors would often be shortened. Here there is enough space, especially when you start the scale at 50. You had to choose a small font in your design, but that can be avoided. Here is a variation in which the grades are sorted by the difference (grade $-$ average): Something often has to be downplayed. In this design I give up on the idea of showing differences explicitly: they are just implicit. For the record, this was done with the Stata code below. Something similar should be trivial in all major statistical programs. graph dot (asis) Avg (asis) Grade, over(Course, sort(2) descending) exclude0 yla(50(10)100) scheme(s1color) marker(1, ms(Oh)) marker(2, ms(plus)) linetype(line) lines(lc(gs12) lw(vthin)) over(Semester) nofill graph dot (asis) Avg (asis) Grade, over(Course, sort(Diff) descending) exclude0 yla(50(10)100) scheme(s1color) marker(1, ms(Oh)) marker(2, ms(plus)) linetype(line) lines(lc(gs12) lw(vthin)) over(Semester) nofill Note: I looked at your links after thinking up my suggestion. It's a weakness of both that they don't suggest this basic kind of graph. Threads here mentioning such plots include this , this and this . Last but not least, references as well as a detailed example can be found here .
