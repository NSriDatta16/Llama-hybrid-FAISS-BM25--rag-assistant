How to detect when the screen is on?

As mentioned in a previous question, I am having difficulty intercepting all android.intent.action.SCREEN_ON events without a long-lived Service (discouraged). I may be able to work around the need if I can simply work out when the screen is on at any given time, in the Service . Can anyone suggesting a method call that would return this information? 1.5 upwards.
