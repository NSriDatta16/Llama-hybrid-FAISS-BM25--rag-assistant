If there is very little structure in your data, then no algorithm will magically find it - neither ML nor classical statistical ones. To detect weak signals, you need lots of data. Lots. Much more than 77 data points. And even if you have lots of data, enough to detect a weak signal, it may be that your signal is so weak that it's useless. For instance, you may have a die that is slightly more likely to come up a 6, maybe in 17% of throws rather than 16.666...%, with the other results correspondingly slightly more unlikely. If you have seen lots of throws, you can detect this. But this small signal will still be unlikely to make a practical difference for your winning percentage at craps in Las Vegas. Your best bet is likely to try to collect more information and find some actual strong drivers. You will need domain knowledge for this.
