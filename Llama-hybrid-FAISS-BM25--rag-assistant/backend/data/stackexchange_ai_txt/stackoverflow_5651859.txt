I take it that this move is within a single repository? If so, checkout the repository to a local working copy somewhere and simply drag the trunk & branches folders in Windows Explorer using the right mouse button instead of the left. When you release, a dialog box will appear and give you the option of an SVN Move or an SVN Copy. Choose whichever is appropriate in your case and commit. This will perform a proper SVN copy/move with full history.
