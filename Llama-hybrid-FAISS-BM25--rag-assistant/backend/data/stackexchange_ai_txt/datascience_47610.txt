Machine Learning methods suited for CPU

I have a large number of x86_64 cores available to me, but no GPUs or TPUs. Which Machine Learning techniques are suited for execution on a CPU? I would imagine more "statistical learning" techniques rather than "deep learning". The reason I ask is that I'm interesting in studying some state-of-the art techniques, but I'm in the situation noted above.
