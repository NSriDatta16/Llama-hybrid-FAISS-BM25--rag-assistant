std::getline needs a string reference argument, and that's where it places the line it has obtained, so of course you can't avoid passing such an argument (and still use that function). You could elegantly encapsulate the construct, if you need it often -- e.g.: bool getline(std::istream& i, std::istringstream& current) { std::string line; if ( std::getline(i, line) ) { current.str(line); return true; } return false; }
