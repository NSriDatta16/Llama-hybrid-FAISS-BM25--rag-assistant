I like to have my SQL scripts organized by topics, rather than by name. As a rule, I even group related items into single files. The main advantages of this are : You do not clutter your filesystem/IDE with files (many of them being a few lines long). The overall database structure shows more directly. ON the other hand, it may be more difficult to find the source code related to a specific object... As for duplicate names : it can never happen, because you obviously have automated scripts to build your database . Relying on your filesystem for this is looking for trouble... As a conclusion, I would say that your current rules are much better than no rule at all.
