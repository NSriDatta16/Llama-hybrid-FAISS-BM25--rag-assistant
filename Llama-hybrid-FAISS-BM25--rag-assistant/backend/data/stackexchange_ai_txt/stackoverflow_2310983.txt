Well that's simple, either look in Request.Params["id"] or - and that's more ellegant - add a argument with the name "id" to you Controller method (case does not matter). public void Index(string id) { } Works even for more complex objects, the MVC does a good job in retrieving the information and matching it to the arguments of the controller method. public class Data { public string ID { get; set; } } public void Index(Data data) { // data.id should be set } Silverlight runs on the client, therefore it cannot access the values on the server. However, the sever can pass the info to the client.
