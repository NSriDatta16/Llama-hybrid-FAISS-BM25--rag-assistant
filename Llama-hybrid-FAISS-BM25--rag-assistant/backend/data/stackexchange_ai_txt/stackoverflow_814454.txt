If you want to write good software then step away from your computer Go and hang out with the end users and the people who want and need the software. Only from them will you understand what your software needs to accomplish and how it needs to do that. Ask them what the love & hate about the existing processes. Ask them about the future of their processes, where it is headed. Hang out and see what they use now and figure out their usage patterns. You need to meet and match their usage expectations. See what else they use a lot, particularly if they like it and can use it efficiently. Match that. The end user doesn't give a rat's how elegant your code is or what language it's in. If it works for them and they like using it, you win. If it doesn't make their lives easier and better - they hate it, you lose. Walk a mile in their shoes - then go write your code.
