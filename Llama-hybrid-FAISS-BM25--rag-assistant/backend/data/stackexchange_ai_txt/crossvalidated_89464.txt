Eigenvectors computed by Matlab's princomp() and eig() have different signs

I am trying to write a PCA function in MATLAB. I know that there is the function princomp , I just wanted to understand the process for myself. One problem I've encountered is that the eig matrix calculation on the covariance matrix is incorrect. I have this covariance matrix: matCov = 0.6166 0.6154 0.6154 0.7166 And when I call the eig function, I get: eVec = -0.7352 0.6779 0.6779 0.7352 Whereas, with the function princomp I get: eVec = -0.7352 -0.6779 0.6779 -0.7352 I know that it's the same, but each time I calculate the eigenvectors matrix (ordered by decreasing variance values) using the princomp function and the eig function, the last column of the eigVectors matrix are different. Can anyone explain this?
