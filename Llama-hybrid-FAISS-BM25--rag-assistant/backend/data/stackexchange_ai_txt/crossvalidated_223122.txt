Update 28 July : the below has now been pushed to CRAN in the generalhoslem package along with the Lipsitz and Pulkstenis-Robinson tests. Fagerland and Hosmer discuss a generalisation of the Hosmer-Lemeshow test and two other approaches (the Lipsitz test and Pulkstenis-Robinson tests) in A goodness-of-fit test for the proportional odds regression model 2013 Stat Med and in Tests for goodness of fit in ordinal logistic regression models (2016) Journal of Statistical Computing and Simulation . I haven't checked properly yet, but as far as I know, they haven't been implemented in R. If that turns out to be the case, I plan to add them to the generalhoslem package. EDIT: it's probably also worth pointing out Fagerland and Hosmer's recommendation that because the tests may detect different types of lack of fit, a thorough assessment of goodness of fit requires use of all three approaches. ANOTHER EDIT: I didn't realise this straight away but the only difference between the multinomial version of the Hosmer-Lemeshow test and the ordinal version is in the degrees of freedom. Strictly speaking, the test for ordinal response models requires sorting the observations by a weighted ordinal 'response score' but they show in the 2012 article above that that is equivalent to binning the observations in the same way as in the multinomial case. I haven't properly tested it but the the logitgof function on my github page should now do the trick: https://github.com/matthewjay15/generalhoslem-v1.1.0/blob/1.2.0.9000/logitgof.R Note that if you examine the observed and expected tables produced by this function, then the columns may not be in the right order (they will be alphabetical). This shouldn't make any difference to the test statistic, though, as they will correspond to each other. An example using the ordinal and MASS packages: library(reshape) # needed by logitgof logitgof
