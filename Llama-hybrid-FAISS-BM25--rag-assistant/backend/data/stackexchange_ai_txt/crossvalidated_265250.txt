As noted in earlier answers, the empirical frequency$$\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \mathbb{I}_{(-\infty,x]}(X_i) \stackrel{\Delta}{=} \frac{1}{N} S_N$$is associated with a Binomial variate $S_N\sim\text{Bin}(N,p)$ for which a conservative confidence interval can be constructed. There are many proposals for this construction . Including one by George Casella . For instance, Jeffreys' confidence interval on $p$ with coverage $1-2\alpha$ is given by N=50;SN=13;alpha=.05 qbeta(alpha,.5+SN,.5+N-SN) [1] 0.1268967 qbeta(1-alpha,.5+SN,.5+N-SN) [1] 0.4364774
