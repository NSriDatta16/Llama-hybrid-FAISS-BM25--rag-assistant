ActionScript 3 & font embedding

I have a problem with doing proper font embedding in a actionscript 3 project (flash CS4, not flex). I followed this Adobe guide to do font embedding: http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flash/quickstart/embedding_fonts/ the guide tells to set the Textfield.embedFonts property to true. if I do so and try to display a text with another font in this textfield, then nothing is displayed - that's fine, i expect it like this. But now I have this particular problem: i embed the font "Arial" in Regular style and create two input Textfields on the stage. one of them i set the embedFonts property to true (as described in the guide) the other i leave as is. Now I publish the thing as swf and try to enter the following (Turkish) string into the textfield Yeni Yılın Barış ve Mutluluk Getirmesini Dileriz. now the problem is, that the untouched textfield displays the string correctly - but the one with embedFonts set to true is missing some of the letters (for example ş is not displayed). But the Arial font does have this letter since it is displayed correctly in static - so why does it not render correctly when i set this property (as told in the guide)? in my final app there shall be a single textField, but multiple embedded fonts and a way to switch between them (for example the user must be able to choose another font for entering chinese text). can someone tell me how to do it properly? thanks!
