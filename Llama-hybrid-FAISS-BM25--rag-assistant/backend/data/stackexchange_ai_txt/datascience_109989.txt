How do outliers and missing values impact these classifiers?

I am currently working with a bunch of classification models especially Logistic regression, KNN, Naive Bayes, SVM, and Decision Trees for my machine learning class. I know how to handle finding and removing the missing values and the outliers. But I would like to know which of the above models would perform really badly if the outliers and missing values are not removed. Like if I decide to leave the outliers and missing values in the dataset which model should I avoid? And how do I decide on which model to avoid?
