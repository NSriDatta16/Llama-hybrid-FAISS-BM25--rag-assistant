You should t-test the mean difference between smart phone users and non-smart phone users. Pearson's R is not appropriate for binary variables because it assumes that both variables are normally distributed (and X, in your case, cannot be because it is dichotomous). A t-test will ask if the mean score on the outcome (Y in this case) is significantly different across the two categories of X. This assumes that your Y variable is something that is appropriate for averaging. In other words it should at least be ordinal (meaning rank ordered categories) with 5 or so possible categories, an interval level of measurement is technically required but, in practice, ordinal is fine. There are several statistical tests and correlation coefficients that can be calculated and what you choose will probably be a function of whatever the convention is in your field for the sort of data you have. The t-test is pretty common across all fields, that's why I suggest it. Note also that the t-test doesn't give you an effect size - you are comparing the means of the two groups under the null hypothesis that the difference between them is 0 in the population. A statistically significant finding means only that the means are not the same in the population. You might also consider some effect size statistic - that's what Pearson's R is, but again that's not appropriate for binary variables.
