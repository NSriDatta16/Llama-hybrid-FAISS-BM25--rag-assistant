Identifying clickable area

I have a div class="parent" . When I click on it I need to clone div class="child" and show them depending on the parent area I clicked. The problem arises when I click on the div class="child", another child div appears which is the behavior I don't really want. One way to overcome this trouble is to write something like this: $('.parent').click(function(event){ if (event.target.className != 'child'){ $('.child').clone().show(); } }); I consider that this is not very elegant as, if inside of div class="child" would be children, then you have to put them in the if() statement also. Could someone tell me how to manage this problem. Probably there is a way to put all children of the div class="child" in an array and to loop over them. Any ideas and thoughts appreciated, Thanks
