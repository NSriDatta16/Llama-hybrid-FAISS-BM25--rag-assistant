1) Windows does cache recently read files in memory. The book Windows Internals includes an excellent description of how this works. Modern versions of Windows also use a technology called SuperFetch which will try to preemptively fetch disk contents into memory based on usage history and ReadyBoost which can cache to a flash drive, which allows faster random access. All of these will increase the speed with which data is accessed from disk after the initial run. 2) Directory really doesn't affect layout on disk. Defragmenting your drive will group file data together. Windows Vista on up will automatically defragment your disk. Ideally, you want to do large sequential reads and minimize your writes. Small random accesses and interleaving writes with reads significantly hurts performance. You can use the Windows Performance Toolkit to profile your disk access.
