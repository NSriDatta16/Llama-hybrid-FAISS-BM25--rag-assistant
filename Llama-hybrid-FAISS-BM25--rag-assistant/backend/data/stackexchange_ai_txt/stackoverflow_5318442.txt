I prefer, and use, your #1 option. I don't like #2 because to me View() implies you are returning an entire page. It should be a fully fleshed out and valid HTML page once the view engine is done with it. PartialView() was created to return arbitrary chunks of HTML. I don't think it's a big deal to have a view that just calls a partial. It's still DRY, and allows you to use the logic of the partial in two scenarios. Many people dislike fragmenting their action's call paths with Request.IsAjaxRequest() , and I can appreciate that. But IMO, if all you are doing is deciding whether to call View() or PartialView() then the branch is not a big deal and is easy to maintain (and test). If you find yourself using IsAjaxRequest() to determine large portions of how your action plays out, then making a separate AJAX action is probably better.
