Xcode, add folder to project that retains directory structure and update automatically

I have folder that I would like to include in my Xcode project, but I would like it to retain it's structure (subfolder, etc). When I drag it into the resources in Xcode it expands that folder into a group in the Xcode project. I would also like it to retain it's structure so I can add and remove files without re-adding the modified folder to the project constantly.
