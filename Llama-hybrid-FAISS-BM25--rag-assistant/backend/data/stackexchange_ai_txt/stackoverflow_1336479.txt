Take a look at this question . You could also just swap out the .git folder in your source tree with a different one, and check your code into that when you want to publish. You can not, however, set up a branch in the same Git repository without sharing the history, because of the way Git works. A repository has a root commit of the initial state, and all other commits are simply deltas against that commit. But while we are at it, if you don't want to expose version control history, why not simply publish the code as a tarball with a version number, no reason to drag Git into it :)
