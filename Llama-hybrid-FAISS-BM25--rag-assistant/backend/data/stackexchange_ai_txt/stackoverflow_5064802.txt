Alternative to instanceof approach in this case

Hello I'm wondering what would be some more elegant alternatives to something like this: class Base... class A extends Base... class B extends Base... //iterator of colection containing mixed As and Bs i want to remowe Bs and do omething with As while(iterator.hasNext()) { Base next = iterator.next(); if(next instanceof A) // do something if(next instanceof B) iterator.remove(); } Sow what are the alternatives... Thank you for advices. edit: Base class may have many subclasses not just two and their numbers may grow in time
