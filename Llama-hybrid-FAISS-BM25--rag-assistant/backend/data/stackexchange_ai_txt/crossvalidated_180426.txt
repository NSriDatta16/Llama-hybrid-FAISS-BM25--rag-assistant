My response is more from a practical perspective. I'm specifically going to address your second part of question: why can't we use machine learning techniques for time series? Reason #1: there is NO empirical evidence that machine learning are known to be superior than simple statistical time series models. Why bother with machine learning when there is no evidence present that it works in time series data?. I once read an article by the editor of the international journal of forecasting (a leading journal in time series forecasting) who said they very rarely if at all publish machine learning methods because machine learning can't even show superiority to naive methods like simple exponential smoothing. Reason #2: I read the book, The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction, Second Edition (Springer Series in Statistics) by Hastie et, al which is considered a bible for modern machine learning. If you look hard at the index the number of times "time series/time" is mentioned guess what, it is 0(zero). Same can be said for other machine learning books, I have very rarely come across time series in a machine learning context. Statisticians have elegantly handled time in methods that they have developed, I doubt if there exist similar methods in machine learning, may be its in infancy/ more research needed. I'm yet to see any empirical evidence that shows any machine learning techniques have superiority of traditional methods, may be someone can share it.
