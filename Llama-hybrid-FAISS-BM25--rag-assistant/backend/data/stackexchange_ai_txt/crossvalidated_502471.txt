What dimensionality reduction methods allow a lower dimensional reconstruction of the original data besides PCA via invertible transformations?

In eigenfaces, one used the inverse transformation PCA is capable of doing to reconstruct the low dimensional face image. In tsne one may not reconstruct the original dataset to produce something akin to eigenfaces as a result of the non invertibility of the transformation. What dimensionality reduction methods besides PCA allows reconstruction of the original image in lower dimensional space, .I.e what eigenfaces does?
