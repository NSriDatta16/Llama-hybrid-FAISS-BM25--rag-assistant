The amount of data you have will only limit the types of classifiers you can try out on the set. If you have 100 samples you might still be able to perform a Logistic Regression - but you can forget about a Neural Net (this would require 100,000+ samples). Take a look at this for more information on how much data is generally needed for ML.
