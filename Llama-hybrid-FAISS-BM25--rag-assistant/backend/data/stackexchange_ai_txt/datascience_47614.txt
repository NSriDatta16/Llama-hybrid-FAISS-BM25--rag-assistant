With 12 or more CPU cores, you wan work with pretty much any deep learning model. Only thing that will not work is training with 100k+ images or more than TBs of test. For such scenarios; you can seed the model with transfer learning. For example, training a Cat/Dog image classification model (from scratch) takes 2 hours on 6 core i5 (as compared to 30 minutes on GTX 1080ti).
