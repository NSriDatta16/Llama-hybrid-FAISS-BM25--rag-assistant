JTable by default installs a renderer for type Number. BigDecimal is-a Number so the default renderer is used instead of your custom renderer. BTW: your custom renderer is buggy in that it doesn't take potentially sorted/filtered rows into account (the row/column index params of the method are view coordinates). @eugener: your answer is wrong - it's not the storage that's important but the lookup ;-) Cheers Jeanette
