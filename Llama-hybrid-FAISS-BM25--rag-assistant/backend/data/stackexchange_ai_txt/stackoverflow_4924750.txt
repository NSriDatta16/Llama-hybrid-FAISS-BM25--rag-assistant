You could try this from the TeamCity documentation but it may not work with NTLM. What database are you using for the TeamCity installation? If you're using the SQL Server backend then you can look in the user_roles table, you would need to set the role_id to SYSTEM_ADMIN with a NULL for project id and find the user_id from the users table (the user will need to have logged into TeamCity). The approach would be similar for other storage backends but it may be easier to simply restart.
