I'll start at the bottom: typedef void Element creates a new name (Element) for an existing data type (void). Essentially, any place in the code where you have "Element" is, in effect, replaced with "void" before compilation. What you'll need to do to solve your problem is to take your (presumably automatic/stack storage) vector_value_int variable, and use it to create a new (heap-based, managed by your vector) integer, then use a pointer to that newly created integer, cast as an Element*, to pass into your Add_To_Vector function.
