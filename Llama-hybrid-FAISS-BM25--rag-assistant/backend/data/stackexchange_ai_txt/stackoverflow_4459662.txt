JNLP Applet loading on Safari or Firefox 3.6

I'm trying to load an applet using JNLP. Things work fine on every browser I've tested, except for Safari (tried on Safari 5.0.3 on OSX Snow Leopard). This seems a Safari related bug, because even the JNLP applet used for testing in the plugin2 page on Oracle doesn't seem to be working, as Safari tries to load "Ignored.class" instead of looking at JNLP file. Does anyone know a workaround for this issue?
