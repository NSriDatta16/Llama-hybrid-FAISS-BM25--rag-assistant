Approaches you could take for your primary problem: You could put in a zero (instead of a blank). This is somewhat logically consistent with the variable of size - implanting something of zero size is perhaps equivalent to not implanting anything. Related to this, you could put in a value that is substantially higher or lower than the range of values you have. This is particularly helpful when you are using modelling techniques that do not assume a linear relationship (such as a random forest). If not, you would have to give some thought to the shape of the relationship and how to model it (this advice is worth considering for approach #1 as well). Use two variables, one categorical (was the device implanted or not?) and the other continuous (size, with missing values for no device i.e. the same as your present variable). I don't know how to address your secondary problem (different devices, some with size unknown) well, but you could try using the device identity as a third variable (categorical, of course).
