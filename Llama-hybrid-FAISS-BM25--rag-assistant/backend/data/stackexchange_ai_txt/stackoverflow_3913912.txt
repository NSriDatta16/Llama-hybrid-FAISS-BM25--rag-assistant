What are "bad" attributes in unit tests?

I just read question that answered what were desirable features of unit tests, but what should be avoided? What makes a unit test "bad"? What are the worst unit tests you've seen? (For example. I remember a developer telling me he once found a test suite with plenty of methods but completely devoid of any asserts). I'm particularly interested in slightly more subtle and specific problems with unit tests e.g. suppose you have a test-suite that runs quickly with good coverage, what problems could it still have?
