As it is not possible to work with the data for this problem directly, let me attempt to address your questions in more general terms. Firstly, you must consider whether your time series T is of a type whereby it can be predicted in its own right using a model such as ARIMA. As a case in point, let us consider yearly temperature fluctuations. Here is a plot of temperature fluctuations for a region from 1962-2022: Weather is an example of a time series that has a clear seasonal trend, i.e. it gets warm in summer and cold in winter. By decomposing this time series, we can see the presence of a seasonality as well as a broader trend of generally increasing temperature, in addition to a random element. Seasonal Trend Random With a trend and seasonal factor, it is possible to use an ARIMA model to forecast weather patterns for future years. However, not all time series have such a pattern. In the first instance, I would recommend decomposing your time series T in order to determine if seasonality is present and if a trend exists. Without these attributes, it will be difficult to predict using a time series model such as ARIMA. With regards to your question about categories A and B â€“ I cannot say whether these factors alone would be of use in predicting the time series T. It could be the case that these variables explain a portion of the variance in your time series, but a significant portion of the variance is down to randomness or other important features that have not been included in the model. Under this circumstance, I would not expect the predictive power of your model to be high. To summarise, I would firstly recommend decomposing the time series to establish the presence of seasonality and trend. It may be the case that the time series T can be predicted in its own right without having to use A and B as explanatory variables within a model.
