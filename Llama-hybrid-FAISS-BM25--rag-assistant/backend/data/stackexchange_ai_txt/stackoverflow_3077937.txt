if you want a DSL that doesn't use ruby syntax, you need to write a parser at the very least to perform the transformation (raganwalds rewrite lib might be a starting point, http://github.com/raganwald/rewrite ) That said, you don't want to do this. This is more code to maintain and Ruby has already made a lot of the tough decisions that make writing a language syntax hard. Natural language programming also isn't much easier for nonprogrammers to use as the exactness of the format is the challenging aspect (see applescript for instance).
