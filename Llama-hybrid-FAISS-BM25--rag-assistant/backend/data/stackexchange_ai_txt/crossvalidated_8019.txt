Averaging correlation values

Let's say I test how variable Y depends on variable X under different experimental conditions and obtain the following graph: The dash lines in the graph above represent linear regression for each data series (experimental setup) and the numbers in the legend denote the Pearson correlation of each data series. I would like to calculate the "average correlation" (or "mean correlation") between X and Y . May I simply average the r values? What about the "average determination criterion", $R^2$? Should I calculate the average r and than take the square of that value or should I compute the average of individual $R^2$'s?
