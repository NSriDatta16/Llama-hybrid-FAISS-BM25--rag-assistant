Another take at answering your question: Assuming you have an existing workingcopy you should just use 'svn update' on the root of the directory containing the files you are looking at as that retrieves exactly what changed between your current revision and the HEAD revision with the least data possible. Older sourcecode management systems like CVS and VSS asked the server for every file has this file changed? , while subversion just sends the changes of a tree as a single action. When you pass a list of files to svn update you don't have this advantage. Therefore the most efficient way to transfer what has changed is just updating. This only transfers a binary diff of the changes in HEAD compared to the base version of your working copy. If the problem you are trying to solve is that svn update is to slow, then we are trying to solve that for Subversion 1.7. This version will introduce a new working copy data storage format that will make simple operations that have to lock an entire working copy (like updating) much faster.
