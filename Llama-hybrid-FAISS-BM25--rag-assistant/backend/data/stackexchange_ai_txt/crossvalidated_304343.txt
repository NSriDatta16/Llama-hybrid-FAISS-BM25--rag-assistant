Machine learning to classify tweets into topics â€“ Where to start?

I want to build something that can classify tweets (from my timeline or lists) by topic. I can of course provide a dataset of tweets pre-classified for each variant, but then the software should be able to learn from that and apply that logic to new, future tweets. Variant A) Take all tweets of a timeline and decide if one was "relevant" or "irrelevant". Variant B) Decide which of x topics a tweet belongs to. Variant C) Group similar tweets together that are related. So now my questions: Where to start? What are the correct terms to Google? What libraries or software should I look at? (I am most comfortable with JS and PHP, but of course this is only semi relevant.) (I asked this before on StackOverflow , but of course got "OFFTOPIC!!1" in the comments, where luckily someone posted a link to CrossValidated - and here I am.)
