Javascript append fragment to an existing HTML element

I have created a DOM fragment where I am adding several childNodes in a loop: fragment.appendChild( clone ) I want to take this fragment and use it to replace an existing HTML element that already contain those nodes. I can use myContainer.appendChild(fragment) However this is done also in a loop and the fragment is appended too many times. How can I get the fragment, append it to myContainer and delete also myContainer's old childs. Thank you.
