How to Use Magit Even More Effectively?

After an several-hour trial upon git using shell, I switched to magit It's pretty neat and efficient: I don't need to type "git" to invoke a git command anymore! But I still found one drawback comparing shell command line Every time I typed : to invoke git command, the output popped out in the other window. I had to type C-x o to switch back then type git command again. Is there a better way to keep typing and watching on the output at the same time other than shell-mode in emacs? Should I rebind the output to some mode else? which one? or a more elegant solution? Thanks a lot
