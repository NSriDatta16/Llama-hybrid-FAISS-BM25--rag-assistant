Trouble compiling a header file in VC++

I just reorganized the code for a project and now I'm getting errors I can't resolve. This header is included by a .cpp file trying to compile. #include "WinMain.h" #include "numDefs.h" #include class Entity { public: Entity(); virtual ~Entity(); virtual bitset getBitMask(); virtual void getMapSection(float x, float y, int w, int h, bitset * section); }; I'm getting these compiler errors for the declaration of Entity::getBitMask(): error C2143: syntax error : missing ';' before ' error C2433: 'Entity::bitset' : 'virtual' not permitted on data declarations error C4430: missing type specifier - int assumed. Note: C++ does not support default-int error C2238: unexpected token(s) preceding ';' There are more similar errors for the next line as well. It seems like bitset isn't getting included but it clearly is? I can't figure out what's going wrong. WinMain.h includes windows.h, and numDefs.h includes nothing. Using MS Visual C++ 2008.
