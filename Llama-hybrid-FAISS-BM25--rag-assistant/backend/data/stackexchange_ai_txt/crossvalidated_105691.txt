Nonparametric test for largely skewed count data

My research design looks as follows: an experimental game with 4 participants (human subjects), repeated for 20 rounds. During each round, participants are allowed to form bilateral coalitions which are “frozen” until the end of a round. Hence, six different possible coalitions exist, but maximum two coalitions can emerge during a single round. The same setup is tested through a simulation, where simulation agents follow pre-set decision rules to form coalitions, the difference from the experiment being that all simulation rounds are independent. For the experiment and for the simulation, I have the data on the number of times each particular coalition was formed. It can be visually represented on a bar chart, on which each colored bar corresponds to each of the possible coalitions, and the vertical axis shows the number of times it occurred (count variables). My general idea is to understand whether stable coalition relationships emerge between participants in the experiment as they play repeatedly: for example, whether participant 1 tends to form coalitions with participant 2 more often than with other players. To that end, I would like to test: Whether there are statistical differences between the frequency of occurrences of different coalitions; Whether the experimentally observed frequency distribution statistically differs from a theoretical benchmark (each coalition occurs with the equal 1/6=0.15 probability). What would be the appropriate test in this case given that I am working count data which is (a) not normally distributed, (b) is largely skewed (a numeric outcome is frequently zero)?
