What is the problem you are attempting to solve with the system? What type of data are you analysing? Assuming this is an analysis system rather than a transactional processing system there are tools for analysing large data sets that might have the functionality you need without requiring you to write too much code. For example the Visualisation Toolkit from Kitware www.vtk.org or MIDAS http://www.kitware.com/products/midas.html MIDAS integrates multimedia server technology with Kitwareâ€™s open-source data analysis and visualization clients. The server follows open standards for data storage, access and harvesting. MIDAS has been optimized for storing massive collections of scientific data and related metadata and reports. MIDAS is available under a non-restrictive (BSD) open-source license. Alternatively IBM have OpenDX http://www.research.ibm.com/dx/
