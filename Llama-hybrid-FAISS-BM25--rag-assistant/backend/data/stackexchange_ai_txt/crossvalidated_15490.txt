Average number of cards of a particular suit in a hand

I am creating a card game AI for an iPhone game and I'm stumped trying to come up with this statistic. The deck has 4 suits. The cards are numbered 1-14 in each suit and there is one Joker. So, the deck has 57 cards. One player will be dealt 18 cards and this person will also get to decide which suit the Joker is (so there are technically 15 cards of that suit) and calls that suit trump. What is the average number of trump cards that this person will have? Can you help me understand how I would figure this out? I took a few stats classes in college, and it's all gone!
