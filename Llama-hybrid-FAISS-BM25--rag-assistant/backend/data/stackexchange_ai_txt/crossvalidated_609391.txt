Missing at Random / Missing not at Random

I plan a study where I predict variables with machine learning methods integrating data from multiple surveys. The questionnaires assessed with each survey slightly differ, so that I have a lot of missing values (e.g. Questionnaire 1 was assessed in survey 1,2,3, but not in survey 4). My question is, do the Missing at Random assumption hold, if the different samples differ systematically in e.g. age? As far as I understood, loosely speaking, if e.g. age can predict the absence of values but is not related to the specific values itself (e.g. expression in a specific item), than the missing at random assumption and imputation is still valid. But in my case, they are probably low correlations between some questionnaire facets and age. Is this a problem if I plan to impute the missing values, using mean imputation or more sophisticated methods? Greetings
