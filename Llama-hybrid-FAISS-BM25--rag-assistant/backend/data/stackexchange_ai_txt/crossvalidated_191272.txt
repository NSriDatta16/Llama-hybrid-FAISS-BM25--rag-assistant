What is a credibility value in meta-analyses?

I came across the term credibility value in reference to meta-analytic analyses and am not familiar with it. It is similar to a credibility interval? Here is the context: "Because there is more variation in business units pooled across companies than there is within the average company across business units, estimated correlations are larger when true validity estimates are calculated for business units across companies. For instance, consider the estimates relative to the customer satisfactionâ€“loyalty criterion. Without the between company range-restriction correction, the true validity value of overall satisfaction was .23 (True Validity A) with a 90% credibility value (CV) of .17. This is the relation expected within a typical company. With the between-company range-restriction correction (True Validity B), the true validity value of overall satisfaction was .28 with a 90% CV of .21. This is the relation expected in business units pooled across companies (i.e., in the total population of business units)" Harter et al. (2002).
