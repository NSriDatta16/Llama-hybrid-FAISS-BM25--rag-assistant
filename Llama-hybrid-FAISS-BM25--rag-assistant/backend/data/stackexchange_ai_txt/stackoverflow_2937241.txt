Sending an email when an Exception is Thrown

I have written a java class where if a method throws an exception, an email is sent, via java mail, with a report to the administrators. It works - my question is w.r.t elegance - to catch the exception thrown by the main method, the sendEmail() method resides in the catch block of the main method. The sendEmail() method has its own try-catch block. In effect - it looks like below - is there a more beautiful way of writing this? try { foo; } catch { try{ sendEmail(); } catch { log(e.message); } }
