Based on the information you have provided, you have a binary outcome: Learning Yes/No and a single exposure/explanatory variable (also binary: computing background Yes/no). Calculating an odds ratio could be one quick way to see if the computing background really affects the distribution of your participants in the Learning Yes/No categories. It would give you an answer to this question: What are the odds of learning, given a computing background? Since this is just a bivariate analysis, I would be very cautious in interpreting the odds since it is possible that you have other hidden variables (that you are not aware of, or are not measuring) that may affect learning in your experiment. If you do have other variables and want to measure their effect as well, I would recommend increasing your sample population size (a rule of thumb is 10-15 more participants per success/failure in learning - whichever is lower) and possibly doing a logistic regression. This will also give you an odds ratio but you can do a multivariable analysis.
