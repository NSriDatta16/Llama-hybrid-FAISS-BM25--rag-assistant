Have you considered SSIS or SSSB? With SSIS, you can basically create packages that are scheduled to run at whatever interval you want and push the relevant data to the main server ( push, not pull ) With SSSB, you can trickle changes over to main server asynchronously using queues and remote endpoints. You can also try streaming transaction logs, or just plain FTPing tran logs over to the main box on a schedule using either SSIS and SQL agent or something similar (Windows Task Scheduler), restoring them to a POS-specific DB and then merging with the main DB. Either of the three is relatively tolerant of network interruption (SSSB requires some code to handle it, but it can be done).
