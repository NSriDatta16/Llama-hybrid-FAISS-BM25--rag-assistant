Find parameters in an algorithm with Machine Learning

I work on an equalization project. I've implemented the Least Mean Squares (LMS) algorithm with a set of data. To initialize coefficients h : h[k+1] = h[k] + mu e[k] x[k] . I need to find a compromize between the time to converge and the final Mean Squared Error (MSE) by adjusting the convergence parameter mu . I would like to know if there is an AI which could find the parameter mu . Something not complicated to implement (I don't have a huge background on AI/ML). Thanks in advance.
