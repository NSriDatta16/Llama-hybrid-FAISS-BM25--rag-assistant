I don't think it counts as "open-source", but I loved QBasic Gorilla.Bas grin I used to edit it to make all buildings disappear when the banana hits the sun; then it's a Banana Free-For-All! xD I also took the liberty to rename the game QBrian Gorilla to make fun of a friend of mine... Lame, I know, but hey, I was 14. Haha.. QBasic was the first programming language I got into, before later moving on to VB, and then ASP, PHP and VB.Net. Ah, nostalgia... =)
