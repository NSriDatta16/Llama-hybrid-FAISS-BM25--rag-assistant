How to interpret the evidence ratio using BRMS in R?

I am running a frequentist multi-level meta-analysis. However a reviewer has requested a bayesian alternative, so I can provide Bayes Factors. My summary of my code is as follows: priors 0") print(hyp) output for 'hyp': Hypothesis Tests for class b: Hypothesis Estimate Est.Error CI.Lower CI.Upper Evid.Ratio Post.Prob Star 1 (Intercept) > 0 0.29 0.1 0.12 0.46 199 1 Am I right in interpreting Evid.Ratio as BF10 for the hypothesis that the meta-analytic estimate > 0.
