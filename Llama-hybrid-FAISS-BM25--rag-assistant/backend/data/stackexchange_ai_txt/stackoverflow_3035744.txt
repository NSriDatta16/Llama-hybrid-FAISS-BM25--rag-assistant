First thanks very much for @Nick's answer. Here I clarify the answer in a more direct way specific to my problem in case anyone else encountering the same problem asks for help here. It seems with eventual consistency you can't make a query, at least a query by key, within a transaction , otherwise an exception message described in my question will be thrown. In the related official documentation of Google App Engine, it doesn't point out directly, but with some sentences like this: All update operations (create, update, delete) occur in primary storage. A strongly consistent read of an entity may still be one operation or transaction behind, since a transaction is applied after it is committed. Eventual consistency may need to read from storage location other than the primary one and may conflict with transactional consistency so it is not allowed an eventual-consistency read within a transaction as I see it. Strong consistency is used by default without any configuration. For my own problem I just deleted the following line in the persistence.xml (JPA): Thanks again, Nick!
