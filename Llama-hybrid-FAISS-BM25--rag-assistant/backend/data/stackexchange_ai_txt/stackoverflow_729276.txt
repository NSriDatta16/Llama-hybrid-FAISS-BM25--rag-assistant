Compact Framework: Failed to use InputPanel in a control

I developed a control that uses the PDA's InputPanel to interact with the user. The relevant part of the code is below: namespace MyNamespace { // ... using Microsoft.WindowsCE.Forms; // ... public class MyControl { // ... public InputPanel MyPanel { get; set; } // ... } } Whenever I try to drag the Control to a Form , I get the following error: System.IO.FileNotFoundException: Could not load file or assembly ‘Microsoft.WindowsCE.Forms, Version=2.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=969db8053d3322ac’ or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified. File name: ‘Microsoft.WindowsCE.Forms, Version=2.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=969db8053d3322ac’ If I remove the InputPanel line from MyControl I can add it to the Form without any problems. Once the Control is added I can add the line again and the whole program compiles and works fine. As soon as the form with the Control is viewed in the Designer, it crashes with a similar error as written above and I can't add it to any other Form again. I am using Visual Studio 2008 SP1 with the Windows Mobile 6 SDK. So my questions is: Has anyone experienced a similar problem or found a workaround? EDIT: Gave up and used the parent form as a property. The form implements IInputPanel which is basically an interface with an InputPanel getter. Nevertheless ctake's answer was really insightful and introduced me to XMTA.
