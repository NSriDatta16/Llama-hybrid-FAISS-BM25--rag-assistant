Make sure you consider all of the possible edge cases: What happens randomNode equals firstNode ? What do you return? What should you return? What happens when randomNode is the last node in the list? What happens when randomNode is NULL ? What happens when randomNode is not in the list? Now, not all of these cases may be applicable, depending on if you know anything about randomNode , and some of these may be trivial. But they are all worth thinking about. If you consider all of these very carefully, there is a simple and elegant solution that handles them all.
