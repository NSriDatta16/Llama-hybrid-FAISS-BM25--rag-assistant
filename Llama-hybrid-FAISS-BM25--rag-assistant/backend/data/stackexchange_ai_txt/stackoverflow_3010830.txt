Asterisk Manager API SIPPeers - Permission Denied

I'm wanting to use the asterisk manager api to show the status of all my SIP lines in a PHP web interface. I thought I'd start simple and use telnet to see it working. So I created a user in /etc/asterisk/manager.conf [portal] secret = password read = all,system,call,log,verbose,command,agent,user Then telnet to localhost on port 5038 This is what I get: asterisk ~ # telnet localhost 5038 Trying 127.0.0.1... Connected to localhost. Escape character is '^]'. Asterisk Call Manager/1.0 Action: login Username: portal Secret: 8u9sdgk Events: off Response: Success Message: Authentication accepted Action: SIPPeers Response: Error Message: Permission denied Why am I getting permission denied? I thought the user has basically full access? Do I need to restart asterisk to make this work? I didn't restart it. On the other hand, I was able to log in which makes me think that the manager.conf has been reloaded as the portal user didn't exist before. Any ideas?
