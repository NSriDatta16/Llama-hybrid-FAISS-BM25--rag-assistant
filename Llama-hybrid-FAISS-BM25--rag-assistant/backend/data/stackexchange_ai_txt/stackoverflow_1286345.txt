Seems like you need to merge the indexes in code. If I understand correctly, when searching for a term, there can be either matches to document text or to tags, and each tag is indexed with its relevant document ids. You will then have two hit lists to merge. As tags and full text are very different entities, you will need some weighting (maybe as field boosts during retrieval) to reach a good ranking. Thus, you can merge the tag hit and full text hit for document k using a formula like: score(k) = a*tagscore(k)+b*fulltextscore(k) Where a and b will be empirically determined coefficients. For a much more detailed discussion, see Grant Ingersoll's findability and debugging relevance issues in search papers.
