There is a standardized SQL. As the other replies state, the database vendors come with extensions specific to their database engines. From my experience with databases (specially in case of large databases), trying to implement a "cross vendor" database has little meaning. The extensions in data definition language, for example, allow the developer/dba to optimize the database performance using vendor's specific features (e.g. phisical representation of the tables, details about storage of a table, index facitilites, etc). In case of queries, again, for large databases, you might need to provide hints to the database engine for building the execution plan. The syntax of the hints is, once again, specific to the vendor. These are some examples of "non-standard" features that might have significant impact. Again, from my experience, unfortunately, a lot of customers or technical guys (architects?) provide less attention to the database details and miss the powerfull features a database provide for data management and access.
