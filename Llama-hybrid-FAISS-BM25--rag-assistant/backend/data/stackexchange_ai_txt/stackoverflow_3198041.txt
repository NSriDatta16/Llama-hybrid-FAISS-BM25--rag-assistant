Extend Workflow Foundation FlowChart

I would like to create a custom reusable workflow foundation activity based on the FlowChart activity. All of the built in classes are sealed therefore I cannot inherit it. These activities will be used in an application which re-hosts the workflow designer and used by non-developers. I can inherit from the NativeActivity class. However, I need to be able to drag and drop activities into this custom activity just like the FlowChart activity. Summary: does anyone have an example or ideas on how to implement a custom workflow activity which behaves just like the FlowChart (in the designer and at runtime) but allows me to extend the class with my own custom logic behind the scenes? I think I may be simply looking for or reusing the same ActivityDesigner that the FlowChart uses. Is that possible?
