Consider the following problem in reverse. I had data for 600 people and I recorded the mean and SD of their height and I noted also that height is normally distributed. But I threw away the 600 individual height measurements. Can you tell me the heights of the 600 people? You can not solve this problem. You could simulate from a distribution with those properties, but you cannot solve this problem. Data once discarded cannot be recovered. Your problem is not identical in form, as you have a time series. But how could that help? If you were willing to make some physically dubious assumptions about wind speed changing according to some scheme you could perhaps make better guesses than just simulating, but you are asking for white magic where no magic exists. You used the tags "monte carlo" and "markov chain", but it is not clear to me why.
