You want to keep your model as simple as possible so it won't overfit. This usually means making simple assumptions about the distribution the data comes from. Some possibilities are Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, some type of decision tree, maybe linear SVM (without playing with the external parameters too much). Also, you should try to have a very small number of features. You can try various feature selection methods, but if you want to learn about the importance of the original features, try not to distort the feature space (e.g. no PCA).
