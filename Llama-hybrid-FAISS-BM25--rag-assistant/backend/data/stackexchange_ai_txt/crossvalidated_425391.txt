When the noises are assumed to be independent , then their joint density function is the product of marginal densities by definition of independence. See pag. 9 of this . You can see that the random variables A and B are independent if $P(A \cap B)=P(A)P(B)$ . So here, the joint density is the product of marginal densities. Summation canâ€™t be the solution as, intuitively, if you flip a coin twice, the prob that you will have two heads in a row (1/2*1/2=1/4) must be lower than the probability of having two generic results either head or tail (1/2+1/2=1). The average would just be the sum divided by two, so conceptually nothing changes and it is still wrong for the same reason. Indeed here you are seeking the intersection between having a tail at the first flip and a tail at the second. You are not happy with any two outcomes, you want exactly two heads in a row. That is why you have a product. Finally, the fact that the noises are identically distributed allows you to keep the same pdf function for each observation. That is why, in the product mentioned above, you have the same pdf function for each term of the product. Which explains the shape of the joint pdf as a product of marginal pdf (due to the assumed independence of noises) with the same pdf function (due to the assumed identical distribution).
