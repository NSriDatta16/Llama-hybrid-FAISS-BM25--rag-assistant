When you speak of reproduced correlations in factor analysis it is very important to remember the difference between factor analysis in proper sense (FA) and principal component analysis (PCA). FA aims to reproduce correlations (or covariances) by means of m latent variables ( m p , where p is the number of variables). PCA, on the other hand, aims to account for multivariate variance as much as possible by m its latent variables; it does not pursue to explain correlations, and often m components reproduce them poorly (all p components reproduce them perfectly though). So there's no wonder if your single component fails to reproduce correlations precisely enough. Try FA instead of PCA, to see, and try to extract 2 factors in place of one, too.
