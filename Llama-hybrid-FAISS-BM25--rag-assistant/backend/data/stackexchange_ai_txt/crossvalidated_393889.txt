It seems to me you might have a more "elegant" solution using a linear model with contrasts to test mean differences in headaches present in the different clinical groups. For example you could employ the following linear model (the "cell means model"): \begin{eqnarray*} Y_{ij} & = & \mu+\epsilon_{ij} \end{eqnarray*} where $Y_{ij}$ is the number of headaches reported for the $j$ th individual in the $i$ th clinical group, and $\epsilon_{ij}$ is the error term, where $\epsilon_{ij}\sim N\left(0,\sigma^{2}\right)$ , and $i=1,\ldots r$ ; $j=1,\ldots n_{i}$ . In terms of your data, the model can be specified in matrix terms as: \begin{eqnarray*} \boldsymbol{Y} & = & \boldsymbol{X\beta}+\boldsymbol{\epsilon} \end{eqnarray*} where $\boldsymbol{Y}=\begin{bmatrix}Y_{11}\\ Y_{12}\\ \vdots\\ Y_{1n_{1}}\\ Y_{21}\\ Y_{22}\\ \vdots\\ Y_{2n_{2}} \end{bmatrix}$ , $\boldsymbol{\beta}=\left[\begin{array}{c} \mu_{1}\\ \mu_{2} \end{array}\right]$ , $\boldsymbol{X}=\left[\begin{array}{cc} 1 & 0\\ \vdots & \vdots\\ 1 & 0\\ 0 & 1\\ \vdots & \vdots\\ 0 & 1 \end{array}\right]$ , and $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}=\begin{bmatrix}\epsilon_{11}\\ \epsilon_{12}\\ \vdots\\ \epsilon_{1n_{1}}\\ \epsilon_{21}\\ \epsilon_{22}\\ \vdots\\ \epsilon_{2n_{2}} \end{bmatrix}$ . In this case, you'd simply create $r$ columns for each of your $r$ treatments, where a 1 would be present if the patient was in the clinical group (zero otherwise). Then you could simply perform the hypothesis test: \begin{align*} H_{0}\text{: } & \mu_{1}=\mu_{2} & \text{versus} & & H_{1}\text{: } & \text{not all } \mu_{i} \text{ are equal} \end{align*} This would tell you if there were any differences in the mean number of headaches among the groups. This can be extended, without loss of generality, to the case where you specify multiple (i.e. $r > 2$ ) clinical groups. You could then create contrasts to determine, if, for example, one group's mean number of headaches was different from the mean of all groups, for example, if $r=4$ (i.e. you had four clinical groups), you could simply test: \begin{align*} H_{0}: & L=0 & \text{versus} & & H_{1}: & L\ne0 \end{align*} where $L=\mu_{1}-\frac{\mu_{1}+\mu_{2}+\mu_{3}+\mu_{4}}{4}$ . You could also test this with matrices using $H_0:\boldsymbol{C^{\prime}X}=0$ where $\boldsymbol{C^{\prime}}=\begin{bmatrix}\frac{3}{4} & -\frac{1}{4} & -\frac{1}{4} & -\frac{1}{4}\end{bmatrix}$ . Of course, you would need to make multiple comparison adjustments if you performed multiple tests of contrasts (e.g. Tukey's, Scheffe's, or Bonferroni's Multiple Comparison's Procedure). However, if you are really only interested in testing the equality of the mean number of headaches across clinical groups, you could do this with the one omnibus $F$ test. For additional details, see Chapters 16 and 17 in Applied Linear Statistical Models, 5th ed. by Kutner, et al. One final note is that if you use a linear models approach, you'd have to ensure that the assumptions of the linear model are appropriate for your data (but to be clear, you'd need to do this in your t-test approach too). Since you are dealing with count data, the errors may not align with the error term assumptions of the model. Therefore, you may have to use a Poisson regression or consider using some other model appropriate for count data.
