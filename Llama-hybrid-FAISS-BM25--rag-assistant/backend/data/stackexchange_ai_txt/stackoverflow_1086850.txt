I'm having the same problem, and came across this blog , which basically states that Linq-To-Sql has got a problem in it's optimistic concurrency where: High precision datetime fields are used. The solution is to set UpdateCheck to never for that column your DBML file GridView columns which are set to invisible are accessing a property on the data object (this second reason makes no sense, but it seems to be all the rage on that blog). I haven't tried these solutions yet, but will post back here once I have.
