What is the difference between Reinforcement Learning(RL) and Markov Decision Process(MDP)?

What is the difference between a Reinforcement Learning(RL) and a Markov Decision Process(MDP)? I believed I understood the principles of both, but now when I need to compare the two I feel lost. They mean almost the same to me. Surely they are not. Links to other resources are also appreciated.
