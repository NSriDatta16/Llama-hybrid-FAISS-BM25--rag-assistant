I have a similar situation like yours. I use Windows for development and about a year back purchased a MBP for home (as I shifted to an office). I find it really difficult to get any real work done on my MBP. Somehow am used to the Windows environment with dual screens. But let that not stop you. A couple of software which I suggest you should get are: Transmit - Good ftp client MAMP - Runs a webserver nearly out-of-the-box. Good for basic development Quicksilver - Helps in quick finding of applications Spaces along with gestures (Configure your gestures to move from one screen to another, I use three fingers glide. its amazing) Entourage - for email Terminal - for ssh (putty alternative) (included) Dreamweaver/BBedit/Textmate (all pretty decent. but i love editplus on windows. not a fan of IDE) I assume your question is not about learning COCOA and more about being more effective using a MAC. Well, the above tools might help you. Unfortunately, your question isn't very clear as to what you really want.
