Need an encrypted online source code backup service

Please note this is not a question about online/hosted SVN services. I am working on a home based, solo developer, project that now has commercial significance and it is time to think about remote source code backup. There is no need for file level check in/out, all I need is once a day or once a week directory level snapshot to remote storage. Automatic encryption would be a bonus to protect my IP. What I have in mind is some sort of GUI interface app that will squirt a source code snapshot off to an Amazon S3 bucket on an automatic schedule. (My development PC runs on MS Windows.)
