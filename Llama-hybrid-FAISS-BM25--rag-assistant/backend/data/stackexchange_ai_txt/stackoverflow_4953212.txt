I took one look at that book of code someone linked and knew there was a way to do it. Low and behold I was right. protected void Show_Products(int item) { using (storeDataContext db = new storeDataContext()) { var q = db.Items.OrderBy(x=> x.Name).Select(x => x); switch (item) { case 1: var q = db.Items.OrderBy(x=> x.Name).Select(x => x); break; case 2: q = db.Items.OrderBy(x => x.MSRP).Select(x => x); break; default: break; } foreach(var n in q) { Do work } } } I initially set var q to a query for initialization, but it doesn't matter because this method will be passed a parameter which will change it. It may not be the most elegant way, but for only a few options I think it is doable.
