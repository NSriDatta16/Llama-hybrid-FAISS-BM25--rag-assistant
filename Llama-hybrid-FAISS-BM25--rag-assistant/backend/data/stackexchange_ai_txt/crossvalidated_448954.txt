The answer to your question can be very simple or very deep, even with some philosophical idea involved (e.g., Bayesian and frequentist). I will try to answer it using frequentist's point of view and with Maximize Likelihood Estimation . We will start with the coin flip example. Let's assume each coin has its own attributes, may be this attributes is related to the physical mass distribution of the coin or the exact shape of the coin (may be the mass is not evenly distributed or not perfect round shape), but for one given coin, it has one parameter $\theta$ (probability of getting head), and this parameter has a "true value", we want to estimate. Note that, this "true" value is "fixed" and unknown andWe can use experiment to estimate $\theta$ . Suppose we flip this coin $10$ times and we get $6$ head. How would we estimate the $\theta$ ? By intuition, we may say, we use the occurrence divided by the sample size. But why we have this intuition? The answer is this is the Maximize the Likelihood Estimation (MLE). Note that, we can estimate $\theta$ by other estimator and the $\theta$ does not need to be 6/10. But it is very reasonable to use MLE. Here is why. Assume independent samples, the probability of getting data is $$ \theta^6(1-\theta)^4 $$ On the other hand, we know $\theta$ is between $0$ and $1$ . If we plot the probability of getting data respect $\theta$ we get: Note that, the probability of getting data (likelihood function) is maximized when we set $\theta$ to $0.6$ . And this is why we use the empirical frequency to estimate the unknown parameter
