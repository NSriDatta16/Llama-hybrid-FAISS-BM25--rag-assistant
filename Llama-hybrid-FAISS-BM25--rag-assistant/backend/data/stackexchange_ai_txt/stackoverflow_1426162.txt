WPF binding to GetTranslation(string key) method for localization

I'm a beginner in WPF and currently working on my first app. For this project I'm supposed to use this method to add localization in the app: [TranslationService.cs] public class TranslationService { string language; public TranslationService(string language) { this.language = language; } public string GetTranslation(string key) { var value = *select the value from database based on "key" and "language"* return value; } } I'm trying to figure out how I can use this GetTranslation method in XAML in an elegant way.. but I'm having a hard time. I'm after something like this: [SomePage.xaml] .. .. I reallly tried figuring it out myself using the 2 WPF books I have and some googling.. but I get lost in the new syntax.. Who can help me get back on track?
