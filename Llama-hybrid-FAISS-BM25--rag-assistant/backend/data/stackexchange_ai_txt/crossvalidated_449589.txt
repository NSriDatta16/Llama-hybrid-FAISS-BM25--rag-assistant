" tomorrow's NEW sale's depends on today's sales " is never the conclusion because that is naive and clearly false as the past never causes the future . What you do today may be correlated with what you did yesterday BUT yesterday is not the cause. Last month's sales do not cause this month's sales but last month's sales may have been caused by the # of salesman and if the # of salesman remains constant or the pattern of the history of salesman remains constant then previous sales can be a barometer of this month's sales BUT it is never the cause just a proxy for what you didn't specify. What is said is that given what factors are causing sales is constant then previous sales are a PROXY for the the unspecified causal factors. This is why modern time series analysis uses a possible triad of factors ... 1) causal variables and their lags (X) 2) unspecified stochastic causals whose effects are being proxied by lags of the series being forecasted (arima component). Note that arima models using error terms are equivalent to memory models in Y . 3) latent deterministic structure(I) such as level shifts , local time trends , seasonal pulses and pulses ALL of which are proxies for unknown deterministic effects AND should be investigated/detailed to uncover the true cause. See http://www.autobox.com/pdfs/regvsbox-old.pdf for a discussion of arima and regression with time series data (transfer functions or SARMAX) . See https://autobox.com/pdfs/SARMAX.pdf for a presentation of the the three kinds of factors As usual the role of a good moderator is always to tease out more and more and more ... so here goes with some more .. I hope this helps just a little bit if y(t)=3+2*x(t) + a(t) true state of nature BUT we only have the past of y and we don't know x if x(t)=[theta(B)/phi(B)]*e(t) then by substitution y(t)=3+2*{[ thetha(B)/phi(B) ]*e(t) } + a(t) y(t)= is then a combination of e(t) and a(t) culminating y(t)=[ma/ar]*w(t) an arima model is a poor man's regression model .
