Single models are much easier to interpret than ensembles. They are therefore often more easily accepted by non-technical users, and are easier to troubleshoot (e.g., when a prediction is way off). Averaged models are much harder to apply null hypothesis significance testing to. This is a very hard criterion in many domains where publishability hinges on p values.
