Relationship discovery using Neural networks

Suppose I am sampling a number of signals at a fixed rate (say once per second) and extracting some metrics from the signals such as, ratio of one to the other, the rate of change, relative rate of change, etc. I've heard that Neural Networks can be of use in discovering relationships. Is this true? If so, what books/internet resources can I use to learn more about how do do this. The processing is being done is Java, so a Java slant on all your answers would be most appreciated. Thanks
