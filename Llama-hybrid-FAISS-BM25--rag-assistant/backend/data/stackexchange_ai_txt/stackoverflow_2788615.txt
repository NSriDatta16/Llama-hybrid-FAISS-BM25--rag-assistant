Take a look here for a similar (but slightly different) problem that I had a little while ago. Basically you cannot run the service as the normal 'SYSTEM' account, you need to specify and configure a local user, with the appropriate permissions and configure the service to run as that user. Then log into the server as the user and run any svn command at the command line; Bert suggests: svn info https://sp-ci.sbsnetwork.local:8443/svn/IntranetPortal/Source you should be prompted for the SVN username and password which are then cached in the appropriate location. You should also be prompted to accept the certificate - which you should do. Now the service should run without any problems.
