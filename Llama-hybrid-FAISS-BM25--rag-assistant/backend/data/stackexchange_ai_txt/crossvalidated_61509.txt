The main effects in the interaction model are a different kind of thing than the main effects in a model without an interaction. You might think of the main effects when there is no interaction as the average effect of that variable ignoring the other variables. However, once the interaction is included then what you're seeing in main effects is just one of many possible regression coefficients at one particular level of all of the other variables (typically 0). Therefore, you can't interpret main effects in the usual fashion from a model containing interactions among those main effects. Consider visualization of a two way regression. If you want to assess the interaction you might plot the various slopes of factor A that can occur at various levels of factor B to get some kind of idea of what the interaction looks like. But only one of those slopes is used as the coefficient in the model. Now you might think that if the effect is strong it will be at least in the same direction no matter what. But consider what I said, it's the coefficient holding the other predictors to 0. What if a predictor's range of values is 300-400? For the interaction that's being held to 0 when calculating other predictors. Even a non-significant interaction can change the coefficient substantially because it's different in kind. BTW, are you adding all of the second order interactions in as well? Those are important for the model of the 3-way interaction's meaning.
