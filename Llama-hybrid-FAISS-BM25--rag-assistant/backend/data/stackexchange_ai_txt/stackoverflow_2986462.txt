Once you've loaded in the configuration from another location, you can use a ServiceModelSectionGroup.GetSectionGroup(config) call to retrieve the group. Take a look at the ServiceModelSectionGroup 's member documentation and pay special attention to properties like Client - I think it will get you the information you're looking for. Good luck! Let me know if you need more details; I'll need a bit of sample configuration that you're wanting to use, etc.
