macro-avg is mean average macro-avg is mean average precision/recall/F1 of all classes. in your case macro-avg = (precision of class 0 + precision of class 1)/2. hence your macro-avg is 51. while weighed avg is the total number TP(true positive of all classes)/total number of objects in all classes. example based on your model. assume TP of class 0 = 28400(the model recognise 28400 object out of 28432 given) and TP of class 1 = 1(the model recognise 1 object out 49 given) precision of class 0 = TP of class 0/total number of object = 28400/28432 = 1. precision of class 1 = TP of class 1/total number of object = 1/49 = 0.02 macro average = (precision of class 0 + precision of class 1)/2 = (1 + 0.02)/2 = 0.51 weighted average is precision of all classes merge together. weighted average = (TP of class 0 + TP of class 1)/(total number of class 0 + total number of class 1 = (28400 + 1)/(28432+49) = 1.
