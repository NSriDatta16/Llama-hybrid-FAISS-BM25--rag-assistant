I had the same problem after upgrading phone to iOS 4.2 I had to: upgrade XCode to 3.2.5 reboot phone with XCode not running, as described above. bring up XCode, Window, Organizer, and when in the view for Jim'sPhone, Summary (I think) or Provisioning Profiles or something, Sorry-- I forget which... Given the warning similar to "XCode doesn't have debugging information for this version of iOS" ==> select "Collect" Keep Organizer in view to see progress... it takes a minute or two. After I did that, I was able to build and install/debug.
