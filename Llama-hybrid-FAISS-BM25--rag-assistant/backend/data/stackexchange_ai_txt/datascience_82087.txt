One approach is using Word Moverâ€™s Distance (WMD) . WMD is an algorithm for finding the distance between texts of different lengths, where each word is represented as a word embedding vector. The WMD distance measures the dissimilarity between two text documents as the minimum amount of distance that the embedded words of one document need to "travel" to reach the embedded words of another document. For example: Source: "From Word Embeddings To Document Distances" Paper Each sentence in the text could be compared to the 10 Bible verses. The bible verses could be ranked based on similarity.
