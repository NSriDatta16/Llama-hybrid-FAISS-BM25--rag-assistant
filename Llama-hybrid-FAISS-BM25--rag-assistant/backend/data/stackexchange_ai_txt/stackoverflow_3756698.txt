My hunch is that if you compile the following pared down example, you'll still get a segmentation fault: #include #include #include int main(int argc, char** argv) { glutInit(&argc, argv); glutInitDisplayMode(GLUT_SINGLE | GLUT_RGB); glutInitWindowSize(250,250); glutInitWindowPosition(100,100); glutCreateWindow("test window"); return 0; } Because your segmentation fault is occurring in: fgCreateWindow() at freeglut_structure.c:106 0x7ffff7948f62 glutCreateWindow() In other words, it can't create a window (doesn't matter what's in it). My guess, along the lines of what @Matias replied is that you need to enable 3D acceleration within your VM? But it might be a display driver issue, 32 vs 64 bit, or something slightly more sinister such as a mis-match between freeglut & your version of OpenGl -- hence my previous barrage of questions. Could you re-compile this pared down version and post the results?
