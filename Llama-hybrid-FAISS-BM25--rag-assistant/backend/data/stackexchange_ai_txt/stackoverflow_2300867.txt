How can I avoid "duplicate symbol" errors in xcode with shared static libraries?

I have static libraries A, B and C organized into Xcode projects. A and B depend on C. When I build an iPhone project that depends on A and B, I get a linker error that a duplicate symbol (from C) was detected in A and B. How can I organize these three static libraries so I can include them in other Xcode projects without experiencing this error?
