XML is actually a container where you can put structured text data, and that covers a lot of different possible uses, like text with semantic structure, for example. The structure can also be seen as a tree, so you can hierarchically organize things. It can be validated against formal grammar rules (DTD, XSD...), transformed in another tree structure (XSLT), data can be extracted by different means, like query languages (XQuery), XML can be built from a tree (DOM), and much more. These technical possibilities open to a lot of features in various domains, like data storage, network communication, process organization (here you find your config files) and so on.
