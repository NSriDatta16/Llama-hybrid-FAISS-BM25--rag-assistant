Estimate Shipping and Tax issue in magento

When I add a product to my Shopping Cart, it does not display the standard shipping calculation. But once I proceed to the checkout page, and edit the shopping cart it shows the estimate price calculation. How can I display the shipping when a visitor adds the product to the shopping cart?
