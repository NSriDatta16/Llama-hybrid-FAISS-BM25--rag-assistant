Storing int32 in Core Data model and Cocoa Error 1660

Edit: I was able to fix the presentation thing by changing the NSLog to present the actual int rather than the pointer. NSLog(@"id: %i", [[info valueForKey:@"idQ"] intValue]); Still have the Cocoa error 1660 to solve?? I am doing my first tests with Core Data and is using this (http://www.raywenderlich.com/934/core-data-tutorial-getting-started) tutorial. I have then tried my own tests and is somewhat successful. However, the int32 (only 32 because of the tutorial) is resulting in a strange number. I do suspect it has something to do with NSNumber. The Cocoa error 1660 i believe has something todo with to long number in the output (input = 1 and output = 95518976). I guess this is a question of being a pointer and needs to present correctly, but what about the error. Could someone nice give me a hint how to fix this? - (void)testingDBmodel { NSLog(@">>testingDBmodel } The output: 2010-12-03 01:11:54.097 Test_v2[11177:207] >>testingDBmodel 2010-12-03 01:11:54.104 Test_v2[11177:207] Whoops, couldn't save: The operation couldnâ€™t be completed.
