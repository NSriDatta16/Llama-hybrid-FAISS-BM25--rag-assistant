Stop drag of google map outside visual bounds

When you are pretty far zoomed out on a google map, you can drag it enough so that the map ends and becomes a blank gray color. The map seems to repeat seemlessly on the horizontal axis, but not vertically.I'm wondering if there is a way to prevent the map from being dragged when it reaches that gray area. Any ideas?
