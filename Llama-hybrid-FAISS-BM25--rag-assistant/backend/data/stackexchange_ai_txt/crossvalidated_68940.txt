How is the Weighted Gini Criterion defined?

I am interested in trying out and/or implementing the Weighted Random Forest (WRF) algorithm described in Chen, Liaw, Breiman . How is the Weighted Gini impurity actually defined? What implementations of the algorithm exist? My best guess would be that the weighted Gini impurity is defined by $$\sum_i w_i * f_i * (1-f_i)$$ where $i$ is the class index, $w_i$ is the class weight, and $f_i$ is the fraction of elements in the group of class $i$. And that splits at each node are chosen by minimizing the weighted average sum of these impurities.
