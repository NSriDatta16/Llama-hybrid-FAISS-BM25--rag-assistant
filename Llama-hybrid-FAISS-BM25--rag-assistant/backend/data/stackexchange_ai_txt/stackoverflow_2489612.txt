I don't think you can make this happen, at least on a Windows box. Jpcap is just a wrapper for Winpcap, and this underlying mechanism can not drop observed packets: http://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/ftp.wiretapped.net/pub/security/packet-capture/winpcap/misc/faq.htm#Q-17 So, I don't see how you can build a reverse proxy "on the wire." Wouldn't you have to do the following: Observe an incoming HTTP request by piecing together packets in real-time AND dropping them from being received by the intended host. Make the alternate HTTP request based on whatever proxy rules you are implementing. Grab the response from your request and push out packets on the wire which fake a response from the original host? Since you can't drop the inbound packets, won't the intended host attempt to handle the request and throw packets of its own onto the wire in response? There's probably even more that I don't know about as I'm no networking expert. This question just made me curious about what would be possible using such a "shim".
