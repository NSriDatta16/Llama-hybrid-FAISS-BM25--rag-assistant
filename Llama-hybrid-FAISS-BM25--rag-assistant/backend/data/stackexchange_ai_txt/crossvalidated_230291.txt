When calculating the AUC, you need to provide a range of values (as @General Abrial mentioned), not the class labels (0/1).. so you need to find how to get the non thresholded output from your SVM. For instance in scikit learn you would use decision_function , rather than the predict function http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.SVC.html
