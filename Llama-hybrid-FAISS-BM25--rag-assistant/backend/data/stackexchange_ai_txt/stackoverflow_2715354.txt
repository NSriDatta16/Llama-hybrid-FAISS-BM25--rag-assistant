Is version control worth the effort? a big YES. What are the main pros and cons of adopting version control? pros: you can track what you have done before. Especially useful for latex, as you may need an old paragraph that was deleted by you! When you computer crashes or you work on a new one, you have your data back on the fly. cons: you need to do some settings. What is a good strategy for getting started with version control for data analysis with R (e.g., examples, workflow ideas, software, links to guides)? Just start to use it. I use tortoise SVN on windows as a client tool and my department has an svn server, I put all my code and data (yes, you also put your data there!) there.
