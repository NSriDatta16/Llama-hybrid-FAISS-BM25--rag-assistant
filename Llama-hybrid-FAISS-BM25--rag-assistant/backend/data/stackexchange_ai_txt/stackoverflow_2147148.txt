twisted http client

I am after an example describing the usage of Twisted's HTTP Client. After reading the excellent blog post on the internals of Twisted , I understand how the "Factory" and "Protocol" components play their role but I am unclear on how to introduce "Request" in the overall Client flow. More specifically, I need to be able to perform HTTP GET and POST requests to a remote server using Twisted. Updated : after a discussion on irc #twisted / #python, it seems that twisted.web2 is fading away in favor of beefing up functionality on twisted.web e.g. Agent.
