UpdatePanelAnimationExtender - Resize not working

This is the page that I'm having. But the resize part in the section does not seem to be working. I copied most of the code from the Ajax site . I placed a alert() in the tag (line 108) to find the value of 'b._originalHeight' and it shows up as '44'. I have also tried the code in the above-said tutorial (line 132) and that did not work either. (I'm not sure where it is getting this value from. But I need it to show all the controls on the form. Add/Edit Contest >" PagerStyle-PrevPageText=" Title * Contest Description Use HTML tags to format this area. Start paragraphs with &lt;p /&gt; tag, bold items with &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; tags. Create a line-break between lines with one &lt;br /&gt; tag. * Contest Start Date &nbsp; Contest End Date &nbsp; --%>
