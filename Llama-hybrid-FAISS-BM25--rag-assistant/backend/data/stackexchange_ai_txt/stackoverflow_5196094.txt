Routing error on Rails 3

I'm working on a profile page, so the config is like this: routes.rb => match "user/:login(*path)" => 'users#profile', :as => :profile rake routes => profile /user/:login(*path)(.:format) {:action=>"profile", :controller=>"users"} on console > Rails.application.routes.recognize_path("/user/example/whatever") => {:action=>"profile", :login=>"example", :controller=>"users", :path=>"/whatever"} And I have a profile action in UsersControllers. But when I use in a view I get the error No route matches {:login=>"example", :controller=>"users", :action=>"profile"} What am I missing? Thanks Update: Thanks for the answer and attention, Steve! After a lot of time trying, a coworker find what I was missing: the problem was only with some logins that are emails too, with "@", ".", etc. The solution was adding to_url at params[:login] in link_to: .to_url ) %> Again, thanks for the attention!
