Interesting problem. This is just for information should anyone else be looking at this. On iPad OS 3.2 I have found some problems retrieving video, although the picker works and I can select video from albums and not just from the camera roll. Here's my working code frag The call NSArray *mediaTypesAllowed = [UIImagePickerController availableMediaTypesForSourceType:UIImagePickerControllerSourceTypePhotoLibrary]; [picker setMediaTypes:mediaTypesAllowed]; picker.delegate = self; picker.allowsEditing = NO; picker.wantsFullScreenLayout = YES; if(!IsEmpty(self.editBackgroundPopover)){ [self.editBackgroundPopover setContentViewController:picker animated:YES]; } And here is the delegate method imagePickerController:(UIImagePickerController *)picker didFinishPickingMediaWithInfo:(NSDictionary *)info { [self.editBackgroundPopover dismissPopoverAnimated:true]; NSString* mediaType = [info objectForKey:UIImagePickerControllerMediaType]; //not production code, do not use hard coded string in real app if ( [ mediaType isEqualToString:@"public.image" ]) { NSLog(@"Picked a photo"); } //not production code, do not use hard coded string in real app else if ( [ mediaType isEqualToString:@"public.movie" ]){ NSLog(@"Picked a movie at URL %@", [info objectForKey:UIImagePickerControllerMediaURL]); NSURL *url = [info objectForKey:UIImagePickerControllerMediaURL]; NSLog(@"> %@", [url absoluteString]); } [[picker self] dismissModalViewControllerAnimated:YES]; } However the video URL which I retrieve from the picker has the form file:/localhost/private/var/mobile/Applications/C6FAC491-D27D-45A6-B805-951727ED2CEC/tmp/-Tmp-/trim.KOzqps.MOV So it looks to me that the Video might be being processed through the trimming code even if I'm selecting the video as a whole. Note also that the movie, originally of type m4v when I loaded it through iTunes is of type MOV, which is of course unplayable on the device! I did try playing the URL but I received an alert saying "This kind of movie can't be played" I don't quite understand what Apple is playing at here, the API appears not to really be usable as a way of loading and playing video from the photo library. Hopefully IOS 4 will be more forthcoming, but for my iPad app, that's still months away.
