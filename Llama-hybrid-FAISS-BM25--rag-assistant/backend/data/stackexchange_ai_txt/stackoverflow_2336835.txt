Is there a way to determine code coverage without running the code?

I am not asking the static code analysis which is provided by StyleCop or Fxcop. Both are having different purpose and it serves well. I am asking whether is there a way to find the code coverage of your user control or sub module? For ex, you have an application which uses the helper classes in a separate assembly. Inorder to ensure the unit testing code coverage, we need to run the application and ensure using NCover or similar tool. My requirement is, without running it, is there any possible to find code coverage of the helper classes or similar kind of assemblies?
