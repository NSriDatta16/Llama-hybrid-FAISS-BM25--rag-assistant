From a programmers perspective: HTML had weaker (little or no) structural constraints by design, or at least web-browsers did not require these to produce some form of output. Each browser had its own logic for trying to piece together the missing structure. XHTML enforced stricter structural constraints ... and is a subset of XML -- it is just stricter than HTML. The stricter semantics allows: More consistent algorithms across browsers -- which means more consistency across browser implementations. Fewer clock-cycles per rendering -- which meant lower power devices could better handle rendering web-pages Stricter structural semantics are a requirement for the "semantic web" which means the structure can be leveraged to enable consistant extraction of usefull information from web-pages. XHTML5 extends HTML to enable the web more interactive as far as I understand, and it is perhaps more significant than HTML to XHTML, as the stricter semantics should have been enforced from the get go. XHTML5 adds a lot of noticeable changes to the protocol. As far as XML vs HTML for the web -- well a browser needs some rudimentary fixed document structure to make some sense of the document, perhaps this isn't as significant as it used to be: by this I mean that XSLT and CSS can skin a document into presentable output for a web-browser. However a document should have some inherent document-esque fixed structuring that is meaningful for a browser without modern web techniques. HTML4 allows for a document to be structured so rudimentary browsers like lynx can display the document -- after all lynx does not stand a chance to render CSS and style elements like images. XHTML5 is in another league all together and probably excludes rudimentary browsers outright -- but its fixed tag vocabulary provide meaning for web-browsers, web-developers, and designers. web-browsers probably need certain tags to enable the new funky features -- but the vocabulary in itself is more elegant than just having to think of a web-page as a ad hoc XML document.
