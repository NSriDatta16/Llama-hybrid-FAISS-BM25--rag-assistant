You should always (well unless you're very tight on memory) go for readability and maintainability when writing code for the very reason you mentioned in your question. 25 characters (unless this is just an example) isn't going to "break the bank", but if memory is at a premium you could dynamically allocate the storage for journal_name and then free it when you've finished with it before dynamically allocating the storage for person_name . Though there is the "overhead" of the pointer to the array. Another way would be to use local scoping on the arrays: void myMethod() { ... some code { char journal_name[25]; ... some more code } ... even more code { char person_name[25]; ... yet more code } } Though even with this pseudo code the method is getting quite long and would benefit from refactoring into subroutines which wouldn't have this problem.
