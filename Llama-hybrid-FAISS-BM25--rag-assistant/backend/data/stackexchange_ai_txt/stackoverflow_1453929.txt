I would create 3 tables here One for orders One table orderItems that is 1-n linked to te orders table by storing the orderID and n-1 to Pizzas by Storing the PizzaID. You should also store the price information in this table, since the price of a pizza might change over time, and that could affect your old orders and another table Pizzas that will contain all available Pizza Items (Call it MenueItems if you plan to expand to pasta and beverages later on ;) )
