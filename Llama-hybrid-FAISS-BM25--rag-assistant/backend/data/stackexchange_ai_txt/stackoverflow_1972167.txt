[PHP]: Logic with date differences

I'm seeking an elegant solution to change the format of time based on the length of time between now, and a ISO formated date in a DB. I'd like the output to look something like this //less than an hour 'X minutes have gone by' //less than 24 hours 'X hours have gone by' //greater than 24 hours ISO date Here is what I have so far... $now = date("o-m-d H:i:s") //now = something like '2009-12-28 16:39:00' $dateExample = '2009-12 16:37:00' $timeSpan = round(strtotime($now) - strtotime($dateExample)); if(($timeSpan/60) The sloppy if statements are really bothering me and I can't seem to figure out a better way to do it....
