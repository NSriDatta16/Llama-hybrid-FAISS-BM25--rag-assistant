From what I know, you can't map that using nhibernate. An entity represents a table(most of the times) , what you have there is more along the lines of a report. To have access to that class I would create a view in the database and then create a separate entity. In your normal use of Buyer you probably don't always need AverageOrderAmount and LastOrderDate - I think that you're using that to display this information on the interface , in which case you should create and map a DB view.
