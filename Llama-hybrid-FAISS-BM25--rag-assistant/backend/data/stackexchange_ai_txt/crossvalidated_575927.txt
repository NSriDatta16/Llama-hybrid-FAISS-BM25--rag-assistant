To put this in the context of Hurlbert's classic paper on " Pseudoreplication and the Design of Ecological Field Experiments ," Ecological Monographs 54: 186-211 (1984), you have what he called a "mensurative experiment": Mensurative experiments involve only the making of measurements at one or more points in space or time; space or time is the only "experimental" variable or "treatment." In mensurative experiments generally, pseudoreplication is often a consequence of the actual physical space over which samples are taken or measurements made being smaller or more restricted than the inference space implicit in the hypothesis being tested. That might be what led you to worry about pseudoreplication, as the repeated measurements within a single grid cell are much more restricted in area than the overall grid. Provided that you are handling spatial autocorrelation in your grid correctly, however, then you shouldn't have to worry about the overlap in observation areas. Zuckerberg et al., in " A Review of Overlapping Landscapes: Pseudoreplication or a Red Herring in Landscape Ecology? " Curr Landscape Ecol Rep 5, 140â€“148 (2020), put it pretty clearly: We suggest that the perceived problem of overlapping landscapes is distinct from more important issues in landscape ecology, such as a robust sampling design complete with a discrete assessment of spatial autocorrelation. Through simulation, we demonstrate that changing the amount of landscape overlap does not alter the degree of spatial autocorrelation. If you include Vessel as a predictor then this is even less of a problem, as you will be modeling differences between independent Boat and Plane observations explicitly--for which such overlap areas might be particularly informative. I do worry about completely ignoring time in your model. It seems that at least some seasonal analysis might be called for. If your understanding of the subject matter indicates that seasonal differences in bird counts aren't important in this region of ocean, OK, but be prepared to defend that position strongly.
