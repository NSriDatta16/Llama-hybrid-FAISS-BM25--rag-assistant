I wrote a JS script called " redirection_mobile.js " to solve this issue. It detects the User Agent and redirects to a mobile version if you're accessing a site from a mobile device. In some case you want to redirect from a mobile device to a desktop version (like with a link "Go to the main site"), the script will handle that and once you finish your session, you'll access to the mobile version again. You can find the source code on github here https://github.com/sebarmeli/JS-Redirection-Mobile-Site and you can read more details in one of my articles here: http://blog.sebarmeli.com/2010/11/02/how-to-redirect-your-site-to-a-mobile-version-through-javascript/
