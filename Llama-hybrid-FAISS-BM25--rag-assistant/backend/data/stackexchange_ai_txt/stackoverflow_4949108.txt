Looks like it's because you're doing it on an , which jqueryui wraps in a , and then the draggable component of the image happens within the wrapping . Try wrapping the in a (which if styled display:inline-block , will "hug" the size of the image in both x and y axes), make the draggable (and therefore the enclosed will be as well), and make the resizable (and since the div hugs the image, it all sits nicely).
