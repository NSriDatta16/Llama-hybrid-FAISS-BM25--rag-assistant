Logistic regression with multiple expit/logistic/intercept terms?

I recently discovered that logistic regression does not work how I thought it did. We all know (except me), that logistic regression looks like this: $$ Y = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(ax + by + cz + d)}} $$ However, this is just linear regression in disguise! Is there a type of regression that takes on this form? $$ Y = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(ax + b)}} \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(cy + d)}} \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(fz + g)}} $$ The latter is far more useful to me. I know I can implement a solver for it, however, if this is a common regression, I'd prefer to use ready-made ones.
