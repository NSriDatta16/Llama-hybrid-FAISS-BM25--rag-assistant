Will jqueryUI Drag & Drop work with a tablet?

If I use the jQueryUI Drag & Drop plugin will it work as expected on a tablet? I'm worried if a tablet would think the user was trying to scroll the page instead of dragging an item. I don't have a tablet to test with so I was wondering if anyone knows if this an issue or not and if so is there any work around?
