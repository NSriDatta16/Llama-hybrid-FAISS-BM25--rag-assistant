The only answer that comes to mind is to work out the contentOffset yourself. Use NSString -sizeWithFont:forWidth:lineBreakMode: sizeWithFont:constrainedToSize:lineBreakMode: to work out the size of the box immediately above the text you want (this may be tricky if the text doesn't have to start the line; you may have to try several ranges to find the one that causes the height to jump). That should give you the contentOffset you need for UIScrollView -setContentOffset:animated: . I'm a little worried about the performance, and it may turn out necessary to create your own implementation of UITextView to be efficient (which shouldn't be that difficult if it's static content). It's not as elegant a solution as I'd like, but UITextView doesn't give you a lot of access to the layout engine.
