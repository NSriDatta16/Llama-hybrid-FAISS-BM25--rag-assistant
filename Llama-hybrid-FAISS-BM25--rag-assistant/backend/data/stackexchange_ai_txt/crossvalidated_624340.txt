Box's M test is to check if the groups' covariances matrices are the same in the population; this homogeneity of covariances is as assumption of linear discriminant analysis (LDA). The test is quite sensitive to the violation of multivariate normality. On the other hand, LDA itself is relatively robust to both violations - of the homogeneity and of normality. Unless Box's p-value is extremely low, one may be justified in practice not to pay much attention to the test. Explore the "Log Determinants" table associated with the test, it helps to identify which groups are more similar and which are apart, w.r.t. the homogeneity. Maybe you decide to exclude a group. Don't forget about the option in SPSS's LDA "Classify - Use covariance matrix - Separate groups". As I've mentioned here QDA (quadratic discriminant analysis) would be then [i.e. gross nonhomogeneity of covariance matrices] a step better approximation than LDA. A practical approach half-way between LDA and QDA is to use LDA-discriminants but use their observed separate-class covariance matrices at classification instead of their pooled matrix.
