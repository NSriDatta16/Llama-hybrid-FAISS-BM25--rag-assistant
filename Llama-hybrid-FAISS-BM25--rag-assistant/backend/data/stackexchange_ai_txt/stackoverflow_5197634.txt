The BLAS and LAPACK libraries are designed for use with what I would consider "medium to large matrices" (from tens to tens of thousands on a side). They will deliver correct results for smaller matrices, but the performance will not be as good as it could be. There are several reasons for this: In order to deliver top performance, 3x3 and 4x4 matrix operations must be inlined, not in a library; the overhead of making a function call is simply too large to overcome when there is so little work to be done. An entirely different set of interfaces is necessary to deliver top performance. The BLAS interface for matrix multiply takes variables to specify the sizes and leading dimensions of the matrices involved in the computation, not to mention whether or not to transpose the matrices and the storage layout. All those parameters make the library powerful, and don't hurt performance for large matrices. However, by the time it has finished determining that you are doing a 4x4 computation, a function dedicated to doing 4x4 matrix operations and nothing else is already finished. What this means for you: if you would like to have dedicated small matrix operations provided, please go to bugreport.apple.com and file a bug requesting this feature.
