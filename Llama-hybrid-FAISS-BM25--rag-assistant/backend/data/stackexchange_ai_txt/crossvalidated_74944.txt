There is a published a documentary about Srinivasa Ramanujan whose life, as we know, is tremendously interesting. However, the film is Indian and I haven't actually seen it. I recall an Indian math historian speaking about this film at our university colloquium several years ago. He boasted, "Ben Kingsley was interested in depicting Ramanujan but was turned down for the role because he was only half Indian". As a mixed race individual, I felt a mixture of anger and pity. The latter because they basically turned down the opportunity to make a movie that would attract anyone's attention.
