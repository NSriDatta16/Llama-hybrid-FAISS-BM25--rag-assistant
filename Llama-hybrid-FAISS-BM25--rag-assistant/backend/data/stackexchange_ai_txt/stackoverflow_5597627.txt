Yes, Inchoo's way is the best method for sending mails through Magento's stack, you can try and just use a simple Zend_Mail object to be sure it's not a misconfiguration within Magento itself. http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.mail.html If a basic Zend_Mail send() doesn't do the trick, then I would suggest checking your servers internal mail server settings for testing there to ensure its functioning properly. On a side note, be sure and check spam folders, I know its obvious but can be over looked sometimes.
