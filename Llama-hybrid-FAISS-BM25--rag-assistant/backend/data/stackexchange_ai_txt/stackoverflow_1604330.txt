applying xml to xslt help

I have an XML file that is very long, but here is a shot excerpt. 190 00\01 1.2.840.10008.5.1.4.1.1.88.11 Roberts^^^Dr.^ I also have an xslt file that is also very long, but here is an excerpt. TEST I have two questions. 1. When I apply the xml to the xslt, I don't get any output. After testing it appears that the dicom template is never even getting called. Why is this? 2. If I change the matching criteria for the dicom template from "dicom" to "/", then it does get called, but the variable is not being set correctly. I know it won't produce valid XML, I'm just trying to figure out what's going on, and what's wrong with my understanding of xslt. Thanks!!!
