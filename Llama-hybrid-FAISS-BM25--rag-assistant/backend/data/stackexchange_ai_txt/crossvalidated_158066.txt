Time series and random variable

I would like to know if the $n$ realizations of a variable, say $Y$ expressed in the form of a time series constitutes $n$ random variables or just a single random variable $Y$? For example, the output of a linear regression model indexed by time, $n$ :$y(n) = ay(n-1) + by(n-2) + w(n)$ Here, $y$ is a random variable containing $n$ data points. The time ordered sequence of observations of $y$ form a time series $\{y_n\}_{n=1}^{1000}$. Then, what is a multivariate case $Y_1,Y_2,\ldots,Y_n$? I am not clear about these concepts and shall appreciate help. Thank you.
