SVM reports different AUC if binary labels 0 and 1) are swapped

I am using a SVM classifier on an highly imbalanced binary data-set (about 10:1 ratio of the majority class to the minority class). I assign the majority class a label of 1 and the minority class to 0. This gives me the first figure (left) - the classifier reports an AUC of 0.82. If I switch the class labels to be 0 for the majority class and 1 for the minority class, I get a substantially different result (figure right, AUC 0.77). What is causing this discrepancy? (The results hold if the labels are 1 and -1 as well)
