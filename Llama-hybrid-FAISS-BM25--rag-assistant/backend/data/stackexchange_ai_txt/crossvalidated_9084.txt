Basically anything what is not separable with a line (ok, hyperplane), for instance 2D data like this: kernel trick will effectively project this situation into a (higher-dim) space in which linear separation is possible; see this movie for an effect of a gaussian kernel on similar data . Look for a kernel argument in your svm function ;-) Note that using a kernel usually introduces new parameters to the outer optimization.
