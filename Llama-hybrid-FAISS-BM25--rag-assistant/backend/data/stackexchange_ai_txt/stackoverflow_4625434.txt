Creating Element from JQuery Drag and Drop

Hi I want to be able to create html elements based on drag and drop functionality. I want to use the Jquery UI Library to do this. The HTML Code is here http://pastebin.com/0cn5FDWr What I want to do is on the when an item is dropped I want to check which item is being dropped and then append some html elements after the drop div (i.e create an input tag, image etc...). Not sure how I would do this, if this can be done by calling custom function containing the code then it would be good. Thanks
