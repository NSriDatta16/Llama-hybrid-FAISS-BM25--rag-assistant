Bitrate Calculation

(Excuse for My english it's freak iÂ´m from LA) I'm trying to finish a trascoding process in VB6.0 , i'm working with ffmpeg , its a very good transcoder , to finish the project i want a progress bar for the trascoding process but it's so very hard , first i need to understand , how a program can calculate the time remaining to the process if i have the inputs Average Bitrate Frame rate Start file Size. I'm trying with : File size (KB) / Average Bitrate Kb/s. In theory this must to work , but the calculated time it`s very small than the real time processed. Somebody have any idea about this , what is the formula (snipped) to calculate the time remaining in a trascoding process. in this wonderfull web i find many answer to mys projects..
