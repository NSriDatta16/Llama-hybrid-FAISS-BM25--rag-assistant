Could you use a table for config storage and lock down access to it? Throw that database/log/backup in an EFS protected folder and the only people that could access would be SQL sysadmins/or authorized accts and whoever has access to decrypt efs with a recovery account and restore the database (domain admins?). You could also use SQL 2005's native encryption and write your own procedure to access the data and then set the connection properties in a script task. I haven't done this, but theoretically it might work.
