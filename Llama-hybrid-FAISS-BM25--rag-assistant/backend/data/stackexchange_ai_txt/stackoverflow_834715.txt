using CrystalDecisions.CrystalReports.Engine; //snip //Where report is the parent rpt of type ReportDocument (or a subclass of ReportDocument) foreach(ReportDocument subreport in rpt.Subreports) { if(subreport.Name = "Multiple") { //Not the most elegant solution, but should work SubreportObject subrpt = (SubreportObject)subreport; subrpt.Height = 0; } } Per your request I have added the hiding functionality, I haven't tested this out and haven't done any hiding of subreports personally. I think that this should work. I couldn't find any "Visible" property or anything like that.
