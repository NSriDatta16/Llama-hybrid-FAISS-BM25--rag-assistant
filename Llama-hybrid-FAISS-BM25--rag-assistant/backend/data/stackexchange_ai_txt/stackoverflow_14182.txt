IMHO: The value of HttpContext.Current.Request.Headers("User-Agent") is a much safer bet as it actually indicates the browser that is making the request, and not the type of device per-se . I've learnt from experience that if a smart phone makes a request through a third-party browser to your service, more-often-than-not any sort of "what type of device are you" test ( HttpCapabilitiesBase.IsMobileDevice and/or HttpContext.Current.Request.Browser.IsMobileDevice ) will fail. Unfortunately though, short of a big list of allowed user-agents (or disallowed user-agents for that matter), you'll just have to make sure it doesn't start with Mozilla, iPhone or Opera before you render the page... It's a hard arena to play in. Good luck.
