Are you sure this is for Python beginners? To me, the cleanest way to do this is with reduce() and lambda, both of which are not typical beginner tools, and sometimes discouraged even for experienced Python programmers: def multiplyItemsByFour(argsList): if not argsList: return None newItems = [item * 4 for item in argsList] return reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, newItems) Like Alex Martelli, I've thrown in a quick test for an empty list at the beginning which returns None. Note that if you are using Python 3, you must import functools to use reduce(). Essentially, the reduce(lambda...) solution is very similar to the other suggestions to set up an accumulator using the first input item, and then processing the rest of the input items; but is simply more concise.
