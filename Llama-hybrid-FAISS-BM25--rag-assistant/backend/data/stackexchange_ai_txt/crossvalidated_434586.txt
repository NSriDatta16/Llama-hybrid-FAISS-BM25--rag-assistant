Solving Variance of Time Series AR process

I am trying to solve for the variance of $x[n]$ , a time series process. $$x[n] +a_1x[n-1]=w[n]$$ where $w[n]$ is white noise with zero mean and variance $\sigma^2_v$ . Also $|a_1| . I am aware that the equation can be solved using the Yule Walker Equations, but I was trying to solve it brute force using expectation. Here is what I did: Take the z-transform of the process, $$X(z) + a_1X(z)z^{-1} = W(z)$$ Solving for the system function, $$ H(z) = \frac{X(z)}{W(z)} = \frac{1}{1+a_1z^{-1}}$$ Inverse z-transform, $$h[n] = (-a_1)^nu[n]$$ Using convolution, $$x[n] = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1}(-a_1)^kw[n-k]$$ Solving for the variance, $$E[x[n]x^*[n]]=E[\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}(-a_1)^kw[n-k]\sum_{l=0}^{n-1}(-a_1)^lw[n-l]]$$ $$E[x[n]x^*[n]] = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1}(-a_1)^k\sum_{l=0}^{n-1}(-a_1)^lE[w[n-k]w[n-l]]$$ Since w[n] is a white noise process, $$E[w[n-k]w[n-l]] = 0, k\neq l $$ $$E[w[n-k][w[n-l]] = \sigma^2_v, k=l$$ So the expectation becomes, $$E[x[n]x^*[n]] = \sum_{m=0}^{n-1}(a_1^2)^m \sigma^2_v$$ Therefore, $$Var[x[n]]= \sigma^2_v \frac{1-(a_1^2)^n}{1-a_1^2} $$ But this is not correct, this answer is nonstationary, and we should expect a stationary solution for the zero mean white noise. The correct answer is $\frac{\sigma^2_v}{1-a^2_1}$ It would be very helpful if someone could point out what I did wrong. I would like to solve this problem using this method. That way I can more appreciate using Yule-Walker equations. Thank you!
