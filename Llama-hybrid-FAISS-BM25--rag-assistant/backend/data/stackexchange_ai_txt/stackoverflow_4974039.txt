Rails project organization with many models

I'm working on a rails app that is starting to have what seems (to me) to be a lot of models. There are 15 right now, but I'm thinking about adding 3-4 more to serve as "tag" like models (I need more functionality than Acts As Taggable offers). So, the reason this bugs me a bit, is that 7 of the 15 models belong to a common parent. Several are belong_to, and a few are has_and_belongs_to_many. All the new models I'm contemplating would belong_to the same parent as well. So, what I'm wondering is, what is the best "Railsy" way of organizing this kind of situation? Instead of app/models being super crowded with 6 "first-class" models and 10+ children of one of these, should/can I start using sub folders in my app folder? ie: app/models/parent/child.rb ? I know this is kind of an open-ended question, but I would really appreciate advice as to the best way to handle a rails project with a proliferation of models. Thanks!
