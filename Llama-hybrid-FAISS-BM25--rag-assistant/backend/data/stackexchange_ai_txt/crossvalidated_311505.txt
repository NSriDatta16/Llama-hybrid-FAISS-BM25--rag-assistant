Can "date" variable be used in PCA?

I'm doing the research on data from the waterworks and having a huge datasets with different measurements. They are all were conducted on certain days through many years. When I'm driving the PCA only on measurements its looking good, but I also wanna know if these measurements are having time trend connections as its the mainly reason why im doing PCA.
