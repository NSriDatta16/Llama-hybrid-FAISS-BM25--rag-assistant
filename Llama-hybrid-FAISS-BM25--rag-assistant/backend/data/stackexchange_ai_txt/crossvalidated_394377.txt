A human child at age 2 needs around 5 instances of a car to be able to identify it with reasonable accuracy regardless of color, make, etc. The concept of "instances" gets easily muddied. While a child may have seen 5 unique instances of a car, they have actually seen thousands of thousands of frames, in many differing environments. They have likely seen cars in other contexts. They also have an intuition for the physical world developed over their lifetime - some transfer learning probably happens here. Yet we wrap all of that up into "5 instances." Meanwhile, every single frame/image you pass to a CNN is considered an "example." If you apply a consistent definition, both systems are really utilizing a much more similar amount of training data. Also, I would like to note that convolutional neural networks - CNNs - are more useful in computer vision than ANNs, and in fact approach human performance in tasks like image classification. Deep learning is (probably) not a panacea, but it does perform admirably in this domain.
