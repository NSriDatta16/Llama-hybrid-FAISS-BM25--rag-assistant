This probably isn't an Attachment-Fu issue, but rather how Ruby handles File I/O as well as how files are stored in Unix. So for instance if your app lives in, say, ~/Users/ron/APP_NAME If you change the above code: :path_prefix => "~/APP_NAME/uploads/" To: :path_prefix => "../#{RAILS_ROOT}/uploads" The files would be stored in a folder called "uploads" in ~/Users/ron/uploads. The "../" means one directory above the current Rails root. If you want to go up two directories, it would be "../../" and so on. But that only addresses hierarchical navigation. If you wanted to tell Attachment-Fu to store files in a hardcoded directory in your filesystem, you could give it a file path such as "~/Users/ron/APP_NAME/uploads", but keep in mind hardcoding in a file path this way is brittle and could be a pain point in the future should your file storage requirements change. Hope that helps.
