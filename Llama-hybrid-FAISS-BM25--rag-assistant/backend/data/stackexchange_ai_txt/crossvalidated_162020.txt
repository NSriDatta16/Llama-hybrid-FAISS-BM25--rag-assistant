Is there a relationship between these two standard deviations

I just started thinking when you have time series data and was curious about the following question. Suppose you have the standard deviation of one observed result. Would the standard deviation of the difference of that result from day to day be related? I just generated some random data and ran the following code library(ggplot2) #a function that creates a uniformly sampled column and a second column #that is the diffs from one to another and then returns the standard #deviations of the two columns test_sd I've attached an exploratory plot which kind of shows that there is a positive relationship. Is there a more mathematically 'tighter' relationship between these two standard deviations?
