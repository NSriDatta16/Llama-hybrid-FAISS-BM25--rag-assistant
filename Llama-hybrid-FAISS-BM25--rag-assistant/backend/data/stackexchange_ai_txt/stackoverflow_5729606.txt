XCode not finding crash logs

I have a problem with XCode organiser , which is not showing any new iPhone app crash log anymore. I checked in ~/Library/Logs/CrashReporter/MobileDevice , the files have not been copied there either. Nor are they even if i synchronize the mobile with iTunes. I reproduce the problem with 2 devices (iphone and ipod), however if I connect them on other computers, the logs are visible. So it seems the problem is with this XCode/Mac OS . Any ideas ? Has anyone come across the same problem ? Thanks,
