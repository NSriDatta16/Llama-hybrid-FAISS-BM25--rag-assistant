If you are nesting 6 levels, you're probably artificially mixing multiple concerns. See below for the 5D model. It looks like you should be using namespace-class-method as the basic navigation model. You are at least mixing code structure with its organisation on disk (files and folders) and the mapping to variants. Smalltalk IDEs like Pharo provide a set of code browsers making navigation easy along a few dimensions, and provide a browser construction kit Glamour to make your own for other navigation dimensions. You'll want to take a look at the work done by Richard Wettel. Something similar to Codecity . Using OpenGL to create a 3- and 4D (time) display of the development history of a project. It is part of the research in software reengineering MOOSE . For your research you might want to use the 5 dimensional model for this: version (wanting to change) status (life cycle: creating, testing, deploying, retiring) view (requirement, code, test, documentation) hierarchy (module, class, method) variant (largely similar, describing the differences, product families) Most systems only handle a few of these dimensions. To handle all five, you have to describe (fix) your development process. If you do, you can describe the use cases you want to support in your UI. If not, you need a 5-dimensional flexible display engine. That will not be as easy to use.
