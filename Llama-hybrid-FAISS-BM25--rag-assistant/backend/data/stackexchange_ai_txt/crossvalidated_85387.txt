Intuition behind standard deviation

I'm trying to gain a better intuitive understanding of standard deviation. From what I understand it is representative of the average of the differences of a set of observations in a data set from the mean of that data set. However it is NOT actually equal to the averages of the differences as it gives more weight to observations further from the mean. Say I have the following population of values - $\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\}$ The mean is $5$. If I take a measure of spread based on absolute value I get $$\frac{\sum_{i = 1}^5|x_i - \mu|}{5} = 2.4$$ If I take a measure of spread based using standard deviation I get $$\sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i = 1}^5(x_i - \mu)^2}{5}} = 2.83$$ The result using standard deviation is larger, as expected, because of the extra weight it gives to values further from the mean. But if I was just told that I was dealing with a population with a mean of $5$ and a standard deviation of $2.83$ how would I infer that the population was comprised of values something like the $\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\}$? It just seems that the figure of $2.83$ is very arbitrary...I don't see how you are supposed to interpret it. Does $2.83$ mean the values are spread very wide or are they all tightly clustered around the mean... When you are presented with a statement that you are dealing with a population with a mean of $5$ and a standard deviation of $2.83$ what does that tell you about the population?
