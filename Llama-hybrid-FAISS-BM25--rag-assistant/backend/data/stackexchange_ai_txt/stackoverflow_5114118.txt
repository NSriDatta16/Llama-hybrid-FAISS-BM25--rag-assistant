There is a program called "ssh-agent" that will save an unlocked RSA or DSA key in memory and supply this key to SSH through a UNIX socket. This can be used for "password-less" SSH connections, assuming you generate an RSA or DSA public/private key pair, and add the public key to the "authorized_keys" or "authorized_keys2" file of the remote host. When you first add a key to ssh-agent or turn on ssh-agent, you will need to supply your password, but subsequent uses of SSH can occur without a password. You may find the following articles helpful in terms of setting up SSH agent: Using ssh-agent with ssh Shortest passwordless ssh tutorial, ever How-To: "Password-less" SSH Note that on Mac OS X (as of 10.5 and higher), if you generate the private/public key pair and put the public key in the authorized_keys file of the remote host, when you SSH into that host, Mac OS X will automatically start up its own ssh-agent (no setup required) and offer to remember the password (it will save it in KeyChain). You can read more about that on Mac OS X Leopard -- Built-In SSH Agent .
