Embed a local PDF in HTML page

Situation: Web application running on a remote server is displaying PDFs. PDF document is stored on client's PC (location is known). Is there any way to embed that PDF into HTML page with local path? p.s.: So far i tried "object", "embed" and "iframe" and with no success. I tried with file://, file:///, and without, URL with slashes and backslashes and nothing works. It works if opened directy in browser URL, just not by embedding
