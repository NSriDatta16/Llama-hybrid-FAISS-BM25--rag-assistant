I want to use the fleximage gem and s3 for storage, but don't want dev/qa/test envs to use s3

I have a rails app that I'm going to host on engineyard and want to store image files on s3. But I don't know if I want all developer machines to beusing s3 for storage of all our test and dev images. Maybe it's not an issue -- but it seems like a waste to have everyone storing all our images in s3. I've heard of some ppl who store images on s3 'hacking' dev environments to store images locally on the file system -- and then using s3 in prod only. What are other people doing?
