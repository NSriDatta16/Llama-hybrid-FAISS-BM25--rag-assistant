Q1 By the convention with confint() (the generic in base R), the coverage of the interval is given by argument level , which is typically set to 0.95 such that the interval is a 95% confidence interval. Check out ?confint.gam for more detail. Q2 You have this back to front; you don't get a fitted value for date , you get one for Region that is a function of date and ID . If you want to know what value of Region were estimated for input date values then look at the est column in the outputm with the date column indicating what values of date the estimate and interval are for: library("mgcv") library("gratia") dat which gives #> # A tibble: 200 x 8 #> smooth by_variable x1 est se crit lower upper #> #> 1 s(x1) NA 0.00251 -2.04 0.296 1.96 -2.62 -1.46 #> 2 s(x1) NA 0.00752 -2.04 0.287 1.96 -2.60 -1.47 #> 3 s(x1) NA 0.0125 -2.03 0.279 1.96 -2.58 -1.49 #> 4 s(x1) NA 0.0175 -2.03 0.270 1.96 -2.56 -1.50 #> 5 s(x1) NA 0.0225 -2.02 0.262 1.96 -2.54 -1.51 #> 6 s(x1) NA 0.0276 -2.02 0.254 1.96 -2.52 -1.52 #> 7 s(x1) NA 0.0326 -2.01 0.246 1.96 -2.50 -1.53 #> 8 s(x1) NA 0.0376 -2.01 0.239 1.96 -2.48 -1.54 #> 9 s(x1) NA 0.0426 -2.01 0.232 1.96 -2.46 -1.55 #> 10 s(x1) NA 0.0476 -2.00 0.226 1.96 -2.44 -1.56 #> # ... with 190 more rows If you want to get point estimates and intervals for the observed data, pass the original data to the newdata argument of confint.gam Q3 This is likely due to either your using a non-Gaussian distribution for family, or not appreciating that smooths are (mostly) subject to identifiability constraints (in this case a sum-to-zero constraint) which means the smooths are centred about the model constant term (Intercept) Note that the est in the output is the estimated partial effect on the response of the smooth of date for specified values of date . It isn't an estimated value in the sense that it is scaled as per the original response.
