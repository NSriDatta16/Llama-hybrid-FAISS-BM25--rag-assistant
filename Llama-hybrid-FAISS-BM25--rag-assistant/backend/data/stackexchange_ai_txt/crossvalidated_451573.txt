Do you have a stepwise option on your Logistic Regression? That would be preferred. While all 12 features may yield a significant p-value individually, they may not all be significant when considered in combination with one or more other features. You need to find the best subset. In any case, it is not the p-values you want to be comparing. If you have significant p-values, what you want to compare is the proportion of variance accounted for. Choose the feature accounting for the largest proportion of variance. Once that is found, run 11 2-feature regressions using that first selected feature combined with each of the remaining 11 features in turn. Then pick the feature that accounts for the most additional variance (as long as the additional amount still has a significant p-value). That gives you the 2 best features. Continue with additional ones until you can no longer account for a significant amount of additional variance. Obviously, this is a lot of work! But a step-wise option using all 12 variables will do all of this for you automatically. Sometimes there is also a "best subset" option that will effectively test all possible combinations of features to arrive at the best subset. This may not always give the same result as the stepwise option.
