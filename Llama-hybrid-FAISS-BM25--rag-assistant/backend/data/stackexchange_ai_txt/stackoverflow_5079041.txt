Visual Studio 2008/2010: show method names in Find In Files results

I had a dream I could see constructor/method/property names along with search results (Visual Studio Find In Files feature), if applicable/available. For example, if I searched for _dreamProvider in Sleep.cs , I would get something like that in Find Results window: Sleep.cs(5): protected IDreamProvider _dreamProvider; Sleep.cs(10): Sleep(IDreamProvider) : _dreamProvider = dreamProvider; Sleep.cs(68): BeginColdSweats(int) : var d = _dreamProvider.Create(DreamTypes.Nightmare); Sleep.cs(74): BeginSomniloquy(int, string) : var d = _dreamProvider.Create(DreamTypes.Epic); This could come quite handy if you want to see at a glance in which contexts a code fragment (not only a particular symbol) is used, specifically during analysis of legacy code and/or refactoring. I could not find any VS addin which would bring that code structure awareness in search results. And there is no specific customization registry flag for that. Do you know of any VS addins, or some kind of hacks in order to achieve that or something similar? Thanks
