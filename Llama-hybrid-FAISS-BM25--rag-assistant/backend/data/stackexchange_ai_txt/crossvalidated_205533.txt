Accuracy on the test set do not change. Why?

I train a SVM classifier using 36 features. If I use all the features, the train accuracy is about 0.96, the test accuracy is about 0.77. Then I change the number of features. The train accuracy drops while the test accuracy remains the same. Even if I just use one feature, the test accuracy is still about 0.77. I use cross validation, but the result does not change. I can not figure it out. So how does it come about?
