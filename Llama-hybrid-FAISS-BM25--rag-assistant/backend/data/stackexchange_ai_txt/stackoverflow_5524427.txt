My question is when the GC will call dealloc on the A class, will the bvrariable be properly deallocated? No, 1) GC is not used in iOS memory managent. 2) In dealloc you just set this pointer to nil (quite pointless thing to do in dealloc) - object itself is not released or/and deallocated. My guess is no because since i retained this object, so I must call release twice to release that object. Right. BTW I can't see any sane reason to retain this object after alloc - you have already claimed ownership of it.
