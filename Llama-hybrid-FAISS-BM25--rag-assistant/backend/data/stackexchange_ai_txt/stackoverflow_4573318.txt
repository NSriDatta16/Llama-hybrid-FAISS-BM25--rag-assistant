While it may seem like you are making a monolithic file, the ViewController is really the place for all of this stuff. If you do what you propose (which is entirely possible), you will end up with a bunch of files that do little. One way to keep organized in a large file is to separate groups of methods with pragma marks like so: #pragma mark lifecycle methods -(void)dealloc{} -(id)init{} -(id)initWithCoder: #pragma mark target-action -(id)doSomethingAction:(id)sender{} -(id)doSometingElse:(id)sender{} Xcode will parse the pragma marks and group the methods for you in the pull down item bar for easy access. Notice that the methods in this list are also listed in alphabetical order.
