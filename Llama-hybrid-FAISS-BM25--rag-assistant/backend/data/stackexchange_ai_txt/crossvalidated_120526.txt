How to fit regression to custom model in R

This is for my honors thesis. I have a large data set, of which I'm sharing only what I call the "Low phosphorus" series: > P0 R N P D.weight 1 r1 0 0 63.8 2 r2 0 0 34.2 3 r3 0 0 24.9 4 r4 0 0 30.4 5 r5 0 0 33.3 6 r1 45 0 24.5 7 r2 45 0 20.1 8 r3 45 0 23.7 9 r4 45 0 20.0 10 r5 45 0 66.8 11 r1 90 0 27.8 12 r2 90 0 17.2 13 r3 90 0 36.4 14 r4 90 0 33.5 15 r5 90 0 14.0 16 r1 180 0 20.6 17 r2 180 0 9.7 18 r3 180 0 8.8 19 r4 180 0 14.4 20 r5 180 0 21.6 21 r1 360 0 18.4 22 r2 360 0 8.9 23 r3 360 0 31.4 24 r4 360 0 13.3 25 r5 360 0 21.9 R is rep N is nitrogen applied to the soil P is phosphorus applied to the soil D.weight is average dry weight of plants in grams The way to visualize these data is to put N on the x-axis and dry weight on the y axis: I have to make a nonlinear regression of these data, but I don't want to fit it to a quadratic model; instead, I wanna fit it to the equation below (an alternative to the Mitscherlich equation): $Y = a - b \times\exp(-cx)$ Y is dry weight a is a fitted parameter representing the maximum biomass b is a fitted parameter representing the initial level of the added nutrient in the soil c is a fitted parameter representing the rate of increase in biomass with increasing nutrient amendment x is, in this case, nitrogen level The problem is, I just don't know how to code for this. I have been going crazy trying to find out how to "tell" R that I wanna use that equation for my regression, and not $Y = ax + b$ (like in a linear regression), or $Y = ax^2 + bx + c$ like in a quadratic regression, etc.
