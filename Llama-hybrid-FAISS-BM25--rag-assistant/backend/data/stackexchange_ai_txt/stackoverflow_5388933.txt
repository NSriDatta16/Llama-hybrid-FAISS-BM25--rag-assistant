WPF Mouse.Capture causes window to freeze

I have a WPF chart and I'm creating a drag-to-scroll sliding window on the chart. I'm essentially following a MouseDown-MouseMove-MouseUp sequence to track the sliding window movements. I want to manage cases where a MouseMove/MouseUp after a MouseDown occurs outside the chart area. For this, I'm doing a Mouse.Capture(Chart) on MouseDown and Releasing the capture on MouseUp. But whenever the MouseDown occurs, my window hangs. What am I doing wrong?
