In awakeFromNib you could write something like (untested): NSScrollView *scrollView = [tableView superview]; NSView *container = [scrollView superview]; [[tableView retain] autorelease]; [tableView removeFromSuperview]; [scrollView removeFromSuperview]; [container addSubview:tableView]; [container setFrameSize:[tableView frame].size]; Alternatively, in Interface Builder you can extract a table view from a scroll view by changing to list view mode (Main Menu -> View -> as List). Then expand the view hierarchy until you see the table view. You can drag that out of the scroll view, but not into another view. You can just hook this up to an outlet and add it to a view programmatically. You'll still need to update the height of the container when the number of rows change.
