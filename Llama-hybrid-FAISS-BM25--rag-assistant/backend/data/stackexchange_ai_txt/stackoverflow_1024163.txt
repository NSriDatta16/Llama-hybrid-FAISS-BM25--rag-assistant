Actually, you may have to think "upside-down" with mod_rewrite . The easiest way is that to make your PHP emit the rewritten mysite.com/roberts-clothing-store/store/12/3 links . mod_rewrite will then proxy the request to one PHP page for rewrite.php?path=roberts-clothing-store/store/12/3 that will decode the URL and sets the arguments (here storeid and page ) and dynamically include the correct PHP file , or just emit 301 for renamed pages. A pure solution with mod_rewrite is possible, but this one is much easier to get right, especially when you don't master mod_rewrite . The main prob could be with the overhead that might be significant but is the price of simplicity & flexibility. mod_rewrite is much faster Update: The other posts do answer the question, but they don't solve the typical duplicate-content problem that avoided by having canonical urls (and using 301/404 for all those URLs that seems ok, but aren't).
