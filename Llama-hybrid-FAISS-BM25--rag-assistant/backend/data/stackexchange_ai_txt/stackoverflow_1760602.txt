Use jQuery's .wrap on all children of a given tag

Working jQuery, what I'd like to perform is something similar to the following: $('sometag').children().wrap(' '); With the resulting DOM manipulation wrapping all children in one div, not each child individually. Starting example HTML: Heading Paragraph What this line of code does: Heading Paragraph What I want: Heading Paragraph What is the proper syntax to achieve the end result I'm looking for?
