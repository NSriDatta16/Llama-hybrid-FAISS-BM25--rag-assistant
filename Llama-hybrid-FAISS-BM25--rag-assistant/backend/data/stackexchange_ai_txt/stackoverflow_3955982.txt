VB6: what's wrong with this tsql procedure call?

I have the following procedure call in VB6: dim rs as adodb.command dim cnn as adodb.connection with rs set .activeconnection = cnn .CommandType = adCmdStoredProc .CommandText = "sp_qryUpdate" .CommandTimeout = 0 .Parameters("@uidbatch").value = lngBatchID .Execute , , adExecuteNoRecords end with I receive the error of, Object variable or with block variable not set The error is thrown after the .activeconnection is set Any ideas what this means? The connection string I'm receiving is correct.
