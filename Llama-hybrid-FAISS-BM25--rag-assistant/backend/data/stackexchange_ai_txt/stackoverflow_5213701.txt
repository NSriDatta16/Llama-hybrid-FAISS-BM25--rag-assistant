exporting to excel over https(SSL) using IE is not working in asp.net website

i am trying to export an excel file from an https site, it is working great with firefox and other browsers but in IE its is giving me error that the site is not available or the file is not found. i have research the problem and i have found it is cache related so i have change the headers in this page so it will allow caching but it is still not working. this is a snap of the code Response.Cache.SetAllowResponseInBrowserHistory(true); Response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.Public); Response.Cache.SetMaxAge(new TimeSpan(1, 0, 0)); Response.Cache.SetAllowResponseInBrowserHistory(true); Response.CacheControl = "Public"; any help would be great thank you
