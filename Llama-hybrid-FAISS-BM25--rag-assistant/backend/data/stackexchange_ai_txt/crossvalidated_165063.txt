Do statisticians use the Jeffreys' prior in actual applied work?

When I learned about the Jeffreys' prior in my graduate statistical inference class my professors made it sound sort of like it was interesting mostly for historical reasons rather than because anyone would ever use it. Then when I took Bayesian data analysis, we were never asked to use Jeffreys' priors. Does anyone actually use these in practice. If so (or if not), why or why not? Why do some statisticians not take it seriously?
