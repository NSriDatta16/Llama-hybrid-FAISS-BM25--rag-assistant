@Ethan is correct about the formulation of the lasso penalty, and I think it's particularly important to understand it in that form (for one thing, because that same penalty can work with other models like neural networks, tree models, generalized linear models, ...). But, to your question: If $\lambda=0.5$ then does it mean that those coefficients whose values are less than or equal to 0.5 will become zero? So in other words, whatever be the value of $\lambda$ , the coefficients whose values fall within $\lambda$ will be turned off/become zero? OR is there some other meaning to the value of $\lambda$ ? The answer is mostly yes , under some assumptions. For vanilla LASSO (OLS plus the L1-penalty), if the covariates are orthonormal, then the LASSO coefficients can be written in terms of the OLS coefficients: $$\beta_i^{\text{LASSO}} = \begin{cases} \beta_i^{\text{OLS}} - \lambda & \text{if $\beta_i^{\text{OLS}} \geq \lambda$} \\ \beta_i^{\text{OLS}} + \lambda & \text{if $\beta_i^{\text{OLS}} \leq -\lambda$} \\ 0 & \text{if $|\beta_i^{\text{OLS}}|\leq\lambda$.} \end{cases}$$ (You'll see that written more concisely as $\operatorname{sgn}(\beta_i^{\text{OLS}}) \left(|\beta_i^{\text{OLS}}|-\lambda\right)_+$ .)
