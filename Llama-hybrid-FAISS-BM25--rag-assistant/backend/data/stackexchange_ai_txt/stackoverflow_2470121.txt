Bad auto completion with python on pydev?

I began learning and loving python about a month ago. Dive into python, django and now Tornado is the path i followed during this time. I chose pydev as an IDE since it seems to be the most up to date and i wanted to come back to eclipse since i'm using Netbeans for php and Java. My question is the following: When i write classes in php or java i declare my methods and properties. I instantiate them somewhere else and use them. The autocompletion works great for java and php but with python, it seems to be always suggesting me a bunch of garbage and never the real object's methods from the class i instantiated. Is it the same for you ? Is it a limitation from pydev ? Am i doing something wrong ? Thank you in advance for pointing me in a direction. Matthieu.
