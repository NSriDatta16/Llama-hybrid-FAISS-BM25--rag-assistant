Configure cobertura to ignore certain blocks of code

Is it possible using Cobertura to tell it to ignore certain bits of code that are identified by start and end comments? For example, public class Foo { public void static doSomething() { ... // Cobertura-Ignore-Start ... // Cobertura-Ignore-End } would result in Cobertura not including the code in between the start and end comments when calculating coverage statistics. Edit : I am using the cobertura Ant task.
