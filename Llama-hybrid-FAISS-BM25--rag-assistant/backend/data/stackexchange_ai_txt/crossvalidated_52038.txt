What do you exactly mean by "better data set"? I would understand it as: with which data set can I train a classifier that yields best results?. If so, I would train two classifiers, say SVM, one for each of the data sets. For each one I would choose the parameters as to give best performance for that data set in terms of cross-validation. Then I would see how each classifier performs on the other data set. If one classifier has a better performance on BOTH sets, I would use this result as a criteria to pick up the data set on which that classifier was trained. Notice that the result depends on the particular classifier chosen. You could try this with several different classifiers, like kNN, MLPs, or anything else. Another question would be: which classifier performs (generalize) better across different data sets. For that please refer to the paper: "Statistical Comparison of Classifiers over Multiple Data Sets", Janez Demsar, JMLR
