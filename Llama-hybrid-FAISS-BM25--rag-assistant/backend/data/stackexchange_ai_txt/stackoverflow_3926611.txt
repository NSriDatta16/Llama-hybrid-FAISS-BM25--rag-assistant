WebformsMVP is included in DotNetNuke now, so we have started using it indirectly as part of custom module development within DNN. I don't think we're fully utilizing everything the framework is capable of, but have had no problems to date. The implementation is very clean and simple to implement, and retrofitting existing webforms code is fairly straightforward. For us the learning curve has been minimal. We have run into a number of cases where we aren't certain of the "right" way to do things, and have found pretty limited guidance online. (Try as I might to avoid it, sometimes I just have to poke some stuff into the ViewState.) But, with it being used by the DNN team, we feel pretty confident that it will not fade away soon, and a growing number of examples should appear online. Of course I encourage its use, even if only for the selfish reason of wanting to see the community grow.
