What kind of prediction/ classification is this?

Suppose I have a data frame like the following (and I want to do machine learning): |--------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------| |person(race) | Apple | Orange | Banana | Peach |... |Jack (white) | 10 | 9 | 24 | 65 | |Jenna (white) | 9 | 67 | 94 | 37 | |Emily (asian) | 10 | 0 | 4 | 25 | |Sophia (asian)| 23 | 65 | 74 | 65 | |John (black) | 0 | 34 | 0 | 65 | |Chen (asian) | 86 | 77 | 90 | 0 | ... |--------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------| if my question is: Does Emily like orange? if yes, how much? What kind of prediction would this be? Is it some type of classification where Emily is asian so the chance of loving orange is $x$ ? Or is this a linear regression problem? What kind of prediction model should I use? random forest, KNN...etc?
