Yes. For disabling, use : #pragma warning disable 0169, 0414, anyothernumber Where the numbers are the identifiers of the warnings that you can read from compiler output. To reenable the warnings after a particular part of code (which is a good idea) use: #pragma warning restore 0169, anythingelse This way you can make the compiler output clean, and keep yourself safe because the warnings will only be suppressed for that particular part of code ( where you made sure you don't need to see them ).
