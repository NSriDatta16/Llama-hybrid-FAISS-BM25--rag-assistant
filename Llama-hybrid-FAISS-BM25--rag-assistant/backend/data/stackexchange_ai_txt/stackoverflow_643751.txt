Finlay Microsoft is correcting his error with ASP-Classic to ASP.NET step. 70% of old asp programmers went to PHP because ASP.NET was to complex. They tough that everything can be solved with ASP.NET drug and drop menus. And in the end everything is inside form tag! We are building big "web form" not web sites. Just look at the HTML from any ASP.NET site. Absolutely horrible! ASP.NET MVC is the new HOPE for cleaner more organised HTML code and powerful business logic.
