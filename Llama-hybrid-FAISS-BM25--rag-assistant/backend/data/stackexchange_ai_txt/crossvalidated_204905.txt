categorical data Analysis with too many levels

I am running multinomial logistic regression Model for rating Hotels. I have a variable called CHAIN ID which is a bunch of numbers but there are too many such IDs, maybe around 1000. I want to include this variable in my model. I have tried that but R is not responding. Is there any way to deal with these many levels of that variable?
