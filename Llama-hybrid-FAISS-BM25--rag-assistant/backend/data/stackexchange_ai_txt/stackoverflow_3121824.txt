Your code is fine as it stands right now. D::c_ is of type C rather than C & . Your SetC takes a reference to a C, and assigns the value referred to by that reference to C::c_ , so what you have is an entirely separate C object that has the same value. Since you created d with automatic storage duration in main , it and c_ which is part of it remain valid until you exit from main .
