Dummy variables for categories in logistic regression and odd ratio

I would like to run logistic regression with categorical variable. My variable assumes the following categories x={red, green, blue} . So I have options to use two different encoding for them: red = (1,0,0) green = (0,1,0) blue = (0,0,1) or I can encode them as red = (1,0) green = (0,1) blue = (0,0) I am trying to figure out what effect different encoding will have on odds ratio? What approach is standard in the industry?
