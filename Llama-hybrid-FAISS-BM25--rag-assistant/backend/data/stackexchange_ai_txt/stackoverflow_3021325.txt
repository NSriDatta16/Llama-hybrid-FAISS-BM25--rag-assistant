What about try-catch (or try-catch-finally )? private void test_click(object sender, EventArgs e) { MessageBox.Show("hi"); try { //if it works ok without a error it continues to MessageBox.Show("worked ok"); } catch( Exception ) { //if it encountered a error of some kind it would go to MessageBox.Show("DID NOT WORK OK"); } } Attention: Here I use a global catch( Exception ) which should be used with care, only! For a test method this is no problem, but do not do this in production code. You should at least specify the expected exception there and think about how to handle the situation.
