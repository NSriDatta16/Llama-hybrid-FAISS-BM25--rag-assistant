I like Russ Lenth's suggestion of comparing to the grand mean (sounds like ANOM), but would go one step further and suggest a Bayesian analysis to look at the credible intervals for the difference between level i and the grand mean. That should save you from the 'multiplicity adjustment makes everything disappear' issue, plus give you some idea of the magnitude of difference your data implies.
