Odds ratio goes above 20, Beta coefficient goes above 4

I am doing an analysis using logistic regression and my odds ratio is going pretty high. When I use a combination of the three IVs, with three other control variables, odds ratio for one of the IVs is 62, which I guess is pretty high. Variables in the Equation B S.E. Wald df Sig. Exp(B) FirmSize .001 .012 .005 1 .942 1.001 FirmAge -.048 .059 .680 1 .410 .953 FirmI .035 .127 .076 1 .783 1.035 TR -1.190 .861 1.910 1 .167 .304 ITR 4.132 1.417 8.498 1 .004 62.301 EO 2.356 .911 6.697 1 .010 10.553 EU -.270 .577 .219 1 .640 .764 Constant -17.535 5.298 10.955 1 .001 .000 a. Variable(s) entered on step 1: Tangibleresource, Intangibleresource, EO, EU. Independently if I test each variable, the odds ratio is even bigger, considering the impact of only one variable being taken into account. My friend suggested that scale suggested that the scale used would be inappropriate and asked me to convert the units. But my IVs, all three of them, are recorded on likert scale (1-5)so it's not like there is inconsistency in measurement approach. What should I do?
