Awesomium.framework (which contains Awesomium and AwesomiumProcess) just needs to be copied to the "Frameworks" folder of your app bundle. From our support documentation : If your project is using an Application Bundle (e.g., you're creating a Cocoa Application): Right-click your Application's name under Targets in XCode's Groupes & Files panel. Select Add -> New Build Phase -> New Copy Files Build Phase. In the dialog that appears, select Frameworks under the Destination drop-down list. Close the dialog. Expand your Application's list of build phases (just click the little triangle next to your Application's name under Targets to expand the list). Drag and drop Awesomium.framework onto the Copy Files build phase that you just created (should be the one at the bottom of the list). The Awesomium framework should automatically be copied into your Application Bundle every time you build your application. Let me know if this works!
