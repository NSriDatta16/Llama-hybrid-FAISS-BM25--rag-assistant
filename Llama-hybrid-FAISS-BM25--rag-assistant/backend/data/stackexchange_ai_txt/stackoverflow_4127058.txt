Nice, subtle, temporary highlighting technique using jQuery

I'm looking for a technique that isn't obnoxious like most that I've seen, that will temporarily raise attention to a small notification passage. I've been clunking around with adding and taking away classes and wrapper divs, without much success thus far. Suggestions appreciated.
