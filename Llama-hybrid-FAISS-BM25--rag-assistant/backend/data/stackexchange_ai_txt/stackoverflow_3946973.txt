Do you mean the 999th line or the 999th table row? The former might be perl -ne 'print if $. == 999' /path/to/*.dat The latter would involve an HTML parser and some selection logic. A Sax parser might be better for fast processing of a large number of files. It probably depends which version of HTML is used and whether it is "well-formed". Perl has many XML and HTML parsers - did you have any particular module in mind? EDIT: Your problem seems to be your XPath expression. The actual HTML is much more complex than your XPath suggests. The following expression works better #!/usr/bin/perl use strict; use warnings; use LWP::Simple; use HTML::TreeBuilder::XPath; # # replace this with a loop over 5000 existing files # my $url = 'http://www.kultusportal-bw.de/'. 'servlet/PB/menu/1188427/index.html'. '?COMPLETEHREF='. 'http://www.kultus-bw.de/'. 'did_abfrage/detail.php?id=04313488'; my $html = get $url; my $tree = HTML::TreeBuilder::XPath->new(); # # within the loop process the html like this # $tree->parse($html); $tree->eof; print $tree->findvalue('//table[@bgcolor]/tr[1]'); Try cutting the above and pasting into a file then running it with Perl.
