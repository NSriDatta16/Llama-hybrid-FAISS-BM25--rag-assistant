How to work multiple filter region sizes: 2, 3 and 4 in CNN?

I mention learn convolutional neural networks (CNN) for classification of sentences made by Yoonkim . I am still confused about the size of the filter and how convolution works . What do filter_h = 5 with filter_hs = [3,4,5] , whether filter_h is the maximum length for each filter_hs ?? how it works? To get the image shape , the longest maximum sentence in this case is 56 so 56 + 2 * (5-1) = 64 .., What does number 2 mean? Where is number 2 obtained?
