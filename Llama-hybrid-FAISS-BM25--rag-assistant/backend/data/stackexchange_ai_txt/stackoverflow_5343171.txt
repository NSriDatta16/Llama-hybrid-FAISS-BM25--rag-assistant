Most out-of-the-box Swing components have support for this built in(JTree, JList, etc). For those components you can set the drop mode and the ui will handle drawing the appropriate visual effects. myJList.setDropMode(DropMode.ON_OR_INSERT); For a custom component you need to handle the drawing yourself by overriding paintComponent to draw the custom effects and then adding a propertyChangeListener for the "dropLocation" property that triggers the appropriate repaints when necessary. This will get called frequently on drag so you may wish to only trigger repaints when the change in drop location actually results in a change in behavior. Swing Tutorial on Drop Location Rendering
