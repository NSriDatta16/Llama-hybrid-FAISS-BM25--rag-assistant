Evaluate methods across datasets based on distance metrics

I want to evaluate $n$ methods, says $M_1,\cdots,M_n$ on $m$ datasets $D_1, \ldots, D_m$ . For each method $M$ , I have a score function $f(M,D) \in [0, \infty)$ for dataset $D$ . A perfect method will have $f(M,D) = 0$ for all $D$ , and the large score the worse the method. So a good method would have very small score across all datasets. Let's take an example, assume that a method $M$ is to approximate dataset $D$ by $D'$ , and $f(M,D) = ||D- D'||$ . My questions are how to compare all methods over all datasets using score $f$ . By comparison I mean to rank all methods by some meaningful criteria or to make a conclusion which methods work well. A trivial way to do it is to average score over all datasets and rank them. Better method would have smaller score. However because the score can be very large, a bad instance would strongly influence the average score and we would give the wrong conclusion even though a method is very good overall. I also think maybe we can rank methods for each dataset and use some test statistics to rank them. Since I have no knowledge on statistics I would like to ask for your suggestion. Maybe there already exists some test statistics to measure such a task. Thanks
