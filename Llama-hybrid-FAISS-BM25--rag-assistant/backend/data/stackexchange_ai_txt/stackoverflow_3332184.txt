If using a third party library is an option, then I suggest using Lists.newArrayList(E... elements) from Google's Guava : List of = Lists.newArrayList(bigInt1, bigInt2, bigInt3); And if mutability isn't required, then use an overload of ImmutableList.of() : final List of = ImmutableList.of(bigInt1, bigInt2, bigInt3); This is IMO a very elegant solution.
