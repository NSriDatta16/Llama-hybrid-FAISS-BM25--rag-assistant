It depends on what you're trying to 'fool'. You can try some online services that do simple User Agent sniffing to gauge your success: http://browserspy.dk/browser.php http://www.browserscope.org (look for 'We think you're using...') http://www.browserscope.org/ua http://panopticlick.eff.org/ -> will help you to pick some 'too common to track' options http://networking.ringofsaturn.com/Tools/browser.php I believe a determined programmer could detect your game, but many log parsers and tools wouldn't once you echo what your real browser sends. One thing you should consider is that lack of JS might raise red flags, so capture sent headers with JS disabled too.
