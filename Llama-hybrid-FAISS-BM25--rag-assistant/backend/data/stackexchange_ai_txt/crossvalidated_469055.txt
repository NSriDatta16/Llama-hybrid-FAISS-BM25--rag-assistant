Does it make sense to condition on fixed values of some parameters before doing MCMC on the other parameters?

I have a Bayesian model with a large number of parameters (around 50), and as usual my goal is to infer the posterior distribution for the parameters, with MCMC. However, I am only interested in the full posterior distribution for 5 of the parameters - the others are indispensable to the model but uninteresting. Due to the impossible computational cost of th MCMC chain on all 50 parameters, I am looking at this method to give some idea of the posteriors I am interested in, while still being possible to run in the amount of time: Obtain the MAP estimate of all 50 parameters. Obtain the MCMC samples of the posterior distribution for the 5 interesting parameters, conditional on the MAP estimate for the other parameters. Obviously this conditional posterior is not as good as the correct joint posterior. But as an approximation, do you think the strategy is plausible? Its okay to assume that the parameters using MAP estimates dont have alot of variance.
