TFS 2010 build succeeds but fails to drop build in output folder

In my TFS 2010 build definition, if I have the setting CLEAN WORKSPACE = ALL, the directory (c:\builds\Binaries) on the TFS agent machine is deleted. While the build itself succeeds, its output fails to drop to the specified drop location. (The error: "TF270003: Failed to copy. Ensure the source directory c:\builds\Binaries exists and that you have the appropriate permissions.") If (after first recreating the c:\builds\Binaries directory) I set CLEAN WORKSPACE = NONE, the build still runs successfully, without getting the drop error. However, there is still no build output, even though the setting DropBuild = True. Why would the CLEAN WORKSPACE setting delete a directory without recreating it? Is there another setting used to recreate this directory on the build agent? Is there a downside to using CLEAN WORKSPACE = NONE? And when I use CLEAN WORKSPACE = NONE, and have a successful build, any ideas why the build is not being dropped to the output location, even though DropBuild = True? (Note that the build log does successfully drop to this location.) Nothing is ever placed in c:\builds\Binaries during a successful build, even though I've opened up full permissions for everybody on that directory of the build agent server. Any ideas would be appreciated.
