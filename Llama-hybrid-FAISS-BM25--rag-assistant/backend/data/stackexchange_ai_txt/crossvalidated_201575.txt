I think what you are looking for is Recurrent Neural Networks. You could start by having a look at some papers, e.g. http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~ilya/pubs/2011/LANG-RNN.pdf from the University of Toronto. A more practical description can be found here: http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/ I think this is a relatively clear example. I hope this helps!
