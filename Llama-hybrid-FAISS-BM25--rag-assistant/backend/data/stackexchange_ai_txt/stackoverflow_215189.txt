what are some resources to learn about copyright law?

I once heard a prominent scientist say, of global warming, that he didn't realize how much he would have to learn about politics. I just read an excellent article in DDJ about the Jacobsen verus Katzer case. When in university, I didn't know how much I would have to learn about the law. It seems to me that a big hole in the classic comp sci education is that of legal issues. Many of us talk about licenses, copyright, copyleft, prior art, etc, but our terms are often vague and probably inaccurate. What are some resources where the average developer can learn about copyright law and become an informed citizen of IT?
