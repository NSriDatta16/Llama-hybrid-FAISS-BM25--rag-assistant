Using numpy to enter noise into data

I am new to data science and have to generate 200 numbers from a uniform distribution set this as x and generate y data using x and injecting noise from the gaussian distribution y = 12x-4 + noise My Approach: x = numpy.random.rand(200) --> This will generate 200 numbers form a uniform distribution I am not sure hot to inject noise from the guassian distribution probably it's like z = numpy.random.randn(200) and y = 12 * x - 4 + z Is that a correct way to inject noise?
