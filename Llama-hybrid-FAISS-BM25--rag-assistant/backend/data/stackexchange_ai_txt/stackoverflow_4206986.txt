I think that is the kind of thing you're looking for: SELECT id, MIN(ABS(id - (SELECT AVG(id) FROM table))) as min FROM table GROUP BY id ORDER BY min LIMIT 1; Per example, if your data set contains the following IDs: 3, 4, 10, with an average of 5.6667. The closest value to 5.6667 is 4. If your data set is 3, 6, 10, 14, with an average of 8.25, the clostest value is 10. This is what this query returns. Hope it helps.
