This does the job: %w{version patchlevel platform}.each{|v| eval "RUBY_#{v.upcase} ||= 'unknown #{v}'"} but I think it's opaque and unpleasant. I think your original version is much better. In particular, I think ||= with constants isn't great anyway (since constants shouldn't be dynamic), and that using eval with constants is not standard or therefore expected. Putting conditional assignment, constants and eval all together makes for a bad mix, in my opinion.
