How To Select First Ancestor That Matches A Selector?

General : How can I select the first matching ancestor of an element in jQuery? Example : Take this HTML block Remove Remove I can remove a row in the table by clicking "Remove" using this jQuery code: $('.remove').click(function(){ $(this).parent().parent().hide(); return false; }); This works, but it's pretty fragile. If someone puts the into a , for example, it would break. Is there a selector syntax in jQuery that follows this logic: "Here's an element, now find the closest ancestor that matches some selection criteria and return it" Thanks
