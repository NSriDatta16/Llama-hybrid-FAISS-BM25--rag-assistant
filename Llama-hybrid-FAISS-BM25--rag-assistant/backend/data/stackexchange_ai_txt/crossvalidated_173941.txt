PCA on returns: to scale or not to scale

I am running PCA on time series data that has returns for a particular stock. Usually, when I run PCA for non-financial data I always scale the data with some R command like prcomp(data,scale=TRUE) . However, I believe that returns data is scaled to a certain level. So when using returns data should my command be prcomp(returns,scale=False) ?
