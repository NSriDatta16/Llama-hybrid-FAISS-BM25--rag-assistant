Go to the menu System > Configuration > Admin > Admin Base URL. There you can enter and enable http://admin.magentostore.com/ . You will still need to set the MAGE_RUN_CODE as Ivan suggested to prevent it being used as a normal store. As an added tweak you can use my (shamelessly plugged) admin rewrite extension to tidy up the URLs. I have been working on another extension to bolster the security by disallowing admin access on non-admin domains, but sadly it is not yet ready for release, watch this space...
