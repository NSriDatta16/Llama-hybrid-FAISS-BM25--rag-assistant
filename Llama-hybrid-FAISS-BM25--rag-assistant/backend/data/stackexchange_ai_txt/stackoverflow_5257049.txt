What is the most elegant way to write a text/binary file with c++?

I found some good results on reading e.g.: Read txt with iterators and preallocation , or read into containers . So I wondered how would I write most elegant a std::string into a file? Edit: When reading I can preallocate space for the string via seek and tellg, since I know the size of the string, how could I tell the filesystem how much I want to write?
