Statistical test to compare the mean of two samples

There's a competition with 20 categories, and each category has 3 winners. I have an array of the winner's performance of the next year (60 values), and other array with the average of the competitors of each category (of the next year also). I wanted to compare them with the hypothesis: 'The winner of the competition will do above average next year'. It would be really useful if i could also do the comparison with only the two vectors of data (mean of winners/mean of competitors). I am interested only in verifying the hypothesis. Is there any good Statistical test that could i use?
