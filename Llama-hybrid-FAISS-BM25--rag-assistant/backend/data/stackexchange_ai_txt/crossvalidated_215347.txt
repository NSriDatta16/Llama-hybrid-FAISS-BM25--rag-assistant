SVMs (linear or otherwise) inherently do binary classification. However, there are various procedures for extending them to multiclass problems. The most common methods involve transforming the problem into a set of binary classification problems, by one of two strategies: One vs. the rest . For $k$ classes, $k$ binary classifiers are trained. Each determines whether an example belongs to its 'own' class versus any other class. The classifier with the largest output is taken to be the class of the example. One vs. one . A binary classifier is trained for each pair of classes. A voting procedure is used to combine the outputs. More sophisticated methods exist. Search for "multiclass SVM".
