You'd only use GPU for training because deep learning requires massive calculation to arrive at an optimal solution. However, you don't need GPU machines for deployment . Let's take Apple's new iPhone X as an example. The new iPhone X has an advanced machine learning algorithm for facical detection. Apple employees must have a cluster of machines for training and validation. But your iPhone X doesn't need a GPU for just running the model.
