I've been finding it more useful to design ajax code around an event based paradigm. MVC is not mutually exclusive to event based organization but the focus for me has been more and more on the event handling side of things and less on the traditional model view controller way of looking at things. It's more of a MWE (Model, Widget, Event) organization with the event code taking the place or wrapping the Controller code.
