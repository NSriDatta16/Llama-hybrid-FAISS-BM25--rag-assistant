Better to use the feature of Windows 7 that is designed for this purpose - taskbar overlay icons. http://10rem.net/blog/2009/12/09/overlaying-icons-on-the-windows-7-taskbar-with-wpf-4 is one of the many places you can see how to do it. If the attention is needed as part of a long running process, I'd use a taskbar progress bar overlay (also easy to do in WPF) and change its state from Normal to Paused or Error which display as yellow and red respectively. That will get the user's attention.
