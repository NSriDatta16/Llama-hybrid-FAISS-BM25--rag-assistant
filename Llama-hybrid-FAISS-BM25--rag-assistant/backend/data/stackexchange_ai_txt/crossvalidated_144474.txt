Predicting customer churn

I'm trying to decide how to go about this problem. I have a large database of customers, both who have churned at some point, and who are current. I'm not sure how to create test/train sets from this. I would like to make a model that can predict the probability a customer will churn within say, the next 3 months. Anyone have advice or links on how to deal with this. I did make a random forest model previously which simply predicted a probability of a yes or no to churn but I would like to refine it. I'm mostly lost on what data I should extract to make my train and test sets, i.e, should I use multiple classes for each month etc.
