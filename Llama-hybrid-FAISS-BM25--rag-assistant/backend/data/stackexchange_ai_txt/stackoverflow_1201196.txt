SQL jobs don't have timeouts -- you can't configure them to stop on their own if they run too long, or reach a particular point in time. (Woulda saved me a lot of development time if you could!) You can configure steps to check for times or durations, and can code the actions taken within steps to check for times, but at the job or the step level, no. Which is what makes this an interesting question. Why are you getting a timeout? Based on what you've said, I'd guess that SQL Agent is unable to tell that the OS has received the "do this" command you're sending via the cmdexec step. After sending and waiting, it thinks the job never started and reports accordingly (and there's your hidden system timeout). How is this happening? You could investingate security configurations or file access rights, but I'd start by reviewing whatever routine it is that you're starting up -- something about it smells fishy to me.
