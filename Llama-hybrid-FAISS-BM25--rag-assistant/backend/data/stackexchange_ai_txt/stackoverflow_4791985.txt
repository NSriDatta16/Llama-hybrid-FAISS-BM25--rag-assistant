Do you use Monitor cmd ? If not: add it to your dialplan (there is also StopMonitor cmd). If you already use it then you will have to show us more details: dialplan, maybe some fragment of asterisk log with error. There is example of my dialplan with Monitor cmd: [afterwork_service] exten => s,1,NoOp exten => s,n,Answer exten => s,n,PlayBack(recording_starting_info) exten => s,n,Wait(2) exten => s,n,Monitor(wav,${CALLFILENAME}) It plays info about recording starting and then customer can record praises to our service, software and developers :)
