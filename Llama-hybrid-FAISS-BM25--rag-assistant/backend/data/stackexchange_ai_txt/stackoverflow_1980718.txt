I'd prefer to only add the Servlet API as dependency, To be honest, I'm not sure to understand why but never mind... Brabster separate dependencies have been replaced by Java EE 6 Profiles. Is there a source that confirms this assumption? The maven repository from Java.net indeed offers the following artifact for the WebProfile: java.net2 Repository hosting the jee6 artifacts http://download.java.net/maven/2 javax javaee-web-api 6.0 provided This jar includes Servlet 3.0, EJB Lite 3.1, JPA 2.0, JSP 2.2, EL 1.2, JSTL 1.2, JSF 2.0, JTA 1.1, JSR-45, JSR-250. But to my knowledge, nothing allows to say that these APIs won't be distributed separately (in java.net repository or somewhere else). For example (ok, it may a particular case), the JSF 2.0 API is available separately (in the java.net repository): com.sun.faces jsf-api 2.0.0-b10 provided And actually, you could get javax.servlet-3.0.jar from there and install it in your own repository.
