You can't necessarily do that, and it's not recommended even if you find a way/hack to do it. One hack would be to ensemble multiple models, weighted - with one feature per model. This is not a tested approach, so proceed with caution. Do Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to see how it affects your accuracy + precision + recall. Also, rank your features using random forests benchmarks to be able to see which feature gives your model more variance.
