In order to avoid the spurious correlation problem, you should regress two stationary time series against one another. This can (potentially) provide a causal story. It is non-stationary series that lead to spurious correlation. See the reasoning given by my answer to this question (As a footnote, you may not need stationary series if they are integrated series, but I'd point you to any of the applied time series books to learn more about that.)
