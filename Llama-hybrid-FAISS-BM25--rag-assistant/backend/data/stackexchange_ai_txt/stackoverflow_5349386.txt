How to access bootstrap.inc on external file

I need to bootstrap Drupal. I have a php-file with all my functions and in one of those functions, I need to use a Drupal function which is located in the bootstrap.inc file. Structure of the server: (d) drupal (sd)includes (f)bootstrap.inc (d) scripts (sb)functions (f) functions.php So I need to include in a self-written function the "variable_set" function, located in bootstrap.inc. A little piece of the function my college wrote (I'm terribly sorry, but I don't know how to format php on the forum. If someone does, please let me know so I can edit this mess): function readxml() { echo " READING... "; $file = './config.xml'; $xml = simplexml_load_file($file); if($xml !== false) { foreach($xml->config->children() as $item){ $name = $item->getName(); // GETS CHILDREN UNDER 'CONFIG' switch($name) { case 'website': foreach($xml->config->website->children() as $kid){ $childname = $kid->getName(); switch($childname) { case 'theme': if(inserttheme($kid)or die ('failed to insert theme ')){ echo 'theme is installed. ';} break; case 'slogan': if(insertslogan($kid)or die('failed to insert slogan ')){ echo 'slogan is installed. ';} break; case 'sitename': if(insertname($kid)or die('failed to insert name ')){ echo 'website name is installed. ';} break; } } break; ` So, somewhere in the theme/slogan/name section, I have to call the variable_set function which is located in the bootstrap.inc file. Somewhere I found this (again sorry for the non-formated text): $drupal_directory = "/home/httpdocs/drupal"; // wherever Drupal is $current_directory = getcwd(); chdir($drupal_directory); require_once './includes/bootstrap.inc'; drupal_bootstrap(DRUPAL_BOOTSTRAP_FULL); chdir($current_dir); return; I included it both in my function.php as well as in my final php-file (where all the functions are called) but no result... What am I doing wrong?
