The way I did it was to take a few minutes initially to go over the most basic stuff -- moving the cursor around, searching forwards and back, jumping to next and previous words/sentences/paragraphs, etc. Inserting, appending. Whatever you can fit in your head. Then, when you've got something to do that doesn't have to be done in the next 15 seconds, make yourself use it. When you're pretty comfortable with the basics, slowly learn the more advanced commands -- especially those that leverage your previous learning (like replacing the next 3 words, or deleting to the next search target) I love using VI, once I learned how. The advanced commands are far more powerful than what most of the GUI editors seem to offer, and the fact that it's ubiquitous and text-based, and so available over ssh, is all the better.
