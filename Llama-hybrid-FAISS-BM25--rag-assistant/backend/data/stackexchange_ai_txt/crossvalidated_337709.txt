Different organisations often have conflicting rules for the precision in reporting of results. Ultimately there is a trade-off between when seeing the extra digits is useful, versus cases where unnecessary and excessive precision "can swamp the reader, overcomplicate the story and obscure the message" â€” a subject explored by Tim Cole (2015) in a piece that I found gave a useful guide to "sensible" precision in reporting, and a comparison of leading style manuals. His advice on percentages was as follows: Integers, or one decimal place for values under 10%. Values over 90% may need one decimal place if their complement is informative. Use two or more decimal places only if the range of values is less than 0.1% Examples: 0.1%, 5.3%, 27%, 89%, 99.6% By "complement" he is referring to cases where one might be interested in the "other lot", e.g. if I tell you 98% of patients in a trial got better, you may well be interested in the 2% who did not, and in that case another decimal place to distinguish whether that "2%" really means "2.4% or "1.6%" would actually be useful.
