It sounds like your unit of analysis is the individual, not the organization. That means your sample size will be 959. Since you're using SEM, I assume that you're also planning on treating your data as hierarchical -- that is, people nested in companies. Then you can include individual level terms as well as company level terms in your model. Since you only have 9 companies, however, you can probably only include about 3-4 company level terms in your model. Hope that helps. Jake
