Using propensity scores as continuous variable in Cox model to estimate treatment effect

I am exploring various methods of covariate adjustment to estimate treatment effects. These include - matching, weighting (IPTW) and use of propensity scores as a continuous variable in the cox model. Here is a fully reproducible R script library("survival") library("survminer") library("MatchIt") data("ovarian") head(ovarian) summary(as.factor(ovarian $rx)) ovarian$ rx $distance ovarian$ ps |z|) rx 0.6105 1.8414 0.5908 1.033 0.301 ps -1.1348 0.3215 5.3374 -0.213 0.832 exp(coef) exp(-coef) lower .95 upper .95 rx 1.8414 0.5431 0.578463044 5.862 ps 0.3215 3.1104 0.000009204 11230.137 Concordance= 0.624 (se = 0.082 ) Likelihood ratio test= 1.1 on 2 df, p=0.6 Wald test = 1.08 on 2 df, p=0.6 Score (logrank) test = 1.11 on 2 df, p=0.6 As you can see, I have used the propensity scores from the logistic regression model as a continuous variable to estimate treatment effect. I did this without matching or weighting. This means that the Cox regression model has been adjusted with the propensity of being assigned to treatment for each patient. This way, I do not intend to include all the covariates in the Cox model. Instead I just used the propensity score as a continuous variable in the model. Questions: Can we compare the hazard ratios from such a Cox model with those of Cox models who are generated by using only the matched patients (propensity score matching like 1:1 nearest neighbor matching) and Cox models weighted by IPTW weights. How do I generate adjusted Cox survival curves for the two treatment groups from the Cox model?
