What are the inputs to a logistic regression? Probability or trial result?

It is a very basic question, but cannot find a satisfactory answer to. When we do logistic regression, what are the inputs? Suppose we have a dataset of students giving number of hours each student spent studying, and the end result of whether they passed or failed. The wikipedia article on LR goes to do a fitting with the logistic curve based on probability as a function of number of hours. But how do I get the probabilities if all I have is whether they passed or failed?
