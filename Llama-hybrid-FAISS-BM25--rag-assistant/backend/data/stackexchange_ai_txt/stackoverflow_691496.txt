Pay attention to difference between free function pointer and member function pointer initializations: member function: struct S { void func(){}; }; int main(){ void (S::*pmf)()=&S::func;// & is mandatory } and free function: void func(int){} int main(){ void (*pf)(int)=func; // & is unnecessary it can be &func as well; } Thanks to this redundant &, you can add stream manipulators-which are free functions- in chain without it: cout
