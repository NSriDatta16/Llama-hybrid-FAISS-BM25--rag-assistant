The MSE predicts the parameter value of the mean of the residual values squared. That is, the average distance between a predicted value from your regression best-fit line and the true values in the population you sampled from, then multiplied by itself. Depending on the software/output you could either be reading a biased or unbiased result. To directly answer your question, the MSE is scale dependent, for very large response variables an MSE of 0.342 would indicate that your regression estimates the sample (and therefore the population, we might infer) very well. For a response variable with smaller values it could be a poorer fit. It does not, on its own, describe the relationship between your response and predictor variables.
