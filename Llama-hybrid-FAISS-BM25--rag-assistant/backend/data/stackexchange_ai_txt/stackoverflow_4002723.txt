I'm guessing that this: entryItem.appendChild(document.createTextNode(o.getProperty())); created a text node with a null value. Looking at Xerces' code (which is the default JAXP implementation shipped with Oracle's JDK 1.6), I see no null validation done at the time of constructing the text node. I suspect that that, later, makes the Transformer die. Either that, or there's some JAXp configuration problem. You may wish to set the jaxp.debug system property (available JDK 1.6+) to get some JAXP tracing information.
