C and C++ are allowed to have variable sized ints... as far as I remember, the only requirement is that small Incidentally, the sizes of floats and doubles in C# are only defined for storage - variables are allowed to use extra precision. So the following conditional: class Foo { private float _v = ...; // Definitely 32-bit. void Test() { var v = _v; // Could be 32-, 64-, or 96-bit. if(v == _v) { ... } } } May or may not execute. (At the time of writing, the CLR will usually use a 96-bit FP register in release mode if it can).
