the fastest way to get pages automatically removed from google set a new last modified date of that specific page return an HTTP 410 for a page URL (you can still display content on it, or make the HTTP 410 google user agent specific, or no-cookie specific, or no language header specific) put the URL into a sitemap.xml (with the new last modified date) ping sitemap.xml to google with this method you can make pages disappear from google SERPS in 1 to 2 hours (if your site gets crawled regularly). note: if you want to kick out thousands and thousands of pages at once this process will take longer.
