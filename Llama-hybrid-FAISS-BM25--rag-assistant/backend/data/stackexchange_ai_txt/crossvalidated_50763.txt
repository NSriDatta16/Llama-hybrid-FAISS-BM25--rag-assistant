Statistics for machine learning, papers to start?

I have a background in computer programming and elementary number theory, but no real statistics training, and have recently "discovered" that the amazing world of a whole range of techniques is actually a statistical world. It seems that matrix factorizations, matrix completion, high dimensional tensors, embeddings, density estimation, Bayesian inference, Markov partitions, eigenvector computation, PageRank are all highly statistical techniques, and that the machine learning algorithms that use such things, use a lot of statistics. My goal is to be able to read papers that discuss such things, and implement or create the algorithms, while understanding the notation, "proofs" and statistical arguments used. I guess the hardest thing is to follow all the proofs that involve matrices. What basic papers can get me started? Or a good textbook with exercises that are worth working through ? Specifically, some papers I would like to understand completely are : Exact Matrix Completion via Convex Optimization, Candes, Recht, 2008 The Fast Cauchy Transform and Faster Robust Linear Regression, Clarkson et al, 2013 Random Projections for Support Vector Machines, Paul et al, 2013 High-Dimensional Probability Estimation with Deep Density Models, Rippel, Adams, 2013 Obtaining Error-Minimizing Estimates and Universal Entry-Wise Error Bounds for Low-Rank Matrix Completion, Kir√°ly, Theran, 2013
