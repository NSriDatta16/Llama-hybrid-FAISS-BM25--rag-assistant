Most elegant way to expand card hand suits

I'm storing 4-card hands in a way to treat hands with different suits the same, e.g.: 9h 8h 7c 6c is the same as 9d 8d 7h 6h since you can replace one suit with another and have the same thing. It's easy to turn these into a unique representation using wildcards for suits. THe previous would become: 9A 8A 7B 6B My question is - what's the most elegant way to turn the latter back into a list of the former? For example, when the input is 9A 8A 7B 6B , the output should be: 9c 8c 7d 6d 9c 8c 7h 6h 9c 8c 7s 6s 9h 8h 7d 6d 9h 8h 7c 6c 9h 8h 7s 6s 9d 8d 7c 6c 9d 8d 7h 6h 9d 8d 7s 6s 9s 8s 7d 6d 9s 8s 7h 6h 9s 8s 7c 6c I have some ugly code that does this on a case-by-case basis depending on how many unique suits there are. It won't scale to hands with more cards. Also in a situation like: 7A 7B 8A 8B it will have duplicates, since in this case A=c and B=d is the same as A=d and B=c . What's an elegant way to solve this problem efficiently? I'm coding in C, but I can convert higher-level code down to C.
