Most Delphi books still have large chunks of relevant stuff in them. Most of the stuff that is still good is the low level stuff, such as writing code, using dlls & bpls. Even writing components is pretty much the same. I referred back to a Delphi 3 book the other day and found what I wanted. As a recommedation I'd get a combination of older and newer books. In terms of new I'd get Marco Cantu's Delphi 2007 & 2009 handbooks, and his Mastering Delphi 2005 (ignoring the .net stuff) or Mastering Delphi 7 which will give you pretty good coverage and are all excellent books. Bob Swart also has some useful books. You probably don't want to go back to anything earlier than Delphi 3, but some pascal programming books can be helpful. You probably shouldn't be paranoid about reading about outdated stuff, being aware of it is very helpful if you have to work with legacy code, So long as you brush up on some more modern books you should be okay. I'd also recommend reading Code Complete 2 or The Pragmatic Programmer. You may also want to read books on Design Patterns and Refactoring - which there none written for Delphi specifically.
