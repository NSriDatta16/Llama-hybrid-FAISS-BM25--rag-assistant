Are databases always the solution in web data storage?

I haven't got any experience with databases, but intends to learn it and use it on a web project I'm planning. Though, I've got advice from a pal of mine that the use of databases should be quite more extensive than I planned. He believes in keeping almost all of the data in databases, where I find that databases are most convenient regarding perhaps user data (just tiny pieces of data), and page content data and the like (everything that's not just very tiny pieces of data) in static files - without having any knowledge to build that assumption upon. What would be the better solution? Minimum data in databases, or as much as I can find ways to store in them effectively? Is there a performance difference between the use of static files and databases? Would the best solution depend on general site traffic? I intend to use a combination of PHP and MySQL.
