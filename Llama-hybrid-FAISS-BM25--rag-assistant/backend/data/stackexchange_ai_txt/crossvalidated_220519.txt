2X2 Factorial Design with Likert-type Responses

I have a 2x2 design completely between subjects. Both independent variables are dichotomous. The dependent variable is a 7 point Likert-type item. But I'm not sure how to analyze it. I know ANOVA, while common, is wrong because the Likert data is ordinal. And I want to look at interaction effects, so a one-way test isn't helpful. Is ordinal logistic regression the way to go? If so, how should I implement it in R?
