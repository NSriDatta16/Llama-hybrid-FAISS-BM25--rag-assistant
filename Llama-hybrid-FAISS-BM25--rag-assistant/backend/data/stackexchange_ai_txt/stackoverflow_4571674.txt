Help With PHP and XPath

I need help doing a few things with XPath in PHP. With any given HTML, I need to: Remove all tables and their contents Remove everything after the first h1 tag Keep only paragraphs (INCLUDING their inner HTML (links, lists, etc)) With regex, I got everything working perfectly. When I encountered nested tables, however, I decided that it is indeed foolish to parse HTML with regex. Thanks so much!
