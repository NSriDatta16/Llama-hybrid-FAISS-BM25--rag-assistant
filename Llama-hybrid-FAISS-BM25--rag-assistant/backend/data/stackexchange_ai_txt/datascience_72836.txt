SpaCy string store

I am trying to get the hash values for some English words from the string store of SpaCy. nlp = English() doc1 = nlp('this is doc1') id = doc1.vocab.strings['Saurabh'] print(id) # output, it has given hash code id1 = doc1.vocab.strings['समाचार'] # This is a hindi word so i do not expect it to be a part of English, # so it shoud throw an error. print(id1) # output, it given hash code Why this is not giving an error in (at least) the 2nd line?
