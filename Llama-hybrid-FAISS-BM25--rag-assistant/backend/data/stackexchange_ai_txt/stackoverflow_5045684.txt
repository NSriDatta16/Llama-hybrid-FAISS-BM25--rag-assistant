Here are some tips off the top of my head if you want to get started with testing using the MS tools: If you have an MSDN subscription, install a Test Rig by installing the Test Controller on your network and the the Test Agent service on each of the machines that will be collecting diagnostic data. See the following link for reference: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd293551.aspx . Add a Test Project to your solution. See the first part of the following blog post: http://blogs.microsoft.co.il/blogs/eranruso/archive/2010/03/27/visual-studio-2010-coded-ui-test-user-guide-create-a-simple-coded-ui-test.aspx . Automated test options can be configured through the .testsettings file(s) that are added automatically when you add a Test project (you can also manually add these files to your solution). Install Team Foundation Server (2010 recommended) in order to take advantage automating your tests with a daily build. You will also need TFS 2010 if you want to use the VS2010 Test Manager tool to define test environments and plan manual tests (these can be fully automated with CodedUI). Customize your new automated build to setup / deploy your application after build and set the build to run tests. Deployment will likely not be necessary for unit tests, but they will be for Web Performance and CodedUI test types. If you have VS Ultimate or Test Professional licenses, you can also go further and set up virtual test labs using "Lab Management" features.
