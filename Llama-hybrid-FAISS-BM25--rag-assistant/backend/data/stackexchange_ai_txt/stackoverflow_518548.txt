Why isn't wget accepting my username/password?

I've tried both wget --user=myuser --password=mypassword myfile and wget --ftp-user=myuser --ftp-password=mypassword myfile but I keep getting the error HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 401 Authorization Required Authorization failed. I know the file is there, and I know the username/password are correct - I can ftp in with no problem. Any thoughts on what's going on here? How do I even tell if wget is paying attention to the username/password that I'm giving it? (The error is the same if I simply don't provide that info.)
