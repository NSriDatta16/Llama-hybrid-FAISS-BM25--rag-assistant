I'm not sure if this can be done out-of-the-box, but in webapps I find it useful to have a "who am I?" facility in the various view files. The idea is to emit a message into the rendered HTML, to identify the fragment. This is especially true when I am encountering an app for the first time. In Grails, I do this with a custom tag. For example, consider list.gsp for a Student: Here is the code: class MiscTagLib { def debug = { map -> if (grailsApplication.config.grails.views.debug.mode == true) { def msg = map['msg'] out ${msg} " } } } The key is that you can leave those tags in there, if desired, as they only appear in when the mode is enabled in Config.groovy: grails.views.debug.mode=true
