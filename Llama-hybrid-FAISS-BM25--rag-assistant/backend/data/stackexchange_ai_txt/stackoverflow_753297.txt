Architecting a visual grid of 'buttons'

I'm trying to design how to implement a relatively simple application. I want to create a grid of 'squares' that cover an entire screen. Each square should have the ability to respond to touch events, and then have an on/off state. For example, if I touch an 'off' square, and then drag my finger across 10 other squares, I want them all to turn on. And vice versa. I'm not sure of the memory overhead of just creating a grid of 150 buttons. Also buttons don't have a settable state, from what I can see. I was also thinking of subclassing UIView and implementing UIResponder methods. It feels like I should be creating an array of array of buttons (or subclass of UIViews), but I'm not sure if that's possible. I'm assuming that I can tell what square I'm on by getting the location of the touchevent from the UIResponder methods. Do I need to create my own version of a myButton by subclassing UIView, and have a on/off state property, along with UIResponder methods, and then create an array of myButtons?
