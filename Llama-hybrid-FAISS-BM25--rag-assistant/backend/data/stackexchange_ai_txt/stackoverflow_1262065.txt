As Albert said, QTP doesn't rely solely on elements' id , in fact due to the fact that many web applications generate different id s for each session, (as far as I remember) the id property isn't part of the default description for most web test objects. QTP is pretty good at recognizing most simple web controls and if you're facing problems it may be the case that a Web Extensibility project will help you bridge the gap between the semantics of your web application and the raw HTML it is created in. If a complex control is recognized by QTP as a WebElement (which is actually the div that contains the span that drives the code) you will understandably have object recognition problems since there are many div s on the page but probably many less complex controls .
