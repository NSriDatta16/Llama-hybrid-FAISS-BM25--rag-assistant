Actually, If you want to become data science what should you focus on is not math for computer science but the statistics associated with multi-dimension mathematics such as probability, calculus, matrix, linear algebra as the foundation. There is no free pass to get of this knowledge, so trying to get all the mathematics course as fast as possible is the short-run determination that can ruin your math life in long-term as many of programmer try to fit in the demand by learning python and R for data scientist but practically not skilled enough. If you really believe in your goal don't make it rush, the mastery comes with effort and time. MIT course is good but what is better than a course is "determinant" and reading a highly related book instead.
