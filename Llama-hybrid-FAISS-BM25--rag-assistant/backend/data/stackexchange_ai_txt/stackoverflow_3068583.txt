I can think of several methods. One way is to try to decode the file using UTF-8. (This is built into Java and is probably built into .NET too.) If the file decodes properly, then you at least know that it's a text file of some kind. Once you know it's a text file, parse out the individual fields from each line and check that you get the number of fields that you expect. If the number of fields per line is inconsistent then you might just have a file that contains text but is not organized into lines and fields. Otherwise you have a CSV. Then you can validate the fields.
