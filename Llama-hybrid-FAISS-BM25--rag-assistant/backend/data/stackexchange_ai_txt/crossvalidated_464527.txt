For a GLM your problem isn't the imbalance per se, but rather the low frequency of the less frequent outcome given your total # of observations. 5% of 60 is only 3 observations; a common rule of thumb for logistic regression is to have 10 observations of the least common outcome per predictor (others suggest more; there are several Q&A about this here including Sample size for logistic regression? ), so you don't have enough to meaningfully evaluate even one predictor variable.
