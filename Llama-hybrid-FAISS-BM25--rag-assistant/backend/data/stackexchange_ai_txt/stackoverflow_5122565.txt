What you are trying to accomplish is possible (impossible ideas are pretty rare) How you are trying to accomplish it is not. This definitely shows the neophyte programmer "bit off more than you can chew" mentality. You cannot grab data from the client. They can, however, push it to you - You could create a small autorun.ini file or something similar for a USB drive that would actively open a browser window on the client pointed to a page on your site to handle authentication. The specifics of such an implementation would be quite verbose and steeped in security challenges, but this is possible. Like I said, what you are trying to do is definitely possible. Don't get discouraged when you ask how to do something and are told it's impossible. Find out why it's "impossible" - it may not be. If it is, find out how other people would do it, and go from there.
