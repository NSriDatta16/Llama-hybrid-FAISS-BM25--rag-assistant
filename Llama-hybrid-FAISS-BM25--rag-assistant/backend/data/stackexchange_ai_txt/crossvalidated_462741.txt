Highly correlated variable, when to remove

I have a dataset that includes both course number and course name. For some models such as regression, a Pearson Correlation matrix is obtained and one of any pair of features that are highly correlated are dropped to improve the results. Since course number/name are categorical features, I am not able to plot the correlation matrix for them, but they have a one-to-one relationship. Does finding highly correlated pair of features and removing one important for various other models in Machine learning? If I were to use SVM or KNN, or Trees would I have to drop one of the columns (either keep course name or course number)? Any pointers are highly appreciated.
