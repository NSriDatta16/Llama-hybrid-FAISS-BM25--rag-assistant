Anonymous classes cannot be safely referred to by name, only but instance. You can predict the name and use that but its not elegant, or reliable. private void neverCalled() { SomeInterface si = new SomeInterface() { // implement interface }; } Class anon = Class.forName(getClass()+"$1"); // hopefully its the first! It is much simpler to give the class a name and use that. Many IDEs allow you to change one into the other very easily.
