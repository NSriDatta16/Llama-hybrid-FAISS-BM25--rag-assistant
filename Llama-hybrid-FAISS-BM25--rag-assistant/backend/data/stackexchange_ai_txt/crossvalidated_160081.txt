A few things: "Only" these two tests relative to what? The literature is huge 10 years sounds very little for a unit root test, be it in the panel or univariate. As to which test to use: if all the series in your panel are stationary an average type test like IPS might be more capable of detecting this, whereas if there are only a few, but strongly, stationary series, the term $-\ln(p_i)$ will contribute a lot to a (possible) rejection of the Fisher statistic. So essentially there is no one single good answer.
