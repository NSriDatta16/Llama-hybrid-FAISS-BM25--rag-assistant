It would be nice to know what your research problem is and what your hypothesis is. Is this a single subject over time? What are the two columns with header 2010 and 2011? Are those years? You could do a dependent samples t-Test, a repeated measures ANOVA, an Interrupted Time Series ARIMA, a longitudinal hierarchical linear model, autoregressive latent trajectory model...... The method depends most of all on your scientific hypothesis.
