It seems analogous to the computation of an effect size. It reflects the mean increase in MSE the variable contributes, divided by a measure of its variability: For each tree, we get a difference between two MSE values. Averaging over trees gives the mean difference between the two MSE values. The standard deviation of the differences reflects the variation around the mean, a measure of residual error (cf. pooled standard deviation in ANOVA). Dividing the mean by this standard deviation gives an effect size (cf. Cohen's $d$ in ANOVA). Note that it would thus be possible to obtain MSE increase > 100% (just like it is possible to obtain Cohen's $d$ effect size > 1; %IncMSE increase should not be interpreted as $R^2$ ): > set.seed(42) > x y library(randomForest) > rf importance(rf) %IncMSE IncNodePurity y 293.7449 1004.795
