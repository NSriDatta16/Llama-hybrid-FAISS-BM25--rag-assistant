Modules, in the ZF sense, group concrete, often standalone, application parts: Modules allow a developer to group a set of related controllers into a logically organized group. The structure under the modules directory would resemble the structure under the application directory. [â€¦] The directory structure for modules should mimic that of the application/ directory in the recommended project structure A package on the other hand is a set of classes in a code library that conceptually belong together. For instance, ActionHelpers and ControllerPlugins conceptually belong to the Zend_Controller package. All available Validator classes belong to the package Zend_Validate . When using PHPDocumentor you can annotate your code to belong to packages. If you look at ZF's API Docs, you will see this grouping in effect. Try to find the Zend_Validate_Alpha class.
