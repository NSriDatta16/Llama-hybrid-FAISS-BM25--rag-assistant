Bayesian multilevel models are conceptually pleasing because the hierarchical structure of the parameters is built into the prior specification. Consider test score $y_{ij}$ for student $i$ who attends school $j$. We want to learn about the school-specific test score parameters $\theta_j$, so, because we want to use Bayesian methods, we will set a prior distribution for each $\theta_j$. However, this is going to be a multilevel model, so we want/expect school-specific parameters $\{\theta_j\}$ to be similar and/or want to share information across school. To model this, we assign the same prior to each school parameter and then put a prior on this hyperparameter. This gives $$ y_{ij} \mid \theta_j \sim \pi_1(\theta_j) \text{ for $i \in \text{school}_j$} \\ \theta_j \mid \phi \sim \pi_2(\phi) \\ \phi \sim \pi_3(), $$ where $\{\pi_1, \pi_2, \pi_3 \}$ are the relevant distributions. In the posterior for this prior specification and data likelihood, the overall parameter $\phi$ will be informed by each $\theta_j$, which are informed by the scores within each relevant school. So $\phi$ gives us a nice overall distribution to study. But $\theta_j$ is also informed by $\phi$ through the prior, so we are sharing information across schools to better inform us in cases where there is a small amount of data. All of this is done through the prior-posterior connection, so it's very natural in the Bayesian paradigm. Further, there is no limit on the depth of your prior specification. If schools are within districts which are within provinces which are within countries you could theoretically add three more levels to this prior specification. Every new level to the model corresponds to another prior being specified. In this sense multilevel models are very comfortable in Bayesian analyses. In terms of computational ease, if conjugate priors are chosen throughout it's possible to work out this multilevel model without doing anything more than Gibbs sampling in most cases.
