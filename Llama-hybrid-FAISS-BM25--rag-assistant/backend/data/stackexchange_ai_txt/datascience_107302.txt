Simple answers are, given that you have a dataset of some features, ask domain expert, which should cause what? Apply the IC* algorithm [1] which describes how to programmatically and statisically construct causal graph. However, the algorithm does not guarantee you an unique graph nor an unique and complete graph, and it depends on your dataset. Because the algorithm builds the model from your data, it can be wrong if your data has problems. Having said that, if all you need is a sufficiently useful model, then you may focus on a subset of your features, try the algorithm and incorporate some domain expert knowledge into the outcomes of your algorithm. This book [2] discussed another construction algorithm, which would also require some prior expert knowledge about your features to build a minimal model. I think there is no straight way to a perfectly right causal model. [1] Pearl, J. Causality: models, reasoning, and inference. Cambridge University Press. [2] Korb. K. & Nicholson, A. E.
