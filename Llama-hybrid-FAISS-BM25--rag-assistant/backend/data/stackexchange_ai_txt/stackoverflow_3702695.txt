Linux Installing Library (ICU) Question

I'm a relative noob to installing libraries. My system currently has an older version of the ICU library (3.8) and I want to go the latest (4.4). Following the steps in the ICU readme.html, everything goes fine (echo $? produces all 0 for every step). And I see the libary was installed to /usr/local/lib. However the current version of the library is is installed in /usr/lib. My questions. 1) Is there an "organzational" or some other significant difference between these two locations? 2) How can I change the install path for the new library to /usr/lib? 3) Is the library being in the wrong location the reason why when I run even the samples in the ICU directory, I get "error while loading shared libraries: libicui18n.so.44"? Thanks all.
