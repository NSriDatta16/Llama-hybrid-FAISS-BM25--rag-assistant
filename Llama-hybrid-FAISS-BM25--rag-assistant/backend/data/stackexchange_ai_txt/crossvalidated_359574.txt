How to find the "right" hyperparameters for the Gaussian process used Bayesian optimization

Suppose we are using Gaussian process as a surrogate model in Bayesian optimization.To compute the acquisition function using Gaussian process we need to know the right hyperparameter of the Gaussian process, for example, the length scale used in the kernel, noise in the kernel etc. One way to compute the hyperparameters would be to use MLE or MAP estimate using observed data. Is there any other known way to do this? Also, is there any prefered way?
