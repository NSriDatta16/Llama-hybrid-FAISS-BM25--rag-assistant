Here is my 2 cents, though I am by no means an expert on time-series. But you might be able to treat this as a missing data problem. So you have yearly GDP growth, but you would like quarterly estimates for the 1990-2012. So basically you have the quarterly estimates for 1990-2012 as missing values. You could create where $X$ are predictors for the growth rate and then $Y$ is the quarterly growth rate. You would break the 1990-2012 series into quarterly values and perhaps set the last quarter in the year equal to the actual value you got, while setting quarters 1-3 as missing. You would also have the quarterly data for 2013 forward in the same table, but now your quarterly data is not missing. X1 X2 X3 ... Y 1990Q1 NA 1990Q2 NA 1990Q3 NA 1990Q4 Yearly Value 1990 . . . 2013Q1 Quarterly value 2013Q2 Quarterly value . . . So then you could use something like the EM algorithm (Expectation-Maximization) algorithm to predict the missing values for the quarter growth rates $Y$ from the covariates $X$ . R has lots of packages for the EM algorithm, as well as Python etc. I am not sure how much variation you would get in the predicted quarterly rates versus the average rate for the year, but you might be able to detect some interesting variations. Of course, some of this depends upon the methods that are accepted within your discipline and stuff like that. And if anyone has a better idea--or correction to what I said--it would be interesting to hear. I have not done missing data problems in a few years.
