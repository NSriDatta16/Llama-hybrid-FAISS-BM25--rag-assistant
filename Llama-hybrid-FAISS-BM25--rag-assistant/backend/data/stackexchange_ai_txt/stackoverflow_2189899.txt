How to write a creator for dnd enabled dijit tree

I have a dijit tree that has dnd enabled via the dndController="dijit._tree.dndSource" option. Currently, when drag is initiated, the avatar content seems to be right aligned. The avatar is automatically picking the image and text content of item that is being dragged but I would like to have this information left aligned. I believe that writing a custom creator function for the tree is the solution, but can find no examples of the same. Could someone point me to an example where the avatar for dijit tree is customized using a creator function? Thanks, Fell
