How can I deal with overdispersion in a logistic (binomial) glm using R?

I'm running a logistic regression (presence/absence response) in R, using glmer (lme4 package). Ben Bolker's overdisp_fun (see link) tells me my model is overdispersed, so I decided to include an individual-level random effect. This is not solving my problem, as I get convergence issues and overdispersion is not reduced. Could anyone recommend an alternative?
