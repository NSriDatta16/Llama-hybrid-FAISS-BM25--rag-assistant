In Django, "applications" are components you develop or choose, then customize, mix and match together to get your final website. In Pylons, "application" refers to the whole thing you're creating--controllers, models, templates, middlewares, any helper modules, documentation etc. A Pylons application is a bunch of code that can be served as-is by Paster, Apache/mod_wsgi or any other WSGI-supporting web server. In Pylons, to get, for example, blog posts and random quotations in single page, you'd: Create separate models for representing and manipulating blog entries and quotes, like myapp.model.Post , myapp.model.Quotation . Create a controller action that queries models to get X blog posts and a single quotation, put them in data object that will be passed to template. Create a template that displays both blog posts and quotation on single page. This template can, of course, inherit from some base template or include template fragments, so you don't have to copy-paste common HTML code across many templates. Hope this helps!
