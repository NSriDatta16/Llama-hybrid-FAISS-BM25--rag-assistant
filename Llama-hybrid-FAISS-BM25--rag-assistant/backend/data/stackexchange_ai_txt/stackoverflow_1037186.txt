I would take a look at Scala. Why ? it's a JVM language, so you can leverage off your current Java skills it now has a lot of tooling/IDE support (e.g. Intellij will handle Scala projects) it has a functional aspect to it. Functional languages seem to be getting a lot of traction at the moment, and I think it's a paradigm worth learning for the future My (entirely subjective) view is that Scala seems to be getting a lot of the attention that Groovy got a year or two ago. I'm not trying to be contentious here, or suggest that makes it a better language, but it seems to be the new JVM language de jour . As an aside, a language that has some dynamic attributes is Microsoft's F# . I'm currently looking at this (and ignoring my own advice re. points 1 and 2 above!). It's a functional language with objects, built on .Net, and is picking up a lot of attention at the moment.
