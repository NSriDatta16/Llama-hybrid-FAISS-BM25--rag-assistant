How to classify an arbitrary chain of states(features)?

I'm trying to figure out how to build a classification model based on some states. I have an arbitrary number of states s1, s2, s3,...,sn that can lead to two outcomes a1, a2 (basically the labels of the classification) And I can have any number of states that can give a classification. For example: s1 -> a1 s1,s2 -> a1 s3 -> a2 s1,s3,s7 -> a2 s1,s3,s1,s7,s3 -> a1 I've read about Markov Chains but I don't understand if this would be a good solution or not because in the end I only need the probability of either reaching state a1 or a2
