One method to consider is Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), which measures similarity between time series. DTW is capable of comparing time series of different lengths, and the resulting score could be used to determine which series are most unique in your sample. You'll find in many articles that DTW works well with KNN classification (I personally can attest to having success with the combination) so you could write a script that calculates a DTW score, then finds the series score(s) which is furthest from the others.
