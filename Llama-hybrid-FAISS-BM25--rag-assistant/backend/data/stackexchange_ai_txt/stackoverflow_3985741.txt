This representation is the binary IEEE 754 floating point representation of the number, printed as an unsigned integer. The IEEE 754 Converter website tells us that the IEEE 754 single-precision representation of Pi (approximately 3.1415927) is 40490FDB hexadecimal, which is 1078530011 decimal (the number that you saw printed). The '%bu' format specifier works similarly but outputs the double-precision representation. The purpose of these format specifiers is to allow you to store a bit-exact representation of a floating-point value to a text file. The alternative approach of printing the floating-point value in human-readable form requires a lot of care if you want to guarantee bit-exact storage, and there might be some edge cases (denormalized values...?) that you won't be able to store precisely at all.
