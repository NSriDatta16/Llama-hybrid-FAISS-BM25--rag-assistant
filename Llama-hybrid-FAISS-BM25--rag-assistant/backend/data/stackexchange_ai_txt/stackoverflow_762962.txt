So I went and embedded a font of my own and it truncates nicely without any particular issue. I'm not sure how you are embedding your font but this method worked for me. If you are doing something completely different then please specify in your post. // Cannot name the font as one that already exists! [Embed(source="Anonymous.ttf", fontFamily="myAnon")] private var fontA : Class; [Embed(source="HGRSGU.TTC", fontFamily="myFont")] private var fontB : Class; //...I have some code here that switches the font var obj : Object = truncateMe.getStyle("fontFamily"); if (obj == "myAnon") truncateMe.setStyle("fontFamily", "myFont"); else truncateMe.setStyle("fontFamily", "myAnon");
