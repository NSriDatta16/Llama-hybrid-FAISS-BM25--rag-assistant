How about a logistic regression, where you predict the categorical based on the numerical columns. You can also do this regression for subsets, find the R^2 / explanatory value for each subset, to see which numerical values are useful. For nonlinear relationships, doing the same thing with a random forest, or even just a single decision tree, can be very effective.
