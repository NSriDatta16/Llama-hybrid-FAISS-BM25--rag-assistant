Use composition: include a usual Queue as a field in your SpecialQueue . Private inheritance is actually something very similar to composition. See http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/private-inheritance.html#faq-24.3 for discussion. Implementation could be something like that: public class SpecialQueue { private int capacity; private Queue storage; public SpecialQueue(int capacity) { this.capacity = capacity; storage = new Queue (); // if (capacity You need to add more functions/interfaces if you want SpecialQueue to support them. I would however not recommend to implement IEnumerable , because this would allow Peek (which you want to prohibit).
