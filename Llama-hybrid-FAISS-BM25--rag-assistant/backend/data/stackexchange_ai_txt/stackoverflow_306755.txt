Frogger for iPhone

Most of my programming experience has either been using forms (Windows Forms, or ASP.NET) or small embedded projects interfacing hardware. Recently I began going through some tutorials for iPhone development. I'm interested in learning Objective-C and the iPhone sdk. I wanted to make a small frogger-like game to help me learn but I've never really ventured into game development. I would have four buttons (Up, Down, Left, Right) and was curious how to go about the navigation. Would it be smart to make a big grid (matrix) and use that to navigate around the screen? Eventually it'd be nice to use OpenGL but I'm nowhere ready to go into that area yet. Thanks for any input.
