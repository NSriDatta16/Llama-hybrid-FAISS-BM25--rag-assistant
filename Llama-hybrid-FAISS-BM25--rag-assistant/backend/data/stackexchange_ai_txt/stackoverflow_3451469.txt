I think Peol is generally correct. The only way to simulate the behavior of the Telerik RadControls in this case is to manually track and persist changes to your Panel layout. Specifically, for panels you'll probably want to: Handle the dragStop event In that event, get the current position/size/offset information for the current panel Persist the new location - either locally in a Hidden Input or via a Web Service If you persist locally in a hidden field, you can then persist long term on the next page POST or via single service call when (for example) the user clicks a "Save" button. The Telerik RadDock simplifies the process by serializing its state to XML, which makes it easy to save and load, but I don't think the jQuery panels provide the same functionality. Maybe this will be added to the Telerik Extensions for MVC in the future...
