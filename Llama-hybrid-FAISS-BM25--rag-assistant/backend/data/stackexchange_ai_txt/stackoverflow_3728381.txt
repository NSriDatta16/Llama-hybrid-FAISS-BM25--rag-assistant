ckEditor: no p and no br

I want to allow basic , and lists with ckeditor. However I want NO and no paragraph tags, as I nlb2 my content and I want it to be essentially naked. Via google I found that I could do: $(function() { $('#description').ckeditor({ enterMode : CKEDITOR.ENTER_BR, shiftEnterMode: CKEDITOR.ENTER_P, toolbar:[['Bold', 'Italic', '-', 'BulletedList', '-', 'Link', 'Unlink'], ['UIColor']] }); However, that still ends up with paragraph tags in it. So a bit of searching and I found this: http://docs.cksource.com/CKEditor_3.x/Developers_Guide/Output_Formatting However I have no idea how to implement that into my jQuery call. Any help greatly appreciated
