I've learned this one the hard way - by essentially being a facilitator for him because I knew him for a long time. Never again! You've got three choices (well, really infinite ones but three that seem like possible positive routes to me): Document all the stuff he does wrong, incidents where he's shown his incompetence and how he's been an anchor to the team. Confront him with this information and explain to him that he can either gracefully ask to be reassigned or you are going to his boss. You won't earn any points with him, but do you care? If his boss goes to bat for him, be prepared to walk . I like this one because it allows him to save face. We don't tend to do a lot of this these days. Ask to be transferred to another group within the organization. You can be completely honest as to why. Be prepared to walk . If you are truly an asset to the company, you can leverage this for a new position outside this dillweed's control. Walk . This is what I ultimately ended up doing once it was clear that my PM wasn't going to do anything whatsoever to fix the problem. He was essentially as incompetent as my immediate supervisor. In the end, I'm glad they were incompetent because they forced my hand and I have found GREAT job as a result. As I see it, you've got three choices: get rid of the guy, get out of his group, get out of the company. There's no reason a talented dev can't get a better job than s/he's in. There are too many of them out there just crying out for talented programers. All the best!
