Non-greedy decision tree / random forest implementation(s) in Python

The standard random forest is trained using a greedy approach for computational feasibility. However, there are a number of alternative methods such as " lookahead " or using bilevel optimization . Such approaches seem to be useful especially in the case of noisy data. I wonder if there are "off the shelf" Python implementations (e.g. pip packages) of non-greedy ways to grow decision trees/random forests. Can anyone recommend some Python implementations. Or alternatively, are there some known Python implementations e.g. on Github etc.?
