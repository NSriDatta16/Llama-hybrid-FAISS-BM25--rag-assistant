Algorithms to find average distance between data maxima

I'm having trouble figuring out a way to analyze some simple data. When graphed, the data I have make a somewhat sinusoidal curve. What I want to do is to find the x-values of the maximum peaks of the sinusoidal curve. I then want to subtract each of these x-values from the last peak found and average these differences to obtain an average distance between peaks. Is there an easy way to do this with Excel, Mathematica, or MatLab (the programs I have available to me?). Thanks in advance!!!
