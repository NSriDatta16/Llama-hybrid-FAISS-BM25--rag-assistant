How to disable a part of concept check for boost::wave?

I know that there is a problem in boost such that concept check will not pass for boost::wave. However I want as thorough a concept check as possible. Is there any way to JUST turn off concept check for boost::wave, but keep everything else? i.e. is there a macro like one would use with /#pragma pop_macro("MACRO") ?
