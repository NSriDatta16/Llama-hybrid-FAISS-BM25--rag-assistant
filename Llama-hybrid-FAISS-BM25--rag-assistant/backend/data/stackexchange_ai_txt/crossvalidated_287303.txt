An estimator is consistent if an estimate for parameter of interest θ, θ* approaches the true parameter θ 0 as the sample size increases. The property is often refereed to as asymptotic consistency. You can look it up on wiki or any intro to stats book. Heuristically, it is obvious that one wants to choose a loss function that will estimate the true θ 0 , at least when the sample size is large. There is a lot to be said about proper model structure in addition to loss function and their influence of consistency and efficiency. If you want to learn about the related information theory , i'd recommend: Burnham & Anderson. "Model Selection and Multimodel Inference: A Practical Information-Theoretic Approach". And any linear model book will tell you about the properties of OLS and associated estimators; including SVM. That's my best simple interpretation of your question. best of luck.
