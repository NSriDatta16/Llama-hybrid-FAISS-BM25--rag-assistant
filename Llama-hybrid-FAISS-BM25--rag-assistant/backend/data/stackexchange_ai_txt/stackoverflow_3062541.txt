Are you using any AJAX? I'd guess that you're experiencing the Single Origin Policy, which limits you to AJAX requests on the same domain - so if you have domain1.com and domain2.com, and are pulling in AJAX from domain1.com on both then it will fail on domain2.com. Having the same site accessible on multiple domains is discouraged, as it's bad for SEO (although there are ways around this, such as canonical meta tags). Instead, redirect domain2.com to domain1.com
