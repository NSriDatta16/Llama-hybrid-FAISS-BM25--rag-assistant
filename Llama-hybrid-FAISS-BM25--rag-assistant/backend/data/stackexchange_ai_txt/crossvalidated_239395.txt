Beta regressions are used for continuous proportions (like the proportion of land with a particular soil type). For count proportions, the most common models would be binomial regression models, a particular type of generalized linear model (GLM). Of those, logistic regression is the most widely used though there's a number of other link functions that are used. The estimated fit is automatically constrained to lie within the bounds. It doesn't transform the response; it relies on fitting a function that stays inside the limits. [Numerous questions on site discuss logistic regression. A few discuss other models - probit regression and complementary log-log regression, for example]
