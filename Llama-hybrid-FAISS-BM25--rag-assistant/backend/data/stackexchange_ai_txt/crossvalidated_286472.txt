Within- and between-subjects design (MANOVA), but not for all subjects

I have carried out a behavioural task on two groups of participants: a patient group and a healthy control group. The patient group was tested in two separate sessions, to include the effects of medication (on or off). I'd like to carry out a Bayesian ANOVA on this data to jointly assess the within-subject effect of medication (on vs off) and the across-subject effect of disease (patients vs controls). A new Bayesian ANOVA (BANOVA) package exists in R but from my knowledge it seems that I can't include the within- and across-subject data in the same model, since some participants (the healthy controls) only contribute to the across-subject factor. Does anybody have any ideas on how I might test this?
