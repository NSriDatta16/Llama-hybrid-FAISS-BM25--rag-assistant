Whatever you do, for God's sake, don't even think about using the Maven VIRUS for this. Exception: If you hate yourself, and enjoy inflicting needless pain on yourself and others because you get some kind of sick pleasure out of it--then, you should use Maven. If you also prefer to bleed internally while you work, throw in Ivy. Eclipse generation IS a good idea (and probably ideal for the end users), but realistically to prevent this turning into such a large project, just go with the simple solution: create a template and use some simple method of customizing it. Just use a find/replace or a simple Python script if really needed. It's hard enough coming up with a complete, solid, re-usable template as it is (a project in itself). Let an Eclipse plug-in or other more automated version come later after you have a better idea of how much work this is. The find/replace or script method isn't "fragile" since your template is going to be small and written by a single author, not some massive production application with who knows what inside of it. More complex solutions are the ones which tend to really become fragile, not the simple ones. I think this is a fantastic idea so don't let anyone tell you otherwise, I create templates like this too.
