How to Drag and Drop DataGrid column header?

I am working with WPF DataGrid. I have to drag the Column Header, drop it to some other control(say Label) and do some operation. But i am not able to achieve drag and drop of DataGrid Column Header. I have tried with ColumnHeaderDragStarted event, but I am not able to find Column Header object or just the Name of header in the handler. Any help plz!!
