R package nnet - neural network question

I am experimenting with neural network package in R nnet and i have some questions. The regulatory environment i am working on requires me to reproduce my results to show them to the auditors. How can i reproduce my model results after few months/years ? Can i use a seed value to control the model output ? How can i validate a neural network model ? are there any goodness of fit tests ? How do i choose the number of hidden layers i need ? I have 18500 observations in my training dataset and 8 variables. Does that help in identifying hidden layers required in anyway? Many times the model stops after 100 iterations. I have used maxiter option but sometimes you see the output and it says converged and sometimes it says stopped after 100 iterations. When it says stopped after 100 iterations does that mean i have a bad model ? and it did not converge ? Thank you
