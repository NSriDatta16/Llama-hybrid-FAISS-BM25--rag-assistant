How to know the dragging element is over which element?

I have a problem with jQuery Drag&Drop. I have a draggable element and lots of dropTarget so I just want to know when I am dragging, my dragging element is over which element? Btw, Firefox provides event.originalTarget that points an DOM Element but it is equal to "undefined" in Google Chrome. Any suggestion? Thanks.
