Can Principal Component analyses be applied to a counting trait?

I am analyzing a segregating population of plants coming from an hybridization process. The experiment consists in several field plots (according to an augmented design). In each plot a segregating population coming from an hybrid plant was seeded. Therefore, the plants into each plot are segregating. I defined several traits corresponding to morphological characteristics of the plant (eg. leaves colour, flower colour, ...). The plants in each plots are segregating. Therefore the shows different characteristics for each of those morphological traits (eg. red or green leaves) and I counted the number of plants in each plot for each of those classes. Therefore I may express the data in my data-set as 'number of plants' or as percentage of e.g green/red plants on the total number of plants in each plots. Since the genetic background of the original hybrids is not known, I would like to run a PCA and a cluster analysis in order to see which populations cluster together according to those traits. Can PCA be applied to such a data-set? Which package can be used for running such an analysis in R?
