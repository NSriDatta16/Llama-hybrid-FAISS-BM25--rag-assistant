What you're asking is probably doable with Interface Builder (or not, I don't know) but I know the code way to do it. To change the height of the table all you do is set the frame of the UITableView object. The default height of a UITableViewCell is 44 I believe, so set it to multiples of that depending on how many cells you have. Of course your cells can be any height so you will need to keep track of what you report in heightForRowAtIndexPath and set the table frame accordingly. UITableView will certainly live in a UIScrollView and both components can scroll. The table view needs to become a subview of the scroll view, so does the image. Then you will scroll the table if you drag on it directly or scroll the scroll view if you drag the image or the scroll view.
