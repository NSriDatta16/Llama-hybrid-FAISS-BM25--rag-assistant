SQL Reporting Services 2005 - How to get current date as a ReportParameter

I have some working reports that must be deployed on SSRS. One more customization that I want to be added is to automatically select the FromDate as today - 1 month, and ToDate as today. Specifically, I want to replace the fragment bellow with a piece that accomplish the requirements above: String [Date].&amp;[2008-09-26T00:00:00] From Date FromDate2 ParameterValue ParameterCaption String To Date ToDate ParameterValue ParameterCaption Thanks in advance.
