Can I refer to NSDictionary items numerically?

I'm trying to set up a UITableView which acts as a form. Each cell has within it a UILabel and a UITextField, so one cell is: Name ^ ^ UILabel UITextField Now, I'm trying to populate the UILabel and the UITextField from a NSDictionary (from a plist), where it's organized like so: Root Type Value Name String Address String City String etc But in order to get the right labels and textfields in the cellForRowAtIndexPath method, I would have to refer to the Dictionary numerically. Is there any way to do that?
