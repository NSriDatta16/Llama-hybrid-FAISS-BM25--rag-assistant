It looks like XHTML + JavaScript could be enough for the dragging & dropping functionality you describe. This means you can use just about any web framework of your choice. If you need frequent asynchronous server calls (AJAX) then GWT is the most standard Java framework I think, although it has its peculiarities. Personally I like Wicket because it does not use XML configurations, relies heavily on code and has a nice community around it. Wicket also offers good AJAX support btw.
