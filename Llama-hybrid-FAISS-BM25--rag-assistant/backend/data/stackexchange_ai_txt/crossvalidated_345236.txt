Define cluster separation. Let's say the average distance of points in a cluster is $a$, and the average distance of points in different clusters in $b$ with $a\ll b$. Then a random projection with the Johnson-Lindenstrauss properties should preserve this difference with high probability, shouldn't it? Most distance-based definitions of cluster separation should be fine. You probably can even use minimum between two clusters and maximum inside a cluster.
