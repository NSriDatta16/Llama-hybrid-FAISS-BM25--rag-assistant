Checks for whether or not a client supports SSL will be subject to Man-in-the-Middle attacks where an active network attacker gains control of the user's connection and makes it appear as if the client doesn't support SSL. This question is most often asked when developing mobile sites targeted at older phones that may not support real SSL (they support WAP-TLS). The number of phones in this category continues to shrink and my suggestion is to ignore them, maybe even going so far as to blacklist their user agents.
