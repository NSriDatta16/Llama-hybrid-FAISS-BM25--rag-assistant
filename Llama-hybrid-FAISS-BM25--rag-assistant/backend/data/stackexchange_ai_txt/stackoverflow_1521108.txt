It completely depends on the external variables of the system. For instance: Are you running on an embedded device whose only external storage is a 1MB SD card, or do you have full access to a 1TB hard drive? Are you logging each time you enter/exit a function, or are you only logging one or two caught exceptions throughout the whole system? Is the purpose of these logs to be sent back to the developer for support? A 1kb log file isn't going to help you much, but you probably don't need 200MB of logs for a single support issue. Without these kinds of details, there is no good answer to your question (and there might not be a good answer even with these details).
