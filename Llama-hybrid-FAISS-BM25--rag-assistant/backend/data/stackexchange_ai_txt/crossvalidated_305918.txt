Post analysis of conditional logistic regression

I have a conditional logistic regression model with significant sample size (well into five figures of groups and six figures worth of observations) and, overall, excellent outcomes in predicting future events. However, every once in a while, the forecast is way off. What are some strategies, techniques or approaches used to dive deep into these models after the fact? In other words, in knowing the subject matter I can say to myself, "Something isn't captured here, the model is way off." But, trying to "reverse engineer" the model and its output... I'm struggling with that. I'm an "amateur" and purely a hobbyist when it comes to statistics. For the most part, everything is self taught with the exception of basic stuff learned in college. So I apologize if this sounds ridiculous!
