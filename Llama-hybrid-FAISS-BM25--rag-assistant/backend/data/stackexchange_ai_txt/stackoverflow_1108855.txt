I would abstract the data access layer and then mock it. With mocking you will be able to increase the code coverage of your tests. It will also prevent the idea of ' Test Cancer ' that will happen by doing expensive calls to network/filesystem/database because people will stop running them. You should have a few tests that call to the database but they should be limited as much as possible.
