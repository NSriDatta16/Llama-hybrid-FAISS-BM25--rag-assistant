What is the most simple implementation of IDynamicMetaObjectProvider?

I have this scenario... 1.- I'm providing a "Dynamic Table" for wich users can define Fields. Each Dynamic Table will have as many rows/records as needed, but the Field definitions are centralized. 2.- My Dynamic Row/Record class was inherited from the .NET DLR DynamicObject class, and the underlying storage was a List appropriately associated to the defining fields. Everything works fine! BUT... 3.- Because I need to Serialize the content, and DynamicObject is not Serializable, I was forced to generate and carry a Dynamic Object when dynamic member access is required. But this is ugly and redundant. So, I need to implement IDynamicMetaObjectProvider myself to achieve dynamic access and serialization together. After googling/binging unsuccessfully I ask for your help... Can anybody please give a good example (or related link) for doing that?
