If you have the following buffer: buffer[10] = {5, 1, 0, 1, 75, 126, 162, 205, 80, 00}; And you want it in C/C++. I would define a struct, like this: #pragma pack(1) struct buffer_s { uint8_t version; uint8_t reserve_1; uint8_t atype; uint32_t ip; uint16_t port; }; #pragma pack() Then put it in a union: union buffer_u { char buffer[10]; struct buffer_s data; }; Now you can declare union buffer_u buf and read bytes into buf.buffer. Then for the ip and port fields use ntohl and ntohs to convert network byte order to host byte order.
