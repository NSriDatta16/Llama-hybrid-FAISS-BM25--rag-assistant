How to take advantage of historic data while doing churn prediction?

The problem: Predict customers who will downgrade their bank account category 2 months in advance. The data: 100's monthly variables for each customer for the last year. At first, I thought I could take this as a times series problem, but I found it's usually better to take it as a classification model. I can see, for each month, who will be gone by period n+2 and use that to train a logistic regression, or a boosted tree model. What I don't know is how to use that data. I guess I could create multiple models for each month and add a "stays - leave", then weight the results in my final model. What other good options are there to take advantage of the historic data? Thanks!
