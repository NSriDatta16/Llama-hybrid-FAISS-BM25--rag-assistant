do autoencoders work well for non images?

I have a classification problem for which a feedforward, fully connected neural net works reasonably well (two classes, true positive and true negative rate close to 80%). I want to get these rates to 90%, and more features is one of the catalysts for improvements I can think of. Do autoencoders to learn additional, interesting features work well for problems that do not involve images?
