Sidebar gadget with embedded media player disappearing on WIN+D ("Show Desktop")

I'm embedding windows media player in a windows sidebar gadget. As soon as I start the player (even if i stop it after doing so), hitting WIN+D ("Show Desktop") hides my gadget (all other gadgets stay visible). What's causing this issue and is there a way to fix this annoying behaviour? The problem occurs both with a media player embedded in the HTML and with one created with new ActiveXObject(...) .
