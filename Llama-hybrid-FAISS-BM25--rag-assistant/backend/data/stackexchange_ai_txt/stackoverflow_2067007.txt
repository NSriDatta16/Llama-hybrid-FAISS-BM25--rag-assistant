But what increases the system columns? building statistics? SQL Server maintains statistics on an index (it's controlled by an option called "Auto Update Statistics", by default it's enabled.) Also, sometimes an index grows or is reorganized on disk. Those things come in under System Activity. Is there anything that depends on the user or role(s) of a user that's running the query? You could look into using SQL Server Profiler to gather data about which users use which indexes. It allows you to save traces as a table . If you can include index usage in the trace, you could correlate it with users. I'm sure the "showplan" would include it, but that's rather coarse. This article describes a way to collect a trace, run it through the index tuning wizard, and analyze the result.
