continuous x categorical interaction (repeated measures), no interaction but simple slope analysis shows interaction

My model is a 2-level repeated within-subject factor (Repeated), a between-subject factor (Condition) and a covariate (Difference). When I ran a Bayesian RM ANCOVA in JASP all seems to make sense, except for that there was strong evidence against the interaction between Difference (continuous) and Repeated (categorical: Repeated 1 & Repeated 2). The thing is when I plot the data I could see there's difference between the two lines. So I ran two separate Bayesian linear regressions to double-check. And indeed: There's no effect of Difference on Repeated 1. But there's an effect of Difference on Repeated 2. My question is then: why did I find that there's no evidence for the interaction between Difference and Repeated in the RM ANCOVA? Which result should I trust? Thanks a lot in advance for your help!
