The magical Xcode Organizer isn't that magical about symbolicating my app. I got no symbols at all for the crash reports that I got back from Apple from a failed app submission. I tried using the command-line, putting the crash report in the same folder as the .app file (that I submitted to the store) and the .dSYM file: $ symbolicatecrash "My App_date_blahblah-iPhone.crash" "My App.app" This only provided symbols for my app and not the core foundation code, but it was better than the number dump that Organizer is giving me and was enough for me to find and fix the crash that my app had. If anyone knows how to extend this to get Foundation symbols it would be appreciated.
