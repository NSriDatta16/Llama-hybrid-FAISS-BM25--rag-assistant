They do not mean the same thing. One is an instance variable, the other is a method. The @foo means "the value of the instance variable foo", where as self.foo means "the value of a call to the method foo on myself". It is typical for a method foo= to set the @foo instance variable, so I can see how someone new to the language might be confused. I'd encourage you to pick up a book on the ruby language. There's one specifically for people who have done some rails but never learned ruby proper. You often can hack rails without understanding the language or what these statements mean, but you'll be far less productive than someone who spends the small amount of time it takes to learn the ruby language itself. As a general rule, use the self.foo form whenever you can, as this is less sensitive to changes in the classes definition.
