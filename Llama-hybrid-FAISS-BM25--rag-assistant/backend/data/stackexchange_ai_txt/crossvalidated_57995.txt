summary: If you can get the number of widgets for each factory then you can just use the counts to do what you want, if you are stuck with the binned data you are probably out of luck. Details below. The bins (10,000 to 20,000 and 20,000 to 40,000) are different widths which is going to make any sort of comparison or prediction very hard since you have will have to make some assumption about how the data are distributed within each bin. It seems like if you know how many factories are in each bin then you (or someone) must know how many widgets each factory produces otherwise how are you getting the numbers to put in each bin. If you have that data you could just use simple counts to answer the sort of questions you wanted, especially since then all widget production is covered, so you don't even have to worry about sample error. Assuming that information is hidden from you as I said you would have make some assumptions about how factories are distributed within bins, if you assume they are evenly distributed then you could estimate how many factories would be greater or less than any specified number of widgets by just multiplying the number of factories by the proportion of the bin above (or below) the specified number of widgets. But this assumption will probably not work very well since your bins are wide relative to the total maximum number of widgets, and the break point is near the centre (to see why this is problem imagine a normal distribution, imagine splitting it into two bins with the break point in the middle, the two bins will be the same height, i.e. they will hide the fact that most factories widget production is near average).
