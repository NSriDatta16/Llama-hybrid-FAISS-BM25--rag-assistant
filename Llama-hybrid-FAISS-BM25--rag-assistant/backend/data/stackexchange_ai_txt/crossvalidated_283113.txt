In what situations would one use Approximate Bayesian Computation instead of Bayesian inference?

I'm not sure why one would use ABC/Likelihood-free inference methods instead of standard Bayesian inference methods. Is this fundamentally a conceptual problem of mine? Are there any concrete examples which could elaborate on when to use the former as opposed to straightforward Bayesian inference?
