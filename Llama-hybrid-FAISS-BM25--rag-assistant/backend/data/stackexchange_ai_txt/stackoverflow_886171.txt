I haven't looked at dns.resolver as of yet - I just added it to the ever-growing list of things to check out. I would guess that rdata refers to the resource record type specific data as described in Section 4.1.3 of RFC1035 . The response of a DNS request contains three data sections in addition to the query and headers: Answers Authoritative Name Server records Additional Resource records From the looks of it dns.resolver.query() is returning the first section. In this case, each resource record in the answer section is going to have different attributes based on the record type. In this case, you asked for MX records so the records should have exactly the attributes that you have - exchange and preference . These are described in Section 3.3.9 of RFC1035 . I suspect that dns.resolver is overriding __getattr__ or something similar to perform the magic that you are seeing so you won't see the fields directly in a dir() . Chances are that you are safe using the attributes as defined in RFC1035. I will definitely have to check this out tomorrow since I have need of a decent DNS subsystem for Python. Thanks for mentioning this module and have fun with DNS. It is really pretty interesting stuff if you really dig into how it works. I still think that it is one of the earlier expressions of that ReSTful thing that is all the rage these days ;)
