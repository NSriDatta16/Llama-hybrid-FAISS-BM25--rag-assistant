ACME Significant in Mediation analysis, but not Proportion Mediated and Fitting terminated with step failure warning

I am running a series of mediation analyses in r using the mediation package and the following code: m_1 I receive the following results: summary(results1) summary(results2) summary(results3) Causal Mediation Analysis Nonparametric Bootstrap Confidence Intervals with the Percentile Method Estimate 95% CI Lower 95% CI Upper p-value ACME -0.000691 -0.001773 0.00 0.038 * ADE -0.002030 -0.003628 0.00 0.232 Total Effect -0.002721 -0.004609 0.00 0.176 Prop.

Mediated 0.109084 -1.115058 1.36 0.53 Sample Size Used: 3230 Simulations: 1000 I am hoping to compare these different models and compare the mediation effects of each mediator. In regression one, I get a significant effect for the ACME, and 25% mediated, much more than the other two mediators. However, that proportion mediated is not significant, nor are the other models' ACMEs. I know that other posts have explained how Indirect effects can be signfiicant while the Direct effect is insignificant, but I have not seen this scenario. How can a significant ACME be found but the proportion mediated is not? Can my results be trusted at all or can the effect not be concluded? Furthermore, can I make a legitimate comparison of the different mediators? Can I say that the mediator in model 1 has a stronger mediation effect than the other models, based on the higher proportion mediated. Is this all caused by a power issue? Is it something to do with the number of iterations in the MCMC? Additionally: For the final model, I also receive the following warning: Running nonparametric bootstrap Warning: Fitting terminated with step failure - check results carefully What do I infer from this warning? Can my results be trusted, or how can I check this?
