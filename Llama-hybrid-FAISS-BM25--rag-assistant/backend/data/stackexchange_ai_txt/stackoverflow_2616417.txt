How can I work with paragraphs in Wordpress?

Wordpress has a filter that automatically add paragraphs to posts. I can remove this by adding the followin code: // Remove the tags which WP automatically inserts in psots. remove_filter ('the_content', 'wpautop'); The problem is that i removes tags as well. So I'm not removing this filter at the moment. My problem is that inside a DIV box, I get extra space above and below the text (at the start / end of text). I could manipulate the tag in css, but again, that will affect all tags throughout the post content. Any suggestions to what I should do?
