The variables in your data set are correlated the way they are correlated, regardless of whether you do PCA or not. If you want to see if A and B are correlated, then you ask your software to print the correlation for those two variables. The goal of PCA is dimension reduction. The components are each linear combinations of the variables. If you want the original variables, use them.
