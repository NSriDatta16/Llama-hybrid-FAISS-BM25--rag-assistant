Developing WPF app - any way to optimize .NET install?

I'd love to use WPF for a consumer app. However, some real world tests are not very encouraging. On several high-end computers I've tested, the .NET 3.5 installation has taken 15-20 mins to complete. I've seen reports online mentioning 50 mins. When Vista marketshare is at 70%, this subject will be moot. Until then, reality is that the majority of consumers are on XP and will need a .NET 3.5 install. Adding 15-20 mins (at best) to the install of a consumer app is simply unacceptable. 1) What the frack is the .NET installer taking so long for? 2) Is there any way to optimize the .NET install? Oh, and I know about the .NET Client Profile. Doesn't improve the situation much.
