The training data consists of fMRI images recorded while the subjects were looking at a set of natural scenes and the objective is to train a model to regenerate the natural scene from the fMRI images. The images also have some text annotations (an average of 5 per image). The study uses the fMRI images from four subjects. The fMRI images are used in two ways. Firstly, fMRI data for the early visual cortex is used to predict a latent representation of the image. Secondly, fMRI data for the higher (ventral) visual cortex is used to predict latent text representations. Then these latent representations are combined and decoded to generate the reconstructed image.
