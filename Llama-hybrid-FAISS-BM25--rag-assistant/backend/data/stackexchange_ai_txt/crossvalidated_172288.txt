Since you're using R, you could make use of some elaborated methods like ROSE and SMOTE . But I'm not enrirely certain if re-balancing your dataset is the right solution in your case. An alternative could be a cost-sensitive algorithm like C5.0 that doesn't need balanced data. You could also think about applying Markov chains to your problem.
