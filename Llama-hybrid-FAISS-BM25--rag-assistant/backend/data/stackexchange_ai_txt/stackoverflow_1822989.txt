What version of Java is realistic to expect on a client/browser?

I'm planning to develop an applet-based application that will be used by "average Jill" non-technical users (classical musicians, to be precise). What version of Java can I realistically expect those users to have installed in their browsers? Is 1.5 safe? I know Microsoft hasn't bundled Java with Windows in years, but do most OEM Windows machines have it? What about Macs? I realize if I use the standard deployment techniques it can prompt the user to install Java if they don't have it or their version is too old for my code, but I'd still like to have a sense of what features I can realistically code for without most users having to install anything. Thanks, Edit: one other thing not covered by the earlier question: how common is it for Windows users not to have Java at all in this day and age?
