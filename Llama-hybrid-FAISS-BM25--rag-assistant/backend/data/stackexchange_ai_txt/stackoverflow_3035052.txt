Festival TTS showing SIOD:ran out off storage message

i am designing a front end for Festival TTS using it's C++ API Everything is working fine in my programme but i have a problem that i am giving a drop down option to user to select other languages when user select a language from drop down then festival tts shows a message on console saying: SIOD:ran out of storage This message only shows if the text given to festival TTS is greater then 5 or 6 lines. i think this message comes because SIOD's heap is not free when i am going to call a new language. So please tell me the solution of this problem. Thanks
