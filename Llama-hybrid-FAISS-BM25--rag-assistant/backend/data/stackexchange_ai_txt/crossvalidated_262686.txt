Distinguishing between two groups in statistics and machine learning: hypothesis test vs. classification vs. clustering

Assume I have two data groups, labeled A and B (each containing e.g. 200 samples and 1 feature), and I want to know if they are different. I could: a) perform a statistical test (e.g. t-test) to see if they are statistically different. b) use supervised machine learning (e.g. support vector classifier or random forest classifier). I can train this on a part of my data and verify it on the rest. If the machine learning algorithm classifies the rest correctly afterwards, I can be sure that the samples are differentiable. c) use an unsupervised algorithm (e.g. K-Means) and let it divide all data into two samples. I can then check if these two found samples agree with my labels, A and B. My questions are: How are these three different ways overlapping/exclusive? Are b) and c) useful for any scientific arguments? How could I get a “significance“ for the difference between samples A and B out of methods b) and c)? What would change if the data had multiple features rather than 1 feature? What happens if they contain a different number of samples, e.g. 100 vs 300?
