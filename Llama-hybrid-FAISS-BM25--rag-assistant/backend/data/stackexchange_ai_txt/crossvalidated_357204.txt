I scored 181 on a test where the average score is 40 and the standard deviation is 16.7. Is it possible to find from these numbers that, for example, my score is in the top .005%? Without more information, no. If you assume a distribution then you can find the quantiles. Without such an assumption you can obtain a bound: For example the one-sided equivalent of the Chebyshev bound may be written $P(X-\mu\geq a) \leq \frac{\sigma^2}{\sigma^2+a^2}$ or equivalently $P((X-\mu)/\sigma \geq k) \leq \frac{1}{1+k^2}$ So for your values, you must have no more than $ 1/(1+(141/16.7)^2)$ of the distribution greater than or equal to your score ... but that's 0.0138339, a fair bit larger than 0.005. It's also possible that the distribution is such that none of the distribution is up that far (i.e. it could be as low as 0). If you add additional information the bounds may come in somewhat, though often the additional information has less impact than you might expect. e.g. adding higher moments doesn't do as much as people tend to imagine they would, and even assuming symmetry doesn't halve the one-sided bound. Stronger assumptions (like symmetric, continuous unimodal; pretty strong assumptions that I wouldn't expect to be true) would bring it down below the value you mentioned I think.
