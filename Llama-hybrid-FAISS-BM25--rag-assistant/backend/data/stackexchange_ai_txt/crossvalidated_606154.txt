One approach is to cluster the spatio-temporal data, and then learn models for the entire cluster, using all of the data from the cluster. This is described in Bayesian Dynamic Modeling: Sharing Information Across Time and Space . Another approach would be to use a model trained on all the dataset (likely with self-supervised techniques), to output a representation of the input time-series. Then learn smaller individual models on this shared representation. There are many options for both representation model and anomaly detection model, an illustrative example could be SMATE: Semi-Supervised Spatio-Temporal Representation Learning on Multivariate Time Series , and then using something like Gaussian Mixture Model or Isolation Forest on the embedding vector for the anomaly detector. There is however not any guarantee that this will be faster than making individual models, as it is the same amount of data to be processed. But in practice there might be batching benefits, or it becomes possible to sub-samples the data in the clusters.
