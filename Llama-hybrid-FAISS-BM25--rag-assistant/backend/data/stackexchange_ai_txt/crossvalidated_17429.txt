Yes. A p-value depends on the sample size, so a small sample can give this. Say the true effect size was very small, and you draw a small sample. By luck, you get a few data points with very high correlation. The p-value will be high, as it should be. The correlation is high but it's not a very dependable result. The sample correlation from R's cor() will tell you the best estimate of the correlation (given the sample). The p-value does NOT measure the strength of correlation. It measures how likely it could have arisen in case there actually was no effect, considering the size of the sample. Another way to see this: If you have the same effect size, but get more samples, the p-value always goes to zero. (If you want to more closely integrate the notions of estimated effect size and confidence about the estimate, it may be better to use confidence intervals; or, use Bayesian techniques.)
