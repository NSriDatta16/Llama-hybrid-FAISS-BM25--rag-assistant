Why is Chrome cutting off text in my CSS3 multi-column layout?

I am using CSS multi-column layout to display text. The layout displays correctly in Firefox. Chrome, however, has a bug that cuts/clips off the tops and bottoms of text characters . Why is this happening? How can I make it work in Chrome? Here is a screenshot of the problem: .multicolumn { max-width: 25em; columns: 3; margin: 0; font: 1.2em/.9 sans-serif; } .multicolumn p { margin: 0; } hydrolytically hypabyssally hypogyny hyponymy mystifyingly karyotypically bathymetrically cloyingly Finally, here is the webpage where I'm trying to get this to work: http://www.vcn.bc.ca/~dugan/css3/newhtml.html
