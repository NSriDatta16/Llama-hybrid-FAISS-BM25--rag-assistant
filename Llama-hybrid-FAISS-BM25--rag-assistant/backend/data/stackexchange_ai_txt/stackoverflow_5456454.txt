The rule is pretty simple: for each alloc/init , copy or retain you must call exactly one release or autorelease when you want to give up the ownership. You've only called one alloc/init , so you may only call release once. This line: [tempReturnedElements addObject:[xmlElement copy]]; should be written as: [tempReturnedElements addObject:[[xmlElement copy] autorelease]]; The reason is: copy gives you a new object. The retain count/ownership of the object pointed to by xmlElement is unchanged, but the new object now belongs to you. You're responsible for releasing it now. See the first paragraph in this answer: you called copy, you need to call release on the resulting object.
