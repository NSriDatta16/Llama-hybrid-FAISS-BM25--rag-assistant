The fact that it tried to insert the link before saving the rhs suggests that one of more of the relationships isn't marked as a foreign key: it shouldn't have done this (if correctly configured). Does your link table have any extra data of its own? If not, you can actually remove this table from the model competely - simply associate the two interesting tables (many-to-many), and select the link table as the storage mechanism of the assication (you'll need to click on the link between the two tables in the designer). Alternatively, if your link table has a compsoite key: "lhsid, rhsid", then I believe the tooling will do all this for you automatically.
