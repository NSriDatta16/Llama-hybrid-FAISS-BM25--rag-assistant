How to make WPF Listview works same as Photoshop layer

As we can see in Photoshop layer window (or other image editting tool also), it has several features: groups with folder-like header (collapse/expandable) ungroupped item (no header) sort "manually" by dragging. In case of No 1, I made groupped item with expander control. ( ref ) In case of No 3, Sort manually can be solved with this code. ( ref ) but I don't know how to list ungroupped items together. Of course, the ungroupped items may not have a header. I am using ICollectionView and MVVM. Does ICollectionView can make it?
