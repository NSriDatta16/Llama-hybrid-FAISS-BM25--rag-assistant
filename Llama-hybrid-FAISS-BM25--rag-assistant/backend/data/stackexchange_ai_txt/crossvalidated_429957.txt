Mapping Likert Scale Options to Numbers

I have a data set which is based on 5-point Likert scale. The options are in either [Strongly disagree, ..., Strongly agree] or [Never, ..., Very frequently]. Now I want to map the responses to numbers like [Strongly disagree -> 1, Disagree -> 2, Neutral -> 5, Agree -> 10, Strongly agree -> 17] for running some machine learning algorithms. Is it ok? Am I doing it right?
