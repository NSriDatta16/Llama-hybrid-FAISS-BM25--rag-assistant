GL_MODULATE is the way to tell GL to use the texture alpha for the final alpha of the fragment (it's also the default). Your blending is also correct as to how to use that generated alpha in the blending stage. So the problem lies elsewhere... Your description sounds like you did not in fact disable Z-test, and you do not render your sprites back to front. Alpha blending in GL will only do what you want if you draw your sprites back to front. Otherwise, the sprites get blended in the wrong order, and this does not produce the correct output. It would be easier to verify this with a picture of what you observe though.
