Before you worry too much about the warning, pay more attention to the model construction. I fear that you might have jumped into a complicated model containing interacting polynomial terms, without looking in detail at what the data themselves indicate. Look at the raw data very carefully as a function of your predictors before you proceed. A few suggestions for what to do next follow. First, see how well a model with only linear terms for the continuous predictors might work. That would cut down the model complexity substantially and make it easier for your audience to understand. My hunch, without seeing your data, is that the warning you get arises from the interaction term between two quadratic orthogonal polynomials, which are coded internally in ways that aren't necessarily intuitive and might lead to apparent differences in scale among predictor terms. Even if you need non-linear terms for the main effects, you might be able to get away with interaction terms that only involve linear trends. Second, if you do need to incorporate non-linear terms for continuous predictors, it's usually better to use restricted cubic splines. Forcing a quadratic fit can give poor fit at the extremes of the data range. A restricted cubic spline with 3 knots will give a smooth, flexible fit between the outermost knots and a simple linear fit outside those knots, while only using up 1 more degree of freedom than a linear fit. They are simply provided, for example, by the rcs() function in the R rms package . I suspect that a model (1) replacing the polynomial terms with splines and (2) limiting the interactions to linear terms will remove your warning. Third, in terms of the model itself, try to get some local statistical support. For example, there's both an IncDayS and a TimeS predictor. It's not clear what different processes those 2 time-related predictors are capturing, and if they are highly correlated then the model results might be hard to interpret. I also wonder whether this might be better described by a repeated-events survival model. Those issues might need expert help from someone you can work closely with. Fourth, devote some effort to becoming less of a novice in statistics. As you know, properly performed biological field studies depend on a detailed understanding of the subject matter, which continues to develop over time. Proper experimental design and analysis of results similarly depend on an understanding of statistical principles. You don't need to become a professional statistician yourself, but you do need to know enough to handle simple designs, to know when to seek outside help, and how to talk intelligently with an expert when needed. An Introduction to Statistical Learning is one free and accessible reference. Look over the resources provided by Frank Harrell under the RMS (Regression Modeling Strategies) and BBR (Biostatistics for Biomedical Research) headings. Consult the R Companion for the Handbook of Biological Statistics .
