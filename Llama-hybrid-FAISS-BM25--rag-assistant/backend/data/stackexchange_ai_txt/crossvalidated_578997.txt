is it okay to run a binary logistic regression with groups of unequal sizes?

My data looks like this: Group 1: outcome 1 - 200, outcome 2 - 750 Group 2: outcome 1 - 300, outcome 2 - 900 Group 2's likelihood of having outcome 2 is 75%, while Group 1's likelihood of having outcome 2 is 79%. If I run a binary logistic regression on this data, Group 2 is significantly less likely to have outcome 2. Based on the group's background, I was expecting the opposite. Is outcome 2 truly more likely in Group 1, or is this just because Group 1 has a smaller total sample size than Group 2? Is the binary logistic regression affected by the groups having different sizes?
