Why fit new TargetEncoder for test data?

In the H2O tutorial on target encoding they recommend fitting a new TargetEncoder to the entire training set to encode the test data. Why not just use the averaged TargetEncoder fit to the training data in the k-fold cross validation? I understand their point about overfitting not being a risk, but it seems to me like they are introducing a change in the distribution of the encoded variable between the training and test sets. http://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/data-munging/target-encoding.html#transform-target-encoding
