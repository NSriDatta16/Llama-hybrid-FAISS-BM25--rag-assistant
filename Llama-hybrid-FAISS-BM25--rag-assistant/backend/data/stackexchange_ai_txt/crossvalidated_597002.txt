Combine results from many likert scales in order to get a single response variable - PCA? CFA?

I'm helping a friend design his research. He'll use a Google Forms questionnaire with several questions (from 0 to 5, Likert scale) to assess anxiety of students' before taking two different tests . The questionnaire has about 10 questions, all underlie anxiety and all go from 0 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree), and students will take either test A or test B (the tests are the same, but in different languages). The question is to verify if anxiety can be explained by type of test . Hence, I'm thinking about performing an Ordinal regression (using R's clm ) to test it in a second moment. The thing is, after we have the data, what would be an appropriate approach to combine all results into a single "anxiety" measure? in order to be able to fit the model afterwards? Hypothetical data: ID test Q1 ... Q10 PART1 A 1 3 PART2 A 2 4 PART3 B 5 1 PART4 B 4 2 ### We'd like to model "Anxiety" taking into consideration Q1 to Q10: clm(ANXIETY ~ test) Notes : sts will take either test A or test B, so this is not a repeated-measures design I've thought of running a pilot study with a few sts and run a Cronbach's alpha to assess reliability/consistency, but I still don't know what to do afterwards to combine all questions into a single variable. This is more of a theoretical question, but R tips would be much appreciated. Thanks! I've seen many similar questions here, hopefully this isn't a duplicate, but I still don't know what path would be the most adequate. like this from 2015 , this from 2012 , this from 2017 and this from 2015
