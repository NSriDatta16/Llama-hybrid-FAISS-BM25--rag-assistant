Let's see what actually happened with your example You started with a mixture of three normal distributions, where the probability of exceeding $\$80k$ was about $0.32576$ You used this to construct a population of $300000$ with $97751$ cases exceeding $\$80k$ , a proportion of about $0.32587$ You sampled $15000$ without replacement from the $300000$ population with (my running of your code) $4865$ cases exceeding $\$80k$ , a proportion of about $0.3243$ . This is the natural estimate $\hat p$ of the proportion both of the population and of the original mixture distribution. You then $1000$ times sampled $10500$ without replacement from the $15000$ sample and looked at the cases exceeding $\$80k$ ranging from $3317$ to $3491$ with an average about $3405.8$ , so getting proportions ranging from $0.3159$ to $0.3325$ with an average of about $0.3244$ (you seem to report a mean of $0.3259$ but I do not get that running your code - with only $1000$ repetitions the difference is not significant) That last step is not conventional bootstrapping, which instead would involve sampling $15000$ (or perhaps $285000$ ) with replacement from the original sample, and doing it many more times. No matter. The real point is that nothing you do after the third step can improve on the knowledge that $4865$ of the $15000$ sample exceeded $\$80k$ . What bootstrapping does do is allow estimates of statistics which are theoretically too difficult to calculate, but that is not the case with proportions. In particular you cannot ensure you improve on $\hat p$ by bootstrapping, though there are some theoretical arguments for using the biased estimates $\frac{4865+\frac12}{15000+1}$ or $\frac{4865+1}{15000+2}$ or $\frac{4865+2}{15000+4}$ instead of $\frac{4865}{15000}$ . As for a confidence interval, there are many theoretical suggestions , at least for the original mixture distribution, and here bootstrapping will not improve on these (and will vary since each set of bootstraps will vary). It is easy enough to extend these to confidence intervals for the population here, remembering that the population is finite and you already know $15000$ of the values.
