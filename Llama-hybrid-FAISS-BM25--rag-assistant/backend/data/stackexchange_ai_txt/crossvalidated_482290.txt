interpretation of model coefficient in logistic regression

In simple logistic regression, a common interpretation of the model coefficient $\beta$ is that a 'one-unit increase in the independent variable is associated with an increase of the log-odds ratio of the outcome variable by $\beta$ '). This is already answered here . What confused me is that the logit function is not linear with respect to $x$ , so how can a one-unit increase in $x$ lead to a constant change in the log-odds ratio?
