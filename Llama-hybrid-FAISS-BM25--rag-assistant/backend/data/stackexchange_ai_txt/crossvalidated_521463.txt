It depends on the many factors, the best thing is just to try out. The translation probably only pays off when you have much more training data in English (and therefore a much better English model), the more French data you have, the lower the chance that it pays off. Also if the English data contains many culturally specific information (e.g., names of companies that only are in the U.S.), classifying the translation might work well either. You also might be interested in using pre-trained multilingual BERT or XML-R as input features. These models allow relatively easy transfer across langauges.
