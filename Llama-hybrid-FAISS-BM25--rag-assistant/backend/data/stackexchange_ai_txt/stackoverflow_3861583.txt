What platform (Windows 32/64?, Linux 32/64), Eclipse version (Ganymede, Helios? 32, 64?) are you using? This bug was reported some time ago ( bug 263661 ), but was fixed in 3.4.1 and 3.5. Make sure, on a 'x86_64' platform that you are using the right jdk for the right Eclipse distro (that is: a 32bit JDK with a 32bits Eclipse, or a 64bits JDK with a 64bits Eclipse)
