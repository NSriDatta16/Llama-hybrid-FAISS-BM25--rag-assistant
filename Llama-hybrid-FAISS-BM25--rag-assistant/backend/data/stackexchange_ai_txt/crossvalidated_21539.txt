What is the correct procedure to choose the lag when performing Johansen cointegration test?

When preforming Johansen Cointegration test for 2 time series (the simple case) you need to decide the lag you want to use. Doing the test for different lags return different results: for some lag levels the null hypothesis can be rejected but for others it can't. My question is what is the right method based on the input data to decide what lag I need to use when preforming the Johansen Test? p.s. I submitted this question to quant.stackexchange but some suggested it is better fit to this group.
