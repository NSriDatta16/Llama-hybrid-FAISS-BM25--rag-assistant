Open a nib file with Interface Builder. One way to do that is to double-click on a file in Xcode in the Resources group with some name ending in ' ...ViewController.xib ' or named ' MainWindow.xib ' In Interface Builder: Make sure your Library window is open by selecting Menu --> Tools --> Library Make sure the Objects tab is selected. On that window's popup menu, go to Library --> Cocoa Touch --> Controllers You should see a golden translucent cube icon named Object Drag that icon to your open xib window. You should now be able to continue along with the Stanford lecture. Update: Before going into Interface Builder, add your new class to the Xcode project using Menu --> New File --> Cocoa Touch Class --> Objective-C class. Set the Subclass of: popup, then name your class. Add any ivars. Save. Your class should appear in the class popup in Interface Builder from then on. Note: There are several ways to add new classes to projects. I am not a fan of the way it's done in the Stanford Lecture.
