How to create hierarchical classes / enums to be used as a key in collection in .NET C#

I have a collection of stuffs in a generic Dictionary () . The key is a string, and I'm attempting to come up with a way to use a hierarchical data structure instead of a string as they key. So instead of doing this: object value = myDictionary["App1.Account1.SomeSetting"]; I want to be able to do this: object value = myDictionary[App1.Account1.SomeSetting]; (notice lack of quotes around the key. This means the dictionary will become Dictionary () . What's the best way to define that {something}? It would be strongly typed and would works like this: App1 - could be any number of applications App1 could contain many accounts (App1.Account1) Accounts can contain many settings (App1.Account1.Setting1) The {something} data-structure would be hard coded with all possible levels/settings, but I can't think of what it could be organized like to still work as a key. EDIT: See my answer below for the solution. Hopefully it helps someone else.
