Are you interested in reducing the time complexity or the space complexity ? The average time complexity can be reduced O(n + d^2), where n is the length of the longer string and d is the edit distance. If you are only interested in the edit distance and not interested in reconstructing the edit sequence, you only need to keep the last two rows of the matrix in memory, so that will be order(n). If you can afford to approximate, there are poly-logarithmic approximations. For the O(n +d^2) algorithm look for Ukkonen's optimization or its enhancement Enhanced Ukkonen . The best approximation that I know of is this one by Andoni, Krauthgamer, Onak
