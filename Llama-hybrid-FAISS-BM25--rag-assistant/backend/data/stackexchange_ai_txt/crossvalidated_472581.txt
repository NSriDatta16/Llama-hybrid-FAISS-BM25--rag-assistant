Calculation of MSE cross-validation is typical, but calculating $\theta_{cv}$ as yours is not good in general. Recently, a similar question has been asked; see option (1) in the question. If $X^TX$ is not singular, the problem has only one minimum, and based on your data, you might not see any adverse effects of averaging out $\theta_k$ . But still, I wouldn't advise it. Cross-validation is typically used for two main purposes: Tune hyper-parameters (which you don't have) Estimate test error (which is MSE-cv you have, and it represents the MSE of future test data, i.e. you claim "we would have trained our model with all the training data, obtain a $\theta$ , and calculate MSE on the test set and would have obtained a similar MSE"). This way, you can't claim a final model because you're using your data to report an estimated test error. You can't have your cake and eat it at the same time.
