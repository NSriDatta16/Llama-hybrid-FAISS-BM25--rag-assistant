You cannot add HTML-ified items to the menu. Menu-items are always wrapped in an anchor tag and will filter out HTML. Changing this behaviour is technically possible, but will cause a lot of unknown side-effects. What you want, is either a simple theme override , or a custom block (potentially without a title and with some other bullets). You can create a block with hook_block or by simply typing the HTML, with some PHP into a new block, using the PHP-input filter. This last option is quick, but is discouraged by many people for performance and "good practices" reasons: you should not store php in your database. EDIT: After comment about "just the name": To insert "just the name" you simply need to create module with a hook_menu. global $user; $items['path/%uid'] = array( 'title' => $user->name, 'description' => 'description', 'page callback' => 'drupal_get_form', //Fill in the callback here: function that renders the page content. 'page arguments' => array(''), 'access callback' => '', 'access arguments' => array(''), 'weight' => 0, 'menu_name' => 'Navigation', 'type' => MENU_NORMAL_ITEM, ); Is about what you want.
