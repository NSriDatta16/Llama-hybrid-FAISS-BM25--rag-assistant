When I am learning any new language I take the provided sample code and rewrite it from scratch. That way if I get stuck on how to do something I can flip over to the provided sample as a reference. I find simply rewriting sample code helps me, especially when there are big syntax differences. With regards to the iPhone, I would play close attention to memory management. There is some great sample code and documentation in the iPhone Dev site.
