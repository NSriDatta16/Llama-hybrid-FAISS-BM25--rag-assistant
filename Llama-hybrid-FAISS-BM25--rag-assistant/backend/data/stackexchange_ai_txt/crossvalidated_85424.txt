The TeachingDemos package for R has the TkBuildDist and TkBuildDist2 functions that provide interactive ways to draw a histogram and/or log density plot for creating a histogram. The first one uses left clicks to add points and right clicks to remove points and the second allows you to click on the tops of bars and drag them up or down. Both show the distribution as it is being created/modified and then return information about the distribution created (histogram and logspline fit). This is not quite paper and pencil, but does accomplish the same general idea using a mouse.
