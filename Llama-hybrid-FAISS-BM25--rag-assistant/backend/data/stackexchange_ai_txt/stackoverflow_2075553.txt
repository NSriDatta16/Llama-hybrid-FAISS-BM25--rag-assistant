I've just seen a webcast on RX extensions, not played with it, and found the explication too complicated... I thought the creators were architect astronauts. For now I just don't see where is the problem with classic event handler... I have always found elegant solution when I had to use asynchronous communication between a client and a service. However I'm curious with experiences from other people with this framework, depending on answers of this thread, I'll give it another try.
