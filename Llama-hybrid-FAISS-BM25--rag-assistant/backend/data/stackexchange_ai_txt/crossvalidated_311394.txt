I gave this expression of the CLT in an answer on X validated yesterday, coming from Kipnis and Varadhan (1986) , which major condition is reversibility of the Markov chain. Chan and Geyer (1994) have another version of the CLT for Harris recurrent Markov chains that are geometrically ergodic with a $2+\epsilon$ moment. (See also Hobert et al. (2002) for a reinterpretation of this result.)
