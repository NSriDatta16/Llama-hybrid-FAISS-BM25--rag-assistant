nunit problem loading exe

following situation: tests.dll contains a bunch of unit tests program.exe contains some to be tested classes tests.dll contains tests using the classes in program.exe therefore tests.dll has a reference on program.exe nunit-agent.exe loads tests.dll and this then loads program.exe --> basically in the nunit environment program.exe is used like a dll. 'misusing' an exe as dll is possible as i just wrote a little test application that also references program.exe and uses some classes defined in there and this runs fine ... BUT in nunit i get a BadImageFormatException as soon as tests are loaded that use code defined in program.exe is this a bug in nunit's reflection mechanism or is there a reason for that? thx tobi
