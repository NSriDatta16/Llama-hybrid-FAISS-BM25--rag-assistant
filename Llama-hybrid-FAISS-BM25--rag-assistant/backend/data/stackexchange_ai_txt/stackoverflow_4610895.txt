I think the largest advantage to using web markup like HTML/CSS and other web technologies is that desktop apps may very well have their days numbered. As we speak, Google engineers are working on the Chromium OS, which essentially consists of a single GUI application... the browser... Now, while nothing may never actually come of it, there is clearly a rising trend in the number of applications accessible through a web browser, accessible anywhere. It seems to me that this is the future of application development. By using these technologies, this becomes one less headache you have to deal with when or if you determine that your app should be available as a web application. Update : A few years ago, we developed an Agent Desktop for our call center that is essentially a local application that opens sockets to integrate with the phone system. The user interface the agents use is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and the experience is stunning. When we released our latest update in 2010 with a professional CSS redesign, our agents were all very impressed with not only how easy it was to interact but also how easy it was to use. In the future we will port this 100% to the browser, but for now it needs to be a local application because of the COM integration with the phone system.
