What probability to select in calculating Bayesian power?

I am comparing a Frequentist to a Bayesian test, running many simulations of the experiment. I want to compare the power of both tests, assuming the Null is true . For the frequentist test, I can fix an $\alpha$, say 5%, and find the proportion of times the p-value is > 5%, correctly failing to reject the Null. For the Bayesian test, I get a distribution of probabilities in favor of the Null. Great. But how do I choose a cut off? Intuitively, if I treat Type I and Type II errors, I would choose 50% right? Is there another way to frame this? Do I put some sort of loss function on top of this in order to determine my "power"? Any insight is appreciated, thanks.
