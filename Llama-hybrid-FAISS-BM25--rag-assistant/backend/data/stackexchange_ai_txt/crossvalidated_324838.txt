Variation in Neural Network Weights if training data is shuffled?

We have two copies of the same Neural Net (NN). Lets call them NN1 and NN2. NN1 is trained on a Training set (TSo) that yields weight set W1 If we train NN2 on TSo's shuffled set (TSs), will the weights yielded, W2 be same as W1? Data to be trained is same, just the ordering of the training data is different. NN1 = NN2 (Initially) NN1 ---> TSo ---> W1 NN2 ---> TSs ---> W2 Is W1 same as W2? Why or Why not?
