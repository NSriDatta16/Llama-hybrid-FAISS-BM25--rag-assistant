Interpreting coeftest results; z-test; t-test, unfamiliar with the output

I am using coeftest to run z- and t- tests on a few different pieces of data. The output comes in this form: fit t test of coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 0.0412 0.0162 2.54 0.011 * type_flagprox 0.0448 0.0184 2.44 0.015 * --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 However, I am used to t- tests and z-tests resulting in data that looks more like this: prop.test(x=c(11, 81), n = c(267 , 942), p = NULL, alternative = "two.sided", correct = TRUE) data: c(11, 81) out of c(267, 942) X-squared = 5, df = 1, p-value = 0.02 alternative hypothesis: two.sided 95 percent confidence interval: -0.0770 -0.0126 sample estimates: prop 1 prop 2 0.0412 0.0860 Where the information you get is that the t-test/z-test basically tell you if differences are significant or not. Do I interpret the first bit of come with the estimated coefficients the same way I would interpret output from a OLS - where a 1 unit increase in type_flagprox is a 0.0448 unit increase in the outcome? If that were output from a binary model, would I interpret it like a logistic regression?
