One method would be to use the test provided in JDemetra+ , which is explained in the manual and the reference therein (though it's unclear from their list of references which one they are referencing): The test for a log-level specification used by TRAMO is based on the maximum likelihood estimation of the parameter $\lambda$ in the Box-Cox transformation, which is a power transformation such that the transformed values of the time series $y$ are a monotonic function of the observations, i.e. $y^\alpha = \begin{cases} \frac{(y^\alpha_i - 1)}{\lambda}, & \lambda \neq 0 \\ \log y^\alpha_i, & \lambda = 0 \end{cases}$. The program first fits two Airline models (i.e. ARIMA (0,1,1)(0,1,1) with a mean) to the time series: one in logs ($\lambda = 0$), other without logs ($\lambda = 1$). The test compares the sum of squares of the model without logs with the sum of squares multiplied by the square of the geometric mean of the (regularly and seasonally) differenced series in the case of the model in logs. Logs are taken in the case this last function is the minimum. GÃ“MEZ, V., and MARAVALL, A. (2010).
