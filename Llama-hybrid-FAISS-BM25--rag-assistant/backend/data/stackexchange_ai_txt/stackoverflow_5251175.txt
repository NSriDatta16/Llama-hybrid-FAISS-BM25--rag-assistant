Show a certain QGraphicsItems tree multiple times in a QGraphicsView

Question Take a certain tree of QGraphicsItems: a QGraphicsRectItem that has two QGraphicsTextItems as children. QGraphicsRectItem CompositeObject; QGraphicsTextItem text1; QGraphicsTextItem text2; text1.setParent(CompositeObject); text2.setParent(CompositeObject); Now take a QGraphicsScene with two QGraphicsRectItem on a different position: QgraphicsScene scene; QGraphicsRectItem* rect1 = scene.addRect(...); QGraphicsRectItem* rect2 = scene.addRect(...); rect1.setPos(0,0); rect2.setPos(0,100); What I want now is the CompositeObject being a child of rect1 AND rect2; my goal: show the same subtree of QGraphicsItems on two places in the same scene, clipped by the parent rect. Updates on the subtree will be visible on the two places in the QGraphicsView without any manual syncing or such. Solution which I'm not to sure about The only thing I can think about on how to do this is: embedding two QGraphicsViews in the scene by using a proxywidget. The subtree I want to see duplicated in my scene will then be a another scene (subScene) on it's own and both QGraphicsViews in my main scene will then show the subScene. This will probably do the trick but introduce a nice overhead because of the proxywidget, which I can't afford since the items in the subScene will have to animate and update regularly. QGraphicsScene subScene; QGraphicsTextItem text1; QGraphicsTextItem text2; subScene.addItem(text1); subScene.addItem(text2); QgraphicsScene scene; QgraphicsView view1(&subScene); QgraphicsView view2(&subScene); QGraphicsProxyWidget* proxy1 = scene.addWidget(&view1); proxy1.setPos(0,0); QGraphicsProxyWidget* proxy2 = scene.addWidget(&view2); proxy2.setPos(0,100); Are there any other options on how to do this?
