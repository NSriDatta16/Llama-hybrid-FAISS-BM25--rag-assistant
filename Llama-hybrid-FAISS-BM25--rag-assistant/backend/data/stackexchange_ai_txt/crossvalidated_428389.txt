Alice should play the first game Both games are identical until Alice rolls a 5. At that point, on the next roll, she has a 1/6 chance of rolling a 5, and a 1/6 chance of rolling a 6. So her chances of winning at this point are identical between both games, but what makes this interesting is what happens if she does not win immediately after rolling her first 5. In the second game, suppose Alice rolls a 5 and then a non-5. She's now back to square one, having to roll a 5 again before looking for her second 5. She will require a minimum of two more rolls to win. In contrast, in the first game, it's possible for Alice to roll a 5 followed by a non-6, which could be a 5. In the second game, failure to win doesn't necessarily revert the player to square one - there's a possibility she could still be just one roll away from winning. After rolling the first 5, a player of the first game has a 1/6 chance of winning, a 1/6 chance of trying again, and a 4/6 chance of starting over. A player of the second game has a 1/6 chance of winning and a 5/6 chance of having to start over. The first game will take fewer rolls to win, on average.
