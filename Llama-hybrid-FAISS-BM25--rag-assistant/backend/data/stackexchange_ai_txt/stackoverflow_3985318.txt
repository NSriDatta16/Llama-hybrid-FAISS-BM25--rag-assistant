Is there a way to export an eclipse project layout?

it could be useful to export just the project layout, in a text format, for example : src/main/java *net.foo.bar **MyFirstClass.java src/main/config *myconfigfile.properties etc It could be useful for sharing and talking about project organization, without making a screenshot. And it will be possible to c/p a file name or a directory name .
