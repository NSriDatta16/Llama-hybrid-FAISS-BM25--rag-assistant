Any and all malware can easily be made undetectable to most if not all antivirus/antimalware products. Even a relatively unskilled person could do it with available tools or services. The only way to clean a machine is to wipe it. Always. A corporate machine should be easy enough and everyone saves time just wiping it. If the problem reappears often however or data loss or theft is suspected - contact professionals. The antivirus software is just to filter out the general noise of crap, it will not catch directed/real attacks. But as someone said, are you sure the machine is doing illicit things and not just normal operation? You need some network skill to decide that I'd guess... but if it is misbehaving and you can't find the cause - wipe it. Easy choice. Even if you did find some kind of virus or malware, you should definately wipe it - as that is sign enough that the machine might be even further compromised which you won't detect. There's a saying in host security, if a host has been infected, it is no longer your host regardless of what you do to it except for wiping it completely (and even that is way optimistic as there are sometimes ways to store malware in programmable rom like in a vulnerable network card's firmware or some other non-volatile piece of storage in it).
