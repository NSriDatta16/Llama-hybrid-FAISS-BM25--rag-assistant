Correction of data using a correlation

Suppose I have measured the outcome variable A using a (psychophysical) test that determines the ability of a subject to discriminate between two stimuli with a certain difference (the variable X ). It was a two-alternative forced choice task, meaning that the subjects choose in each trial if the stimuli were diferent, yes or no. Now, dependent on the variable X , the subjects scored at minimum 50% (meaning they were guessing at small x) up to 100% (always choosing correct alternative at large X ). The outcome variable A , now, is the value of X where correct rates are 75% (midway between chance and 100% correct rates). I have measured A on three points in time (before, during, after: t0 , t1 , t2 ). At t0 no practice was received on the task, at t1 ten minutes and at t2 20 minutes of practice was received (8 participants). A repeated measures ANOVA showed a significant effect of practice as the scores go up by around 33%. Now, during testing I have sampled at random a condition in which the subjects could theoretically never have been able to do the task above chance level (very small X ), which are referred to as 'catch trials'. It turns out that these guess rates (theoretically 50%, i.e., chance level) increased significantly, being chance at t0 (as expected), but steadily, and significantly increasing above 50% at t1 (60%) and t2 (70%). The most parsimonious explanation here is that subjects were doing the task using false cues. In other words, they noticed cues between the stimuli other than X . This means that the learning effect of 33% is an overestimate. Now, I plotted the individual improvement percentage (average 33% as noted above) against the corresponding guess rate pooling all data across t0 , t1 , t2 . This, indeed, showed that A correlated significantly with guess rate. I did an F -test on the slope, P~0.01 and a correlation coefficient ( r 2 ) = 0.25. Can I, based on this data set, quantitatively correct the learning effect of 33% by the finding that it, at least in part, was caused by the subjects using false cues? In other words, can I reduce the 33% learning improvement by a certain factor to correct for the subjects using other cues? Is it as simple as subtracting the false-cue improvement (20%) from the total improvement (33%). Or should I take the 0.25 correlation coefficient into account as well? ps: as it is my first step in CrossValidated, please feel free to shoot at the question to improve it
