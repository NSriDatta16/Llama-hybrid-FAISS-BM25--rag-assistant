G eographic I nformation S ystem is an industry standard root of the acronym GIS. A GIS is a technological infrastructure that provides presentation-based (static maps), analytical (data and statistics) and organizational (process) decision support. Many non-GIS professionals focus their interests on presentation and lightweight user interfaces (see Google Maps), but the full power of an enterprise-grade GIS is only available in large application suites such as that offered by ESRI , Inc. Like any other information system, however, the utility of a given geospatial system is determined by the underlying user requirements. What truly sets a GIS apart from any other IT system is the native support for real world coordinate systems and the complex geometric transformations inherent therein. By supporting real-world coordinates, a GIS guarantees that (within a given resolution) the relationships depicted between datasets are true-to-life. With the addition of extended attributes in the underlying database, a framework exists to make real-world decisions using real-world data in real-world relationships with a visual interface that most people can easily interpret. With this basic premise, all other aspects of modern Geographic Information Systems, whether light or heavy, are merely additional features. A picture is worth a thousand words.
