How do you organize your git repositories?

"Traditional" version control systems follow a "Cathedral" model -- all the code is stored in one main repository. Distributed Version Control Systems like git allow a lot more flexibility in organizing your multiple repositories. You can "push" changes, "pull" changes, and "clone" repositories. Have you organized your repositories along your workgroup or workflow lines? Have you noticed any patterns?
