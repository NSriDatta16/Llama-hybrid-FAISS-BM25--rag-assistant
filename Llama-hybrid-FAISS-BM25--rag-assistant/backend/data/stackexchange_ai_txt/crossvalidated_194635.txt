Model selection for and forecasting of arctic oscillation (a seasonal time series)

I'm having a doubt with a time series. I have to find the best model for it and use it to do some forecast. The data are about the arctic oscillation (AO) from 1950 to 2015. The series is clearly stationary, and the augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test confirms it. The ACF and PACF for absolute values of the series are depicted below. Running seasonplot from "forecast" package in R, I can see that in the summer months the values look clearly more clustered, while during the end/beginning of the year the values are more scattered. The question is: How can I find the best model? Based on the PACF, before seeing the seasonality, I chose an AR(1), and it was good till I discovered the seasonal thing. How can I find the best model to do forecasting? Thanks!
