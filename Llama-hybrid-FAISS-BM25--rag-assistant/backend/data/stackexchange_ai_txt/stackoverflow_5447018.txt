My guess is that you're scheduling these page fetches based on a fixed timer, and you're not paying attention to where the fetches actually end. Pretend that each page takes 60 seconds to fetch. You have a huge pile of fetches scheduled for 30 seconds, and then again in 30 seconds, more and more piling up as you're completing earlier requests. This is just a guess, though, as even this simplified example isn't completely self-contained. (Can you reproduce it without having a database involved, with just a fixed list of URLs?) That stack trace is not particularly helpful, either; effectively, it just says that the memory was allocated by calling a python function, which should be obvious. You might want to try a Python-specific memory profiler like Heapy or Dowser to see where your Python objects are going.
