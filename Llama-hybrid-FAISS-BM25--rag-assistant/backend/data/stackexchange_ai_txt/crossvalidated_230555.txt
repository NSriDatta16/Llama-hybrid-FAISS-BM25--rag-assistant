Logistic regression at a defined cutpoint for survival analysis

I have some pre-treatment variables which are significantly associated in a cox model with progression-free survival (PFS) in a medical study. I was wondering if taking a defined cutpoint (for example 3 months or 6 months PFS) and classifying patients according to progression in these time period is possible to do a logistic regression with my pre-treatment variables and see the performance of the model in the prediction of 3 months or 6 months PFS. Is possible/correct from a statistical point of view?
