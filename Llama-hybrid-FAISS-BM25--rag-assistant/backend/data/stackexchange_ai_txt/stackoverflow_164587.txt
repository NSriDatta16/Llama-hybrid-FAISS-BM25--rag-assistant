It doesn't give exactly what you need, but I'd highly recommend trying the SQL Server 2005 Performance Dashboard Reports, which can be downloaded here . It includes a report of the top 20 queries and their average execution time and a lot of other useful ones as well (top queries by IO, wait stats etc). If you do install it be sure to take note of where it installs and follow the instructions in the Additional Info section.
