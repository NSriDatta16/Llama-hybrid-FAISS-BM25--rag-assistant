I think something else to keep in mind is your client base, are you publishing this service publicly, or is it restricted to a set of known agents? I'm involved in the latter situation, and we've found it's not that difficult to solve this via simple communication / stakeholdering. Though it's only indirectly related to your question, we've found that basing our versioning number on compatibility seems to work quite well. Using A.B.C as an example... A: Changes which require recompilation (breaks backwards compatibility) B: Changes which do not require recompilation, but have additional features not available without doing so (new operations etc.) C: Changes to the underlying mechanics that do not alter the WSDL
