Why encode pitch as one-hot encoding instead of ordinal encoder?

looking at the state-of-the-art publications on deep learning for synthesizing audio one can see that they always resort to encoding pitch as a one-hot vector. I'm curious what the advantage is on doing this, since pitch (frequency) fits naturally as a scalar value and one could reduce network dimensionality by encoding it as such. The papers I've studied are: GANSynth: Adversarial Neural Audio Synthesis Neural Audio Synthesis of Musical Notes with WaveNet Autoencoders
