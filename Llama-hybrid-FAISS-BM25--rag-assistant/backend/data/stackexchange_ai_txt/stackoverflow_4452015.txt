In Ruby 1.9.2-p0 (YARV) the result is the same as in the original post (i.e., Foo::bar #=> # NoMethodError: undefined method 'bar' for Foo:Module). Also, letters with accent are unfortunately not considered as being upper nor lower and related methods produce no result. Examples: "รก".upcase => "รก" "รก" == "ร".downcase => false
