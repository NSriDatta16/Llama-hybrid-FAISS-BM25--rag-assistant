Is it possible to have multiple header rows in a virtual string tree?

I have a need for multiple fixed rows for the header of a virtual string view - something that looks like the effect you get if you set a StringGrid 's FixedRows property to a value greater than 1. Is there a way to achieve this? Some searching on the Soft-Gems website and forums led me to a couple of mentions of an AdvancedHeaderDraw method and a HeaderQueryElements property on the virtual string tree, but I can't work out how to use them. I also found a demo that uses THeaderControls to achieve a similar effect but there has to be a more elegant solution.
