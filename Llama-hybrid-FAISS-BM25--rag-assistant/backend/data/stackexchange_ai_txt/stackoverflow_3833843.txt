In the touchesBegan, touchesMoved, and touchesEnded methods, one parameter is event, which is a UIEvent object. The number of fingers on the screen is [[event allTouches]count]. [EDITED because Josh Hinman pointed out that I had it wrong before -- my previous suggestion of using [touches count] on the touches parameter in those same methods will not work.]
