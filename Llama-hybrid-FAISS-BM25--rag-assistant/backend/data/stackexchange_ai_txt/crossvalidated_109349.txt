This is called learning from positive and unlabeled data (PU learning for short). Positives in this case refer to the labeled users, everyone else being unlabeled. I strongly advise against using one-class SVM for such problems as it is known to be suboptimal. The unlabeled data can provide valuable information regarding the structure of the positive class vis-a-vis the rest, which is ignored entirely by one-class SVM. An additional problem with one-class SVM in this setting is its sensitivity to false positives, which do exist in most practical applications. I work on this problem myself. A series of techniques exist to tackle such issues, such as biased SVM, bagging SVM and (recently) RESVM. I suggest reading my paper for a simple approach (currently under review). In the paper you can also find references to the main existing approaches, so it's good to get started.
