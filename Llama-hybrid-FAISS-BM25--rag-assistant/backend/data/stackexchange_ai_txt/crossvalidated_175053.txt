Gabe, welcome to the site! I'll try to give you some answers and some clarifications so that you can dig deeper. First of all, your dependent variable (# of falls) is not continuous it is discrete, despite having infinitely many values that it can take. Second (and most importantly) of all, Poisson regression was not a bad idea at all and might be the best way to go. One import consideration is how long each patient has been on the drugs . The parameter being estimated in Poisson Regression is a rate , how many times we expect an event to happen over a fixed period of time. Poisson regression can take this into account with something called exposure , which I suggest you look into. You talked about comparing an increase in fall risk , which makes it sound like a binary event (fall or no fall) versus a count event (how many times will they fall). Do you want a risk instead of a rate? If so you might want to consider dichotomizing the result and trying logistic regression, though personally I think the Poisson regression is preferable. Lastly, if you don't have a lot of data, you might want to consider Bayesian methods and/or reducing the number of questions you're trying to answer. Hope this was helpful and gave you enough to keep digging. Let me know if you have follow-ups.
