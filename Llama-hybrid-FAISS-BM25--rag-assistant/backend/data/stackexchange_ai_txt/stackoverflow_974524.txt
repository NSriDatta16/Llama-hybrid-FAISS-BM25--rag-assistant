Speeding up straggling idempotent tasks

I'm running multiple idempotent tasks to gather one batch of data. I found out that many times the computation is delayed significantly due to a couple of tasks out of a hundred. What I'd like is a way of watching these tasks and launching the stragglers again if they are significantly delayed. Is there a standard library or idiom for doing this in Java? I'm currently using the ExecutorService / ExecutorCompletionService pair to get the job done.
