Robert, if you build a new Windows App using Visual Studio you will definitely get the main form as the first screen shown, but it does not need to be like this. Visual Studio does this for you. It creates a Program class (Program.cs) with the Main method (which is the entry point for you application, pretty much like any other language) and call the main form for you. Look for Program.cs and you will find this: static class Program { /// /// The main entry point for the application. /// [STAThread] static void Main() { Application.EnableVisualStyles(); Application.SetCompatibleTextRenderingDefault(false); Application.Run(new Form1()); } } Knowing this you can change it and do pretty much whatever you want to change the way forms are handled by your app.
