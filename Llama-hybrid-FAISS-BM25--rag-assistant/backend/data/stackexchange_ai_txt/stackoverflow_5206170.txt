open is the method name. The fragment you pasted defines a public method called open which takes no arguments (there's nothing listed between the parentheses) which returns an instance of MyDBAdapter and may throw a SQLException . You may want to have a look at the tutorial on method declaration: http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/methods.html
