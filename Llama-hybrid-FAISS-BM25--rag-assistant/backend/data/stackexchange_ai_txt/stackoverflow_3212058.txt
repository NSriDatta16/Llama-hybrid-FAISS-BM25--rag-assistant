C++ How to create a heterogeneous container

I need to store a series of data-points in the form of (name, value), where the value could take different types. I am trying to use a class template for each data-point. Then for each data-point I see, I want to create a new object and push it back into a vector. For each new type, I need to create a new class from the template first. But I can not store the objects created in any vector, since vectors expect the same type for all entries. The types I need to store can not be fitted in a inheritance hierarchy. They are unrelated. Also there can be more types created in future, and I do not want to change the storage service for each new type. Is there a way to create a heterogeneous container to store these entries? Thank you!
