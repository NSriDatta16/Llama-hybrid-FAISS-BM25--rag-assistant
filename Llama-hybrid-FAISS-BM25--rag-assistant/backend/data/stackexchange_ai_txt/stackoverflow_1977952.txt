Use Page_Init in your MasterPage to make code run before child page and UserControl Page_Load events. Don't forget to do the occasional "View Source" as a sanity check. You gotta make sure that stuff goes into the response in the order you expect. The client script used in your UserControls will not execute until the response is sent to the user agent, so as long as the jQuery libraries are included earlier in the response, you should be ok. This is not actually a lifecycle issue unless you have server code mixed in with the client code that you are sending. I have this in the head of my MasterPage " /> var applicationRoot = " "; " type="text/javascript"> " type="text/javascript"> " type="text/javascript"> and this in the codebehind: // Swap the jQuery inlcude for the minified version phjQuery.Visible = false; phjQueryUI.Visible = false; string jQueryAddress = currentSettings != null && currentSettings["jQueryLocation"] == "local" ? ResolveUrl("Script/jquery-1.3.2.min.js") : "https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.3.2/jquery.min.js"; string jQueryUIAddress = currentSettings != null && currentSettings["jQueryLocation"] == "local" ? ResolveUrl("Script/jquery-ui-1.7.2.custom.min.js") : "https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.7.2/jquery-ui.min.js"; litJqueryMinified.Text = " "; litJqueryUIMinified.Text = " "; This allows me to have it minified or hosted by google in production, but use the full version in dev, with intellisense. Don't forget this in your Page_Load to get ResolveUrl to work: Page.Header.DataBind(); Hope this helps. :)
