My question is: How does the foreground activety enumerate if and what inactive activity exists? And how does it inform them? You don't and you don't. Think of a Web app, with multiple Web pages. The "foreground Web page" would not "enumerate if and what inactive Web pages exist", let alone "inform them". From the standpoint of the currently-visible Web page, it is the only thing around. The fact that the browser happens to perhaps have other Web pages in its history is immaterial. The same thing goes with Android activities. One activity should neither know nor care whether there are 0, 1, 2, or 1337 other activities from this application in RAM (though, odds are, it will be well below 1337). Rather, there should be a consistent central data model (e.g., database), and the activities each work against the central data model. OK, so does it mean that Android does not support or encourage one activity proactively informs another inactive activity? Correct. So that activies have to poll to get information? No more or less than Web pages have to poll to get information. That depends a bit on your definition of "poll".
