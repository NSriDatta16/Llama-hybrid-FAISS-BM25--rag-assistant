Embedding a Prolog engine in Obj-C projects

I'm looking for a light-weight Prolog engine to be embedded in an Obj-C application under Mac OSX. In Java there are some excellent implementations with the characteristics I need: deployability, lightness, dynamic configurability, integration with Java and ease of interoperability. Can you recommend something similar in C/C++? After several searches I found YAProlog and reading here it seems it can be used as library to be called from other programs. But (stupid questions): I'm inexperienced with UNIX and I don't know exactly how to produce libyap.a file with those commands of the YAP manual... Can I then copy libyap.a in my Xcode project and use it?
