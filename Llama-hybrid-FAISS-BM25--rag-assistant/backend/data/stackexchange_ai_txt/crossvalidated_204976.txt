Bayesian inference when observed variable contains uncertainty

I have a very simple graphical model to describe the relationship between two categorical variables $c \in \{0,1\}$ and $l \in \{A,B,C\}$: $$c \rightarrow l$$ I know all the conditional probabilities $p(l \mid c)$ through a lookup table. Calculating the posterior $p(c \mid l)$ is simple using Bayes' rule. However, what if I observe the labels $l$ with some uncertainty? That means my observation would be a tuple $(p_A, p_B, p_C)$, i.e. $(0.8, 0.1, 0.1)$ instead of observing $l=A$. Is there a way to calculate the posterior probability accordingly? I assume I can find some sort of weighted contribution (as below), but I couldn't figure out how to formulate this. $$ p(c \mid \mbox{observed tuple} ) = p_A ~ p(c \mid l=A) + p_B ~ p(c | l=B) + p_C ~ p(c \mid l=C) $$ Thanks for any help!
