Interpret several classifications to one classification result

I want to interpret several data series X, that consist of like 4 to 20 values that can range from 1 to 5. Imagine these as a result of classifications, where each row is a different id, and each element in the series is another estimation in time of the id. The series has the numerical classes(int):1,2,3,4,5; these describe the amount of people in a room. The class can change too. This sounds like an easy task at first, but it isn’t that easy. my goal is to find a good way to classify the series to have a possibility to also detect class changes (see last rows) and to figure out the position of the class change I also want to find out how this science field is called in general and where to find information on that, so I can help myself. I don’t want to use ML or regression for that step I know that I could reach a so-so estimation already by mean or median, but Im looking forward to find a more complex approach like using a moving average as smoothing before to improve results. However, this might also destroy some structures, see last 3 examples of Smoothing 1. My considerations to the class change: There is a class change wherever an increase/decrease in the series is AND the change will not turn back with the next value. (eg changes at smoothing type 2, last example: 0 -1 0 -> change is from 2nd to 3rd element, negative). By that I could also detect the position where a change occurs. I guess there might be be more elegant ways and Im also sure that I am not the first one looking for something like that. Thanks in advance.
