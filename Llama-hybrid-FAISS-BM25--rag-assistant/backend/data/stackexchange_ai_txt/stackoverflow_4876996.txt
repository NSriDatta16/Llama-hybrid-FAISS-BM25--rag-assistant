Well, this isn't so much a rails question as a general project organisation question. Rails in particular generates a doc directory in the rails root directory which seems like the place to put documentation related to the application. However, you need to ask yourself whether or not you want to be placing the documentation, if it's standalone (rather than being directly related to the source/development of said application) in the same repository (assuming you are using an scm system). If the documentation you are writing isn't really related to the development of the project, but rather it's usage or some other purpose such as business goals, etc, that kind of thing really belongs elsewhere, especially (depending on how you plan on deploying your application) considering that each checkout of your application code will be pulling down all this documentation unnecessarily (you certainly don't need it on the server, unless it's documentation about running server related maintenance scripts, etc). If you are just writing simple text, then .txt makes sense for your extensions. But really, just use whatever files (and appropriate extensions thereof) that you and your team are comfortable with. Again, it really depends on the purpose of this documentation and who it is for. If it's not useful to the application developers or for deployment/management purposes, it doesn't really belong in the application at all and should either be stored in a separate repository or a dedicated system for sharing this documentation with the people that need to have it, be that a simple shared folder on a server somewhere or something more specialised.
