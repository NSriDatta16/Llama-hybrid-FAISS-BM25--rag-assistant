You can organize it in whatever way makes the most sense for your application. I don't exactly know what you're doing so I can't be certain what the best organization would be for you, but you can pretty much split it up as you see fit and just import what you need. You can define classes in any file, and you can define as many classes as you would like in a script (unlike Java). There are no official header files (not like C or C++), but you can use config files to store info about connecting to a DB, whatever, and use configparser (a standard library function) to organize them. It makes sense to keep like things in the same file, so if you have a GUI, you might have one file for the interface, and if you have a CLI, you might keep that in a file by itself. It's less important how your files are organized and more important how the source is organized into classes and functions.
