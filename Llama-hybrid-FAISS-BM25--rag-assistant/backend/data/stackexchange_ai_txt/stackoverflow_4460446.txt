What is the best way to upload files to a storage service? (Amazon S3 or EdgeCast)

We have a web application which needs to store uploaded images with EdgeCast or Amazon S3. To do so we need to re-upload those images to EdgeCast / S3 first. There are a number of options I can think of: Do an inline curl re-upload , which will upload the image using the desired EdgeCast / S3 API. The disadvantage is that with concurrent uploads the server load will be massive. Queue re-uploads . I know it is possible but I have no idea how to do it. Don't bother with the re-uploads and upload directly to EdgeCast / S3 from the client end. Mount EdgeCast's / S3's FTP into the filesystem, and then just copy uploaded files, letting the FTP daemon do the rest. Which is the best solution, and are there any other ones? I suspect it is either 1 or 2. Edit: My application is in PHP
