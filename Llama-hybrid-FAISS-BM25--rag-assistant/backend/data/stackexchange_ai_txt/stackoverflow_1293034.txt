How to speedup data retrieval from 2 servers on different hosts

I have a database server on host A, and some applications also on host A, on host B hosted by mediatemple i have application that needs to retrieve data from host A, this app works fine and super fast when on host A, but when on host B it's A LTO slower, it sometimes take 10 seconds to generate the page. Because slow SQL queries. I tried persistent connections, it made the app load twice as fast, also i setup a ssh tunnel, it also improved the speed a bit, but it is still extremely slow! Any solution to my problem?
