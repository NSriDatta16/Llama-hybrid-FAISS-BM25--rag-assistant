I'm generalizing here, but... A clustered index seek is, for the most part, the best-case scenario. The only ways I can think of to improve performance would be: Update the query to return fewer rows/columns, if possible; Defragment or rebuild the index; Partition the index across multiple disks/servers. If it's only returning 138 rows, and it's that slow... maybe it's being blocked by some other process? Are you testing this in isolation, or are other users/processes online at the same time? Or maybe it's even a hardware problem, like a disk failure.
