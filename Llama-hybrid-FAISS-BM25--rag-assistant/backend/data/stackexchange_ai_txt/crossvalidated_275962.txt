Retaining Random Forest performance while reducing the feature set

Suppose I have trained a random forest on a very high dimensional set of features. Then I have identified the top m features that have the highest Gini index. If I'd now drop all other feature variable except the top m ones (so performing a great dimensionality reduction), can I expect to obtain a similar classification?
