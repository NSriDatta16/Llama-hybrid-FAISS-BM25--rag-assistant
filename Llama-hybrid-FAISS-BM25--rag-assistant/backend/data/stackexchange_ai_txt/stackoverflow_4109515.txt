Does IIS throw away the URL fragment on custom error pages?

I'm using the old 404-rewrite method on a certain site that is tied to IIS6 *. So if I enter http://example.com/non-existent/path it calls my error page like so http://example.com/catch.aspx?404;http://example.com/non-existent/path Great. Except if I call the page with a fragment, like http://example.com/non-existent/path#with-fragment I get the same result as above. I can't find the fragment anywhere: Request.Url Request.Url.OriginalString Request.UrlReferrer Request.RawUrl headers, server variables, etc This has come up because I want to resolve paths created by AJAX to their server-side versions. Is there any way for me to retrieve the original path from my handler? Thanks. (*) Please don't suggest I change platform. Obviously I would if I could.
