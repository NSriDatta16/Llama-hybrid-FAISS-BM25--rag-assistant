How can I benchmark C code easily?

Is there a simple library to benchmark the time it takes to execute a portion of C code? What I want is something like: int main(){ benchmarkBegin(0); //Do work double elapsedMS = benchmarkEnd(0); benchmarkBegin(1) //Do some more work double elapsedMS2 = benchmarkEnd(1); double speedup = benchmarkSpeedup(elapsedMS, elapsedMS2); //Calculates relative speedup } It would also be great if the library let you do many runs, averaging them and calculating the variance in timing!
