How is the 'Likelihood Approach' different from the Bayesian approach? It's very different. Bayesians interpret probabilities in subjectivist terms as the measure of belief. They also use priors, so out-of-data knowledge, as parts of the models. Those are core concepts of the Bayesian approach, that is completely lacking from the likelihoodist approach. Why do we not hear much about the 'Likelihood Approach'? Because it blended with mainstream statistics. Maximum likelihood is one of the most popular ways of estimating model parameters, the likelihood ratio tests are commonly used. The discussion is usually about Bayesian vs non-Bayesian approaches because of the “controversial” ideas mentioned above. In the discussions, you would often see people using “frequentist” as a catch-all term for non-Bayesians.
