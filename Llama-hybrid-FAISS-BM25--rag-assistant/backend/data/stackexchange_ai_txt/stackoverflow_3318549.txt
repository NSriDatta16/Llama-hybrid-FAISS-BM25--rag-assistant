To take a screenshot in the terminal with ImageMagick, type the following line into a terminal and then click-and-drag the mouse over a section of the screen: import MyScreenshot.png To capture the entire screen and after some delay and resize it, use the following command: import -window root -resize 400Ã—300 -delay 200 screenshot.png You may use a mixture of xwininfo and import to retrieve the window id of the browser and make a screenshot of that window. A bash script to automate this process would be something like this: #!/bin/bash window_id=`xwininfo -tree -root | grep Mozilla | awk '{print $1}'` import -window $window_id -resize 100x100 tumb.png This script will create a 100x100 screenshot of Firefox on the current directory under the name tumb.png Several sources show how to run a bash script from inside a Java application, google can help you on that. If you are in a hurry, check this and this .
