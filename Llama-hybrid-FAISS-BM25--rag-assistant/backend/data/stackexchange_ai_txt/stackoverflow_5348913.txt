How do I embed an open-source project in a django project for GAE?

I am a python newbie. Can anybody tell me how I will be embed an open-source project in my django project for GAE? Let's say I would like to embed Python markdown . Can anybody show me a direction? Can I just copy and paste my source into my django folder and modify something in the settings.py to get it done? The reason for embedding the source is that GAE does not allow egg files running in it.
