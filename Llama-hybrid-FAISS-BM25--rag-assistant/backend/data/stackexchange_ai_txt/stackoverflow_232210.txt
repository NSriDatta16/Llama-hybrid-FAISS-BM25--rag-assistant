It also depends on what your stored procedures are doing. For example if it's just select a from b where x = y then a stored procedure is probably overkill. But I personally tend to use stored procs to return multiple result sets and page results within the database. In my cases I can see a benefit to using them. It is an extra layer to deal with but if you have your code well organised and logical I don't see too much hassle personally. A good project with stored procedures is always going to be better than a shoddy project without and vice versa.
