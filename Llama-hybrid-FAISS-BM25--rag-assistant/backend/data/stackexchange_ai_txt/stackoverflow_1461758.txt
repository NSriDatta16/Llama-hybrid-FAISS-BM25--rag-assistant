Let me introduce you to my good friend Bayes... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference Edit: Part 1) Bayes will only work for non-independent trials. If winning one game somehow increases your probability of winning the next, you can carry on! Otherwise this isn't very helpful at all. Edit: Part 2) Regardless, the base is the following Bayes' Formula. P(A|B) = P(B|A) P(A) ----------- P(B) Which is read, "The probability of A given B is equal to Prob. B given A times Prob of A all over Prob. of B". To illustrate this, the car salesman with 3 doors problem is often given. You have 3 doors and behind one door there's a brand new car. The other two doors have absolutely nothing. The host then asks you to pick a door. Remember, there is door 'A', 'B' and 'C'. Therefore, you have a 1/3 probability of being correct. The host, being a generous guy, opens one of the other doors. He now gives you the option of either sticking with the same door or opening the other door. I realized that explaining this in a Stackoverflow reply would take forever and just googled it. This is the Monty Hall problem: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem . http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem#Bayesian_analysis for the Bayes section. Edit: Part 3) You may want to look up 'Bayesian Networks' if you decide this sort of approach can work (but on a much grander scheme)
