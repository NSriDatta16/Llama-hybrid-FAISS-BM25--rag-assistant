Due to the Propensity Score Theorem, the propensity score can serve as a dimension reduction - especially if you have many covariates, matching based on covariates is not easily feasible. The propensity score has the additional advantage of matching only on covariates that actually determine selection - in a standard matching on all covariates, each cocariate would receive the same attention whether or not they actually contributed to the selection bias. The reason why logistic regression is chosen is because it yields unbiased estimates of the propensity score. You can use other ML techniques, but these require modification to remove biases (I recommend https://docs.doubleml.org/stable/guide/basics.html and the associated paper for background details)
