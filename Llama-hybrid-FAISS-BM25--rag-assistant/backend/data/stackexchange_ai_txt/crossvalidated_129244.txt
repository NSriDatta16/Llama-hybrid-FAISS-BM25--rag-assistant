A single document as input to LDA?

We use topic modelling usually on a collection of documents - which makes the input. But what if I only have a single document where I want to see the underlying topics in it? I have heard that you can break them by paragraphs in cases like that, but what is the need for that? Does that mean I can't use latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) or it is not supposed to use with a single document as the input?
