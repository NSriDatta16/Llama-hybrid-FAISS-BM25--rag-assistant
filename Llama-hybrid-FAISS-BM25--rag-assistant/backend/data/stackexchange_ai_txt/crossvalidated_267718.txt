How to interpret the results of a Bayesian GLM logistic regression?

I'm running a Bayesian GLM logistic regression because a traditional GLM reported perfect separation issues. However, I'm new to this type of regression and I'm not sure how to interpret coefficients here. Is there a way to know which coefficients are significant as in a normal logistic regression? In my original model I'm trying to identify a U-shaped relationship between Y and X. How can I know if such relationship is there and significant? coef.est coef.se (Intercept) -0.15 3.48 Control1 -4.38 6.14 Control2 -3.46 8.01 Control3 0.19 0.27 Control4 0.00 0.02 Control5 0.72 0.36 Control6 0.03 0.19 Control7 -1.39 2.14 Control8 0.59 1.18 Control9 0.38 0.50 as.factor(SIC1)2 0.38 1.18 as.factor(SIC1)3 -0.12 1.25 as.factor(SIC1)4 0.52 1.44 as.factor(SIC1)5 0.10 1.20 as.factor(SIC1)6 -0.33 1.12 as.factor(SIC1)7 0.34 1.99 as.factor(SIC1)8 -1.51 1.21 X -3.19 1.42 X^2 0.35 0.21 --- n = 61, k = 19 residual deviance = 35.2, null deviance = 57.6 (difference = 22.4)
