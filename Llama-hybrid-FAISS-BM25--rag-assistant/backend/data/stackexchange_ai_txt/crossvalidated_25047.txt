What is the probability of rolling all faces of a die after n number of rolls

It is fairly easy to figure out what is the average number of rolls it would take to roll all faces of a die [$1 + 6/4 + 6/4 + 6/3 + 6/2 + 6/1 = 14.7$], but that got me thinking of a seemingly more complicated problem. If you roll a die 1-5 times, the odds of all faces showing is obviously 0. If you roll a die 6 times, the odds of all faces showing can easily be calculated as $$1 * (5/6) * (4/6) * (3/6) * (2/6) * (1/6) = .0154$$ or 1.54% This is where I get stuck. How to do it $n=7$ or more times and calculate it for general $n$? Any tips are helpful!
