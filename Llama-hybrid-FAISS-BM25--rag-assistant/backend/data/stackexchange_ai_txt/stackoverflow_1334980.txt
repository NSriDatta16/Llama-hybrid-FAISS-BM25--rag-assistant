I came to C# from Delphi a few years ago. I feel your pain. The .NET framework is a monster and it takes awhile to learn your way around. You are where you're supposed to be. I think you should start with a Winforms application. WinForms is the standard .NET framework for writing desktop apps. It will feel very similar to Delphi's designer. Drag-drop controls onto designer surface and assign properties and events. It's a mature .NET technology. Alot of people are going to push you toward WPF for desktop development, telling you to write WPF apps and winforms is dead, and such. IMO, The WPF design time experience sucks in VS2008. It's alledgedly improved in VS10. We'll see. Right now, people recommend Blend to design WPF, if you go that route. I would pick up a book on winforms and a book on ADO.NET. ADO.NET is a bit different than the standard data access functionality in Delphi. Also, Winforms has a much more flexible data-binding than Delphi. You can bind to anything practically in .NET. It's nice change for a Delphi dev. I would use the standard report control to write the reports. Once you are comfortable with WinForms, I would move on to ASP.NET, WPF, WCF or where ever you want. Good Luck!
