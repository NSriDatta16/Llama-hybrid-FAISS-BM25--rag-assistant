drag object vertically

i like to drag this object vertically instead of horizontally, which is doin it now: - (void)touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch = [[event allTouches] anyObject]; CGPoint location = [touch locationInView:touch.view]; if (CGRectContainsPoint(myObject.frame, location)){ CGPoint xLocation = CGPointMake(location.x, myObject.center.y); myObject.center = xLocation; } }
