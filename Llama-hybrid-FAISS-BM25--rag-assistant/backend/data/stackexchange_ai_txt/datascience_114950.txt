Time series data for Prophet model

I have a time series data that has some missing dates. For example, in the dataset below '2017-08-06' is missing. To enter this data in the Prophet model, do I have to create the data frame with all the missing dates? I know the Prophet model does not require the missing data for any specific time to be filled as it is a curve-fitting-based model. But I am unsure if all dates should be included for daily time series prediction. Thanks so much for answering my question.
