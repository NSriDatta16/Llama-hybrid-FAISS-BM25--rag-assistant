What are the most concrete and easiest to understand applications of deep learning in the industry?

I am a researcher in deep learning, and have given courses on the theory. Recently I was approached to give the same course adding sections using some very concrete examples of deep learning for companies. My audience will be industry managers never exposed to deep learning before. What are the most easily performed examples I could provide without having to develop millions of lines of code that can be of general interest to managers never exposed to deep learning before? These examples need to be quite concrete and easily applicable. In particular, they look for examples that can have the label "big data" slapped on them. I know about using ML for detecting digits, or all the other applications on kaggle, but they do not seem to care for those.
