Using multiple edmx file vs. one large edmx file?

I'm new to the Entity model thing and i'm looking for an advise how to organize my Entity model. should i create one entity model file (.edmx) which will contain all the tables in my database or should i break it logical files for user, orders, products, etc. Please let me know which one is better and what the pros/cons (if any) of each alternative. Thanks.
