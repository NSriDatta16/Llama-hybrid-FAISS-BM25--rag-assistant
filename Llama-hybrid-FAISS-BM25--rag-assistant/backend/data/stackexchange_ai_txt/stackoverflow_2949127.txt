anyone know of a custom membership provider implementation that check password strength against in-built dictionary

I've got an Asp.net MVC app and before being able to go live, the IT have requested for us to comply with their password policy. The flexibility of AspnetSqlMembershipProvider doesnâ€™t quite satisfy the requirement. The password strength and length rules are as follows: one lowercase one Uppercase one number and or special character 8 characters in length so far, aspnetsqlmembershipprovider is good... Not allowed to use: Dictionary words Names, real or fictional Plain language phrases Dates Telephone numbers Car registration numbers User IDs Postal codes Organization name Only the first 4 criteria are satisfied by the aspnetsqlmembershipprovider. Do you know of any third party products that offers this functionality (preferably in the form of a custom membership provider)?
