Have you taken a look at the technique in the XSLT Cookbook? http://books.google.com/books?id=POJkiuHIAfoC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA324#v=onepage&q=&f=false Mr. Mangano has a recipe for set difference, and a fairly well written explanation as well. Mind you, when you are comparing two elements that seem to be the same but have two different source documents, XSLT will usually report them as different, so you must test by the value of the element, attributes, etc. You might want to poke at the example code from the book, provided here: http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596009748
