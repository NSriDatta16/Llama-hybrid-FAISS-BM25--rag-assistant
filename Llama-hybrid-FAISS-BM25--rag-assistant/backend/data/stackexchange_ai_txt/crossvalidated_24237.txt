As the comments suggest, either method could work in a practical sense and @Macro might be right that the results should be similar so long as the diagnostics check out. Particularly when the response is centred around 0.5, linear regression is often not a bad approximation. However, it falls apart as the responses get towards 0 and 1, because a) the variance of the response tends to get smaller at those points, invalidating various OLS assumptions and b) you start getting predicted values outside of the allowable (0,1) range. Because of that, I think the answer to your question "which is the natural method to use?" is definitely logistic regression . As @Dason pointed out, if you know the number of games you can easily do this (eg in R, if the response is a proportion, you can set the weights to be the number of games). In contrast, I can't think of any reason why you'd prefer linear to logistic regression.
