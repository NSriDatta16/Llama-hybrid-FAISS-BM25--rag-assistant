Outcome variable coding for multinomial logistic regression with "I don't know" choice option

I have a categorical outcome variable "Type of intervention" with 3 levels: "Type A", "Type B", & "cannot decide". The "cannot decide" option is meaningful, i.e. it could be the case that group membership in one or more of my b/n subjects conditions results in more "cannot decide" answers. Based on my limited stat knowledge, I should use a multinomial logistic model, since the outcome var. is categorical, and has more than 2 levels. My question is related to the type of coding needed here for the outcome: usually, multinomial regressions use dummy coding, with "0" row values for the reference category. However, I don't think I have a meaningful reference category here - the "cannot decide" does not sound like it. I am essentially comparing choices for "Type A with choice of "Type B". How should I code the outcome var. in this case? Thank you very much in advance.
