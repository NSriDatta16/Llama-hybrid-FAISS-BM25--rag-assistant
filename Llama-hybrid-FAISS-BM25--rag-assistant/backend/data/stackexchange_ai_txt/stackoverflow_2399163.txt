A ','.join as suggested in other answers is the typical Python solution; the normal approach, which peculiarly I don't see in any of the answers so far, is print ','.join(str(x) for x in a) known as a generator expression or genexp. If you prefer a loop (or need one for other purposes, if you're doing more than just printing on each item, for example), there are of course also excellent alternatives: for i, x in enumerate(a): if i: print ',' + str(x), else: print str(x), this is a first-time switch (works for any iterable a, whether a list or otherwise) so it places the comma before each item but the first. A last-time switch is slightly less elegant and it work only for iterables which have a len() (not for completely general ones): for i, x in enumerate(a): if i == len(a) - 1: print str(x) else: print str(x) + ',', this example also takes advantage of the last-time switch to terminate the line when it's printing the very last item. The enumerate built-in function is very often useful, and well worth keeping in mind!
