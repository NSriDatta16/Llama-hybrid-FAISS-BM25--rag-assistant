Weird Error In My system.log file Over and Over and Over

In Magento Enterprise 1.8 I am getting a particular error over and over again and I was wondering if someone else has had this problem and what they did to solve it. The error is: Invalid block type: Mage_CatalogInventory_Block_Qtyincrements I am also seeing a lot of there: Invalid block type: Mage_Navadmin_Block_Navadmin
