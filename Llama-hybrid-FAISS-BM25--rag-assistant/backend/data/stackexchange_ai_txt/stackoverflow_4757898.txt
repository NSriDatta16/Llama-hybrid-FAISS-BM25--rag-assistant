lazy SlidingDrawer

I'm using a SlidingDrawer and it works quite well in my application but... is it possible to have one that doesn't open or close entirely when the handle is touched? I'll try to explain better: dragging the handle up and down, my SlidingDrawer opens and closes correctly following up my finger but, when I stop touching, the view completes showing or hiding its content by itself (depending on its previous state). Is it possible to have a SlidingDrawer that behaves exactly as described but, once the touch is released, stop open or close preserving the height shown so far? Thanks!
