EDIT: Is this a 2d vector? Or just two vectors? I answered this for a 2d vector. How should I handle the following situation I think you should handle it by removing the float constructor. From reading the code, it's unclear what kind of object you should expect from this. From reading the callsite code, I would have no reason to believe that vector2 v2(1, 5); creates a vector of two vectors, each with one value. Personally, I would have expected it to create a 1x5 matrix. If this is a common use case for your library, consider a named constructor : vector2 Create2x1(float f1, float f2); re: ASSERT The ASSERT is a nice sanity check, but requires your Iterator to support random access (or at least subtraction to find distance). This might overly restrict its usage. Consider using a std::distance or checking that local_vector_storage is size two afterwards.
