No, T-SNE does not have to result in clear clusters. It is a low dimension visualization of high dimension data. So, if you data points are well clustered in low dimension, it means that they can be classified in lower dimension. The idea behind T-SNE is to calculate probability of data points. Points far from each other have low probability. I would suggest to have a look at this link once, https://towardsdatascience.com/t-distributed-stochastic-neighbor-embedding-t-sne-bb60ff109561
