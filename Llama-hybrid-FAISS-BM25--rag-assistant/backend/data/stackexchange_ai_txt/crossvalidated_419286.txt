Can cross validation be applied to threshold based outlier detection model?

I have a threshold based outlier detection model. I apply PCA then calculate the distance from the centre of the features, and use the MSE to differentiate if the datapoint is a outlier. However, I was wondering if I can apply cross validation to prevent overfitting. Right now, my method is: 1. Spilt data into train, test. 2. Apply PCA on train data and measure the distance from the model, set a threshold. Eg: >500 is an outlier 3. Den i apply the same pipeline to the test data, and the same threshold. Qn: 1. Should I use cross validation on the train data set to make it more robust? 2. If I were to use cross validation, when should I use it?
