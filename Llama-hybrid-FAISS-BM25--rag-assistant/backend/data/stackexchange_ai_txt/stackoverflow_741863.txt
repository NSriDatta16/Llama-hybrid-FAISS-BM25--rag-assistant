If you're using SQL Server, I would strongly recommend NOT using VARCHAR(8000) or VARCHAR(MAX) for all fields..... you need to let common sense prevail here - make the field as big as you think you'll probably need it, add a little extra for unexpected length, and you're done :-) Also, I think it's a good idea to keep it to a few lengths that you use over and over again. E.g. I use VARCHAR(255) for most fields like street address or e-mail etc. that could be a bit longer, VARCHAR(50) for things like phone numbers etc., and VARCHAR(20) for short strings like zip code and such. Be pragmatic about it - find a style that works for you. Don't over-optimize, but don't go nuts the other way, either. Marc
