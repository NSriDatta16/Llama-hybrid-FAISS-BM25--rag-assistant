Guidelines for join/link/many to many tables

I have my own theories on the best way to do this, but I think its a common topic and I'd be interested in the different methods people use. Here goes Whats the best way to deal with many-to-many join tables, particularly as far as naming them goes, what to do when you need to add extra information to the relationship, and what to do whene there are multiple relationships between two tables? Lets say you have two tables, Users and Events and need to store the attendees. So you create EventAttendees table. Then a requirement comes up to store the organisers. Should you create an EventOrganisers table, so each new relationship is modelled with a join table or rename EventAttendees to UserEventRelationship (or some other name, like User2Event or UserEventMap or UserToEvent), and an IsAttending column and a IsOrganiser column i.e. You have a single table which you store all relationship info between two attendees or a bit of both (really?) or something else entirely? Thoughts?
