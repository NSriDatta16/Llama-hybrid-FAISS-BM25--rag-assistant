What does AR(max=1) mean?

http://cocodataset.org/#detection-eval "ARmax=1: AR given 1 detection per image" "AR is the maximum recall given a fixed number of detections per image, averaged over categories and IoUs." Above link, they described ARmax=1, but I didn't understand exactly. I understood general recall concept in machine learning or other areas. Could you explain ARmax=1 more detail ??
