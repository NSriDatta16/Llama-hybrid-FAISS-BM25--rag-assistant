Interface Builder 3.0 crashes on startup

I just bought a new Mac and am running Mac OS X 10.6.4 and trying to run Interface Builder 3.2.4 and when I do it consistently crashes with the following error message: Assertion Message: Unimplemented error handling: You don’t have permission to save the file “Library” in the folder “Interface Builder 3.0”. Thread 0 Asserted: 0 InterfaceBuilderKit 0x000000010011d74b -[IBLibraryController libraryStoragePath] + 419 1 InterfaceBuilderKit 0x000000010011d40c -[IBLibraryController userObjectsStoragePath] + 33 2 InterfaceBuilderKit 0x000000010011c8e8 -[IBLibraryController loadUserAssets] + 41 3 InterfaceBuilderKit 0x000000010011c83d -[IBLibraryController restoreUserPreferences] + 27 4 Interface Builder 0x0000000100002396 5 AppKit 0x00007fff8000d798 -[NSApplication run] + 80 6 AppKit 0x00007fff800065f8 NSApplicationMain + 364 7 Interface Builder 0x0000000100001c44 8 Interface Builder 0x0000000000000002 Does anyone have any thoughts on this? It seems like it would be easy enough to try and modify the permissions of a folder, but I have no clue where to find the folder “Interface Builder 3.0”.
