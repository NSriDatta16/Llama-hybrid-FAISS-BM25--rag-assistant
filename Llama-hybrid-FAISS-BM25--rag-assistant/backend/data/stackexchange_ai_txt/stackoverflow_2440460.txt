Input Sanitation Best Practices

Our team has recently been working on a logic and data layer for our database. We were not approved to utilize Entity or Linq to SQL for the data layer. It was primarily built by hand. A lot of the SQL is auto generated. An obvious down fall of this is the need to sanitize inputs prior to retrieval and insertion. What are the best methods for doing this? Searching for terms like insert, delete, etc seems like a poor way to accomplish this. Is there a better alternative?
