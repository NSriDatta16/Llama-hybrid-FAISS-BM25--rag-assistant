You can still use the Filestream type if you do not disable this. In low volume situations, as in one implementation that I administer, there have been no complaints about performance. This is with only 3-6 concurrent users looking at 1-2 images every minute, or there about. There is a daily job to dump updated blobs to a web server to actually host the images (up to 150 a day after initial load). I would say that the only way to really be sure is to test with the peak load that you expect before you put the server into production. According to msdn choosing to not disable the 8.3 feature may cause continued performance degradation as the change will only effect future files, so enumerating old files will be slower (not certain about that last part, but the msdn article does not specify if disabling after the fact will disregard the 8.3 names when locating files). You may also want to consider cluster size in your implementation if your blob data has predictable size patterns. If all files are between 25 and 30 KB you might want to set the cluster size at 32 just to reduce fragmentation and i/o ops (you will not want to go too big though because it will waste space on small files). Opinion following: If you know that you can change this setting and it will only prevent future problems, I would do it that way.
