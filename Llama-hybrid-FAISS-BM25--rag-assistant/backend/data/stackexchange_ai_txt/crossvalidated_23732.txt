I would personally favor cross-validated score evaluation because: it is easily interpretable by the analyst provided that the underlying score function (accuracy, f1-score, RMSE...) is interpretable too, it gives an idea of the uncertainty by looking at the stdev of the score values across CV folds, it gives a way to decompose the error into bias (error measured on train folds) and variance (difference of errors measured on train and test folds). Model size is not a factor with the computing power This is not always true: deep learning machine learning models for instance have a model size that is often limited by the hardware (typically the amount of RAM on the GPU card).
