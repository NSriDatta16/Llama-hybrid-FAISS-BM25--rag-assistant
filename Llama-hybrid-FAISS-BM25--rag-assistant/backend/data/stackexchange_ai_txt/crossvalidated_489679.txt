As pointed out by Robert, Site is a grouping factor in your study. To formulate the appropriate model, you will however need to determine whether you can treat Site as a fixed or random grouping factor in your modelling. Site as a fixed grouping factor If you were to repeat your study again, would you select the exact same 8 sites as before because these sites are the only ones you are interested in? If yes, you should treat Site as a fixed grouping factor. That means that you could formulate your models as linear regression models using the lm() function of R: # effect of fire_frequency on tree_height is assumed to be # the same across all 8 sites m1 Site as a random grouping factor If you were to repeat your study again, would you select the exact same 8 sites as before because these sites are the only ones you are interested in? If no, you should treat Site as a random grouping factor, since the 8 sites were selected to be representative of a larger set of sites you are truly interested in (ideally, they would have been selected at random from that larger set of sites). That means that you could formulate your model as a linear mixed effects regression model using the lmer() function of R: library(lme4) m A third possibility would be to use a GEE model - especially since your fire_frequency variable is a site-level predictor and GEE models can offer a more natural interpretation of its effect than mixed effects models.
