Plotting two variables as lines using ggplot2 on the same graph

A very newbish question, but say I have data like this: test_data How can I plot both time series var0 and var1 on the same graph, with date on the x-axis, using ggplot2 ? Bonus points if you make var0 and var1 different colours, and can include a legend! I'm sure this is very simple, but I can't find any examples out there.
