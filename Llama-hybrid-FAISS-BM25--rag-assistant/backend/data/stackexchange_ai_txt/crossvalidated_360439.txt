Reducing the dependency among variables

I am trying to perform a multi linear regression model: $$y_i = β_0 + β_1x_{i1} + β_2x_{i2} +... + β_px_{ip} + ε_i$$ where $$x_{i1}, x_{i2}, ..., x_{ip}$$ are highly correlated with each other (VIFs can be as low as 5 and high as 10). I am just wondering if there exists a procedure with the following properties: 1) reduces the collinearity of the variables (e.g. VIFs should be lower than 5 after the procedure) 2) the variables after the procedure should maintain the original meanings/interpretations.. (so PCA and FA are out). 3) not dropping any of the variables. I should have all p original varaibles.. (So LASSO and RIDGE are out)
