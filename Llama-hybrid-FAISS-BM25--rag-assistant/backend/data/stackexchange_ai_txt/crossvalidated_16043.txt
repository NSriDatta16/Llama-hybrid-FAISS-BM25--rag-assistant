There are many algorithms for trying to identify these properties. One powerful algorithm that you could look into is principal component analysis (PCA), which attempts to identify an orthogonal set of vectors that account for the maximum amount of variance in a set of data. This has applications in machine learning, data compression, and dimensionality reduction and can be implemented easily with most matrix packages using the SVD . Another, more powerful technique that's often used is independent component analysis , which I confess I know very little about. However, the lecture notes I've linked do an excellent job explaining the technique and its applications. Hope this helps!
