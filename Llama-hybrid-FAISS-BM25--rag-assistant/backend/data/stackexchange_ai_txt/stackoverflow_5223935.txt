I work for Flurry. We have many successful deployments on the Windows 7 platform. You and Buju may be experiencing an emerging issue that has not come to our attention previously. Please email winmosupport@flurry.com as the diagnosis may involve discussing account specific details. Once we determine the underlying cause we can post back to this thread so the community has the benefit of our investigation. Thanks for working with Flurry. Edit I just wanted to follow up on Mac's comment as the KeyNotFoundException may manifest in two ways during debugging. As Mac noted we do caputure the KeyNotFoundException, however, the debugger sees the exception first before we can handle it within our library. The debugger's behavior is dictated by the setting in Debug > Exceptions. If the checkboxes under Thrown are selected the program will be stopped and the stack trace above will be output. If the checkboxes under Thrown are not selected the output will generate an error like the following: A first chance exception of type 'System.Collections.Generic.KeyNotFoundException' occurred in mscorlib.dll (this is the message Buju received) The program will continue following this message as it just serves as a notice that an exception occurred somewhere within the program. More information on first chance exceptions can be found in the following articles: What is a first chance exception - http://blogs.msdn.com/b/davidklinems/archive/2005/07/12/438061.aspx How to handle (disable) first chance reporting - http://www.helixoft.com/blog/archives/24
