Do not, and I can only repeat, do not use mbstring overloading. It will most certainly break any method which, for instance, relies on strlen() returning the number of bytes. All components in Zend Framework expect UTF-8 by default, but can handle different charsets if you tell it to. That is done via iconv_*, which is built into PHP by default, so there are no dependencies on extra libraries like mbstring. The only thing were you have to tell Zend Framework about UTF-8 is your database connection, which you can simply do via the charset option (see Zend_Db or Zend_Application documentation). You surely also want to tell the user agent which charset you deliver via the content-type header. And don't forget to add accept-charset="utf-8" in your tags.
