Free public interest data hosting?

I have hourly and daily temperature reports for many stations at http://data.barrycarter.info/ I encourage people to download it, but, at 6.6G, it uses up a lot of bandwidth. Is there a service that hosts "public interest" data for free? I know about http://aws.amazon.com/publicdatasets , but you need an Amazon EC2 account to access that data.
