Personally, I'd use a function that swallows one character at a time. The function will use a finite state machine to do a simple regular expression match, saving details in a either static local variables or a parameter block structure. You need two sub-blocks - one for part-matched state, and one for the last complete match - each indicating the relevant positions or value as needed. In this case, you should be able to design this manually. For more complex requirements, look at Ragel .
