PC eigenvectors are dimensionless weights and do not themselves imply any change in units in individual variables when multiplied by the sample data. The PC scores are the sum of these multiplications across each variable. This means that if the units of all variables are identical then the units of the scores will be those of the variables. If the units of the variable differ then things get tricky. Multiplicative interactions between different units create a new unit, but additive ones do not. Dividing distance (km) by time (h) gives us speed (km h $^{-1}$ ) but adding distance and time doesn't give a physically meaningful unit. To be able to sum different variables to a physically meaningful unit requires transformation to a common scale. A common form of pre-processing is scaling to unit variance, which involves dividing each unit by its standard deviation. The units of standard deviation are identical to that of the individual values and the result of the division is cancelling of the units to give a dimensionless number of arbitrary units. To identify the units of the output you need to determine the units of the variables as these are input into the actual PCA.
