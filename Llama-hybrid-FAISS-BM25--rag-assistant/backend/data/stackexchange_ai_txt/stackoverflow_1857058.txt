Although this is an unusual use for excel, Assuming Each Concatenation operation takes memory just free up some memory before you run out. Not that elegant, although you could do 2000 rows copy and paste your Column A over itself as values. Optionally also deleting A2:AC2002 (the used data which may not be needed). Turning off Automatic calculation may also help. With Macro from the macro recorder simple record a macro of you doing this [relatively positioned]. Begin by selecting the formula you have done. Very crude code: Sub Macro5() With Application .EnableEvents = False .ScreenUpdating = False End With Dim i As Long For i = 0 To 32 Selection.Copy ActiveCell.Offset(1, 0).Range("A1:A2000").Select ActiveSheet.Paste Application.CutCopyMode = False ActiveCell.Offset(-1, 0).Range("A1:A2000").Select Selection.Copy Selection.PasteSpecial Paste:=xlPasteValues, Operation:=xlNone, SkipBlanks:=False, Transpose:=False Application.CutCopyMode = False ActiveCell.Offset(2000, 0).Range("A1").Select Next i With Application .EnableEvents = True .ScreenUpdating = True End With End Sub
