Abstract Methods in Number Class

Why is it that the Number Class provides abstract methods for conversion methods for Double, Int, Long, and Float but not abstract methods for byte and short? Overall I am slightly confused on when to use Abstract methods, as I just began learning Java. Thanks for any insight anyone can offer.
