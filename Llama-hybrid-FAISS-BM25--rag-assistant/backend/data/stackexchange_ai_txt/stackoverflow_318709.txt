Make Word's Cursor Type (Or More Text Insert) in Non-Italic After Turning Text Italic

When I perform the following code: Dim italicSaveRange As Word.Range Dim savedItalic As Variant Dim someRange As Word.Range Set italicSaveRange = someRange.Duplicate italicSaveRange.Collapse (WdCollapseEnd) savedItalic = italicSaveRange.Italic someRange.Italic = True italicSaveRange.Italic = savedItalic I expected that any text entered at the cursor or inserted into someRange a la: someRange.InsertAfter "Lorem ipsum..." would not be italic (assuming that the formatting was not italic at this position previously, of course.) But it is. Help. Based on your suggestion I now have the following, which appears to be working. It may be a fragile solution, depending on what gets moved around in the meantime (e.g., try typing some italic text into Word, ctrl-i to prepare to use non-italic, but then move the cursor left into the italics and then right out again; the cursor is inserting italic text...), but for my purposes where I am adding text elsewhere (but at a different level of the code so that I cannot access the text to insert at this level) this will probably work. Thank you. Set italicSaveRange = someRange.Duplicate italicSaveRange.Collapse (WdCollapseEnd) savedItalic = italicSaveRange.Italic someRange.Italic = True italicSaveRange.InsertAfter SP italicSaveRange.Characters(1).Italic = savedItalic italicSaveRange.Characters(1).Delete
