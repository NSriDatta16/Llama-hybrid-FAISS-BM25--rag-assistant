Estimating optimal number of items for adaptive testing

I am trying to find out what would be the optimal fixed length of a computer adaptive IRT scored ability test. I have the 2PL parameters of the items. I think the right question to ask is: How to estimate what is the average information gain of asking an additional question using maximum Fisher information (MFI from the package catR) criterion for selecting the additional question? Or How to estimate the correlation between results of test takers having done an eg. 30 item test (as the max realistic number) and tests with less number of items (again using MFI for asking another question)?
