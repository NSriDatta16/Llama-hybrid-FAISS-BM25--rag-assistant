Rotate HTML with JS as in Photoshop's free transform

I need to rotate some html content (let it be a div) by dragging a block inside it with a mouse. The content should rotate around it's center. Look at http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/app (drag an element from right to left and drag a circle inside it) for an example. Are there any plugins or solutions in js to do it? Thanks in advance.
