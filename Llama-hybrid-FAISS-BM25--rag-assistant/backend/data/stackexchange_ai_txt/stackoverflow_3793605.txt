Gandjustas answer is an ok solution if the your queries are not the core of your application. If this geometircal/spatial data is very important to you and you need speed when working with such data specifically you should look into geospatial extensions for your RDBMS. I will assume that you use mysql, you have spatial extensions on your disposal. With proper data types and indexes that will give you Distance(g1, g2) and other usefull functions.
