Aggregate cover_me results for rspec and cucumber

Before moving over to ruby 1.9.2 and cover_me I was using rcov. We don't tend to unit test controllers, relying instead on cucumber coverage. With rcov it was possible to aggregate the coverage results from both the cucumber and rspec runs. Is this possible with cover_me?
