Nice Question. I was able to get the delete function to work. It looks like you are following the pragmatic programmers Agile Web Development with Rails , Third Edition book. Here we go... To add_to_cart.html.erb I added the following table row, beside the last tr line item: 'inventories', :action => 'remove_cart_item', :id => "#{item.getinventoryid}"} %> To CartItem.rb model changed attr_reader :inventory, :quantity to attr_accessor :inventory, :quantity def getinventoryid @inventory.id end To Cart.rb model: changed attr_reader :items to attr_accessor :items def remove_inventory(inventory) @items.delete_if {|item| item.inventory == inventory } end To inventories_controller.rb: def remove_cart_item inventory = Inventory.find(params[:id]) @cart = find_cart @cart.remove_inventory(inventory) redirect_to_index("The item was removed") end
