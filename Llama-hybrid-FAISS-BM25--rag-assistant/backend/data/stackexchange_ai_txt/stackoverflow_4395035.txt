To quote something I read in a magazine recently 'code like it's 1996'. Trying to code elegantly and efficiently doesn't seem to return consistent results when you test your newsletter with multiple mail clients. When you test make sure you get your testers to do a foward of the message as sometimes fabulous coding will break in the forward. While I hate using tables for display, they will render more consistently across mail clients than floating or multi column DIVS will (particularly if the newsletter, etc is forwarded on from the original recipient to someone else). see also: http://www.netmag.co.uk/zine/discover-culture/create-the-perfect-newsletter Heeeeeelllooooo 1996!!
