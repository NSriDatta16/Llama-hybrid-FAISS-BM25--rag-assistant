In my case only happended the first time (using IE 7), maybe that happens on your local dev instance? I think there's not much you can do, even MSDN pages tells you that "a message will appear on top of...", things that could mitigate this: Warn the user that the message will be shown, then once he clicks the app is reset (Store the current app state in the isolated storage, when you receive the reset reload the app with the settings). Open a popup, and in the popup include and standard HTML button to download. HTH Braulio
