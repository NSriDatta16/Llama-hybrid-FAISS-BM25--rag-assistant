Zero- and one-inflated beta GAMM (Generalized additive mixed model) in mgcv

I have vegetation cover (%) data [0,1] that includes 0's and 1's that I'd like to model with a beta GAMM, but don't understand the method for doing so. I've read that if the data includes 0's and 1's this makes it a "zero- and one- inflated model" which it involves adjusting eps within the family argument, but the instructions for what values that should take are not clear to me. All I can gather from other posts is that increasing eps within betar() needs to be done. From the mgcv pdf: in betar(theta = NULL, link = "logit", eps=...) , eps can be set to betar(theta = NULL, link = "logit",eps=.Machine$double.eps*100) , but the context for this value is lost on me. Alternatively it can be set to eps , which I assume is to ensure my values of 0 and 1 don't actually hit the [0,1] boundaries, but this doesn't make sense biologically. Maybe it doesn't need to? I have many random effects that I need to include as this is a longitudinal study with fixed sites, within seasons, and years. My data has 903 rows, but only 3 values = 1 and zeros "can" be present (each value of "cover" is an average of 10 replicate quadrats of vegetation cover, so in theory, the mean of all 10 could be 0 at some point). Example data: # (Mean of 10 reps per site) Vegetation cover (%) x $site site $year year $year) x$ year.std $year - min(x$ year) x $season season
