Logistic regression using Longitudinal Data

I want to know the factors affecting stunting status among children. My data was taken from year 2003 data and the same children in year 2011. So my data was a longitudinal data. I want to know which factors makes the children become stunted. My dependent variable is stunting status (0=normal, 1=stunted) and my independent variables were socio-demographic and feeding practices (based from their young age 2003) (all categorical variables). Can anyone help?
