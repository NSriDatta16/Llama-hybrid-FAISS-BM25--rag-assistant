It's probably a reference to Neural Prolog. Neural Prolog-the concepts, construction and mechanism http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=538347 This article introduces a Prolog-like inference system based on Neural Logic. A brief introduction of the background of this research is given first. The logical basis, knowledge construction and inference mechanism of Neural Prolog are described An integration of Prolog and neural networks to deal with sensibility in logic programs http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=138740 Neuro-Prolog, which integrates the Prolog interpreter C-Prolog and the neural network simulator SunNet, is described. By using Neuro-Prolog, users can handle both definite information, such as logical rules, and indefinite information, such as sensibility, concurrently in a single system. In Neuro-Prolog, the definite information is handled in Prolog and the indefinite information is handled in neural networks.
