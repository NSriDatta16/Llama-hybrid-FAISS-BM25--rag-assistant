jQuery Cross-Browser Performance Issues

I am wrapping up a project in which I used jQuery for the first time. I loved working with the library, and thought I understood one of the benefits was cross-browser compatibility. I had an unpleasant surprise waiting for me when I began testing the site in IE6 and IE7 because in many many instances, the JavaScript (which is not terribly complex) does not work. Can anyone offer some general comments on what jQuery does and does not do from a cross-browser standpoint? Any tips for debugging jQuery/JS in IE?
