You could also checkout the Gantry framework RocketTheme is developing. It is based on the 960 Grid System, and has some neat feature which I think may meet your needs more elegantly. For your case, you can set different layouts per menu item from within the Admin / Template. And it has 65 base modules in the Gantry code, which you can throw around rather easily. BTW - can you provide the URL of your client's site?
