Applying SMOTE and PCA to high dimensional data giving low accuracy

I have a high dimensional datasets of around 2300+ columns. The dataset consist of two class labels of which one is extremely biased and occurs less than 10%. I looked at the various algorithms and found that for high dimensional biased data we can apply resampling algorithms such as SMOTE first and then apply PCA and then build a training model. At first I resample the entire training dataset and did cross validation and I achieved recall for the biased label closed to 84%. Then I found that we have to only resample the training dataset and not on the testing set. So I applied resampling algorithm on 90% of training set and then tested on 10% of testing set. In this case also, I applied PCA as a filtering mechanism using WEKA and then tested the model. But I see the percentage dropped significantly to 46% when I use kNN using WEKA. Other classifiers were giving very worse results. Can anyone tell me if I have followed proper approach ? If then, how can I improve the accuracy ?
