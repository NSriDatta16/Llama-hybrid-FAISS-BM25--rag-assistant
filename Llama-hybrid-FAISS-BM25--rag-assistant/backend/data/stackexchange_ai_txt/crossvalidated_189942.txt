There are multiple ways to tackle this including Product of Experts (PoE), Generalised Product of Experts (gPoE), Bayesian Committee Machines (BCM), Robust Bayesian Committee Machines (rBCM). All of these methods assume independence between the gaussian processes and differ with regard to weighting the GPs (known as local experts) based on heuristics and / or removing the accumulative weighting of the prior. Anyway, Marc Deisenroth gives a good description of them in his ICML paper last year. The equations are literally just a few lines of code too which is nice ;)
