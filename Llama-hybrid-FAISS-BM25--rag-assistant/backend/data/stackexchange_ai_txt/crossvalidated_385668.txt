How to know if a conditional independence is true or false

I'm learning Bayesian networks and I have to "guess" if the following conditional independence are true or false using the following table: And the conditional independence are: $I_p(A, B)$ $I_p(A, C)$ p is the probability distribution. A = a , B = b , and C = c . I have no idea about how to know or which operation do I have to do to know if those conditional independence are true or false. What do I have to do to know if those conditional independence are true or false?
