I wouldn't worry about the size of the index :-) We go for option 1 all the time and never filter data outside of lucene.net. You could end up in a situation where you need to retrieve a LOT of hits from lucene.net before you get the number of "true" hits after filtering in the database - it could also require several roundtrips to the database. We currently have around 100 fields in average on our 150K documents and that is working extremely well.
