I have been successful with AdHoc distribution. Thought of posting this info for someone else so it will help. From Program Portal > Provisioning > Distribution, you need to create a AdHoc provisioning profile. Download the AdHoc mobile provisioning file and make sure it's installed in your machine. Followed by this you should go to xCode and build the project as you would for Distributing. Make sure you select the "AdHoc mobile provisioning" for Code Signing under Build section properties. And Entitlements.plist specified. Also verify Build results as per document says. Follow the documentation from Program Portal user Guide, for Build steps. Then you can drag the .app and .mobileprovision file (you used for AdHoc distribution) to iTunes account. It installs the App for you. You can then sync to device. It works great. You need to send just the .app & .mobileprovision file to people who want to preview the App before it can go to AppStore. Their UDID's (device ID's) should have been registered in your Program Portal account.
