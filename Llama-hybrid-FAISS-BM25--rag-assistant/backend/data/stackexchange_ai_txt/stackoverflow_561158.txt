Database fields are used for storing single items of data. Any data structures must be mapped to columns and tables in the database - not added to individual database fields. What sort of data are you storing? If you want to do any kind of indexing or searching of the individiual items of the array then you'd be far better coming up with a database design to reflect the data you're modelling (so an array of cartesian coordinates mgiht map to a table containing x,y and z columns). If this is to simply store some data for later retrieval then you can add it as a BLOB field and just serialize and deserialize to and from it.
