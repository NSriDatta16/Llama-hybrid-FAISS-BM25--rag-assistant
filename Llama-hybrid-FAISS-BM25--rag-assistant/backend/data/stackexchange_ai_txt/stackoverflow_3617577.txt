Rails 3 and undo last action button

Which solution would you prefer to use with Rails 3 in order to provide gmail like undo option instead of confirmation popups? I would like to allow user to undo last action, which would then revert the changes in tables made by that action. So far I was trying to get things done using Memento gem. Its not ideal, but things worked. The problem is, that this gem doesn't seem very active and it won't work with Rails. I would like to find something more elegant for Rails3. Any ideas?
