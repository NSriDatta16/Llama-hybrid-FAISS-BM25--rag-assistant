AS3 Specify if there are unvisible displayObjects with active listeners

Is there any way to count (specify) the avarage amount of objects that are removed from stage and has active listeners? I have really big project(game), more than 100 classes.. Now i scan each classes, if there are active unnecessary listeners i remove them. Now, i wanna such a tool, which will tell me where is there any other unnecessary listeners, or at least tell me if there are everything ok. It's like a stupid question, maybe you can suggest me any tool to control listeners. Thank you
