But couldn't you just log the data to eliminate stationarity and use an arma model instead? Yes, in some situations you can use a log-transform to make a series a stationary time series that can be well modelled with an ARMA model (See also the question When to log transform a time series before fitting an ARIMA model ). So that is when the model is multiplicative, and then the logarithm makes sense. But for a model generated by linear additions, I think, it does not make sense. For instance when you have something like $$X_t = 1.01 X_{t-1} + \epsilon_t$$ then the curve may look like having an exponential trend. But just because it looks like an exponential curve taking the logarithm is not automatically turning it into a pretty ARMA model. I think ( I am not sure) it might be better, after all, to fit such an explosive model with an ARMA model anyway.
