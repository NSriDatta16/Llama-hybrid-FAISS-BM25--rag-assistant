Logistic regression for hierarchical / nested (3 level) data

Research Problem We are trying to help universities recruit as many students as possible for different projects for a good cause. To be eligible for any project offered by their university, students can self-register online via a brief form that asks for contact information and some more data. Some questions are mandatory, others aren’t. We see that a lot of students drop out filling in the form. (BTW this is not my real research problem, but will serve as a good analogy). So our hypothesis is: The number (and type) of questions influence the drop out rate above and beyond other predictors. The more (mandatory) fields, the lower the probability of a student submitting the form. Data Structure Our research question seems quite simple, but the structure of our data has some pitfalls: Each row is a student that opened an application form with their respective university (e.g. city), project (e.g. project category) and individual level variables (e.g. sex, device they opened the form with) The two predictor variables of interest are on yet another level, the application form level (see details below). These are the only numeric predictors, all confounding variables are categorical. The outcome is whether the student submitted the application form or not (Boolean) The data is hierarchical: We have a total of ~80 universities with a total of ~4,000 different projects and ~30,000 rows (students). All distributions are skewed: Some universities have hundreds of projects, some have only two. Some projects have hundreds of student applicants, some have less than 10. We know from exploratory data analysis that within each university and project, submission rates do share a high proportion of variance so we want to consider that. The application forms do not vary a lot between universities / projects and if they do, they are mostly the same within any university: Each university can have their own application form, but many use the same default form that contains only 4 mandatory fields Most universities do use one form for all student recruitment, but some use different form types for different project categories This means that also in the predictor variables, we tend to have unbalanced classes / little variance in the no. of fields So overall, we have a lot of multicollinearity in the data if we use it row-wise. Question / Current Approach Our question is IF AND HOW we can robustly measure the effect of the number of fields on the outcome (students submits form or not) in such a way that it does not only reflect the differences between the universities (or projects). We were thinking about either including university and project IDs as confounding variables into our logistic regression model, or hierarchical modelling. But is this even possible with so many different universities and projects? Alternatively, we could aggregate the data on project level and compute dummy variables for the individual level variables, e.g. “ratio_male” = 0.27. We could then use the submission rates per project as the outcome variable for a (weighted) linear regression. But wouldn’t that make us lose lots of information? And in any case, the data would still be hierarchical (projects nested in universities)… Thanks so much in advance for any input!
