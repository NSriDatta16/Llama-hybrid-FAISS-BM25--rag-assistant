Perhaps Spring Security would be useful? Your webapp could leverage Spring Security and use whatever login mechanism you need (i.e., you could do the default form-based authentication or Basic Auth for now, and replace the login/auth piece with an OAuth implementation when you're ready), but still have Spring Security manage authorization to particular resources in your webapp. Someone has also built OAuth for Spring Security , so it may be a useful addition to your web app all around.
