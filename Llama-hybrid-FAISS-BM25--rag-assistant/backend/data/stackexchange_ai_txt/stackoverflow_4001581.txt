Could you do something as simple as having a BOOL ivar called goingForward on VC2 that gets set to YES by VC1 prior to -pushViewController:animated: call and set to NO by VC3 prior to -popViewControllerAnimated: ... and then check goingForward in VC2's -viewWillAppear? I am sure that there are more elegant ways of doing this (and look forward to reading about them) - but this should work, don't you think?
