Microsoft Sql Management Studio, SQL Server Agent, Build a Insert Bulk with dynamic parameters

Here is the syntax to start with (classified data omitted) BULK INSERT [dbName].[dbo].[data_200801] FROM '\\servername\wwwroot\path\Files\data_200904.csv' WITH ( FIELDTERMINATOR = ';', ROWTERMINATOR = '\n' ); This works fine as one of the step of the job. Where I hit a wall is that I need the file name to be dynamic with a SQL function such as Filename = data_ & Year(GetDate()) & Month(GetDate()) & .csv I can't seem to be able to concatenate the dynamic feature in my job. Can someone who likes chalenges help me? Thank you
