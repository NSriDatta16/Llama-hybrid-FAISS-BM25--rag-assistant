I don't have time to read your entire code, but please pay attention to the following: you may be copying a HTML chunk and creating a clone of it in your code. This way, you actually get two textboxes with the same Id, although you see only one of them. At postback, the browser concatenates the values as a comma-separated list. For example, if you enter "Test1" and "Test2" in the textboxes, respectively, and then submit, both textboxes get the value doubled. Now, if you only expand one of them (the first, let's say), and submit, only the expanded one gets doubled again, while the one not expanded stays the same over postbacks. For a solution, if you only need to show or hide a div, the best way is to do it from javascript, client side, by changing the style (visibility) of that div, and not by cloning it. This way, your function could be reduced to one line of code.
