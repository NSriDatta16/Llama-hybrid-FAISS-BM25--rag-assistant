Text-Classification-Problem: Is Word2Vec/NN the best approach?

I am looking to design a system that given a paragraph of text will be able to categorize it and identify the context: Is trained with user generated text paragraphs (like comments/questions/answers) Each item in the training set will be tagged with . So for e.g. ("category 1", , "text paragraph") There will be hundreds of categories What would be the best approach to build such a system? I have been looking at a few different options and the following is a list of possible solutions. Is Word2Vec/NN the best solution at the moment? Recursive Neural Tensor Network fed with averaged Word2Vec data RNTN and The Paragraph Vector ( https://cs.stanford.edu/~quocle/paragraph_vector.pdf )? TF-IDF used in a Deep Belief Network TF-IDF and Logistic Regression Bag of words and Naive Bayes classification
