It basically says that patients should be told about all meaningful risks of a procedure, even if these risks are very small in statistical terms. Now, from a stats perspective, there are two main approaches - Frequentist and Bayesian. Frequentists look at the long-term frequency of an event, so a doctor might use this to say the risk is very low based on lots of data. However, Bayesians would start with this general knowledge but then update it with specifics about the patient, like their age or health condition. While both methods might lead to the same decision about a procedure, the key thing from the court ruling is to make sure all meaningful risks are shared with the patient. That's where technology could help! Think about a medical app that gives up-to-date, personalized risk assessments. It could help doctors explain risks and help patients make informed decisions.
