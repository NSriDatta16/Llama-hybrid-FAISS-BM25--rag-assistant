Singularity issues in Gaussian mixture model

In chapter 9 of the book Pattern recognition and machine learning, there is this part about Gaussian mixture model: To be honest I don't really understand why this would create a singularity. Can anyone explain this to me? I'm sorry but I'm just an undergraduate and a novice in machine learning, so my question may sound a little silly, but please help me. Thank you very much
