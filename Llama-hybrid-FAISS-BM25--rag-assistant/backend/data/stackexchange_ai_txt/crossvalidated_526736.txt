Stop stan when it reaches convergence (Rhat = 1)

I'm doing a Bayesian analysis, which involves changing the warmup and iterations (many times per day). I wanted to know if there is a loop to automatically change warmups and interactions and stop the model when it reaches convergence (Rhat = 1)? If it exists? Where can I get information on this? Thanks in advance.
