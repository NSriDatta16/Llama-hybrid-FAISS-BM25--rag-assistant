Input data for this dataset to be feed into keras for training

Suppose I have 3 csv files which forms the dataset for training a machine learning model in Keras. file1.csv Name, X1, X2, X3 Joe, 1.16, 1.00, 1.11 Joe, 1.19, 1.11, 1.17 Joe, 1.17, 1.13, 1.16 file2.csv Name, X1, X2, X3 Jack, 1.81, 1.23, 1.15 Jack, 1.34, 1.53, 1.87 Jack, 1.35, 1.64, 1.75 file3.csv Name, X1, X2, X3 Bo, 1.42, 1.64, 1.43 Bo, 1.35, 1.53, 1.32 Bo, 1.46, 1.64, 1.53 Based on the data, I will classify whether the person has good or bad performance. For the data above, Joe has good performance while the rest have bad performance. In keras, the above dataset will be transformed into numpy ndarrays X_train and Y_train to be fed into model.fit() like below; model.fit(X_train, Y_train, nb_epoch=5, batch_size = 128, verbose=1, validation_split=0.1) I am confused over how X_train and Y_train should look like. What should be the shape of X_train and Y_train ? Suppose I have the following dataframes read from the csv files. df1 = pd.read_csv(file1.csv) df2 = pd.read_csv(file2.csv) df3 = pd.read_csv(file3.csv) How should I use these dataframes to get X_train and Y_train ? I am using python v3, keras with tensorflow.
