Passing arguments in a nested For Range loop in Python 2.5

I'm just learning Python and am trying to figure out how to pass an argument in a 'for range' loop to a variable. In the code below, I would like the 'months' variable to be the names of the months (Jan, Feb, etc). Then I'm trying to get the user prompt for the 'sales' variable to read 'Enter the sales for Jan'. Then with the next iteration, move to the next month - 'Enter the sales for Feb' Thank you for any suggestions. def main(): number_of_years = input('Enter the number of years for which you would like to compile data: ') total_sales = 0.0 total_months = number_of_years * 12 for years in range(number_of_years): for months in range(1, 13): sales = input('Enter sales: ') total_sales += sales print ' ' print 'The number of months of data is: ', total_months print ' ' print 'The total amount of sales is: ', total_sales print ' ' average = total_sales / total_months # variable to average results print 'The average monthly sales is: ', average main()
