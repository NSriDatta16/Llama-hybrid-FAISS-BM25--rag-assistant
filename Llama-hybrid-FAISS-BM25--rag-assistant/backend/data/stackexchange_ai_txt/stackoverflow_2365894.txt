Companion sample Xcode project for "Apple Help Programming Guide"?

Does anyone know of a sample Xcode project that demonstrates how to provide user help and which closely follows the guidelines of the "Apple Help Programming Guide" ? The guide's revision history shows that one of the more recent new guidelines is to organize help books in a bundle . I'm experiencing some trouble following this guideline. Unfortunately AFAIK the guide does not make any mention of a downloadable sample Xcode project; and I cannot find any application installed on my 10.5 system with a help book organized into a bundle. Does anyone know of a sample project or at least an open-source project which follows this "help book in a bundle" guideline?
