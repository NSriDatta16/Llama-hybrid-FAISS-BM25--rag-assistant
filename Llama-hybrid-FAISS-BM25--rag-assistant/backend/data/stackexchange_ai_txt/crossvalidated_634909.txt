Your intercept values (estimates of outcome at reference conditions) are approximately 1.74 for all your models (1.73, 1.72, 1.76), while the largest disease.state coefficient has a magnitude of only about 0.07. That's a pretty small difference from the intercept. The degrees of freedom (df) values suggest that you have thousands of individuals in each group. Thus you were able to distinguish "statistically significant" disease.state coefficients down to a magnitude of 0.03 or so. For your disease.stateIJ and disease.stateKL values, the Main Model values are pretty close to the averages of the values from the Male and Female subset models; the Male values had magnitudes greater than 0.03 while the Female values were below 0.02 in magnitude. The above suggests that the Male-Female differences in some coefficient values are real. A more efficient way to test the Male-Female differences is to use an interaction model rather than separate subset analyses, for example: lmer(y ~ disease.state * sex + (1 | id), dt) This has the advantage of using information from all cases in a single model. The interaction coefficients would then demonstrate directly the disease.state values for which there was a "statistically significant" difference between Males and Females. You need to apply your understanding of the subject matter to determine whether those differences might be important in practice.
