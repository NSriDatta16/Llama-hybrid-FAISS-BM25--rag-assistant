Magento ::: How do I include a custom block in my templates?

I need to include a custom block on my templates, and even thoguh I read several instructions on how to do it, none seem to work, and none answer all issues (for me). I have a template file here: [templates]/aw_blog/blog-bottom.phtml I am using a custom theme according to best practices for Magento 1.4.1 and up, so I am working with local.xml to override the page.xml in the base theme. In my 2column-left.phtml template, I call the blog-bottom template like so: getChildHtml('blog-bottom') ?> So I know that the missing link is local.xml, but the various options I tried produce no results. So, what is the correct way to refer to this block in local.xml so that it is available to pages using 2column-left? I have both CMS and category pages using 2column left, and I'd want to show this block on all of them. Thanks.
