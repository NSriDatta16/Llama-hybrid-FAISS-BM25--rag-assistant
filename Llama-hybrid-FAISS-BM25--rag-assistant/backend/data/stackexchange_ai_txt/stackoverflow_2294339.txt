Organization of many bundles (like System Preferences.app)

I'm working on a project which organizes many separate bundles onto a System Preferences-like screen, in categories. First, how does System Preferences organize its pref panes into categories? A quick glance in the pref panes' bundles reveals no obvious category info. Second, how should I organize my bundles into categories? Right now, I've got nested bundles, where the category bundles are pretty much just an Info.plist with the category's name and the order of its sub-bundles. This is, of course, disgusting to manage in Xcode. I've tried separate projects; I've tried one big project with many targets; nothing seems clean.
