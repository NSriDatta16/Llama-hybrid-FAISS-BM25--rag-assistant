You need to define the training features and train against them for given result. Imagine people are voting on dish. So let's ask them, what do they consider for the vote and we get the features: price, size, vegan. A data set will contain, the measurement on each feature of the dish: $15 ; 300g ; No ; 1 $20 ; 450g ; Yes ; 0 ... $9.95 ; 200g ; Yes ; 1 Columns 1 through 3 are the features, and the 4th is the final vote. Training on that data will allow you predict the vote on a dish, given its features.
