As mbg mentioned, the hamming distance is a good start. It's basically assigning a bitmask for every possible item whether it is contained in the companies value. Eg. toothpaste is 1 for company A, but 0 for company B. You then count the bits which differ between the companies. The Jaccard coefficient is related to this. Hamming distance will actually not be able to capture similarity between things like "video" and "photography". Obviously, a company that sells one does sell the other also with higher probability than a company that sells toothpaste. For this, you can use stuff like LSI (it's also used for dimensionality reduction) or factorial codes (e.g. neural network stuff as Restricted Boltzman Machines, Autoencoders or Predictablity Minimization) to get more compact representations which you can then compare using the euclidean distance.
