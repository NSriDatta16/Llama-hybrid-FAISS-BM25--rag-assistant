Make sure to have 'single' commits for changes that shall be merged. How to merge only specific revisions explains how to 'synchronize' your documents. Splitting your text into several subdocuments might help to. Subversion forces no directory layout, you're free to create a directory layout that suits you best. The easiest approach is to isolate common text sections into separate files, put in the common folder. These paragraphs are included with \input{name} to your thesis or paper. In cases where you can't or don't want to maintain a common file, thesis and paper need to be merged in order to exchange content. I have two huge documents in mind. As you might not synchronize all content, changes to be merged shall go into a 'revision'. In other words your working copy is up to date. You apply your changes and make a commit. Next you merge this exact revision with the other document. -trunk --thesis --paper1 --paper2 --common
