I would stick with 16-bit values rather than 13-bit. Since you're doing brute force analysis and billions of comparisons, the extra 50MB seems a small price to pay. Also keep in mind that the code managing the 13-bit case will be significantly more complex, as you'll usually have to read across multiple 16-bit (or 32-bit, or whatever) values and shift and combine in order to get the actual value you need. In other words, extracting value # n is going to be much more complex than simply "retrieve it from the table". The only real way to know for sure, however, would be to try both and see... but unless you've got the time to implement the 13-bit value retrieval code that you might not end up using, I probably wouldn't bother.
