What does span mean in exponential moving average?

To borrow from the documentation of pandas ' ewm function: the center of mass, span, halflife and alpha of an exponential moving average can be derived from each other when any one (and only one) of them is specified. While the meanings of center of mass and half-life seem self-explanatory, I have trouble understanding the meaning of span. Certainly, you can express it in terms of the rest of the listed parameters, such as: $$span = 1-\frac{\alpha}{2}$$ $$span = 2 com-1$$ But the implication of span is not obvious from these expressions. I wonder if its meaning can be explained intuitively?
