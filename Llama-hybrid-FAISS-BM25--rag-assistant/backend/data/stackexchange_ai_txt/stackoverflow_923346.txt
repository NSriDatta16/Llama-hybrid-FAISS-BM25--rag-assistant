ObjectMother starts with the factory pattern, by delivering prefabricated test-ready objects via a simple method call. It moves beyond the realm of the factory by facilitating the customization of created objects, providing methods to update the objects during the tests, and if necessary, deleting the object from the database at the completion of the test. Some reasons to use ObjectMother: * Reduce code duplication in tests, increasing test maintainability * Make test objects super-easily accessible, encouraging developers to write more tests. * Every test runs with fresh data. * Tests always clean up after themselves.
