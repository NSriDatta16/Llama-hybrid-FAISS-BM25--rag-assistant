You can create a gradient image and place it above the top of your scrollview. If you would like the "fade" to only be visible during scrolling, you can animate the image fading in and out on scrollViewBegin/DidEndScrollingAnimation or combine that with scrollViewDidScroll, you can decide when it's appropriate to fade out (i.e. when you're scrolled to the top).
