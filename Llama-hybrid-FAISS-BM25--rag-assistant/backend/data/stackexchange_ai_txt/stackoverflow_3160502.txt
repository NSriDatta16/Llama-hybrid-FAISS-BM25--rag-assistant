Ruby: Round number down to nearest number based on arbitrary list of numbers

Say I have an array of integers: arr = [0,5,7,8,11,16] and I have another integer: n = 6 I need a function that rounds down to the nearest number from the array: foo(n) #=> 5 As you can see, the numbers do not have a fixed pattern. What's an elegant way to do this? Thanks
