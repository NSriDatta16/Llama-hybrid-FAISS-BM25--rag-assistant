Handle 50,000 classes in OneVsRestClassifier

I'm new to data science and NLP. I'm trying to solve a problem that is having 1 million rows and some 50,000 distinct classes. The dataset has some text column as a predictor and the other one is the multilabel responses. I have been using tfidf to represent the text fields and MultiLabelBinarizer to transform the labels. But MultiLabelBinarizer is giving MemoryError. And there is no way I can pass the legacy multi-label data representation using a sequence of sequences as it seems no more to be supported in the sklearn package. So, what should be my approach? Any help is appreciated. Thanks in advance.
