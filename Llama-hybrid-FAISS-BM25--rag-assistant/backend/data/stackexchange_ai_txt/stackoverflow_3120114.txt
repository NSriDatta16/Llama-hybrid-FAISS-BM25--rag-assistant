Row selection when dragging over a UITableView with scrolling disabled

If one were to create a standard grouped table view consisting of two rows and then touch down on the first row, the cell would highlight. If one were to then drag one's finger down, the selection of the row cancels, and the table view begins to move with the drag. Imagine the same situation, but with table view scrolling disabled via tableView.scrollEnabled = NO . Now, when one has selected a row and begins to drag, the row deselects and the table remains static. I have two questions: How can I ensure the row isn't deselected when one selects and drags within the confines of the row? When one drags from the first row to the second row, how can I ensure that the first row is deselected and the second row becomes selected? For an example of this functionality in action, open the Clock app and select the Alarm tab bar item. Tap the top right plus button and a modal view will appear presenting four rows. Tap down on the first row, drag onto the second, and you'll see the selection move across rows while the table itself remains static. How is this achieved?
