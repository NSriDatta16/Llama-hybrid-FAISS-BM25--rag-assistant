Unfortunately, not all programmers (myself included) are as familiar with RegEx as they ought be. This often means we end up writing our own string-parsing logic where RegEx could otherwise have served us well. This isn't always bad. It's possible in some cases to write a DSL (a class, a cohesive set of methods) that's more elegant and readable and meets the precise needs of your problem domain. The trouble is that it can take dozens of iterations to distill the problem into a DSL that is simple and intuitive. And only if the DSL will be used far and wide in the application or by a large community is this trouble warranted. Don't write a elegant solution to a problem that only appears sporadically.
