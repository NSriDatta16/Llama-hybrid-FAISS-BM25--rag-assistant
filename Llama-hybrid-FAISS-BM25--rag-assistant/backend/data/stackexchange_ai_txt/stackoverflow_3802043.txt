Simply set the scaleType attribute of your ImageView. Possible values here: ImageView.ScaleType You might want to use CENTER . In addition you face another problem: You have to provide a hdpi image in addition to your mdpi image so your mdpi image does not get automatically scaled up to hdpi by the Android system, read more here: http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/providing-resources.html Edit: Oh, and I nearly forgot: The 'drawable-mdpi' and 'drawable-hdpi' folders are only possible if you build your project against at least Android 1.6. So you have to set your minSdkVersion to 3 and your targetSdkVersion to 4, and place your images into the normal 'drawable' folder in order for Android 1.5 to catch up.
