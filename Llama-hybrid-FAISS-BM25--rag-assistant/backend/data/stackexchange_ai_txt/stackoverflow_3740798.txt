Taken from http://devzone.zend.com/article/141 There are a couple built-in options for storing session data. The session handler is set in the php.ini under the directive named session.save_handler sqlite Optionally, you can store session data in an sqlite database. To do so, use a configuration such as: session.save_handler = sqlite session.save_path = /tmp/phpsess.db mm For high-performance session storage, you can store session data in memory with the mm shared-memory module. You'll need to compile php with the mm module support. Here is a tutorial to configure session handling with mm ( http://www.zend.com/tips/tips.php?id=164&single=1 ). Note that since session date is stored in RAM, you should consider it volatile data, and it's lost with power outage or a reboot. Note: the link in the above tutorial is outdated. You can retrieve the mm module from the OSSP.org website.
