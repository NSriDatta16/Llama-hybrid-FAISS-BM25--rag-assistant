Variable lengths differ error message in R

I am running a logistic regression on the spam dataset from https://hastie.su.domains/ElemStatLearn/ . The dependent variable is in the last column, which is given as V58 after I import the data in R studio. But I get the error message "variable lengths differ (found in 'V1')" I've checked for na's using na.omit, I tried removing the V1 column just to see if that fixes the issue, but I get the same message. I tried using the old cv.glm function instead, but that does not work. I also tried referring to the dependent variable as spam.data$V58. I am stuck. What am I missing? Below is the code I have so far to just get the model. spam.data I should also say that the way I created the data set was to copy and paste the data from the website to a text file and read it into R from that file. The info on the site says we should get 4601 rows and 58 columns, and indeed we get this size dataset. Any ideas?
