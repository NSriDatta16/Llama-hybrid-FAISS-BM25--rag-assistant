There are really two questions here: What is the EF assembly version? In a (correct) .NET 4 project, it can really only be 4. What is your EF model version? Perhaps surprisingly, the EF 4 assemblies support both EF 1 and EF 4 models at runtime. When you upgrade a VS 2008 project to .NET 4, it will upgrade the EDMX to an EF 4 model, as well. But if you skipped this or just want to confirm it's right, look at the xmlns elements in the EDMX. For CSDL, EF 4 is "http://schemas.microsoft.com/ado/2008/09/edm"; EF 1 is "http://schemas.microsoft.com/ado/2006/04/edm". For SSDL, EF 4 is "http://schemas.microsoft.com/ado/2009/02/edm/ssdl"; EF 1 is "http://schemas.microsoft.com/ado/2006/04/edm/ssdl" For MSL, EF 4 is "http://schemas.microsoft.com/ado/2008/09/mapping/cs"; EF 1 is "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:windows:storage:mapping:CS"
