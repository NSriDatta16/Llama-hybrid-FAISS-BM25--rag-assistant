Okay, for example I'm using the following fictional code: getStuff ( 'session_database', $_COOKIE [ 'sessionid' ] ); if ( $db_sessid !== null && $db_sessid [ 'fingerprint' ] == sha1 ( 'SOMESALT' . $_SERVER [ 'HTTP_USER_AGENT' ] ) ) { set_cookie ( ... ); // New sessionid and write also to DB // User is now logged in, execute some user stuff } else { // Session doesn't exist, or the fingerprint does not match } } Now the attacker only still needs the sessionid, which is in the cookie (sent along HTTP headers) and the useragent. So what's still the point of the additional salt? Checking for IP's is also in my opinion not such a good option, some providers or proxy's change them every single request. Thanks so far (-:
