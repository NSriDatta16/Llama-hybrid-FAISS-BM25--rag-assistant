Moving the instruction pointer while debugging Java in Eclipse

Can I move the instruction pointer directly to a line of my choice (within the current method) while debugging a Java program in Eclipse (Galileo)? It's straightforward to drag the instruction pointer to the desired line within a method in Visual Studio, but I don't see a way to do that in Eclipse (and don't find anything about it in the docs or on google).
