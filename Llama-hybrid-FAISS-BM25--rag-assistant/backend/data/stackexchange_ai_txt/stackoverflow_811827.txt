Where should I put my JUnit tests?

I've got 2 questions about organising Unit tests. Do I have to put test to the same package as tested class, or can I organise tests in different packages? For example if I have validity and other tests, is it correct to split them into different packages, even if they are for same class? What about mock and stub classes? Shall I separate them from packages containing only tests, or put them together?
