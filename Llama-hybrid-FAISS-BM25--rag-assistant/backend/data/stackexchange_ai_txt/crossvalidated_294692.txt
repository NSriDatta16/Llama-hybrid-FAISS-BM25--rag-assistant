Machine learning courses: maths explained

I'm looking for a Machine Learning course that would give the maths behind algorithms rather than simply teach how to apply them. I've looked at Udacity Into to Machine Learning and Andrew Ng's course on Coursera, and they both seem too applied to me. Any recommendations of textbooks would also be much appreciated.
