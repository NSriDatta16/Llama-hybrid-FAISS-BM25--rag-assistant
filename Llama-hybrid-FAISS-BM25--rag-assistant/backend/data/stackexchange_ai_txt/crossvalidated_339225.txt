Avoiding perfect multicollinearity in machine learning/regression

Suppose that I'm trying to use regression predict the GDP of a country. Assume I'm using the following features (variables): Dummy variables indicating which continent a country is from (hence there are dummy variables for Asia, Africa, etc). Dummy variables indicating whether a country's population is less than 50 million, between 50 to 100 million, or more than 100 million Two-way interactions of the above dummies (i.e. continent dummies interacted with population dummies) If I don't have an intercept (constant), do I need to omit one dummy variable for either population or continent to be the base category, so as to avoid perfect multicollinearity? Do I need to omit some of the interactions so as to avoid perfect multicollinearity? Do the answers to the above questions depend on whether I am using machine learning techniques like Lasso, or just doing "standard" statistical regressions without regularization/shrinkage?
