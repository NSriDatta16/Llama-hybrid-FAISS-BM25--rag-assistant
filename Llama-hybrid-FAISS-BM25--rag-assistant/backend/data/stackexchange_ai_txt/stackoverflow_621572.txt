debug=true in web.config = BAD thing?

We're seeing lots of virtual memory fragmentation and out of memory errors and then it hits the 3GB limit. The compilation debug is set to true in the web.config but I get different answers from everyone i ask, does debug set to true cause each aspx to compile into random areas of ram thus fragmenting that ram and eventually causing out of memory problems?
