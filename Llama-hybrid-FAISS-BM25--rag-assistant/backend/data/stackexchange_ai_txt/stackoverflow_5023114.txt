This has already been answered here: What is the best way to prevent highlighting of text when clicking on its containing div in javascript? Basically, for firefox, you should be able to do this in CSS: div.noSelect { -moz-user-select: none;//mozilla browsers -khtml-user-select: none;//webkit browsers } For IE you can apparently "add a handler to the ondragstart event, and return false;"
