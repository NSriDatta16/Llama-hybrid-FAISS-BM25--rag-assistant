Mixed linear model in R

We are dealing with house price estimation model in R. We think using mixed linear model with lme4 package and nlme package. (which package is better to use?) We have explanatory variables which are commercial density in environment of house, social density in environment of house, quality of inside of house, size, technical equipment (elevator etc.), house type(duplex, house complex etc.),age of house, sunniness (north, south etc.), transportation, floor, prestige (lux brand apartments), garage. We try to do our model like this in R lmer(price~quality+sunny+size+garage+technic+age+floor+(1|prestige)+(1|house.type)+(1|social)+(1|commercial)+(1|transportation),data=house) We are not sure about which factors are fixed which factors are random, can you help about this? social,commercial and transportation are continuous variables can we use them as a random? Should we normalize Price and size?
