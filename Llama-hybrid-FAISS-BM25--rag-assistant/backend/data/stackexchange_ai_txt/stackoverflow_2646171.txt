Can I attach data gathered by a form to a file that is being uploaded?

I need customers to upload files to my website and I want to gather their name or company name and attach it to the file name or create a folder on the server with that as the name so we can keep the files organized. Using PHP to upload file PHP:>> if(isset($_POST['submit'])){ $target = "upload/"; $file_name = $_FILES['file']['name']; $tmp_dir = $_FILES ['file']['tmp_name']; try{ if(!preg_match('/(jpe?g|psd|ai|eps|zip|rar|tif?f|pdf)$/i', $file_name)) { throw new Exception("Wrong File Type"); exit; } move_uploaded_file($tmp_dir, $target . $file_name); $status = true; } catch (Exception $e) { $fail = true; } } Other PHPw/form:>> input type="hidden" name="MAX_FILE_SIZE" value="1073741824" /> label for="file">Choose File to Upload input name="file" type="file" id="file" size="50" maxlength="50" /> input type="submit" name="submit" value="Upload" /> php if(isset($status)) { $yay = "alert-success"; echo " Thank You! File Upload Successful! "; } if(isset($fail)) { $boo = "alert-error"; echo " Sorry... There was a problem uploading the file. Please make sure that you are trying to upload a file that is less than 50mb and an acceptable file type. "; }
