According to NCover FAQ it can cover silverlight: [ http://docs.ncover.com/ref/3-0/frequently-asked-questions/#q05][1] So far I haven't found any information whether that actually works e.g. for silverlight class libraries. Strange that if ncover works there is no information (blog posts etc.) about it. Is everyone using the "Create standard .NET library and link files into it to get the coverage data" path when testing silverlight code? When it comes to other solutions (even commercial) my googling hasn't produced any results.
