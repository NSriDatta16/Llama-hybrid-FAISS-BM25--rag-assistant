How to get ListViewItem under MouseCursor while dragging sth. over it

I'm implementing drag & drop on a ListView. I already managed to get the ListViewItem under the cursor when dropping on it but I would like to get the ListViewItem under the mouse cursor while I'm dragging sth. over the ListView-Control. I would like to select the ListViewItem (selected=true) like in Windows Explorer when you are dragging files over a folder. I thought about events like ItemMouseHover, MouseMove in the ListView but they are not fired when dragging sth. over it. Hope you can help me... Regards, inno P.S.: I'm using .Net2.0
