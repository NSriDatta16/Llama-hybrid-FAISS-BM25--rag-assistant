Your query is going to hit each record of the table, therefore you don't want to slow things down by first hitting an index and then the table, as obviously this will lead to 2 IOs per record from the table (1 for the index and 1 for the actual table data). Therefore the first question becomes how can you speed a full table scan? Tune IO. Are your disks fast, defragged, not shared (with other data, applications, etc), etc. ALternately, consider denormalisation; e.g. a trigger on your table that counts and sums the appropriate data with each insert, update and deletion and stores this value in another table. Then query for the single row of data in this other table.
