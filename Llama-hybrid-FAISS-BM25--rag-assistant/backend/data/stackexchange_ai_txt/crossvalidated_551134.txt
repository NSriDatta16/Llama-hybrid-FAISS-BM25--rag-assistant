Can Boruta be used for inference about which variables matter?

In particular with Boruta variable selection. If not, what is a better approach? Edit: In terms of the spectrum from prediction to inference, I am interested in the latter. That is, I am interested in understanding the relationship between the predictors and the outcome measure in my data (rather than building the best model to predict new data). I was told that random forests with boruta is a good approach for prediction, but not for inference. I'm wondering if this is true? If it is, what would be a better analysis for my goal? Edit 2: I would like to know if observations that are high on the DV vs low on the DV have different patterns in terms of the predictor variables.
