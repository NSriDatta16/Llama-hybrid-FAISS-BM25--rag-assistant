Units of mean decrease accuracy on a variable importance plot obtained from a Random Forests classifier?

To know the importance variable in a Random Forest I used The mean decrease accuracy and mean decrease Gini. I would like to understand what are the x-axis units of the mean decrease accuracy and mean decrease Gini on a variable importance plot obtained from a random forests classifier. For example the mean decrease accuracy and gini values range between 0,000 - 0,012 and 0-600 respectively. Thanks
