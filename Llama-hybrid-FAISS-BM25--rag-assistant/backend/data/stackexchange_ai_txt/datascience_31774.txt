How to use 3-Axial acceleration data for CNN?

Currently, i am using 1-D acceleration by dividing data in 10 seconds segments and then making a test train split into these segments. But i am not sure how to use 3-D data, especially how to make test train split out this data because for each label there will 3 channel input. EDIT My dataset looks lie this : Right now I am only using X-Axis . I am segmenting X-acc in 200 samples and for each sample, I have an activity label. So now I have a number of segments and a label for each of these segments. After that, I am splitting these segments and their corresponding labels in test train split . This all works fine but no i want to use Y-axis and x-axis also. so now i will have three arrays each segmented in 200 samples, now i am not sure how toperform test train split. Note Activity labels are not shown here, but there are total 6 labels and are one hot encoded.
