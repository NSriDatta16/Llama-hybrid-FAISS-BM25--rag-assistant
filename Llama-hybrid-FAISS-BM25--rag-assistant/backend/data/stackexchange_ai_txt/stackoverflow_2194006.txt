At the moment, it seems -according to Shelley Powers , in her A List Apart Article " Using SVG for Flexible, Scalable and Fun Backgrounds: Part I " and " Part II "- that CSS is not currently best-suited to positioning of SVG. In fact it seems to be quite a minefield to incorporate SVG into a web-page, without directly embedding it within the html itself. I hope that there are solutions to be found, and, indeed, Powers does offer a couple of workarounds, to enable proper separation of style and content for SVG. I'd hazard a guess that the current problems are the relative new-ness of the concept/standard (relative to, for example, .gif or even .png ...), sadly. I'm sorry I can't offer a better answer. =/
