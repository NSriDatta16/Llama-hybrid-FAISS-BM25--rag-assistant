I had to do somenthing similar to you in the past and read the same tutorial you posted, unfortunately there isn't much information avalaible about this and it was headache for me to make it work. I don't remember well the details but I was taking a look to the code I wrote and here are a couple of suggestions that may work for you: Do not submit the form using your own jQuery code, instead use the new "#ahah" property of form elements that can be used for calling your callback in the onchange of the select http://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/developer--topics--forms_api_reference.html/6#ahah IF you are doing this in a node form, adding the #ahah property in a form alter may not work, I remember having seen an issue about this that wasn't solved at that moment. if this is the case, use this code for attaching the ahah binding, you'll not need "efect", "method" or "progress" since you just want to submit the form, not to change anything about it: function YOURMODULE_form_alter(&$form, $form_state, $form_id) { if ('YOURCONTENTTYPE_node_form' == $form_id) { //the only way I could make it work for exisiting fields is adding the binding "manually" $ahah_binding = array( 'url' => url('YOURCALLBACKPATH'), 'event' => 'change', 'wrapper' => 'FIELD-wrapper', 'selector' => '#FIELD', 'effect' => 'fade', 'method' => 'replace', 'progress' => array('type' => 'throbber'), ); drupal_add_js('misc/jquery.form.js'); drupal_add_js('misc/ahah.js'); drupal_add_js(array('ahah' => array('FIELDd' => $ahah_binding)), 'setting'); //force the form to be cached $form['#cache'] = TRUE; } } Here is my callback function, note that it has some modifications from the tutorial you posted: function YOURMODULE_js() { // The form is generated in an include file which we need to include manually. include_once 'modules/node/node.pages.inc'; // We're starting in step #3, preparing for #4. //I have to add the 'rebuild' element, if not an empty node was created $form_state = array('storage' => NULL, 'submitted' => FALSE, 'rebuild' => TRUE); $form_build_id = $_POST['form_build_id']; // Step #4. $form = form_get_cache($form_build_id, $form_state); // Preparing for #5. $args = $form['#parameters']; $form_id = array_shift($args); $form_state['post'] = $form['#post'] = $_POST; $form['#programmed'] = $form['#redirect'] = FALSE; // if you want to do any modification to the form values, this is the place // Step #5. drupal_process_form($form_id, $form, $form_state); // Step #6 and #7 and #8. $form = drupal_rebuild_form($form_id, $form_state, $args, $form_build_id); // Final rendering callback. drupal_json(array('status' => TRUE, 'data' => $output)); } As I said before there are details that I have forgot but maybe this will help you. Good Luck.
