It sounds like it's either Index unbalancing over time Disk fragmentation Internal innodb datafile(s) fragmentation You could try analyze table foo which doesn't take locks, just a few index dives and takes a few seconds. If this doesn't fix it, you can use mysql> SET PROFILING=1; mysql> INSERT INTO foo ($testdata); mysql> show profile for QUERY 1; and you should see where most of the time is spent. Apparently innodb performs better when inserts are done in PK order, is this your case?
