How do you know it's the phone, not the server (or a proxy somewhere between) which is caching? Have you checked this with Fiddler2 (or equivalent)? Have you tried setting headers to disable caching? Something like: myRequest = (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create(myUri); myRequest.Headers["Cache-Control"] = "no-cache"; myRequest.Headers["Pragma"] = "no-cache";
