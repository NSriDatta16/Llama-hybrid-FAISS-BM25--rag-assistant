Preprocessing vs Data Engineering vs Feature Engineering

I'm having a very hard categorizing different methods of data preparation into the 3 categories Preprocessing , Data Engineering , Feature Engineering . A somewhat common definition describes Feature Engineering as the creation of new feature from raw data using domain knowledge. ( a ) Preprocessing is commonly described as "cleaning the data". ( a ) But sometimes Feature Engineering is also described as including basic cleaning techniques like handling missing values ( b ). In this post by google Preprocessing is divided into Data Engineering and Feature Engineering . Data Engineering here is really just putting the data in a form that is recognizable by some model and Feature Engineering is everything else (i.e feature scaling)
