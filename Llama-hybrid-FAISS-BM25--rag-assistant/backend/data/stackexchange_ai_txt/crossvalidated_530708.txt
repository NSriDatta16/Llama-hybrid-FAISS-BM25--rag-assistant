Logistic regression model

I have a question about binary logistic regression. I have been trying see which IV are the independent predictors of an outcome of a categorical variable â€‹in a sample of 680 cases, where 30% of cases are having the outcome of interest (total of ~200 cases). No missing variables. I have about 50 IV. On univariate analysis, 20 of them are statistically significant (p 0.25 in all). If I do logistic regression on all 27 IV at once, I get 11 variables with p Also, I did the automated forward LR (SPSS), which resulted basically with same eleven variables (with the rest of them removed from the model). My question is, how can I know if the model is overfitted? In theory, I should have put maximum 20 variables to start with, however it is really hard figuring which ones to remove? How can I know if a model can sustain testing 27 variables at once? Thank you!
