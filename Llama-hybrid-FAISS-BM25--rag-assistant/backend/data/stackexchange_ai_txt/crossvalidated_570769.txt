Rasch Analysis: comparison of the distribution person location estimates across independent samples

I hardly understand Rasch analysis (and this isn't my goal) but I need to clarify the following questions before delving deeper: Does it make any sense within the framework of Rasch analysis (and related concepts) to compare the distribution of person location estimates across independent samples? Example 1: We have test data from class A and test data from class B. We conducted Rasch analyses on both data sets and assigned a the value of the person location estimate to each pupil. We look at the distribution of these values. Does this allow us to make a statement like: The pupils in class A were on average more "proficient" than the pupils in class B. Example 2: Let's say we repeat the test in the same class at two time points (but we cannot match the anonymized results). Do summary statistics/test of the person location estimates allow us to make a statement like: The pupils proficiency increased/decreased on average between t0 and T1. I would be very grateful if somebody could enlighten me. Note: Each data set is analysed separately.
