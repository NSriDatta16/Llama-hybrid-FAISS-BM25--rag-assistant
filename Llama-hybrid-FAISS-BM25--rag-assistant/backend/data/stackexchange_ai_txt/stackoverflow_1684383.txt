To get started with launchd (instead of cron) you'll want to first create an empty .plist file, for example local.mytask.plist and put it somewhere. ~/Library/LaunchAgents is probably a good place. Open that in text editor and copy in the code below KeepAlive Label local.mytask ProgramArguments /opt/local/bin/wget http://someserver/somepage.php StartInterval 300 RunAtLoad StandardErrorPath /dev/null StandardOutPath /dev/null Then "activate" the file from the command line: sudo launchctl load /Users/my_username/Library/LaunchAgents/local.mytask.plist To make it load automatically, create a ~/.launchd.conf file with the same line (minus sudo launch ) load /Users/my_username/Library/LaunchAgents/local.mytask.plist The above instructions above have been copied from www.davidlanier.com and reposted here for your reference.
