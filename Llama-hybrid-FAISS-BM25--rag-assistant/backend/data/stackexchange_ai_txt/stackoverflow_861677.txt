You can override the touchesBegan method of the UITableView then run a hit test. Then ask the view returned what class it is. - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event{ CGPoint location = [[touches anyObject] locationInView:self]; UIView *whatIsThis = [self hitTest:locationInView withEvent:event]; NSLog([[whatIsThis class] description]); } At least you'll have a starting point. You could also ask who its superView is as well.
