Remove the OpenAL framework you added. Go to one of the other frameworks in your project, say UIKit, right-click and "reveal in finder". Drag the OpenAL you find there from the Finder window into XCode under Frameworks. Now it will probably work... sometimes when you say "Add Existing Frameworks" it seems to choose a wrong directory, and you are probably adding the OS X OpenAL framework (which is fine for the simulator).
