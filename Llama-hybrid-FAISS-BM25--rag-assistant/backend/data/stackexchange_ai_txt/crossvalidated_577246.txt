Why does PCA on high-dimensional text data improve the performance of random forest but not a decision tree classifier?

Why does PCA on high-dimensional text data improve the performance of random forest but not a decision tree classifier? I am dealing with high dimensional text data. I found that performing PCA to an optimised number of dimensions (obtained using grid search) improved the performance of a random forest classifier. Applying the same to a decision tree classifier had no impact on results.
