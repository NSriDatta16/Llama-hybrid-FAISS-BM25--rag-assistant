SSH Server setup on Cloud in Windows Azure Platform

My client has been using SSH2 protocol for File transfer, recently they have decided to host their application on Cloud, they still want to make use of SSH protocol when transferring files to Cloud storage. Could anyone pls provide information regarding the SSH server setup on Cloud using Windows Azure? Following are the Host the SSH Server on VM Role in Cloud, In this case, will the other Web/Worker roles on the same cloud be ale to access the local storage of the VM role? Is it possible to host a SSH FTP server using .NET components (Payed/Open Source) in a Worker role in Azure? If yes, please provide information regarding the .NET components available in Market. If there is no support for SSH in Windows Azure, please let me know other alternatives for Secure File Transfer in Cloud. My client used to run their business Unix machines in Closed network from which they performed the file transfer through SFTP to SSH FTP servers of their suppliers. We are building some applications on Cloud for them which require them to transfer data in the form of files as input to this cloud (web role) application. To transfer files from their Closed network and to make them available on Cloud storage, they insist that they want to still perform this using SSH FTP or using SSH Protocol. We have struck the wall with this requirement, and following is the solutions that we have proposed to them. Please review and provide your comments/suggestions/inputs regarding the best method to perform SSH FTP of files to Cloud Storage. Host SSH Server on VM Role in Cloud, and deploy a Service in their network to transfer files from their network to the cloud. In this case, the files might be saved to the file system in the VM Role, how will we extract the file from the VM role and save it to the shared cloud storage so that other web roles running on cloud can access these files for getting input? Is it possible to host a SSH FTP server using .NET components (Payed/Open Source) in a Worker role in Azure? If there is no support for SSH in Windows Azure, please let me know other alternatives for Secure File Transfer using SSH to transfer files from on-premise to cloud storage.
