If you expand the Properties folder in the SolutionExplorer you should find a Settings.Settings item. Double clicking on this will open the settings editor. This enables you to declare and provide initial values for settings that can either be scoped to the application or the current user. Since the values are persisted in Isolated storage you do not need to worry about what privileges the user is executing under. For a wee example: I created a new string setting with the name Drink and a TextBox named drinkTextBox. The code to assign the current value to the text box is: drinkTextBox.Text = Properties.Settings.Default.Drink; and to update the value persisted: Properties.Settings.Default.Drink = drinkTextBox.Text; Properties.Settings.Default.Save();
