While discretization transforms continous data to discrete data it can hardly be said that dummy variables transform categorical data to continous data. Indeed, since algorithms can be run on computers there can hardly be a classificator algorithm which does NOT transform categorical data into dummy variables. In the same sense a classificator ultimately transforms it predictors into a discrete variable indicating class belonging (even if it outputs a class probability, you ultimately choose a cutoff). De facto many classificators like logistic regression, random forest, decision trees and SVM all work fine with both types of data. I suspect it would be hard to find an algorithm which works with continous data but cannot handle categorical data at all. Usually I tend to find it makes more difference on what type of data you have on the left side of your model.
