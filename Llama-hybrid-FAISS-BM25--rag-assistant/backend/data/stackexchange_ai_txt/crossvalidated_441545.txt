Scaling the MAE by the mean of non zero points for intermittent data

I am currently trying to find a way of scaling the MAE for my intermittent data. The data is always greater than 0 and is intermittent, with long periods of zeros. I have read a few papers that suggest scaling the MAE by the MEAN of the test data ( Measuring forecast accuracy by Hoover or Advantages of the MAD/Mean Ratio over the MAPE by Kolassa & Sch√ºtz ). Though this solves the issue of scaling the MAE I cannot understand why for Intermittent data one wouldn't scale by the MEAN of non-zero data. I have already looked at metrics such as MAPE, sMAPE, MASE and a few others but they often have some issue with intermittent data (the exception being MASE though harder to interpret) To me this would have the benefit of brining all data points to either center around 1 or remain 0. If one divides by the MEAN of all points this could result in time series being centered much close to 0. I can find no papers on this so I'm assuming I'm missing something seriously obvious. Many Thanks
