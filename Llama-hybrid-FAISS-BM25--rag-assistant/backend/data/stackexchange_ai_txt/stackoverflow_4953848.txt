You would want to have a look at http://code.google.com/p/swfobject/ . It is an actively used javascript library for flash embedding. You would not have to deal with cross browser issues. Using SWFObject,flash version detection is as simple as : function flashdetect(){ var version = deconcept.SWFObjectUtil.getPlayerVersion(); var major_version = version["major"]; var revision = version["rev"]; }
