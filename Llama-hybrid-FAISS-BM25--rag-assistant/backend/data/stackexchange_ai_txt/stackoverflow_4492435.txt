I know you want to do this in IB, but if you're willing to try it programmatically, then you can move things around pretty easily. For your buttons, just implement the setCenter method like this: [myButton setCenter:CGPointMake(xCenter,yCenter)]; Otherwise, if you want to use the IB, use the Autosizing options. The arrows will stretch or compress the width and height, and the bars (|-|) preserve distances from the top and bottom. If you have three buttons in a row, you can fix the left distance for the left button, the right distance for the right button and both/neither for the center button. Something like that may work. The third option is to make a new view, call it landscapeView or something, by dragging a UIView from the library to the window with File's Owner, First Responder, View, etc. Then orient that to landscape, copy over all your UI objects, lay them out as you like, and when you rotate, replace the current view with landscapeView. The problem with this that I've found (one of many) is that you have to reconnect everything and have different IBOutlets for the labels and whatnot. T
