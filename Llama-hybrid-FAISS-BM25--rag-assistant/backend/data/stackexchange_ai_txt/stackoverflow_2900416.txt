DTC needs to be enabled and running on both sides of the connection. In my organization, it took some research to figure out which four boxes to check and then some hand-holding to get those boxes checked on all db servers, all app servers and most laptops. There's still a couple of hold-out developer laptops... but they're ok as long as they don't write. :) You should have some driving scenario (such as an atomic multiple database write) to hit the DBA's over the head with. Give them some time to guess at alternatives... then let them know that DTC is the only hammer for this kind of nail. I'm unsure of the implications of DTC on a SQL farm. I imagine the whole farm could get involved in the transaction if it involves enough data... which can't be a good thing.
