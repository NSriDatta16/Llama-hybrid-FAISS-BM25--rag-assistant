When I started learning PHP, I started by writing a content management system. Turns out that it was the worst content management system in human history, but I sure learned a lot. Another friend of mine learned PHP through programming a web based game. Point is, try to find something interesting that will keep your attention for a long development process! Then, resign yourself to a very long learning curve.
