Can we call a CMS like Drupal Machine Learning?

Drupal process a page and created run time PHP files, Twig files, sometimes CSS/JS as well, from the fragments we have already created based on it's logic. Since machine learning does some similar thing to act on the data and use own logic to produce result, can we can CMS to be bit of Machine Learning capabilities?
