Yes, you need to expire the cache if you change the data, but as you said, that's not common, so you can even do that on a semi-automated basis and not worry about it if necessary. You should check out this MySQL.com article , as well as perhaps explore the MEMORY storage engine (sorry, new and can't post more than one hyperlink per post?!) which takes a little bit of coding around to use but can be extremely efficient. What's the actual query time (vs page time)? On a reasonably modern server that's not loaded to hell, MySQL should be able to do an autocomplete query on 150k rows much, much, faster than two seconds. Missing some indexes?
