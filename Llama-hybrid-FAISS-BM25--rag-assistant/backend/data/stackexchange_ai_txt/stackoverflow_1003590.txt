I like obout for their lightweight'ness. Their licensing policy is very fair (pay once free updates for life) and they also give (free) educational licenses. However, I had to use Developer Express on one of my projects and never looked back since. Very powerful and not as bloated as Infragistics. Basically, if you decide to go obout way, you probably will not regret it.
