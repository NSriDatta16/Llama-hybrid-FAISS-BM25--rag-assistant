static methods are for methods which are independent of object state. Typically I would use them for utility methods and pure mathematical kind of functions. e.g. computeAverage(int[] values); abstract/interface methods are pretty much the same thing. interface methods have the feel of pure contract. abstract methods are more version tolerant. If you have a contract and it can possibly have different implementations I would go with these. static methods are more performant because they don't need to do virtual table lookup.
