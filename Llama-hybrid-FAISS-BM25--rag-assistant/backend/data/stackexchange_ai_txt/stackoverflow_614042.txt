I haven't seen anything like that in FB3. An AS3 project will lack quite a few of Flex project settings (e.g. template html). You are best served by creating an empty Flex project and adding the AS3 source to it -- drag and drop the folder(s) in the src folder of the Flex project. Alternatively, if it is a SWC you can add it using project settings.
