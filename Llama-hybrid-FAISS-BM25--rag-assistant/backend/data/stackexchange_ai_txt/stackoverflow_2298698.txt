The title and first part of the question is in conflict with what you ultimately state as your goal. To address the first part: You need to construct the ticket yourself and explicitly set the expiration on the COOKIE the same as the timeout and then set the cookie. This is easier said than done, because MS in it's infinite wisdom does not expose the timeout property of the formsauthentication element. There is a pretty simple workaround. See the code in this answer to see what is required to create persistent tickets. In conclusion: You are not doing anything wrong , the createPersistentCookie functionality is broken but can be worked around. To address your stated goal: There is really no clean way to do this using FormsAuthentication. Any attempt to do so would result in brittle hacks around a well designed, secure system that is dead simple to implement and leverage. If you attempt this with forms auth you will find yourself chasing ghosts. good luck.
