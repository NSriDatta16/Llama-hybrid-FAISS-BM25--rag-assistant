rewrite complicated query with union in arel?

I have the following models class Courier and then i have the following query: # could i translate this into cleaner arel? result = Courier.find_by_sql( In short: i am looking for all couriers that have a coverage for the given country-code or a coverage with an empty country-code instead (the fallback). The query works, but i am wondering if there are any better ways to write it?
