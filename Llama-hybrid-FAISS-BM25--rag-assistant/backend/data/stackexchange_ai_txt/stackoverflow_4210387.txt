Well, for what it's worth, I tried using deeply-nested namespaces on a medium-sized project a couple of years back, and it was absolute hell -- I spent my entire time writing typedefs :) In Java, packages work quite nicely, because you can just import things at the top of each .java file and not have major problems. In C++, it's a pain in the butt, because it's bad practice to put using directives/declarations in header files -- as a result, you end up either (a) fully-qualifying everything in headers (bleurgh) or (b) using lots of typedefs (also bleurgh). Not cool -- my advice would be to avoid like the plague, unless you enjoy writing things like: centipede::autoseg::hierarchygeneration::ragbuilders::RAGBuilder That's not a type, it's a sentence...
