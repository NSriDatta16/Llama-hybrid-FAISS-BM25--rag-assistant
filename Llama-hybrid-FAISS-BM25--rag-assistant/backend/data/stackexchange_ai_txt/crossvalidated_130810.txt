One example of such a method are Finite Mixture Models (e.g. here or here ) used for clustering. In FMM you consider the distribution ( $f$ ) of your variable $X$ as a mixture of $K$ distributions ( $f_1,...,f_k$ ): $$f(x, \vartheta) = \sum^K_{k=1} \pi_k f_k(x, \vartheta_k)$$ where $\vartheta$ is a vector of parameters $\vartheta = (\pi', \vartheta_1', ..., \vartheta_k')'$ and $\pi_k$ is a proportion of $k$ 'th distribution in the mixture and $\vartheta_k$ is a parameter (or parameters) of $f_k$ distribution. A specific case for discrete data is Latent Class Analysis (e.g. Vermunt and Magidson, 2003 ) defined as: $$P(x, k) = P(k) P(x|k)$$ where $P(k)$ is probability of observing latent class $k$ (i.e. $\pi_k$ ), $P(x)$ is probability of observing an $x$ value and $P(x|k)$ is probability of $x$ being in class $k$ . Usually for both FMM and LCA EM algorithm is used for estimation, but Bayesian approach is also possible, but a little bit more demanding because of problems such as model identification and label switching (e.g. Xi'an's blog ). So there is no distance measure but rather a statistical model defining the structure (distribution) of your data. Because of that other name of this method is "model-based clustering". Check the two books on FMM: McLachlan, G. & Peel, D. (2000). Finite Mixture Models. John Wiley & Sons. Fr√ºhwirth-Schnatter, S. (2006). Finite Mixture and Markov Switching Models. Springer. One of the most popular clustering packages that uses FMM is mclust (check here or here ) that is implemented in R . However, more complicated FMM's are also possible, check for example flexmix package and it's documentation . For LCA there is an R poLCA package .
