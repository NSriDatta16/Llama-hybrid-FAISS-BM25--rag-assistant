I am making a logistic regression model. Should I test for multicollinearity in dependent features if my predicting feature in categorical?

I have a doubt, will multicollinearity affect my Logistic Regression model as my predicting(output) feature is categorical? (because correlation will make sense only for 2 continuous features and not 1 continuous and 1 categorical) also Does checking for multicollinearity in machine learning depend upon the type of variable that we are predicting(i.e. whether the variable is continuous or categorical)
