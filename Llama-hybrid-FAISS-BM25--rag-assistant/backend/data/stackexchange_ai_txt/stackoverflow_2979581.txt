The algorithm is supposed to print the paragraph "neatly" Padding space at the end of lines (except at the end) is not "neat" Thus, the algorithm should minimize such padding The exact measure of "neatness" is the sum of the squares of the padding on each line (a very common measure of compound errors, that basically implies that it's more acceptable to have many small errors than a few large ones).
