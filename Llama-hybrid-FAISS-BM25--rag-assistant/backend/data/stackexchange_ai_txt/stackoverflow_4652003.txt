The 'member is defined more than once' error occurs because you have two same-named classes in the one namespace. Say one of your tables is called Product . When you drag that table onto the dbml (or rather when you save the dbml), the designer generates a lot of code in the default namespace, including a class called Product which contains properties for all the database columns. That's what you want but if you then go and create another dbml file in the same namespace, and drag Product onto the second dbml file, you'll end up with two Product classes in the same namespace - hence 'defined more than once'. The solution is to change the Entity Namespace property on the dbml designer. Open the dbml, and without selecting any tables or relationships open the properties window. Under the Code Generation group there is a property called Entity Namespace. If you change that one to something else, you'll resolve the problem. e.g. you might change it from MyProject to MyProject.Customers , or MyProject.Inventory . The other option, as pointed out by Femaref, is to use a single datacontext for all pages. From what I read this is probably the more common pattern. I've only used multiple contexts when I have a large number of tables because the single dbml approach is unmanageable. But whatever works for you!
