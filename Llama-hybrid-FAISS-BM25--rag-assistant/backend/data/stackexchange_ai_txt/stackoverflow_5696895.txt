I think you should make one big feature matrix out of it. Suppose you have tables Sales Manager (id attr_1 ... attr_m) Customer (id attr_1 ... attr_n sales_manager_id) Order (id product_id_1 ... product_id_l customer_id) Then it is most probably reasonable to create the matrix in the following form Matrix: product_id order_attr_1 ... order_attr_l customer_attr_1 ... customer_attr_n ... manager_attr_1 ... manager_attr_m Now you have 20*l row matrix with all the attributes that are given for certain order. In the simplest form you can use the following matrix for classification. In case of too many attributes maybe it is reasonable to use PCA first. Maybe you should try to use Weka and see, what turns out. Considering your question about the hierarchical relations, then the classification algorithms will not understand them explicitly. I would recommend this book here: Introduction to Data Mining , as it answers most of your questions.
