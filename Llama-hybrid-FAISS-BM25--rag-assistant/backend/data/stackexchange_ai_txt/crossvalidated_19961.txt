This also depends on the type of data you have. Do you have a time series ? Then looking at a ACF/PACF plot of the residuals may be one way of determining if these are white noise: require(tseries) tsdiag(rnorm(100)) you may find this PDF helpful. If you have cross-section data an inspection of the residual plots yields very valuable information in my opinion: data(cars) plot(lm(speed~dist, data=cars)) There exist tests (see comments) but I very often find graphs more useful.
