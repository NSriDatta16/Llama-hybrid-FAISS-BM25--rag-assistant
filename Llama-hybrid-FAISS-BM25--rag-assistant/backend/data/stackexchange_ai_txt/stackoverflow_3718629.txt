Shaggy Frog had the right idea-- the -lgcov flag was not appearing in the output. My project had a unit testing target and separate configurations for with and without coverage. The Other Linker Flags setting was different in the unit testing target and the coverage configuration, with -lgcov being set in only one of those. Instead of adding in all of the flags, Xcode was overriding one set of flags with the other.
