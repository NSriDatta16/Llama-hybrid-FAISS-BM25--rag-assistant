How to draw a rectangle in WinForm app in the correct location

I have a WinForm app that has an image displayed in a PictureBox that has the added functionality of allowing a user to draw a rectangle on the image by clicking and dragging. The Location, Height and Width of the rectangle are saved to disk. When the image is viewed again I would like to automatically redraw that rectangle in the same position on the image. When I redraw it, however, the Height and Width are fine but the location is always off. The location is being captured in the MouseDown Event like so private void pbSample_MouseDown(object Sender, MouseEventArgs e) { if (SelectMode) { StartLocation.X = e.X; StartLocation.Y = e.Y; //later on these are saved as the location of the rectangle } } And I am redrawing it like so public void DrawSelectedArea(Rectangle rect) { Graphics g = this.pbSample.CreateGraphics(); Pen p = new Pen(Brushes.Black); g.DrawRectangle(p, rect); } Given the location from the MouseEventArgs captured during the MouseDown Event how can I calculate the correct location to redraw my rectangle?
