Are you calling session_start() at the VERY top of your PHP document? The PHP manual says that the session_register() function has been deprecated as of PHP 5.3.0 and reliance on it is highly discouraged. Instead, do something like $_SESSION['dog'] = "Woof"; But you must be calling session_start() before anything else in your document!
