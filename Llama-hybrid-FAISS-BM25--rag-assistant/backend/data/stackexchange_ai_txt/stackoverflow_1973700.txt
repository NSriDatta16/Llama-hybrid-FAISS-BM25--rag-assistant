You don't exactly say what you were expecting to happen when you truncated the table. Remember that if you de-allocate the storage from a table/index then it's just returned to the tablespace as free-space. The space used on disk from the operating system's perspective isn't going to get any smaller. So whilst a tablespace can be set to "auto extend" when more space is required, it does not auto-shrink when space is freed.
