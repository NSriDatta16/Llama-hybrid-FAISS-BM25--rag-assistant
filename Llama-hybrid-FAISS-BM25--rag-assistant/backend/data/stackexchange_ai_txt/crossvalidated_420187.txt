Difference-in-difference equation is: $$Y_{i,t} = \beta_0 1(i \in treated) + \gamma_t T_t + \delta 1(i \in treated) * T2 +\epsilon_{i,t} $$ where $1(i \in treated) $ is the group specific effect, $T_t$ are the time fixed-effects, and T2 is the dummy for all the time periods of the treatments; hence $\delta$ , the coefficient in front of the interaction term, is the coefficient of interest. If I understand well, the coefficient in front of G2 is non significant. It means that, outside of the period of interest, there is no significant difference between your treated and control. This is neither necessary nor sufficient, but it is encouraging regarding the fact that your control group is a good control group. What matters for your research question is whether $\delta$ is significant.
