This is very easy to accomplish with XSLT ( No need to capture the results in a variable, or to use special named templates ): I. XSLT 1.0 : , when this transformation is applied on the following XML document: Locality CollectorAndNumber Institution Distribution Unimportant the wanted result is produced : Locality,CollectorAndNumber,Institution,Distribution If the wanted elements should be produced not in document order (something not required in the question, but raised by Tomalak), it is still quite easy and elegant to achieve this: , Here the names of the wanted elements and their wanted order are provided in the string parameter $porderedNames , which contains a space-separated list of all wanted names . When the above transformation is applied on the same XML document, the wanted result is produced : CollectorAndNumber,Locality,Distribution,Institution II. XSLT 2.0 : In XSLT this task is even simpler ( again, no special function is necessary ): When this transformation is applied on the same XML document, the same correct result is produced : Locality,CollectorAndNumber,Institution,Distribution Do note that the wanted elements will be produced in any desired order, because we are using the XPath 2.0 sequence type (vs the union in the XSLT 1.0 solution), which by definition contains items in any desired (specified) order.
