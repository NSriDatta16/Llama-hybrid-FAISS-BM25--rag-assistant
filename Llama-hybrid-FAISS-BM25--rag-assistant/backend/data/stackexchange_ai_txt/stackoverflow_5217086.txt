CSS selector involving pseudo class first-child and dropcap

I need to format HTML similar to below. Basically a quote is optional , and I need to dropcap the first letter of the body paragraph. Genius begins great works; labor alone finishes them.-- Joseph Joubert Life is like a box of chocolates. ... ... My CSS looks like this: article > p:first-child:first-letter { float: left; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 360%; line-height: 0.85em; margin-right: 0.05em; } p.quote { font-weight: bold; } It doesn't work currently when the quote is introduced. AFAIK I can't select the article's first child P which is not class "quote." I'll use jQuery if I can't figure this out, but for now I'm looking for a way to do it CSS only. Thanks in advance!
