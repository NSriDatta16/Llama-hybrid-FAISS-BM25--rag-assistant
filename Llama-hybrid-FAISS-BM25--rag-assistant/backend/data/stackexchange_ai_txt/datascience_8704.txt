Is Vector in Cosine Similarity the same as vector in Physics?

I'm new to Data Science. I'm trying to understand cosine similarity and it seems like the equation is about finding the distance between two vectors. From what I've Googled, a vector needs to have magnitude and direction. But in CS, it seems like it's a 1-dimensional array. Is vector in CS the same as vector in Physics? If so, what is the direction of a vector. And if a vector is like this [1, 0, 1, 0] what is the magnitude of this vector?
