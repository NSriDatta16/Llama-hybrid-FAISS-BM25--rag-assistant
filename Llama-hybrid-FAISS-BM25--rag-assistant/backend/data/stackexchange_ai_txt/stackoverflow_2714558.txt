You could try abit of both. Have the main site detect the useragent, then redirect to the completly new domain. That way its more automated but your main site code wont have tons of if statements depending on if its a mobile or not as the new domain would take care of that. If you go with this tho, always add a link on the mobile site so that users can view the main site if they please... use cookies tho else youll end up getting redirected to the mobile site.
