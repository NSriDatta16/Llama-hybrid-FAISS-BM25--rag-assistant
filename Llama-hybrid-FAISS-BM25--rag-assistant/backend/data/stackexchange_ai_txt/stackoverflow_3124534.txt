Use the geometry package. It allows full control over margins etc. \usepackage{geometry} \geometry{margin=2cm} The space between paragraphs can be set via parskip : \setlength{\parskip}{0cm} However, parskip does not work for paragarphs introduced by \paragraph . But if your paragraphs do not need a caption (as I assume since you wrote \paragraph{} , it may be better to begin paragraphs just with a blank line: \setlength{\parskip}{0cm} Here goes the first paragraph. Here the second. With no space. Note that this paragraph was introduced with a blank line. \paragraph{The third paragraph} This paragraph will have a small offset, since it is introduced explicitly with paragraph command.
