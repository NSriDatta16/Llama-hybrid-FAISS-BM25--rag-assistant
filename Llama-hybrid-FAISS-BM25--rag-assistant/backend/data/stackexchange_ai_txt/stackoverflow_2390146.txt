Take a look at Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ) : Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ) technology enables applications running at different times to communicate across heterogeneous networks and systems that may be temporarily offline. MSMQ provides guaranteed message delivery, efficient routing, security, and priority-based messaging. It can be used to implement solutions for both asynchronous and synchronous messaging scenarios. It's good to know that Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) can leverage queuing services offered by MSMQ.
