Is it possible to do a time series analysis with more than one explanatory variable?

I am working on a project, and I am absolutely new to forecasting and not so strong in statistics. I have an employee data for the last 7 years, along with the other variables like economic growth, employee turnover, vacancies, and some other economical factors. I have to do forecasting for the next 5 years. I have some questions: Is it possible to do a time series analysis with more than one explanatory variable? Can this be done in R? I would appreciate any kind of help. Thanks in advance!!
