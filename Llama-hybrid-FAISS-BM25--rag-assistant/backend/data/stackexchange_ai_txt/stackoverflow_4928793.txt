Properly selecting and filtering elements in variable HTML structure with jQuery

I have a HTML fragment with multiple elements (mostly of the same type (here for example I use SPAN), but also a few others) that may be enclosed within a DIV, but not always. Basically, sometimes I have a single root element (the DIV), sometimes I have multiple elements at the same level. What is the proper way to select all of these specified elements (SPAN) with jQuery? Clarification Update : This way of selecting should succeed for both cases listed below To give an example, the following code segment shows you two possible structures for my HTML fragment. var test1 = " "; var test2 = " "; alert($(test1).filter("span").length); alert($(test2).filter("span").length); Naturally, the first filter returns 0, whereas the second returns 2. I know one way to 'solve' this would be to encapsulate my fragment within a DIV, on which I then run my filter, however I'm curious to know if there's a better solution. Update 2: What I could do (as mentioned in the paragraph above) is something like the following code, which works for both cases: alert($(" ").append(test2).find("span").length);
