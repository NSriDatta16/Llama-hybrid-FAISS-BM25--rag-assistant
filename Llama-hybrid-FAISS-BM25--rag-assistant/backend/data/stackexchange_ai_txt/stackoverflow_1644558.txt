Since you only want up to four million, it's likely that int is not your problem. It's quite possible that your program is buggy and that the data storage is just fine, so you should test your program on smaller values. For example, it's clear that the sum of the first three even terms is 44 (hint: every third term is even) so if you run your program with a cap of 50, then you should instantly get 44 back. Keep running small test cases to get confidence in the larger ones.
