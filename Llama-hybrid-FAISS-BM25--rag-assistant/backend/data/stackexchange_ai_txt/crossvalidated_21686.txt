To supplement these fine responses, I would mention use of gradient boosted trees (e.g. the GBM Package in R ). In R, I prefer this to random forests because missing values are allowed as compared to randomForest where imputation is required. Variable importance and partial plots are available (as in randomForest) to aid in feature selection and nonlinear transformation exploration in your logit model. Further, variable interaction is addressed with Friedman’s H-statistic ( interact.gbm ) with reference given as J.H. Friedman and B.E. Popescu (2005). “Predictive Learning via Rule Ensembles.” Section 8.1 . A commercial version called TreeNet is available from Salford Systems and this video presentation speaks to their take on variable interaction estimation Video .
