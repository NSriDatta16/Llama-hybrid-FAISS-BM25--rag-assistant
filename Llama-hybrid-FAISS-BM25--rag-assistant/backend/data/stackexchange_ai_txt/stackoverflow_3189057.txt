Microsoft Sync Framework and Integer as Identifier

I've got to implement data synchronization between a local storage that resides on a mobile device and the server DB. The thing is that our DB (which is already in production for many years) all uses an integer as the Id of a record. I'm afraid that changing it to be a GUID is currently not an alternative because it has too many repercussion. Does someone has a good workaround this issue?
