Extracting a bad prediction out but prediction didn't improve

I am predicting a time series $y$ . I have a baseline prediction time series let's call it $x$ . By baseline I just mean a prediction I will later improve on. I did more research and found that I can systematically come up with another time series $z$ that have lower or even negative correlation with $y$ . $z$ has a pretty significant standard deviation too (about 1/3 of $x$ ) I thought $x - z$ would definitely have higher correlation with $y$ since I removed a significant low correlation part of my baseline prediction. Imagine time series $x = u+z$ , if $z$ has lower correlation with $y$ , I think intuitively $u$ should have higher correlation? So two components "balance out" when they add together. But it doesn't.. what did I miss? I guess another way to ask this question is, can $u+v$ have higher correlation with $y$ than both $u$ and $v$ ?
