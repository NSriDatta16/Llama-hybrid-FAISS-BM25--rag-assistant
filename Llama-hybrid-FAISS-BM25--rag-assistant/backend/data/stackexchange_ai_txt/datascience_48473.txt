Kmeans clustering with multiple columns containing strings

I have the following dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/carolzhangdc/imdb-5000-movie-dataset What I want to find is clusters based on imdb score per genre per country. I have created a pandas data frame that contains per country for every unique genre the average imdb rating. The dataframe looks like this: country object genre object avgRating float64 dtype: object Since the columns country and genre contain strings, I can't use Kmeans for this. Is there anyway I can achieve what I want?
