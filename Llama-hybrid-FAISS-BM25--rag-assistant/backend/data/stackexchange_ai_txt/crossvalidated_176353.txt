How can I use PCA to estimate the variance-covariance matrix?

I am working on alternative ways for the estimation of variance-covariance matrices. For this I have already estimated the sample variance-covariance matrix, single index covariance matrix. I also want to estimate the covariance matrix by principal component analysis (PCA). As I have 5 different types of asset returns and factors which are assumed to drive these returns are 6 in numbers like (Inflation, interest rate etc). Kindly guide me what is the procedure to estimate this covariance matrix by PCA.
