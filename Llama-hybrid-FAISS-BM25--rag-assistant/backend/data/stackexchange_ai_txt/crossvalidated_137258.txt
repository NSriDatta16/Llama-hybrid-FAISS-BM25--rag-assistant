Interpretation of scaled data in a logistic regression analysis

I have a variable (distance to road; measurement=meters; see below) that contains a right-skew and percentage data (0-100% based on amount of habitat in a moving window; see example below) in a generalized linear model in a logistic regression framework (response=binary=0 and 1). I wanted to standardize the data for better model convergence. One method was to use the scale() function. Does this make sense for a percentage variables? I've listed the code below. If I chose the scale function then I'm having trouble interpreting the odds ratios from a standardized output. Another option was to scale the distance data by 100-meters to make the odds ratios a scaled odds ratio for easier interpretation over 100-meters as opposed to 1-meter. I assume I can just create another variable for roads and divide by 100-m; however, I wasn't sure what made the most sense given the skewness of the data. Would a transformation help in this case to improve model fit? At this point the k-fold cross validation estimate is 46% accuracy, which is fairly more; therefore, I felt that the model may not be able to fit the skewed data as well as it could. results Scaled Odds Ratio using scale() function: OR 2.5 % 97.5 % (Intercept) 0.9995938 0.9791843 1.0204286 scale(MP_Perc) 1.0451499 0.9922289 1.1010815 scale(MPHW_Perc) 1.1372870 1.0828121 1.1947049 scale(HW_Perc) 1.0049131 0.9702967 1.0408317 scale(YP_Perc) 0.9625852 0.9285777 0.9978946 scale(AG_Perc) 1.0839830 1.0398650 1.1301173 scale(Shrub_Perc) 1.0461523 1.0208763 1.0720880 scale(Dist_Roads) 0.8794098 0.8606520 0.8985149
