The way the problem is worded, the organizer/teacher can ensure he never has to give out the prize: Allow each student into the room in turn - which only allows the Counter to count one other student. Then only iterate a subset of the students - say 3 of them. Then either the Counter can count two other students then get stuck, or the Counter never goes back into the room. This satisfies the specified conditions: Everyone goes into the room at least once, and some students go in multiple times. To allow the students to win, you need to add the condition that there is a finite limit between any single student's visits to the switch room.
