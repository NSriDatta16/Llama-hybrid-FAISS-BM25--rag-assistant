However, my UK server is based in Scotland, my other server is based in Germany and is actually closer to London than Scotland? Just to compare the speed between Scotland server and Germany server: === Germany Based === Pinging firststopdigital.com [87.106.101.189]: Ping #1: Got reply from 87.106.101.189 in 126ms [TTL=46] Ping #2: Got reply from 87.106.101.189 in 126ms [TTL=46] Ping #3: Got reply from 87.106.101.189 in 126ms [TTL=46] Ping #4: Got reply from 87.106.101.189 in 126ms [TTL=46] Variation: 0.4ms (+/- 0%) Shortest Time: 126ms Average: 126ms Longest Time: 126ms === UK Based === Pinging pb-net.co.uk [62.233.81.163]: Ping #1: Got reply from 62.233.81.163 in 120ms [TTL=55] Ping #2: Got reply from 62.233.81.163 in 119ms [TTL=55] Ping #3: Got reply from 62.233.81.163 in 119ms [TTL=55] Ping #4: Got reply from 62.233.81.163 in 119ms [TTL=55] Variation: 0.3ms (+/- 0%) Shortest Time: 119ms Average: 119ms Longest Time: 120ms The difference is around 6ms which is not much at all.
