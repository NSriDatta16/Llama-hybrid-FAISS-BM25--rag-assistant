The most prominent example is the HMAX model. The model uses a series of layers to produce a single vector feature set that is composted of the data needed to classify objects using machine learning. In order to achieve in-variance (Rotation, Size, Scale) in this model the developer needs to have many pictures of the same thing or person which can be used to train a classifier. When researchers are attempting to find better ways of creating or reading these features, that's where computer vision meets data mining.
