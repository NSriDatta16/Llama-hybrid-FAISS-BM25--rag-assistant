How to store passwords in Winforms application?

I have some code like this in a winforms app I was writing to query a user's mail box Storage Quota. DirectoryEntry mbstore = new DirectoryEntry( @"LDAP://" + strhome, m_serviceaccount, [m_pwd], AuthenticationTypes.Secure); No matter what approach I tried (like SecureString ), I am easily able to see the password ( m_pwd ) either using Reflector or using strings tab of Process Explorer for the executable. I know I could put this code on the server or tighten up the security using mechanisms like delegation and giving only the required privileges to the service account. Can somebody suggest a reasonably secure way to store the password in the local application without revealing the password to hackers? Hashing is not possible since I need to know the exact password (not just the hash for matching purpose). Encryption/Decryption mechanisms are not working since they are machine dependent.
