I agree with @Bertvan. The iteration should not take that much time (even if the records are 49K). I would suggest considering the following lines ( which could be creating problem): if (prodPrefClient.Count() == 1) Not sure what are you trying to achive here, But this call is iterating a lazy collection. Please consider if you need this check. wrapperItem.DiscountPct = ValueParser.SafeDecimal(item.Discount, null); Int/double comparers do eat some processing time. You should also check the total time taken by the operation by removing this line of code. Hope this would help.
