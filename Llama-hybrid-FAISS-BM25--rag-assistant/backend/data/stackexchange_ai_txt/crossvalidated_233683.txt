I am learning from Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning, Chris Bishop any good resources?

Are there any videos or other books/notes that anyone has come across that follow Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning by Chris Bishop? I bought this book to learn Machine Learning and am having some trouble getting through it.
