I would suggest a logistic regression model, which can be implemented in R. Logistic regression is a type of generalised linear model , which is why in the code below the key function is glm Here is some pseudo code: library(MASS) # Load the MASS library, which contains the glm function model = glm(Survived ~ Location + Country + Injury + Time) # Define a model of whether the victim survived, predicting on location, country, injury and time of attack summary(model) # View the model coefficients to interpret the model In terms of selecting a specific model, I would suggest investigating the stepAIC function in R, as some predictors may drop out/or be included in the model, for example interaction effects .
