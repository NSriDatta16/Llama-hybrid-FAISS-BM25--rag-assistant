A split is decided based on the loss it produces. You can see the exact form in equation (7) of XGBoost: A Scalable Tree Boosting System - Chen, Guestrin . Specifically, we look at the drop in loss by doing the split, but then subtract $\gamma$, which is a regularization hyperparameter. In other words if the loss drop exceeds $\gamma$, we honor the split. If not, the split isn't made. I would think then that max_depth is reached only if the sequence of splits exceed $\gamma$ in loss drop. Otherwise if $\gamma=0$ there doesn't seem to be anything preventing the algorithm from attaining max depth.
