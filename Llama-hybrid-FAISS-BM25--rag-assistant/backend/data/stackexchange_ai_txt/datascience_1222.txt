You should look more into the infrastructure side of things if you don't like maths. The lower you go in the software stack, the further away you get from maths (of the data science sort). In other words, you could build the foundation that others will use to create the tools that will serve analysts. Think of companies like Cloudera, MapR, Databricks, etc. Skills that will come in handy are distributed systems and database design. You are not going to be become a data scientist without maths; that's a ridiculous notion!
