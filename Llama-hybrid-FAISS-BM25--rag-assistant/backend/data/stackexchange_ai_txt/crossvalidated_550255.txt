From what I understand of your data, the dependent variable is ordinal. By making this binary high/low you lose the possibility of discovering something like a dose-response effect. This is the biological gradient numbered five of nine here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradford_Hill_criteria . Also, if you make that variable binary, unless you have a biological plausible a priori value, then the chi-squared result will depend on the threshold. For example a very large threshold will likely give a low p-value if your hypothesis is correct, so your ability to find a “good” threshold will affect things. One way forward would be ordinal logistic regression, and then other variables could be added as dependent variables, as biological variables often do not act alone. With logistic regression, odds ratios can be useful in interpreting the results.
