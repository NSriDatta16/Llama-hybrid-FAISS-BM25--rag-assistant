NHibernate + Paging + Ordering

I'm not quite sure of the most elegant solution for what I am trying to do. I have a page which lists music listings, there can be thousands of these so they are paged in batches of 20, I also have 4 links at the top of the page to change the way these listings are ordered. The sort by properties could be located on different entities such as Audio.AudioStats.NumComments or Audio.Artist.NumProfileViews. I am using the repository pattern, and a service layer. My controllers can only access the service layer, then the service layer accesses my repositories. I can do the paging fairly easily, i simply pass in my current page, and the page size to my data layer...but how would i safely let the user decide on the ordering of my entities. I am using S#arp Architecture 1.5.2 if that makes any difference. Thank you in advance.
