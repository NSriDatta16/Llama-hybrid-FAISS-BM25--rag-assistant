To clear things up a little, since some of the answers are providing incorrect information: The jQuery .css() method allows the use of either DOM or CSS notation in many cases. So, both backgroundColor and background-color will get the job done. Additionally, when you call .css() with arguments you have two choices as to what the arguments can be. They can either be 2 comma separated strings representing a css property and its value, or it can be a Javascript object containing one or more key value pairs of CSS properties and values. In conclusion the only thing wrong with your code is a missing } . The line should read: $("#myParagraph").css({"backgroundColor":"black","color":"white"}); You cannot leave the curly brackets out, but you may leave the quotes out from around backgroundColor and color . If you use background-color you must put quotes around it because of the hyphen. In general, it's a good habit to quote your Javascript objects, since problems can arise if you do not quote an existing keyword . A final note is that about the jQuery .ready() method $(handler); is synonymous with: $(document).ready(handler); as well as with a third not recommended form. This means that $(init) is completely correct, since init is the handler in that instance. So, init will be fired when the DOM is constructed.
