Data Scientist Consulting Interview Guide

Does anyone have any books or blogs that specifically sheds light on questions to ask your organization (from a consulting POV) as a data scientist? I am a new data scientist, which I have a background in consulting and predictive analytics. There are several good reads such as "The Data Scientist's Field Guide" by Booz Allen, "The McKinsey Mind" from McKinsey, or maybe "Business Analytics for Managers" from SAS. I have come across interview guides to understand and execute strategy, but none that specifically structure questions for a preliminary assessment of analytic capability. Any recommendations would be appreciated. Thank you.
