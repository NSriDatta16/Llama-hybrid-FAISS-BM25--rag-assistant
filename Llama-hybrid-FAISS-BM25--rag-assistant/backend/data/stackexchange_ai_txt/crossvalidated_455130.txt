The uni-variate Gini and Lift values will be different. This is because the probabilities you estimate will change based on the transformation you choose. Consider a logistic regression model without an intercept term $$\log(\frac{\pi_i}{1-\pi_i}) = \beta x_i.$$ If you transform $x_i$ (assuming that $x_i > 0\hspace{0.1cm} \forall i$ ) using $\log(\cdot)$ , then the logistic regression model would become $$\log(\frac{\pi_i}{1-\pi_i}) = \beta' \log(x_i)$$ and the estimated probabilities $\pi_i$ would change, which means your Gini/ROC curve will change, and so will your Gini.
