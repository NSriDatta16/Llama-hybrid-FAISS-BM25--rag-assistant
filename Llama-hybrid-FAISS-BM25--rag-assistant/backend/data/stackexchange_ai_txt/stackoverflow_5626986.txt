What is the best plugin to find a class by name using vim?

I'm trying to leave my bulky IDE behind and I've found that one of the best parts of something like intellij or visual studio + resharper is the ability to look for a class or symbol quickly. How does the average power vim user lookup a class or method name (grep/regex/other?) and does a great plugin exist for this? Thank you
