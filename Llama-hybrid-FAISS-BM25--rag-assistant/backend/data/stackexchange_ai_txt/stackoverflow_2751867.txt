Kind of messy, but I used this successfully foreach($xml->data->children() as $child) { //var_dump($child); foreach ($child->attributes() as $a => $b) { echo $a . '=' . $b . ' '; } } Not sure why, but the OpsView API returns a two-dimensional array instead of just having one value per XML node :( echo $child['name']; works and is much more elegant, thank you.
