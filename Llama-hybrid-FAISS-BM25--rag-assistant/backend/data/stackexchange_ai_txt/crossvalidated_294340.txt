Proper tests to examine parameter/treatment effects?

I am running simulation models on 100 plots randomly selected from a real study area. I am testing the effect of different modeled treatments that are applied uniformly across the study area. The data are not normally distributed (even if log transformed). (a) What statistical test is most appropriate to determine whether a single treatment (e.g., doubling the number of organisms in a plot) has an effect on a dependent variable (e.g., the number of potential habitat patches occupied). The plots are independent but the dependent variable is measured before and after a parameter change. Are these paired samples or not? (b) What statistical test is most appropriate to determine whether multiple treatments (e.g., changing the number of organisms in a plot, increasing the connectivity potential, etc.) has an effect on a dependent variable (e.g., the number of potential habitat patches occupied). Thanks!
