You can't. Pro*C only knows #if and #include. My best advice would be to preprocess the file as part of your build process to remove stuff Pro*C won't like. Something like grep -v -E '^#(warning|pragma|define)' unchangeable.h >unchangeable.pc.h My other advice would be to avoid the abomination which is Pro*C, but I'm guessing you're stuck with it...
