network monitoring software

Hello friends can anyone suggest me a Net Monitor for Employees tat allows you to see screens of computers connected to the network. This way you can observe what your employees are doing! Additionally, you have the ability to take control of a remote computer by controlling the mouse and keyboard. You can record remote computers screens even when you are not monitoring them. When your employees need instructions, you can show them your desktop. To increase your efficiency the console now include several tolls that can be executed on all or just selected remote computers. When you need attention you can send a message to employees and/or lock the remote computer. Communication uses encryption. Application works through Internet, LAN, WLAN or VPN. Agent can be remotely installed. i am runnin a traing institute with 30 Pcs which uses windows Xp and i am lookin for commercial software..
