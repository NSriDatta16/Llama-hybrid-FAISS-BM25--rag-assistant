Comparing fixed effects of a binomial GLMM

I got stuck interpreting the result of a generalised linear mixed model (GLMM). Feedbacks on how to compare two coefficients within a categorical fixed effect would be really helpful! To be specific, the research question I ask is that are mind-wandering minds more likely to lead to deliberate thought than at-present minds? So the response variable is deliberateness (1 or 0), the predictor variable is attention status (at-present vs. mind-wandering). I also wanted to include Participant ID and the activity (both categorical) as the random effects. I used the GLMM model because: 1. the response was binary, 2. it was a repeated measure, each participant received this question 18 times. 3. there were random missing values. I used the GLMM package in R, my code was: intent_status The result is: summary(intent_status) Call: glmm(fixed = deliberate ~ 0 + Status_Q, random = list(~0 + Participant, ~0 + Day_Recons), varcomps.names = c("at-present", "mind-wandering"), data = intent_status, family.glmm = bernoulli.glmm, m = 10^4, debug = TRUE) Link is: "logit (log odds)" Fixed Effects: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) Status_Qat-present 1.1898 0.1215 9.796 |z|)/2 Participant 2.29233 0.27786 8.250 From the p-values of fixe effects I know both coefficients of at-present and mind-wandering were significant (both B !=0). But how do i know if the B(at-present) significantly larger than B(mind-wandering)? I searched on-line but wasn't able to find the answer that I want. Please let me know if my approach is sensible to the original question, which is "are mind-wandering minds more likely to lead to deliberate thought than at-present minds"?
