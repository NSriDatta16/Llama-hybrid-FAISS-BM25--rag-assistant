.NET stores 2D arrays in Row Major order. Ref . (about half-way down!) CLI spec (section 8.9.1) states: Array elements shall be laid out within the array object in row-major order (i.e., the elements associated with the rightmost array dimension shall be laid out contiguously from lowest to highest index). The actual storage allocated for each array element can include platform-specific padding.
