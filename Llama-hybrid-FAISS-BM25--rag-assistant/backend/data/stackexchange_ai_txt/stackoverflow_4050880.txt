Cannot create a controller in Magento

I'm a beginning Magento programmer. I used to access the backend as localhost/magento/admin and everything was working fine on WAMP. I could access any route I set up in config.xml as localhost/magento/(frontName) and my controllers were working fine. Then I was trying to get Zend Debugger working with Eclipse, and in the process I fiddled with things, reinstalled WAMP and Magento a couple of times, installed Zend Server CE and later removed it, and MAYBE fiddled with some settings - don't remember exactly what I changed. Ultimately, I'm back on WAMP, but now localhost/magento/admin is broken and the backend must be accessed as localhost/magento/index.php/admin, which is ugly. Also, I can't get any routes working. localhost/magento/(frontName) is broken, localhost/magento/index.php/(frontName) gives a 404 error within Magento. I've been trying to fix this for nearly 2 days now; I'd be grateful for any help. Sorry about the n00b question.
