Can I use Lasso before Random Forest?

I have a small dataset with 160 obs. and >50 candidate predictors, some of which are correlated. I would like to fit a classification model for prediction, and to identify the best set of predictors. I was thinking to use a Lasso Regression for feature elimination and then fit a random forest with the selected covariates. Would this be legitimate, or should I use the random forest directly? Do you think that some other classification algorithm would be more suitable (eg boosting trees?) Thank you.
