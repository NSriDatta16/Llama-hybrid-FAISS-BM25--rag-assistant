What about shearing and shuffling bands to mangle display and mouse-only input? Start by taking your sine-wave morphed text, divide into horizontal bands or maybe even a grid. That makes optical recognition harder and might allow you to avoid the kind of nasty background games that make some captchas hard for humans. For a site where you can rely on local drag in the browser, instead of typing in an entry use shuffling requiring the user to re-order pieces (just in sloppy order, not like one of those puzzles). Or, if you wanted to use clicks alone, the classic sliding tile puzzle. Note, I've run into a captcha where you had to identify which of N cartoons had an animal in them which succeeded in blocking me! Wellington Grey sums up the AI CAPTCHA race nicely.
