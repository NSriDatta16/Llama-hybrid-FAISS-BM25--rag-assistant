CMake and absolute header paths

I'm trying to use CMake to build my C++ project and I have a problem in the header paths. Since I'm using a lot of classes organized in several directories, all my include statements are with absolute paths (so no need to use "../../") but when try to make the CMake-generated Makefile it just doesn't work. Does anyone know how to specify in CMakeLists.txt that all the includes are with absolute paths? My output when trying to make ~/multiboost/BanditsLS/GenericBanditAlgorithmLS.h:45:25: Utils/Utils.h: No such file or directory ~/multiboost/BanditsLS/GenericBanditAlgorithmLS.h:46:35: Utils/StreamTokenizer.h: No such file or directory My CMakeLists.txt file : #The following command allows the use of the "file" command cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.6) #The declaration of the project project(multiboost) #This allows recursive parsing of the source files file( GLOB_RECURSE source_files * ) list(REMOVE_ITEM source_files ./build/* ) #This indicates the target (the executable) add_executable( multiboost ${source_files} #EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL build/ )
