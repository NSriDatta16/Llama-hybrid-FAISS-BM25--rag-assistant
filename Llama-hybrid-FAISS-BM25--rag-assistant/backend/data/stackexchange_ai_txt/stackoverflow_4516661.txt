Unable to use UIPanGestureRecognizer to move UIImageView

I am trying to create a program where a user can drag a UIImageView around the screen by using UIPanGestureRecognizer. I have tried a few different ways but cannot figure it out. I am not sure if I need to create a sender/requestor. My understanding is that the UIImageView needs to be placed in a UIView that can handle gestures. In my program I have a view controller - AdvancedViewController1. I have created a UIView named AdvancedView1. In interface Builder I have inserted AdvancedView1 into the AdvancedViewController 1. The following are my .h and .m files for the controller and the view. I have only included the relevant code. Please let me know if I am close, and how to fix my code. Thanks in advance for your help. AdvancedViewController1.h #import #import "AdvancedView1.h" @interface AdvancedViewController1 : UIViewController { UIWindow *window; AdvancedView1 *advancedView1; UIImageView * option1; } @property (retain) IBOutlet AdvancedView1 *advancedView1; @property (retain) IBOutlet UIImageView *option1; @end In IB I have linked an IBOutlet to AdvancedView1 to the UIView and option1 to the UIImageView that I want to be able to move. AdvancedViewController.m #import "AdvancedViewController1.h" #import "AdvancedView1.h" @implementation AdvancedViewController1 @synthesize advancedView1; @synthesize option1 - (void)viewDidLoad { UIGestureRecognizer *pangr = [[UIPanGestureRecognizer alloc] initWithTarget:self.advancedView1 action:@selector(pan:)]; pangr.delegate = self; [self.advancedView1 addGestureRecognizer:pangr]; [pangr release]; [super viewDidLoad]; } AdvancedView1.h #import #import "AdvancedViewController1.h" @class AdvancedView1; @interface AdvancedView1 : UIView{ CGPoint* origin; } @property (nonatomic) CGPoint* origin; @end AdvancedView1.m #import "AdvancedView1.h" #import "AdvancedViewController1.h" @implementation AdvancedView1; @synthesize origin; - (void)pan:(UIPanGestureRecognizer *) gesture { if ((gesture.state == UIGestureRecognizerStateChanged) || (gesture.state == UIGestureRecognizerStateEnded)) { CGPoint translation = [gesture translationInView:self]; gesture.origin = CGPointMake(gesture.origin.x+translation.x, gesture.origin.y+translation.y); [gesture setTranslation:CGPointZero inView:self]; }
