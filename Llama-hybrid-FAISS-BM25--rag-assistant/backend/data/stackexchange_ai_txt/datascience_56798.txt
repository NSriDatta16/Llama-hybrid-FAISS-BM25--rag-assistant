Learning algorithms Instead of learning a function as a calculation done by a feed-forward neural network, there's a whole research domain regarding learning algorithms from sample data. For example, one might use something like a Neural Turing Machine or some other method where execution of an algorithm is controlled by machine learning at its decision points. Toy algoritms like finding a maximum, or sorting a list, or reversing a list, or filtering a list are commonly used as examples in algorithm learning research.
