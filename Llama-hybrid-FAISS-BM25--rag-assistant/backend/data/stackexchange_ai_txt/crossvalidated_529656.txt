For comparing the overall trend (from 2016 onward) you could use a linear model, which would give you a slope over the years, which you can also test for significance. The slope would tell you whether the income is changing over time (increasing/decreasing/constant). You could also include the years before 2016 and include for ex. a dummy variable indicating the old and the new strategy, 1 for years >= 2016, and 0 otherwise. Then with the same linear model you could test whether the average sales are different between these two indicators.
