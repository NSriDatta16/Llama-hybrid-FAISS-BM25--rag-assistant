Can someone help me convert this cocos2d-iphone specific code to be compatible with the cocos2d-mac template?

This code is used by sprites on the scene so they can be dragged. I am having trouble trying to figure out how to convert this code to be compatible with the cocos2d-mac template. I appreciate any help. //////////////////////////////////////////////////// /////properties for touches moved - (void)ccTouchMoved:(UITouch *)touch withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { CGPoint touchLocation = [self convertTouchToNodeSpace:touch]; CGPoint oldTouchLocation = [touch previousLocationInView:touch.view]; oldTouchLocation = [[CCDirector sharedDirector] convertToGL:oldTouchLocation]; oldTouchLocation = [self convertToNodeSpace:oldTouchLocation]; CGPoint translation = ccpSub(touchLocation, oldTouchLocation); [self panForTranslation:translation]; }
