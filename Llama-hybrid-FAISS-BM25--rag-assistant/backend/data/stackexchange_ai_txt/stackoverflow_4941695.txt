Re-read the configuration 'snmpd.conf' file? HOW?

Well, a year back I developed an agent module for net-snmp to monitor disk usage/statistics. It was locally installed on a system in LAN. Now, I intend to use the same module for my Home PC and to trap over it from office.. But my ISP does not provide me a 'static IP' and its expensive to own one. Over the last week-end I found out 'no-ip.org' can help me out to setup a virtual static IP using Dynamic IP (Just stole its working-logic, simple) Anyways, Here is what I did! I wrote a program that will check for present running IP in my system and update me through a mail and it also inserts the same to my snmpd.conf file. I do not know how to make 'snmpd' to re-read the configuration file without restarting the snmpd service. After spending lot of time on google I found I can use ' kill -SIGHUP ' But will this ever help me out in re-reading the .conf file? SIGHUP would terminate the process, generally speaking... How would I do this if I ever wanted to re-read the .conf file without restarting the snmpd daemon?
