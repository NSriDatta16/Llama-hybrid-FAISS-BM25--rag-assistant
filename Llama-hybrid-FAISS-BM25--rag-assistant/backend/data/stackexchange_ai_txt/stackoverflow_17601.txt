With or without hyphenation? Without it's easy. Just encapsulate your text as wordobjects per word and give them a method getWidth(). Then start at the first word adding up the rowlength until it is greater than the available space. If so, wrap the last word and start counting again for the next row starting with this one, etc. With hyphenation you need hyphenation rules in a common format like: hy-phen-a-tion Then it's the same as the above except you need to split the last word which has caused the overflow. A good example and tutorial of how to structure your code for an excellent text editor is given in the Gang of Four Design Patterns book. It's one of the main samples on which they show the patterns.
