Clustering multivariate temporal count data

I am interested in utilizing machine learning clustering algorithms on a count dataset that: Takes account of Sparsity (excess of zeros) Takes into account a complex interrelationship like ecological and microbiological relations Clusters (then classify eventually) observations coming from tensors: observation x variable x time rather than matrices observation x variable I first tried implementing zero inflated models in R via package ZIP , then CaDENCE because it uses a neural network to model the conditional density of a ZI . But the problem is, it has to: be a multivariate model, and it has to take into account the interrelationship So, I'm not sure it can fit. Thus, how can I apply machine learning on sparse interrelated count data?
