It's Nontaxable . It's just an ordinary word. Non is not a word (in English). It's just a prefix. Likewise, The prefixes un- and re- are not words in their own right, so when you put them in front of identifiers, you don't keep the rest capitalized. For example: Set , Reset ; Do , Undo . Apart from that, I have to discourage use of an identifier cast in the negative. It sounds like this is a Boolean value, and that just leads to double-negative expressions, like this: if not Nontaxable then ... Don't make people have to read stuff like that.
