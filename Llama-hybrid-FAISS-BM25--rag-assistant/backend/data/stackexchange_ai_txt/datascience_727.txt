Your problem is that the resets aren't part of your linear model. You either have to cut your data into different fragments at the resets, so that no reset occurs within each fragment, and you can fit a linear model to each fragment. Or you can build a more complicated model that allows for resets. In this case, either the time of occurrence of the resets has to be put into the model manually, or the time of resets has to be a free parameter in the model that is determined by fitting the model to the data.
