Looking at the source (no decent documentation!), you can pass through SQL, which can be parameterized like the sql for :conditions, etc., so you can do something like: @books = Book.where("author_id = 1 OR author_id = 2") Not ideal to drop down to raw SQL, but I can't see a more elegant way to do it using the where method. Source and absence of documentation here
