In Clojure - How do I access keys in a vector of structs

I have the following vector of structs: (defstruct #^{:doc "Basic structure for book information."} book :title :authors :price) (def #^{:doc "The top ten Amazon best sellers on 16 Mar 2010."} best-sellers [(struct book "The Big Short" ["Michael Lewis"] 15.09) (struct book "The Help" ["Kathryn Stockett"] 9.50) (struct book "Change Your Prain, Change Your Body" ["Daniel G. Amen M.D."] 14.29) (struct book "Food Rules" ["Michael Pollan"] 5.00) (struct book "Courage and Consequence" ["Karl Rove"] 16.50) (struct book "A Patriot's History of the United States" ["Larry Schweikart","Michael Allen"] 12.00) (struct book "The 48 Laws of Power" ["Robert Greene"] 11.00) (struct book "The Five Thousand Year Leap" ["W. Cleon Skousen","James Michael Pratt","Carlos L Packard","Evan Frederickson"] 10.97) (struct book "Chelsea Chelsea Bang Bang" ["Chelsea Handler"] 14.03) (struct book "The Kind Diet" ["Alicia Silverstone","Neal D. Barnard M.D."] 16.00)]) I would like to sum the prices of all the books in the vector. What I have is the following: (defn get-price "Same as print-book but handling multiple authors on a single book" [ {:keys [title authors price]} ] price) Then I: (reduce + (map get-price best-sellers)) Is there a way of doing this without mapping the "get-price" function over the vector? Or is there an idiomatic way of approaching this problem?
