The official BroadcastReceiver API reference clearly states (3rd paragraph) : [...] the Intent broadcast mechanism is completely separate from Intents that are used to start Activities. There is no way for a BroadcastReceiver to see or capture Intents used with startActivity(); [...] So as Jason & HellBoy have suggested, instead of starting an Activity in makePhoneCall(), you send a Broadcast to your BroadcastReceiver, which in turn starts an Activity (only if it contains the marker extra of course)...
