If this program is meant to evolve, meaning this wasn't the last version of it, and probably new features are going to be added, I would suggest preparing yourself to talk with your bosses about the current status of the project Call their attention and share with them how the project came to be and explain (using the best of your communication skills) to them that this characteristic is intrinsic to the origin of the project. Sometimes this happens and code refactoring is meant for these situations.
