I am answering my own question to give an indication of how far I have got in obtaining an answer to my original question. It is apparent that any metrication of concepts related to elegance will share the following characteristics: they are likely to be heuristic they are likely to have to be based on multiple iterations of the development process they are likely to be relative rather than absolute they are likely to be based on areas of study other than software/system development, in addition to needing information from the system development itself. Examples of possible domains are aesthetics, psychology, neurolinguistics and neuroaesthetics; If the work I am doing is to be of any value to software developers, it must not be based on complex, mathematical or statistical models, but must offer guidelines based on their work, and work by other developers. Any guidelines are likely to be based on the answers to questions like: What is the frequency of objects, attributes, data types? How does this frequency compare with other projects? Is this measure of any value in aiding the developer to evaluate his project/see room for improvement? I am still seeking references to work being done in this arena.
