Prediction interval for sum of observations from logistic regression

It is possible make prediction intervals for $Y\mid X=x$ where $X \sim \operatorname{Binom}(n,p)$ and $Y \sim \operatorname{Binom}(m,p)$ as answered in my previous question . Now I wish to make a prediction interval for $Y$ in a logistic regression settings. Yes, making prediction intervals for single observations in logistic regression is not very useful . Rather, the goal is to create a prediction interval for the aggregate sum. Here is an example of what I am trying to do. Assume we have a binary response, $z$, and three binary predictors $A,B,C$. The model $\operatorname{logit}(z) \sim A + B + C$ is fit (only main effects) using training data with both the response and predictors available which has $n=100$ observations of various levels of $A,B,C$. Next, someone hands us $m=50$ new rows of data that only contains $A,B,C$ e.g... $$ \begin{array}{cccl} A & B & C \\[6pt] 1 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 1 & 0 \\ & \vdots \\ & \vdots & & \text{46 rows ommitted} \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{array} $$ Our goal is to predict how many $Z_i=1$ for these 50 new observations (i.e. the aggregate sum $Y=\sum_{i=1}^m{Z}_i$). We can get a point estimate by summing the estimated probabilities for each new observation, but how would we generate a prediction interval? Since the sum is not Binomial ($p$ varies), there doesn't seem to be an answer available.
