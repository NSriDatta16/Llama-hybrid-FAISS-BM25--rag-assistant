There's a maximum of 5 concurrent connections for SQL Express. If you have more than 5 concurrent connections performance will drop severely. Alos, you have to consider that SQL Agent is not included so if you want to schedule backups or maintenance tasks you have to use windows scheduler. Other that this, it's a perfect solution for small databases.
