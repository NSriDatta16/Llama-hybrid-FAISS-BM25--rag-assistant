Feature selection from large time series data

I have a dataset containing thousands of economic variables (FRED data) and I am looking to algorithmic-ally extract a set of leading indicators to be used in a forecasting framework. Granger causality seems the most obvious test for determining which variables are leading indicators but I am concerned this will be computationally intractable as it would require estimating and determining lag order for 2n models. Is there a more efficient way to estimate causality across such a wide range of features? Beyond using granger causality are there any other methods that come to mind for selecting leading indicators from such a large dataset? Thanks for any thoughts or suggestions!!
