Magento - How to display all user fields on registration form?

when I go to Customers -> Manage Customers -> Add New Customer, I see that there are Telephone,Zip, Country, and state fields. When I go to my frontend website the click 'Register', I see only First Name, Last Name, Email address, and password. How do I display Telephone, Zip, Country, and state fields on my front end? Thanks.
