It depends on the length of the time series. For instance, if I have only six months of temperature data, then I cannot use an ARIMA model to forecast the other six months, as the data I have so far does not fully pick up the seasonal pattern. On the other hand, if I have three or four years worth of data, then the seasonal pattern can be more easily detected. In this regard, I would try expanding the length of your time series to determine the best model. If you are working with only a few minutes of data (as seems to be the case in your comment) then the data simply is not exhaustive enough to infer characteristics of the time series over a longer period.
