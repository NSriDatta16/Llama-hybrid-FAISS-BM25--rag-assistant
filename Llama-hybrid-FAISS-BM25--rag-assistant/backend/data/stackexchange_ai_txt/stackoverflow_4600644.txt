I figured out a way to make this work. It is a little bit hacky but it got the job done. If anyone knows of a more appropriate way to do this please do let me know. To get it working I made myself a copy of the Linkify class and edited the part that handles the linkifying for phone numbers to do @mention links instead. Here is where I found my copy of the linkify class I changed this: if ((mask & PHONE_NUMBERS) != 0) { gatherLinks(links, text, Regex.PHONE_PATTERN, new String[] { "tel:" }, sPhoneNumberMatchFilter, sPhoneNumberTransformFilter); } into this: if ((mask & PHONE_NUMBERS) != 0) { gatherLinks(links, text, Pattern.compile("@([A-Za-z0-9_-]+)"), new String[] { "http://www.twitter.com/" }, null, null); } I called this class MyLinkify and used this code in my Activity to apply the links. MyLinkify.addLinks(tweetTxt, Linkify.ALL); To get the MyLinkify class to build I also had to add a copy of the Regex class into my project, here is where I found Regex.java Im putting this as an answer incase anyone else looking for this effect finds this thread. I realized this is probably not the best way to go about getting this to work. If anyone knows a better way to get it working please add it here and I'll select it is the actual answer to this question.
