Zero autocorrelation at different lags does not imply constant variance. An ARCH(1) time series is illustrative of this, in that the variances are autocorrelated but the values of the time series themselves are not. That's what happens at an intuitive level (i.e. fit ARIMA and then (G)ARCH). And heteroskedasticity doesn't need to be "checked"; all you need to do is reject the assumption of homoskedasticity. This can be done by looking at, for example, the ACF of squared residuals. There are numerous statistical tests that can test the null hypothesis of homoskedasticity. In practice, if you discover that the residuals have a GARCH structure, what you do is you first identify the order of the GARCH structure and then re-fit your ARIMA+GARCH model simultaneously (in one shot). You can do this using the rugarch library in R, for example. The effect of including the GARCH structure includes, but is not limited to, interpretation of the GARCH coefficients and also improving prediction intervals for forecasts.
