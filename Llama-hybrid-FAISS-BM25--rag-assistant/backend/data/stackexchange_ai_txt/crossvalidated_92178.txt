Times ago I went to this website Rdatamining that suggested dynamic time warping for time series classification. Basically, it uses dynamic time warping to evaluate a distance between time series and to cluster them based on that distance. Within cluster you might have a look to hierarchical time series clustering as proposed in the hts R package (for the theory have a look to Roby Hyndman Forecast Book Chapter ).
