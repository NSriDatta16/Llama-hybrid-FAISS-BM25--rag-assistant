I'm trying to write a similar program and have the same problem. It seems to me that it's possible to have only one "onTouchListener" in the whole program. I use FrameLayout and when I touch the screen I want a new ball to appear. It works when I define "FrameLayout.setOnTouchListener" If I touch existing ball I want to drag it somewhere. It works when "Ball.setOnTouchListener" is defined. But when I use both "setOnTouchListeners" than only one of them works. So I think that Android can work with only one "setOnTouchListener" and in it you have to somehow (I don't know how) check which dynamically created ball was touched and process it.
