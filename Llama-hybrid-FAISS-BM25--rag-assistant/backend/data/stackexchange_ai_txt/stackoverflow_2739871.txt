As a solo developer, one thing that helped me make the shift to TDD was setting a code coverage threshold for myself. In my build script I used a code coverage tool (NCover) to determine the percentage of code that was covered by tests, and initially set the threshold at 80%. If I stopped writing my tests first the coverage percentage would fall below the 80% threshold, and my build script would cause a failure. I would then immediately slap myself on the wrist and write the missing tests. I gradually increased the code coverage threshold and eventually became a full TDD convert.
