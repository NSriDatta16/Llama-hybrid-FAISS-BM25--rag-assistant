Apart from that the population may be too big or part of it somewhere hidden, part of objects just may not exist at the time of the measurement. If you craft bolts and measure them, statistical estimates like average length plus minus remain valid for the bolts you will make in the future, if you do not change the technology or intended length. It is also possible to imagine situations when some objects are already lost/destroyed at the time of the measurements, and you need to make conclusions about them from the objects still available.
