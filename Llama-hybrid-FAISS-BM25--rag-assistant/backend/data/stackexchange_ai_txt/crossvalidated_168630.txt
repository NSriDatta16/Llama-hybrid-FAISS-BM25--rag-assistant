Visually summarising multiple diverse metric results

I have a multivariate time series (climate fluxes), and I have a number of model outputs that I want to asses. I also have number of metrics that I can use to assess the performance of each variable in the series (e.g. RMSE, mean bias, correlation, difference in variance, differences in skewness and kurtosis, differences in the upper and lower tails of the distributions, and so on - at least 10 metrics for each variable for model output). So I end up with many, many scalar statistics for each model. Each of these numbers is a random variable, with it's own distribution, and those distributions are extremely diverse (e.g. RMSE can go to infinity, correlation's domain is $[-1, 1]$; bias is "better" as it goes to zero, correlation is "better" as it goes to 1). I'm looking for a good method of visually representing the performance of each model using all of those metric results at once. I know that there's no perfect way to do this, because once you hit the Pareto region, you ultimately have to weigh the value of improved performance in one metric against degraded performance in another metric in a totally subjective way, but I'm basically just looking for ideas.
