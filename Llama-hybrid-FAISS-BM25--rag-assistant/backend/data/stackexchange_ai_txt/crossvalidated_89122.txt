You could use moving averages . Here is the basic idea. First, consider some time series data with the random variable (RV) on the y-axis and time on the x-axis. We have one RV measurement for each time increment. We start by taking an average of the RV values for the first n time increments, say n = 5 and taking the average of time increments 1 through 5. We then graph a point representing this average at y = avg. and x = mid-point for the time increments under consideration (x = 3 if the number of time increments is 5). Now, slide over one time increment, and take the average again for time increments 2 through 6, placing the new average value at x = 4. repeat this until your run out of time increments. Then connect the average points to create a segmented line string representing the trend. I hope that is clear enough for you to get the picture. This is conceptually very similar to linear regression. However, the representation is a line string, not a line or polynomial.
