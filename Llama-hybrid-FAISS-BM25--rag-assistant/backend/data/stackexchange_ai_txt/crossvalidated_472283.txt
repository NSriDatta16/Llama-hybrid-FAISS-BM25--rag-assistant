Is it possible to get p-values? From glmnet, no. Because the model is purposefully biased, traditional tests of hypothesis are invalid. Does it make sense to fit a linear model from the reduced set of input variables of the lasso model and then compute their statistical significance? I would recommend against this, as the test would be conditional on the fact that the variable is selected. People do this none the less, but it really doesn't tell the whole story transparently. Ryan Tibshirani wrote this paper and a corresponding R package to do post selection inference for the lasso. The package returns confidence intervals, but I haven't had the time to play with it and check the coverage properties myself.
