Where are you looking that its greyed out ? If its on a database you need to go to storage / full text catalogs in management studio to change full text settings in sql server 2008. You can check its installed in the first place by going to services; by default it seems to be disabled after install. If its not installed you can change the installed components through add remove programs.
