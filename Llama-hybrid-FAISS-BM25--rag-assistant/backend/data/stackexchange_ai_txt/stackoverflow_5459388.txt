You can't. Instead, you can make a dictionary: Averages = table.Columns.Cast ().ToDictionary( c => c.ColumnName, c => grp.Average(dr => Convert.ToDouble(dr[c])) ) The Convert.ToDouble is needed since I don't know what tyhpe the coulmn is, and Average needs a specific numeric type. If all of the columns are the same numeric type, you can replace that with a cast.
