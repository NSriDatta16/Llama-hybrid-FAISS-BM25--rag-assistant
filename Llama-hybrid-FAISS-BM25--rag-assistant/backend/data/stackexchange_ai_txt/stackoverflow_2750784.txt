Assuming you are under Linux, you can get processor load averages by reading from a file /proc/loadavg which contains 3 numbers separated by spaces. You can also call uptime command from php exec('uptime') and parse its output, which also contains load averages (among other stuff). How to interpret load averages - I usually take 1.0 * cores as a maximum healthy load. So if you have 4 cores then anything above 4.0 would indicate that processor is doing some heavy calculations and better wait.
