How do I detect rollover on elements while dragging a MovieClip above them?

I have a draggable item, a MovieClip that calls startDrag() on itself when it is clicked, and another MovieClip on the stage. I need the MovieClip to receive ROLL_OVER and ROLL_OUT events while the draggable MovieClip is being dragged over it, but the lower clip doesn't receive these messages while a clip is being dragged over it. Essentially, ROLL_OVER is only sent to the topmost MovieClip under the mouse. Normally, you'd fix that with some combination of mouseEnabled or mouseChildren on the overlapping MovieClips, but if you do that to a draggable MovieClip, it breaks dragging. I need to detect when the mouse is over the lower MovieClip, regardless of what MovieClips are above it. So, how do I do that?
