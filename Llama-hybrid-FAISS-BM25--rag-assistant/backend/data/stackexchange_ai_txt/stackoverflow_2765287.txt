TreeView Scrollbar in PreviewMouseMove

I'm trying to implement drag/drop in my TreeView and have it all working except once the scroll bar appears inside the TreeView. When the user attempts to scroll the bar by dragging it up or down PreviewMouseMove naturally gets fired. However, I cannot figure out a way to recognize that the mouse is over the scrollbar and not initiate the beginning of a drag/drop. Any ideas?
