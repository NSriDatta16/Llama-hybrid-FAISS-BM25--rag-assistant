Is it okay to use the first differentiated data even though my raw data is stationary from the start?

I am doing a time series analysis and the Augmented-Dickey Fuller Test result says that my data is stationary. But my raw data is not normally distributed. When I took the first difference of my data, it is now normally distributed. Is it okay to use the first differentiated data even though my raw data is stationary from the start?
