RNN input shape is batch_size x sequence_length x nbr_features. Believe you need to pre-process and setup your training data properly. You need to generate multiple training examples from the available data. I am not sure what is your data looking like. From available info, it appears you have 9999 data points for a feature that are dependent. I would go in the below direction similar to CBOW model that builds based of conditional probabilities. First identify your sequence length (say 25) Generate multiple training examples from the available raw data(26th is the predictor output) Proceed with training.
