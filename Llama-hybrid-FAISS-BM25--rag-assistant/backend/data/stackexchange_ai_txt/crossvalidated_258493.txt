t-distribution notation on Bayesian conjugate prior wikipedia page

On this Wikipedia page on 'conjugate priors' the following notation is used for the posterior predictive of a normal random variable with known mean $\mu$ but unknown variance $\sigma^2$: $$t_{2\alpha'}(\tilde{x}|\mu,\sigma^2 = \beta'/\alpha')$$ Here's my interpretation of the notation: $\tilde{x}$ is a new i.i.d. variable the distribution of which is described by the t-distribution. $\mu$ is the known mean and is the first parameter of the distribution $\sigma^2$ is second parameter of the distribution and is the Bayesian variance estimate given by the ratio of the posterior $\beta$ and $\alpha$ $\alpha'$ and $\beta'$ are the posterior hyper-parameters of $\sigma^2$ $t_{2\alpha'}$ is a t-distribution with $\nu = n - 1$ degrees of freedom that has been shifted by $\mu$ and multiplied by $\sigma$. My guess is that the pdf is given by: $$f(x) = \left(\frac{\Gamma(\frac{\nu+1}{2})} {\sqrt{\nu\pi}\,\Gamma(\frac{\nu}{2})} \left(1+\frac{x^2}{\nu} \right)^{\!-\frac{\nu+1}{2}} + \mu\right)\sigma$$ Can anyone more knowledgeable clear this up for me?
