Are reinforcement learning and deep learning equivalent?

Can a deep learning classifier, trained on a dataset derived from a reinforcement learning (RL) agent's interactions with an environment, achieve the same performance as the RL agent itself? Assuming an environment that can generate unlimited data, where the RL agent's actions and outcomes are recorded and formatted as a classification dataset (with states as inputs and actions as labels, assume you have the same allocation strategy of final reward to each earlier actions), would there be a mathematical equivalence between the RL approach and the deep learning classifier's approach? If there's a performance discrepancy, what additional information or capabilities does RL possess that a deep learning classifier does not?
