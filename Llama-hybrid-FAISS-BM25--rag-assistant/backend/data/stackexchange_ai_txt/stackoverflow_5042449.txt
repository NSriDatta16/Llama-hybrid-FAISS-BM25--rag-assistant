The answer was to call a function created in the C++ using: extern "C" { __declspec(dllexport) void StartAgent() { printf ("Starting Agent... \n"); StartServer(true); RunMainLoop(); } } This is then called in the C# using: [DllImport("myDll.dll")] public static extern string StartAgent(); StartAgent(); Calling this from the C# and into the C++ gets the application running.
