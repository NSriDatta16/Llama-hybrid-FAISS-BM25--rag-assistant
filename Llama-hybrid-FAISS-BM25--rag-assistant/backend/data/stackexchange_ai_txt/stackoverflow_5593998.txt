I feel you should go like this: Have your application store Contacts in a database (I guess you're already doing this) Have your application store messages in another database (I guess you're already doing this too) In the UI, display all the messages inside a ListView, by querying them from your message database. When user clicks on any message, have another screen that loads this message in full, and lets the user select the recipients Send the text message to the selected recipients now I just wanted to point out the flow of the app, since the storage and retrieval process os pretty straight forward. I am not sure if this was what you were looking for. Do let me know.
