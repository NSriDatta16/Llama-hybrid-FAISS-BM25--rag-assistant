Aliases are great if you consider that my organization has table names like: SchemaName.DataPointName_SubPoint_Sub-SubPoint_Sub-Sub-SubPoint... My team uses a pretty standard set of abbreviations, so the guesswork is minimized. We'll have say ProgramInformationDataPoint shortened to pidp, and submissions to just sub. The good thing is that once you get going in this manner and people agree with it, it makes those HAYUGE files just a little smaller and easier to manage. At least for me, fewer characters to convey the same info seems to go a little easier on my brain.
