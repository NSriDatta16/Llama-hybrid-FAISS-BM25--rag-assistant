Variable importance from GLMNET

I am looking at using the lasso as a method for selecting features and fitting a predictive model with a binary target. Below is some code I was playing with to try out the method with regularized logistic regression. My question is I get a group of "significant" variables but am I able to rank order these to estimate relative importance of each? Can the coefficients be standardized for this purpose of rank by absolute value (I understand that they are shown on the original variable scale through the coef function)? If so, how to do so (using the standard deviation of x and y) Standardize Regression Coefficients . SAMPLE CODE: library(glmnet) #data comes from #http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic) datasetTest
