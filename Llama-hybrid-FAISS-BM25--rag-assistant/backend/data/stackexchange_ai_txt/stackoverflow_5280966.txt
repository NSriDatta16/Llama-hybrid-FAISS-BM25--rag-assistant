Overloading new operator may look as a good idea at first glance if you want to do custom allocation for some reason (i.e. avoiding memory fragmentation intrinsic to c-runtime allocator or/and avoiding locks on memory management calls in multithreaded programs). But when you get to implementation you may realize that in most cases you want to pass some additional context to this call, for example a thread-specific heap for objects of a given size. And overloading of new/delete simply doesn't work here. So eventually you may want to create your own facade to your custom memory management subsystem.
