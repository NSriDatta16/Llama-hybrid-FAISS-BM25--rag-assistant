Here, MSE = variance / sample size. Bias is implicitly included, and trying to separate it out wouldn't be meaningful. Note that random forests often outperform regression with this task. The goal of a regression tree is to generate a line that best fits the data. MSE is the average squared difference between the actual data values and where the data point would be on the proposed line. The tree runs an algorithm that finds the line that results in the smallest MSE. Regarding variance, this method seeks to minimize variance. Variance is defined as the sum of the squared errors (or differences between the actual data points and line selected as the best solution). R-squared is another method that is commonly used.
