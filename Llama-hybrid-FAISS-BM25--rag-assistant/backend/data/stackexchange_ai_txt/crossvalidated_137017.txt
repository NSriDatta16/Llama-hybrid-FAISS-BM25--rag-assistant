How do I combine stochastic policy with Q-value Iteration?

I am trying to use a stochastic policy in my q-value iteration algorithm. Note I am not asking for Q-learning but rather Value Iteration that uses Q-value. As I understand it, stochastic policy is a probability of choosing an action from a particular state. On the other hand, Q-value is a value of being in state-action pair. How do I combine both?
