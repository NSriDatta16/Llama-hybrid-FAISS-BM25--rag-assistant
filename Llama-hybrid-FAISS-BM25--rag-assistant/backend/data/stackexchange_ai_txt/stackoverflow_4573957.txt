I think a discussion "accepting passwords vs auto generating the password" is meanless in the context of your qestion if you make shure that the pfx-file is deleted after the import. It will only exist until beeing imported into "machine's certificate store." If the pfx-file must be backed up or transferd via email/usbstick i prefer the "accepting passwords form user" variant because Providing an inputform for the password plus implementing some logigic to make shure that the password ist strong enougn is easier than organizing that the user gets its pfx-file and the corresponding password via two independet channels. Sending pfx + password in one email is as secure as having no password at all.
