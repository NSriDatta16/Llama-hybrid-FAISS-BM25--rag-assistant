Best practices to compute TFIDF matrix based on another TFIDF matrix in R

I'd like to compute a TFIDF matrix ( tfidf_matrix_b ) based on a previously computed TFIDF matrix ( tfidf_matrix_a ). Is there a good way to do this using prebuilt R functions / a good algorithm to do so? I am aware of packages such as tm (in fact, it is my difficulty in using tm that prompted this post). I can certainly write a function for myself that will: 1) Calculate tf_matrix_a from corpus_a 2) Calculate tf_matrix_b from corpus_b using a dictionary created from corpus_a 3) Calculate tfidf_matrix_a and tfidf_matrix_b by dividing tf_matrix_a and tf_matrix_b by the document frequencies calculated from tf_matrix_a However, I would have thought there would be a more elegant solution / this already existed in something like tm . Does anyone have a more elegant solution? If it's helpful, this is for the purposes of text classification, classifying new data based upon a model trained on old data. Gotta have the new data in same form as old data to do so! Thank you!
