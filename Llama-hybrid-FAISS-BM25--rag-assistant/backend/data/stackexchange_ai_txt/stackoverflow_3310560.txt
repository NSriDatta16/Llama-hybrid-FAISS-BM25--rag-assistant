To help you understand how long c++ programmers have been doing this, I learned about this technique in the late 90's working with COM. I think it's a personal choice as to the exact mechanism you use to leverage the fundamental properties of c++ stack frames and destructors to make your object lifetime management easier. I wouldn't go very far out of my way to avoid needing to assign to a variable. (this next thing I'm not 100% sure about but I'm putting it in hopes that someone will chime in - I know I've done this in the past but I couldn't find it in Google just now and I've been trying to remember... see, garbage collectors have dulled my mind!) I believe you can force the scope with a plain old pair of curlys (POPOC). { // new stack frame auto_ptr instanceA(new C); { auto_ptr instanceB(new C); } // instanceB is gone } // instanceA is gone
