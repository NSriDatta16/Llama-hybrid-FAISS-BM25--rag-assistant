Time Series figures finder

I have been working on a continuous Time Series with the objective of creating an algorithm that finds some specific kind of figures defined by the graph of the curve. I partially solved the problem looking for mathematical conditions that the points should satisfy in order to consider the figure that I'm looking for. However I would like to know if this can be done with ML tools. Some of the figures that I automated are: Mountain shaped figure bounded by two similar stabilities A ladder looking figure bounded by an initial stability and a final stability I know that this is very vague, but that is the idea of what I'm looking for. I tried using Dynamic time warping in order to find similar shaped figures but it does not worked so well in order to find these figures. Is there anything useful that I can study in order to attack this problem?
