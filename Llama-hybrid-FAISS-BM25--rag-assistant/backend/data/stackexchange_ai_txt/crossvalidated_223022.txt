What is meant with "decision level of factor loading"?

I have performed a PCA with some data sets. Prior to performing PCA, I tested the applicability of PCA with KMO and Bartlett's Sphericity tests. I got some critics stating that I have to add "my decision level of factor loadings" instead of KMO or BS results! Can anyone tell me what "decision level of factor loadings" means?
