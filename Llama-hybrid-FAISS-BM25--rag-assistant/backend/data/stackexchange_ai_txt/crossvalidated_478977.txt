The problem of finding error estimates of statistics in (autocorrelated) time series is usually approached via block bootstrapping. It is the same in spirit as your approach. See Section 5 of this document for a very short summary [1]. There is also some parallel work in the physics community, where ideas from renormalisation are used; see e.g. [2] for a clear exposition.
