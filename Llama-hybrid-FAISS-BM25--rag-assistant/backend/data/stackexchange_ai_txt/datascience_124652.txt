Let me provide some guidance on the various aspects you've mentioned: 1. Encoding Categorical Variables Yes, you should encode categorical variables like REGION , PROVINCE_NAME , DISTRICT_NAME , and INCIDENT_TYPE . Use techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding, depending on the nature of the variables. For INCIDENT_DATE , creating a new feature like SEASON is a good idea. You can extract this information from the date and then encode it. 2. Handling Outliers Whether to keep or remove outliers depends on the goals of your analysis. If earthquakes are significant events in your context, and you want the model to capture their impact, keep them. However, if they are skewing the results and making it hard to visualize other patterns, you may consider creating separate models with and without these outliers for comparison. 3. Scaling Data Yes, use StandardScaler to scale your data. Include all relevant columns (features) in your model, as they contribute to the clustering process. 4. Dimensionality Reduction with PCA While PCA can be beneficial, it's not always necessary, especially if your dataset isn't too large. You can start without PCA and explore it later if needed. It helps in reducing the number of features while preserving the most important information. 5. Determining the Number of Clusters Silhouette analysis is a good approach. You can also try the elbow method, which involves plotting the explained variance as a function of the number of clusters and selecting the "elbow" point where the improvement slows down. 6. Analyzing Clusters Once you have your clusters, analyze them by examining the mean values of features within each cluster. To visualize geographic patterns, consider plotting the clusters on a map using geospatial visualization tools. This can help you understand if certain regions or provinces are more prone to specific types of natural disasters.
