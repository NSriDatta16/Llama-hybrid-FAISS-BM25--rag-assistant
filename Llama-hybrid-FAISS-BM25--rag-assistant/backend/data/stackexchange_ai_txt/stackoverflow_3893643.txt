There isn't a straightforward way to get the width (in pixels) of text content. You can however get a reasonable estimate by multiplying the number of characters by the average pixel width of each character - this will vary depending on the font, and works best for fixed-width fonts like Courier. This also assumes that all the content is simple text without additional formatting. Most fonts have a character width less than the height, so assuming width = height will definitely work. Example: var fontSize = parseInt($('.my-td-class').css('font-size')); // get default font size function updateFont() { var e = $('#some-element'); while (e.text().length * fontSize > e.width()) { fontSize *= 0.8; // reduce to 80% e.css('font-size', fontSize + 'px'); } } Edit: Based on the other answers, you could apply this technique to the height as well. Just make sure that the width/height comparison reflects the current font size and not any hard-coded value.
