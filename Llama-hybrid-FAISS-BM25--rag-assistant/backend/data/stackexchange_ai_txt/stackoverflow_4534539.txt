Connect 4 with neural network: evaluation of draft + further steps

I would like to build a Connect 4 engine which works using an artificial neural network - just because I'm fascinated by ANNs. I'be created the following draft of the ANN structure. Would it work? And are these connections right (even the cross ones)? Could you help me to draft up an UML class diagram for this ANN? I want to give the board representation to the ANN as its input. And the output should be the move to chose. The learning should later be done using reinforcement learning and the sigmoid function should be applied. The engine will play against human players. And depending on the result of the game, the weights should be adjusted then. What I'm looking for ... ... is mainly coding issues. The more it goes away from abstract thinking to coding - the better it is.
