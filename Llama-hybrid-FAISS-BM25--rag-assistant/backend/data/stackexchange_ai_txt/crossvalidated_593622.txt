The minimum is actually 55% . Here was my first example achieving 60% accuracy, which helps inform the improvement in the next paragraph. Each row is one of the models, and each column is 10% of the data; an x indicates the model being incorrect on that decile. xxAxAAAAAA xBxxBBBBBB CxxxCCCCCC That fourth column of all x s is wasteful, so we're going to have the three models all be correct on a subset of the data of proportion $t$ , and with the remaining $1-t$ they will cycle the rest of their $0.7-t$ correct answers such that only one of them is correct on any point. This means that $3\cdot(0.7-t)=1-t$ , and so $t=0.55$ . This is, to me, clearly the worst possible, because we've "wasted" correct votes maximally. But I don't have an elegant proof, and this should definitely already exist somewhere...
