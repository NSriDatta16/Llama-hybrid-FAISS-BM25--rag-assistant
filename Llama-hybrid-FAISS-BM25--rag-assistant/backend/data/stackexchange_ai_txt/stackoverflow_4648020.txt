I'm not sure what you're after when you ask for the "easiest way". There are at least a couple solutions, both of which are very straight-forward. You can either choose to organize your "page" as a grid, putting each image and button in a column, or you could create an object that represents one row and then create an instance of that row for each group of five. Both solutions are very easy.
