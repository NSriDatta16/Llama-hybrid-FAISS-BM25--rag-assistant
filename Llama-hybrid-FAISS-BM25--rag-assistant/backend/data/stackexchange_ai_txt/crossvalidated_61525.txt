If I had to choose a single text for a beginner, it would be Sivia DS and Skilling J (2006) book (see below). Of all the books listed below it strives hardest to give an intuitive grasp of the essential ideas, but it still requires some mathematical sophistication from page 1. Below is a list of Further Readings from my book, with comments on each publication. Bernardo, JM and Smith, A, (2000) 4 . Bayesian Theory A rigorous account of Bayesian methods, with many real-world examples. Bishop, C (2006) 5 . Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning. As the title suggests, this is mainly about machine learning, but it provides a lucid and comprehensive account of Bayesian methods. Cowan G (1998) 6 . Statistical Data Analysis. An excellent non-Bayesian introduction to statistical analysis. Dienes, Z (2008) 8 . Understanding Psychology as a Science: An Introduction to Scientiﬁc and Statistical Inference. Provides tutorial material on Bayes’ rule and a lucid analysis of the distinction between Bayesian and frequentist statistics. Gelman A, Carlin J, Stern H, and Rubin D. (2003) 14 . Bayesian Data Analysis. A rigorous and comprehensive account of Bayesian analysis, with many real-world examples. Jaynes E and Bretthorst G (2003) 18 . Probability Theory: The Logic of Science. The modern classic of Bayesian analysis. It is comprehensive and wise. Its discursive style makes it long (600 pages) but never dull,and it is packed ful l of insights. Khan, S, 2012, Introduction to Bayes’ Theorem. Salman Khan’s online mathematics videos make a good introduction to various topics, including Bayes’ rule. Lee PM (2004) 27 . Bayesian Statistics: An Introduction. A rigorous and comprehensive text with a strident Bayesian style. MacKay DJC (2003) 28 . Information theory, inference, and learning algorithms. The modern classic on information theory. A very readable text that roams far and wide over many topics, almost all of which make use of Bayes’ rule. Migon, HS and Gamerman, D (1999) 30. Statistical Inference: An Integrated Approach. A straightforward (and clearly laid out) account of inference, which compares Bayesian and non-Bayesian approaches. Despite being fairly advanced, the writing style is tutorial in nature. Pierce JR (1980) 34 2nd Edition. An introduction to information theory: symbols, signals and noise. Pierce writes with an informal, tutorial style of writing, but does not ﬂinch from presenting the fundamental theorems of information theory. Reza, FM (1961) 35 . An introduction to information theory. A more comprehensive and mathematical ly rigorous book than the Pierce book above, and should ideally be read only after ﬁrst reading Pierce’s more informal text. Sivia DS and Skilling J (2006) 38 . Data Analysis: A Bayesian Tutorial. This is an excellent tutorial style introduction to Bayesian methods. Spiegelhalter, D and Rice, K (2009) 36 . Bayesian statistics. Scholarpedia, 4(8):5230. http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Bayesian_statistics A reliable and comprehensive summary of the current status of Bayesian statistics. And, here is my book, published June 2013. Bayes' Rule: A Tutorial Introduction to Bayesian Analysis, Dr James V Stone, ISBN 978-0956372840 Chapter 1 can be downloaded from: http://jim-stone.staff.shef.ac.uk/BookBayes2012/BayesRuleBookMain.html Description: Discovered by an 18th century mathematician and preacher, Bayes' rule is a cornerstone of modern probability theory. In this richly illustrated book, a range of accessible examples are used to show how Bayes' rule is actually a natural consequence of commonsense reasoning. Bayes' rule is derived using intuitive graphical representations of probability, and Bayesian analysis is applied to parameter estimation using the MatLab programs provided. The tutorial style of writing, combined with a comprehensive glossary, makes this an ideal primer for the novice who wishes to become familiar with the basic principles of Bayesian analysis.
