Android - XML Syntax For Strings

In my XML values strings code, I have a string with some text that I want to have only a few of the words in color. I also want to have a new line for some of the text. I can do things like: my bold text and that works (leading space added for this post). I try to tag the text with color but no color shows up and there are no errors. name="dogs" >Red Dog, Sammy I also try adding a new line - I've tried things like: some text, space at beginning only for this post this didn't work either some text, space at beginning only for this post But, no new paragraph / new line, carriage rtn happens. What am I doing wrong? Or, more correctly put, How do I accomplish this? Thanks
