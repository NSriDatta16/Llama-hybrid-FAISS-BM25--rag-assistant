It all depends on your use case: Indexing by ID or Position: If you would like speed when accessing a particular attribute, then index the attributes by their IDs instead of their index position. If you would like to keep an order, then order them by index position and a position offset amount. Independent Table Vs Local Array: If the attributes are duplicated in multiple items, then have them as their own table, and reference the attributes to that table. If the attributes are not refenced and are unique to each item, then using them as serialise-able arrays (for storage) is adequate than needing them to be their own table.
