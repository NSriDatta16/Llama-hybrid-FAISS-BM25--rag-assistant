Redirect IE browsers using .htaccess (away from an xhtml)

as the title says, I want to use an xhtml as my homepage and I want to redirect visitors using Internet Explorer browsers to a different page (a .htm with less content that says "You're using IE, tough tittie."). Since IE automatically downloads app/xhtml files, I can't do this using javascript and whatnot, so I think the only option is to use .htaccess. But after almost 2 hours of googling htaccess examples from similar posts, I still can't get it to work, I get either 403 or 500 both in IE and in chrome/firerfox.. Here's what I tried last: Options +FollowSymLinks RewriteEngine On RewriteBase / RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} "MSIE 5" [OR] RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} "MSIE 6" [OR] RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} "MSIE 7" [OR] RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} "MSIE 8" RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://www.mypage/index.IE.htm Anyway, to to make this clearer, I'd like my .htaccess to do this: if(whoever_accesses_my_page is anyVersionOf_IE) set_index("http://www.mypage/index.IE.htm"); else set_index("http://www.mypage/index.xhtml");
