If you are trying to troubleshoot your own code, you can use the javascript "debugger" command to cause firebug to break on a given line of code. You will have to enable firebug debugging first for that web page. Maybe that's more along the lines of what you were looking for? I don't think you want to trigger Firebug to open on an end user's browser; this would, at best, cause confusion for the average user.
