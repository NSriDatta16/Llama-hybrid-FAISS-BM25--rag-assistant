Note that the features you list are the product of 3 terms, hence they are third order interaction terms. According to the documentation , the default degree computed for the Polynomial transformer is degree=2 . Additionally, if you only wanted those features and not the homogenous terms ( $a^3, b^3, c^3$ ) you could set interaction_only=True .
