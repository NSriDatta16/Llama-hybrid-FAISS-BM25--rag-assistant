I'm pretty ambivalent on OpenID. One the one hand, it addresses the 'identity provider discovery problem' (how the relying party site figures out where to send the user to authenticate). On the other hand, URLs are tremendously clunky to the average user. I see OpenID as it currently stands as being a useful stop on the road to a solution for Web identity, but certainly not the ultimate destination. Specifically addressing your intranet question, OpenID is probably not the right answer. As I mentioned above, OpenID buys you the ability to locate the identity provider, at the cost of typing in that URL at every relying party. If you're going to be authenticating all your users at some internal identity provider, and only accepting users from that identity provider, OpenID really doesn't gain you much. I would look at a system such as CAS or OpenSSO , either of which will redirect users to the login page without any need to enter a URL. I recently blogged about a company that rolled out OpenSSO to 40 intranet applications for 3000 users in just 4 months, with apps on IIS 6.0, Apache, JBoss and Tomcat.
