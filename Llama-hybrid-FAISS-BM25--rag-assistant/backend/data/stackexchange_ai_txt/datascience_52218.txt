The purpose of having a test set or a validation set is to be able to check the performance of your model on data it has not seen before. If you perform feature engineering with the test data present you will get a data leakage. That happens when give your model information about your test data during training. It is especially bad when doing target encoding with the label mean since it will give your model information about the distribution of the labels in the test set. The effect is that you will get an overly optimistic test score that will not reflect the performance on new truly unseen data.
