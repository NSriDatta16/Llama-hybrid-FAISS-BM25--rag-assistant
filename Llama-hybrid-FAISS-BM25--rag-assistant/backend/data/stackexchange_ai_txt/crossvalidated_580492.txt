Multilevel Model Crossed Random Effects

I am analyzing a dataset using a multilevel model approach and have been recommended to look at using crossed random effects due to the structure of data. I've currently been treating my data as 2 levels and nested within each other and having a difficult time understanding if there is going to be a crossed effect. The data is a set of 30 participants who completed three different training scenarios and had multiple measurements taken during each scenario including: Jump height (Pre and post - variable of interest being change), grip strength (pre and post- variable of interest being change), and average heart rate. I'm now wondering if this data is actually three levels with: Level 1 being the participant Level 2 being the event and Level 3 being the measures To my understanding (and some of the previous answers I've read on this site) the crossed effect would come from the same measures (level 3) being involved in multiple events. Therefore my model would look something like model For more context the original question was to see if these measures had significant differences across the three events which was completed by using a repeated measures ANOVA. It was then decided to account for covariate factors (such as the effect of initial jump height on the change in jump height) which led to the multilevel models Any advice, guidance, or further resources would be much appreciated!
