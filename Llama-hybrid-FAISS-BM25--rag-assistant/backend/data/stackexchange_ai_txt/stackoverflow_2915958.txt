This is one hell of an ugly hack, but its the only thing that I could come up with to finally make it work... and after hours of Googling and hacking away trying to get results, this is the only thing I came up with. coverage run manage.py test coverage xml sed 's/filename="/filename="my\/path\//g' coverage.xml > coverage2.xml This is just relpacing the filename attribute of the class xml tags and adding the full path to the source files at the beginning. Just make sure that you update the Cobertura xml report pattern to be coverage2.xml (if that is where you're piping sed's output to). It would be nice if the Cobertura plugin would allow you to enter the source path similar to how the Violations plugin does - unfortunately, as far as I'm aware, it doesn't. I hope this helps!
