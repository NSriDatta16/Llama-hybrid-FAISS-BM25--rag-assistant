Django project hierarchy/organization

I am new to Django and starting a project, and I would like to do it the right way. I would like to know what you think is best practice for organizing a project. Here are some questions I have: How do I separate the static resources from the Python code so that I don't waste time processing the static content through Django? As apps are reusable modules, they are not really tight to a project, so should they be located in the project directory, or in another directory that would contain all my "homemade" apps? Are templates considered to be static or dynamic content? Here is my current file hierarchy: webapps/ myproject/ apache/ bin/ lib/ templates/ app1/ app2/ src/ app1/ app2/ __init.py settings.py urls.py manage.py myproject.wsgi admin/ static/ css/ img/ What do you think? What would be better? Thanks!
