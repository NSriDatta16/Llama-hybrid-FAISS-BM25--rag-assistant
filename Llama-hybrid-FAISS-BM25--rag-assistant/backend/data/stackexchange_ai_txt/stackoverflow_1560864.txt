Trying to Create an Enterprise Provisioning Profile--Distribution Tab is Missing

I'm attempting to create an Enterprise Provisioning Profile, but the program portal isn't working the way I expect it to (based on the documentation). Here's what I'm seeing: First, I log on as the Team Agent. Second, I navigate to the Provisioning section of the program portal. According to the documentation, I should see 4 tabs at this point: Development, Distribution, History, How To. But when I do this, the Distribution tab isn't there. And without the Distribution tab, I can't create a Enterprise Provisioning Profile (or an Ad Hoc one, for that matter). I've tried contacting Apple administrative support, but they weren't able to provide any help with this. They suggested that I try the forum. :-) Just to fill in a few more details: My company has an enterprise membership in the developer program. And when I navigate to the Certificates section, there is a Distribution tab. I figure that there must be something that I've done incorrectly. Has anyone had a similar experience? Any suggestions on what to try next?
