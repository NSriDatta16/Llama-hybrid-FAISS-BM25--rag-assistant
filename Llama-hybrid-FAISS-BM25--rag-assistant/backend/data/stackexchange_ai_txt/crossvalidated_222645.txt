Using lasso regression in Matlab with constraints on lambda values

I have successfully ran a lasso regression on Matlab, however, some of the lambda values result in a non-steady state solutions for my linear problem. I would like to basically force the regression to give me lambda values that would give me stable solutions, and to do that I need the fitted coefficients as organized in 'B' to be all negative. Is there anyway I can apply this sort of constraint within the regression?
