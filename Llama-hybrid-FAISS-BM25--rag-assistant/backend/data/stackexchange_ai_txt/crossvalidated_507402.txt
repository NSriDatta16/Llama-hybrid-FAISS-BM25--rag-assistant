How does $E(u)=\int E(u|v)p(v)dv$?

I'm reading Bayesian Data Analysis: http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/ and this equation was given $$E(u)=\int E(u|v)p(v)dv$$ Can someone explain this to me? I don't see how they're equivalent, because to get the expectation of $u$ you need to get the average of $u$ , but the RHS is the integral across all $v$ , but then there could be values of $u$ not conditioned on $v$ so that means those values will be excluded will they not? Which means it's not the expectation for $u$ because it's not the weighted sum across all $u$ .
