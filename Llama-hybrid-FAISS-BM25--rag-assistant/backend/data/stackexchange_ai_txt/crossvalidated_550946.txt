Linear SVM weights interpretation in binary classification: which sign relates to which class?

I'm trying to interpret the weights of a linear svm which I use to classify elements in my dataset of patients into two classes: alzheimer and non-alzheimer . From this post I understand that the value of each weight can be interpreted as: "how much a feature contributes in the classification". I'm interest in understanding how to correlate the sign of the weights to the classification label: in what way do I infer that positive weights are associated to the alzheimer label and negative weights to the non-alzheimer label, and not vice-versa? I also read this post but it seems to me his reasoning is based on having two numerical labels, one positive and one negative...
