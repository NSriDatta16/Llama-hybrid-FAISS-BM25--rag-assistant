Assumably, a field called "to" contains the email address of the organization being contacted. Since this doesn't vary by customer, it shouldn't be part of the form; it should be part of the form's target script. Even if the "to" email is somewhat variable (say a limited list of webmaster, technical service, sales, complaints dept, etc.), the form should not contain the target email. It should contain a dropdown send-to list where the option values are integers that are used by the script to determine which email address is appropriate. Aside from security concerns, an option list like the one described is easily generated from an array. So changes to your email list are easy to make. Keeping the email address off the contact form helps prevent misappropriation of your form for spamming. And it also keeps your email address(es) private from webscrapers.
