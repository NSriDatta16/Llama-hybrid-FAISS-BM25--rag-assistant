Microsoft is doing allot of interesting work internally with virtualization and shipping several major virtualization products soon. HyperV and XP being virtualized in Windows 7 most notably. It would be shocked if we didn't see this functionality in the new VS. If you are interested in desktop virtualization for development testing check out Virtual Box from Sun it is amazing and unlike the other high quality virtualization environments free and GPL . I use a portable version of VirtualBox to drag my virtual desktops back and forth to work each day on a external SATA drive. link text
