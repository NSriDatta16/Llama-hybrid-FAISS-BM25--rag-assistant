There are plenty of great answers already, so I'll add a slightly tangential example that I found intriguing. Hopefully its not too far-off from the topic. Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are often used for Bayesian posterior inference. In typical encounters of Markov chains in probability theory, we ask questions like whether a chain converges to some stationary distribution in the limit of infinite steps. In Bayesian statistics for example, the inverse question is asked: if we want a chain to converge the posterior distribution of interest, how do we design such a chain? (The standard Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm is one such algorithm.) This example doesn't directly answering the question, but serves as a fun example of an application of solutions to inverse probability question. I found this insight from https://www.jstor.org/stable/2684568 which motivates the MH algorithm from the inverse perspective.
