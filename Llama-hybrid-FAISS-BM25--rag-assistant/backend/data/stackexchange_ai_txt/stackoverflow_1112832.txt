Create onDragEnter custom event

I was experimenting with the onDragEnter event and realized it only works in IE. How can I recreate this event using jQuery, so that I can get information about what is being dragged, etc.? For example, I'm trying to drag some random text over a box that can recognize what the text is, etc. I also need to be able to drag some random image and have the same box recognize what the image is, etc. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Regards, David
