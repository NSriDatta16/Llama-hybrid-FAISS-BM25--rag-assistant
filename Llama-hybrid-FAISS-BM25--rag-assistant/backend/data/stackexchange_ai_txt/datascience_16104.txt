Dealing with NA values while using Rotation Forest in R

I am using Rotation Forest in r. I have a very big list (which I can't give a sample) that has 50 attributes and 4000 rows. for every row there is a few missing values in the attributes, it supposed to be like that and I cant fill the missing values. this is my code: y this is the error: Error in cov.wt(z) : 'x' must contain finite values only from what I gathered the problem is with NA in relevance to PCA in the rotation forest. any suggestion on what I can do?
