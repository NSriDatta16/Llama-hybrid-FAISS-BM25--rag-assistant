I would rather have one install put one and exactly one piece of software on my machine. When we deploy to our customers, we want to be able to control the installation of dependencies ourselves. EDIT: Note that I am speaking of an enterprise environment where we centrally manage software deployment to our customers. I also feel this way for myself, but I would class myself as a power user and I can see the counter argument for average Joe user.
