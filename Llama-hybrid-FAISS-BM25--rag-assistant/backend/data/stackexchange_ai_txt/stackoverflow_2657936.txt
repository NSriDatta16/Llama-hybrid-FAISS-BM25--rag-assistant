Prariedogg, Absolutely externalize the settings into something like a plist. You can even have multiple plists that align to the particular situation (e.g. settingsMac.plist, settingsIPhone.plist). When your app determines what environment it is running in, it loads the appropriate settings via a delegate or a central singleton. By externalizing it you will reduce the average maintenance cost of the application. There is less cost to managing and deploying plist updates than recompile/retest/repackage/redeploy. -- Frank
