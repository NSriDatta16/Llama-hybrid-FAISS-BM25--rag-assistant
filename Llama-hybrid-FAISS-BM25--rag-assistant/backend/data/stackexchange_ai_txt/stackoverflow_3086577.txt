HUGE framerate difference between release/debug builds

I'm working on a DirectX game and I'm finding that during release builds I'm getting 170fps average, however in debug builds I'm getting ~20fps. I was wondering if this massive difference is normal between release and debug builds especially since in debug I don't have any traces being out put? I know there should be a performance gap between debug and release builds, just not this huge surely?
