Intuitive understanding covariance, cross-covariance, auto-/cross-correlation and power spectrum density

I'm currently studying for my finals in basic statistics for my ECE bachelor. While I think I have the math mostly down, I lack intuitive understanding what the numbers actually mean.(Preamble: I'll use rather sloppy language). I know the E[X] is the "weighted average" of all results of X weighted by their probability. Var[X] gives gives the expected variance from that E[X] squared, so tells us something about the "blurriness" of the distribution. The other properties I know the formulae, but lack any kind of intuition. Anyone have good explanations/resources to help with that?
