If you can work with 3.2 or later, the UIGestureRecognizer suite should allow this. There are a series of calls allowing some gestures to cancel or interoperate with other gestures, and you should be able to create a custom diagonal swipe gesture that cancels other gestures but does not actually do anything itself. Prior to 3.2 the UIScrollView gesture handling is essentially undocumented. You can detect taps but not movements through the standard touchesBegan UIResponder calls. I think that once it detects movement it commandeers the run loop and captures all events, bypassing the normal event chain. Note that setContentOffset is always called. You can create a subclass of UIScrollView and when you detect a diagonal shift during event tracking do not pass it to super. I do not know if, or how well this would work but it is somewhere to start.
