It's all done with good ol' image bugs. Breaking down how they find out... Which client was used : Check the user-agent Whether an email was forwarded : Done by attaching image bugs to divs that are loaded only when the message is forwarded. Whether an email was printed : bug attached to print stylesheet How long it takes to read an email : A connection that's kept open, as pointed out by Forrest (this is also how Facebook tracks(ed?) whether or not you are online on chat). Whether an email was deleted : Check If a message was read for a short period of time or not opened. In fact, they group "glanced" and "deleted" together. Of course none of this will work if email clients disable images in emails. EDIT : Here's another question on this: The OP actually has their tracking code, and this answer here explains how it works.
