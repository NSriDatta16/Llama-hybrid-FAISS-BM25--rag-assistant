No, there is no value to do so. If you train a logistic regression (for example), for each feature a weight will be associated. If at test time, you do not have one feature anymore, what will you do ? You will put a "fake" feature equal to zero instead ? But the problem is that you taught your model to predict with this feature : this feature has a "signification" for the model. So the performance will be poorer.
