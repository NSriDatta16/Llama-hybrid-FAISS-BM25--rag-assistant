Logistic regression already has some slack but if you want even more slack you can use a softer link function. For example, replace the logistic function $\sigma(x)$ with $\sigma(\lambda \tanh(x/\lambda))$ where $\lambda$ controls the amount of slack. Alternatively, you can have an explicit noise model on the labels, i.e. each label gets flipped with probability $p$.
