Why do PCA loadings given by sqrt(eigenvalue)*eigenvector yield correlations between PCs and original variables?

I did a lot of reading in this blog and elsewhere about PCA, SVD, loadings etc. But I still don't understand why loadings, which represent correlations between principal components and the original variables, are mathematically defined by loadings = eigenvector * square root (eigenvalue) It seems I just can't grasp it. Could somebody please explain me the mathematics behind it?
