How can I classify time-series given a predictor for each of them?

Say that I have two time-series and a predictor for each of them. I would like to build a classifer that given a window of future (and unseen) samples returns which series is more likely to have produced them. One vanilla approach could be to check which predictor provides the best prediction by applying both of them to each series and assessing how close the results are to the new samples. However, things get more complicated when the scores of the predictors are comparable. In case the predictors are obtained by means of neural networks, is there a way to convert the two prediction models to a single classifier? Can we say anything about the confidence of this kind of classification?
