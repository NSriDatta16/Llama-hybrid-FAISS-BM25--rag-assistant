Question regarding equation in the multinominal distrubution of the exponential family

So this question is regarding to some notes i read in the book Machine learning and pattern recognition in chapter 2 in the section exponential family. First they state: So then they derive this which i understand. The part marked with the arrows is what dont understand. It dont think it is clear from the equation that $\sum_{k=1}^{M} x{_k}=1 $ which must be true for the first equation. The second equation (2.211) i dont understand at all.
