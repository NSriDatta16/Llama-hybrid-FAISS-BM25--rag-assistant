Welcome to Data Science! The first step is to make clear for yourself and future models the output you are looking for. It appears it's clear in your mind which tests to priorities but it's not in the data as a column. You rightly point out that you could generate a rank or some priority metric. Once you have that, then you can consider using an ML model. So step 1 is generate your desired output that is meaningful for the task. As a first step, I would consider creating a priority column for each test with three categories representing High, Medium and Low. You have to then decide how to generate these categories from your test data. An algorithm would be best but in that case you wouldn't need a model. Alternatively, use your judgement or realistically a combination of both. Once you have your input data (features) and your assigned output (in this case 3 classes) you can follow the usual ML approach. You can then extend this with additional discrete labels or alternatively switch to a numeric score and use regression type models if you need additional fidelity.
