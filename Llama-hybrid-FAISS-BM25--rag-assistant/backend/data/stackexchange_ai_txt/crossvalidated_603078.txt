The reason for the lack of the $f_X(x)$ in the formula, is because that term would appear only when integrating over all possible values of X. This is not the case here. We are integrating over samples of X in the given interval $[T_1,T_2]$ . We have that $Var[X]=E[(X-\mu)^2]=E[X^2]$ To estimate the variance of the signal $x(t)$ over the interval $[T_1,T_2]$ we must calculate the average of $x^2(t)$ in that interval: $\displaystyle {1 \over {T_2-T_1}}\int_{T_1}^{T_2}x(t)^2 dt$ Then apply the square root to get the standard deviation.
