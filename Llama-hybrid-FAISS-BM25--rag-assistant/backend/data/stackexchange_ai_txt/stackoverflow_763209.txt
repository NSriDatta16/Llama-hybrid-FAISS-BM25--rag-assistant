In both winForms and WPF dragging and dropping can be done in a similar way by working with the events on the target DragOver and Drop. However with WPF you have other options. You will also be able to make the application look better by having a thumbnail as you drag (this is possible in winforms but harder to achieve). Have a look at this WPF sample it uses a helper class and think it does exactly what you need.
