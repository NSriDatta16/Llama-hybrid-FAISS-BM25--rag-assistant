jQuery UI Dragging - which handler is being used?

I got the following setup for dragdrop functionality: const listDragOptions = { handle: ".camera, .texter", // dragged by either camera or edit icon //revert: true, // so dragged elements fall back to their original position, revertDuration: 200, // the element goes back instantly, no need for effects on this one snap: true, // snap to table cell edges helper: "clone", // create a cloned element instead of moving the original one drag: function(event, ui) { // tell me which handle is being used! } } Basically I need to know which of the two handles ".camera, .texter" the user has clicked to achieve ddragging functionality. This seems tricky. I can't find anything in the API, so I'm really willing to accept any dirty hack. Thanks for all answers!
