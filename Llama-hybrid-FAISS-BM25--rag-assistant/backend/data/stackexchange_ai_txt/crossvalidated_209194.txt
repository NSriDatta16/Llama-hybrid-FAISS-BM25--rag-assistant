The standardized alpha coefficient is more intuitive so let's start there: $$\alpha_{standardized}=\frac{K\bar{r}}{1+(K-1)\bar{r}}$$ where $K$ is the number of items and $\bar{r}$ is the mean of the non-redundant correlations between items. The non-standardized alpha coefficient just needs a few changes to the denominator. $$\alpha=\frac{K\bar{c}}{\bar{v}+(K-1)\bar{c}}$$ where $K$ is the number of items, $\bar{v}$ is the average variance of each item, and $\bar{c}$ is the mean of the non-redundant covariances between items. Here is some sample data in subject-by-item format (with four items A, B, C, and D): A B C D ------------- 5 5 5 5 3 1 3 1 5 5 5 5 3 1 3 1 5 5 4 5 1 2 3 3 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 3 3 3 4 4 1 3 1 1 5 5 5 5 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 3 3 4 3 1 3 3 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 3 3 3 3 2 3 3 5 3 5 5 3 3 3 4 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 3 3 3 3 3 1 3 3 1 1 3 3 1 1 3 3 2 5 To calculate the standardized alpha, we need the inter-item correlations ($r$): $r_{AB}=.776$ $r_{AC}=.756$ $r_{AD}=.630$ $r_{BC}=.730$ $r_{BD}=.750$ $r_{CD}=.810$ Which makes for a mean inter-item correlation of $\bar{r}=.742$. $$\alpha_{standardized}=\frac{4(.742)}{1+(4-1).742}=.920$$ To calculate alpha, we need the variances ($v$) and covariances ($c$): $v_A=2.433$ $v_B=2.101$ $v_C=2.384$ $v_D=2.933$ $c_{AB}=1.754$ $c_{AC}=1.820$ $c_{AD}=1.683$ $c_{BC}=1.633$ $c_{BD}=1.861$ $c_{CD}=2.142$ which makes for a mean variance of $\bar{v}=2.463$ and mean covariance of $\bar{c}=1.816$. $$\alpha=\frac{4(1.816)}{2.463+(4-1)1.816}=.918$$ Now let's compare these results to your idea of the average item-sum correlation. $$S=A+B+C+D$$ $r_{AS}=.877$ $r_{BS}=.901$ $r_{CS}=.919$ $r_{DS}=.895$ which makes for a mean item-sum correlation of $\bar{r}_{XS}=.898$. So your result is similar to but lower than the alpha coefficient(s). Perhaps someone else who is better at algebra than I am can put together an equation for calculating one from the other.
