Validity of negative binomial model: algorithm did not converge and alternation limit reached

I have strongly skewed, zero-inflated count time-series. I want to regress the counts against a continuous variable. Here's what they look like when plotted against each other year by year. (X lags behind Y by one year.) The blue print is the average followed by variance. Since variance is much higher than mean, I have selected to model them as a Negative Binomial rather than a Poisson. I am ignoring the time dimension for now. Here is what the estimation looks like: library(MASS) summary(glm.nb(hq_ct~ihh_emp, temp)) Call: glm.nb(formula = hq_ct ~ ihh_emp, data = temp, init.theta = 0.2482159799, link = log) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.7784 -1.2604 -0.7383 -0.2973 7.2707 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -0.469081 0.096494 -4.861 1.17e-06 *** ihh_emp 0.043719 0.001353 32.311 I get two warnings. I ran the same model again, this time including a size variable which should explain many of the zero values. (There are two reasons for zero values: 1) Voluntary reporting, which means that more counts are reported as time goes by and that fewer were reported in the past; 2) Individual size, where smaller individuals tend to have zero counts.) summary(glm.nb(hq_ct~ihh_emp+emp_app, temp)) Call: glm.nb(formula = hq_ct ~ ihh_emp + emp_app, data = temp, init.theta = 0.4944747188, link = log) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -4.3025 -1.3073 -0.4733 0.0794 5.0559 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 2.873e-01 7.484e-02 3.838 0.000124 *** ihh_emp 7.555e-03 1.095e-03 6.901 5.15e-12 *** emp_app 3.083e-06 3.252e-08 94.780 I get the same two warnings again. How should I deal with them? Apart from those, does the model look good? (Note: this is only a first stage in my analysis and I plan to include panel analysis and more control variables). Here's my data . EDIT: I just found out that the number of iterations can be tweaked so I did, which dismissed the warnings (see below). However, the question remains as to the interpretation of the estimation: does it look good? Should I graduate to a zero-inflated model? summary(glm.nb(hq_ct~ihh_emp, temp, control=glm.control(maxit=50))) Call: glm.nb(formula = hq_ct ~ ihh_emp, data = temp, control = glm.control(maxit = 50), init.theta = 0.2482159657, link = log) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.7784 -1.2604 -0.7383 -0.2973 7.2707 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -0.469089 0.096494 -4.861 1.17e-06 *** ihh_emp 0.043720 0.001353 32.311
