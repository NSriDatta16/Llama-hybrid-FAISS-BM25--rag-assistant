using jQuery in object-oriented way

Is it possible to achieve the following, using jQuery: I'd like to create two different objects that have different functions with the same name. var item = new foo(); item.doSomething(); var item2 = new bar(); item2.doSomething(); Furthermore, I'd like to be able to use the created items as "regular" jQuery objects - for example, to drag&drop the items and execute the correct doSomething() function when dragging has stopped.
