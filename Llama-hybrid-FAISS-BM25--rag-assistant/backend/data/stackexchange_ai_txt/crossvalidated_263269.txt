Datetime components as grouping variables in multi-level model

Does it make sense to use datetime components (e.g. year, month, day) as grouping variables in a multi-level model? For example, I have some data that consists of repeated measures within group: group | date | measurement ------|------------|------------ 1 | 2015-05-01 | 0.5741408 1 | 2015-05-02 | 0.5486846 1 | 2015-05-03 | 0.3509362 : | : | : 483 | 2016-12-24 | 0.8088201 I was initially converting the date column so that it was simply the number of days greater than the minimum. mod = lmer(measurement ~ days + (1 | group), data=DF) However I don't necessarily expect a linear time effect and am wondering if I can convert the date column into year, month, and day columns. mod2 = lmer(measurement ~ (1 | group) + (1 | year) + (1 | month) + (1 | day), data=DF) I get a bit confused thinking about the nesting structure of this and am not sure if it is a correct way to model the data. The date column inherently contains a lot of contextual information and I want to be able to leverage that in my model. Does it create any problems to use the date time components as grouping variables?
