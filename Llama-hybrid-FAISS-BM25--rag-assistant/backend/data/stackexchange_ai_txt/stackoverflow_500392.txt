Your is_numeric is ill-defined. See my comments to your question. Other numerical types could be: long , complex , fractions.Fraction , numpy.bool_ , numpy.ubyte , ... operator.isNumberType() returns True for Python numbers and numpy.array . Since Python 2.6 you can use isinstance(d, numbers.Number) instead of deprecated operator.isNumberType() . Generally it is better to check the capabilities of the object (e.g., whether you can add an integer to it) and not its type.
