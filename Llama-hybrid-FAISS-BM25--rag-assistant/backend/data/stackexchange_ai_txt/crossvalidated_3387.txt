The UCLA website has a bunch of great tutorials for every procedure broken down by the software type that you're familiar with. Check out Annotated SPSS Output: Logistic Regression -- the SES variable they mention is categorical (and not binary). SPSS will automatically create the indicator variables for you. There's also a page dedicated to Categorical Predictors in Regression with SPSS which has specific information on how to change the default codings and a page specific to Logistic Regression .
