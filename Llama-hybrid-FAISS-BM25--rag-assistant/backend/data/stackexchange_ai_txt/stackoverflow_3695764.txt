I managed to find out the correct term for this authentication type: "Captive portal". Punching in Captive Portal iPhone into Google turned out a few technical details from these pages: one , two , three . To implement a Wi-Fi popup login page: DNS request for www.apple.com must not fail HTTP request for http://www.apple.com/library/test/success.html with special user agent CaptiveNetworkSupport/1.0 wispr must not return Success . I have not tested this, but it sounds about right. Comments below mention that iOS 7 behaves differently and may query more than one server. I have not tested this. So easiest would be to simply redirect all HTTP communication to your login page, and block all non-HTTP communication. Microsoft 's captive portal detection uses something similar to pre-iOS7 behavior: its Network Connectivity Status Indicator attempts to contact http://www.msftncsi.com . Windows 8 and 8.1 also include support for WISPr . Android 's captive portal detection, as of AOSP 4.0.1, tries to contact http://clients3.google.com/generate_204 or http://www.google.com/blank.html . So to be as universal as possible, you'll want to simply block all communication except for authentication, and include WISPr support on the login page. I'd say "go with a proper authentication on your network" -- something universal such as PEAP+MSCHAPv2 -- but Windows makes it very painful for your users to set it up. I don't know who thought that "Use your Windows authentication details" makes a sane default on machines that are not part of a corporate domain network, or even why "Check certificate validity" is a sane default, as most networks will not consider getting a proper certificate a priority.
