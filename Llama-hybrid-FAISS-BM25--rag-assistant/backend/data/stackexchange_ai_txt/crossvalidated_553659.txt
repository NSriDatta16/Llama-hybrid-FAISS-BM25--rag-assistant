Interpreting p-value from GLMMTMB model

I'm analyzing count data from an experiment, where I want to study whether colonies of ants with different ratios (0, 50 100) of infected workers have different foraging activities. I am using the forager count as the response variable and the infection ratio as a factor. Because the colonies are sub-colonies from original nests, I've added original colony as a random factor as well as adding a random factor of observation time within the sub-colony ID to account for pseudoreplication. I've built a model using GLMMTMB fc.a4 Which gives me the output: > summary(fc.a4) Family: nbinom1 ( log ) Formula: Foragers ~ PerInfected + (1 | Colony) + (1 | Box/Time) Data: df.choice AIC BIC logLik deviance df.resid 727.0 761.6 -356.5 713.0 1024 Random effects: Conditional model: Groups Name Variance Std.Dev. Colony (Intercept) 4.092e-09 6.397e-05 Time:Box (Intercept) 3.556e-07 5.963e-04 Box (Intercept) 7.227e-01 8.501e-01 Number of obs: 1031, groups: Colony, 19; Time:Box, 180; Box, 45 Dispersion parameter for nbinom1 family (): 0.17 Conditional model: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -3.1154 0.3426 -9.093 I'm a relative beginner with statistics with R, but how I interpret this according to this article ( https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2017/RJ-2017-066/RJ-2017-066.pdf ) the output shows that the p value according to the Wald Z statistic would show, that the difference between 0 percent infected and 100 percent infected would be significant (0.027). But should I instead use emmeans to make a pairwise comparison with a tukey's p value adjustment to get the p-value, since according to some sources the Wald Z statistic isn't always a good way to get significances between factors? Any input would be highly appreciated (also whether the code to my model is correct), as I would like to understand this in more detail, especially because I don't have a statistical background and I wouldn't want to erroneously interpret results.
