This strikes me as an overly convoluted way to test whether your logic is correct. I would construct a couple of unit tests in the following manner. Add an object to the web. In the test keep a reference to the object Call the logic that unhooks the reference from the web. Iterate over (or traverse) your web and use the ObjectReferenceEquals to see if the reference you're looking for is still hanging around.Since you have numerous possible connections, this may not be the swiftest of operations. However in a relatively small test it should be fine. There is nothing in your scenario that leads me to believe you need to leverage garbage collection to test your data structure. Also, I believe your data structure is correctly termed a graph. Good luck
