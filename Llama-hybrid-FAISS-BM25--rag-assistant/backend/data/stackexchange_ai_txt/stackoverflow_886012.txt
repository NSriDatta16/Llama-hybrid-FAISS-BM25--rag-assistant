It's entirely doable with Core Animation, but you're going to get into a user interaction issue. On the Mac, there's a distinction between mouse drag and a click. But on the iPhone we only have the finger and we're used to direct interaction, meaning we tap up and down and it's selected. In this other mode, you're saying tap-drag-lift (to enlarge icon) may do something different than tap-lift (select). Also, when you drag your finger across the icon strip, the current (enlarged) icon is always the one directly under your finger and not visible, so you'll have to adjust for that. Even though it's doable, you may want to think through the user experience. Even though it sounds sort of cool, my guess is that it'll take a lot of tweaking to get it to look and feel just right in a mouseless direct-interaction environment. I'd be surprised if Apple didn't already try it out and decide against it.
