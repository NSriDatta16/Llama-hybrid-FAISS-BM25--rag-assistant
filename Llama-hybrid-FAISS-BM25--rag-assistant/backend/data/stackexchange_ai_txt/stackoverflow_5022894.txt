phpunit - wrong path

Does anybody know what I'm doing wrong? I've installed phpunit, and everything is fine when I'm in the /opt/local/PEAR directory, so if I go to /opt/local/PEAR directory and run phpunit I get: PHPUnit 3.5.11 by Sebastian Bergmann. Usage: phpunit [switches] UnitTest [UnitTest.php] phpunit [switches] blablabla but if I am on some other path I get: Warning: require_once(PHP/CodeCoverage/Filter.php): failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /usr/local/bin/phpunit on line 38 Fatal error: require_once(): Failed opening required 'PHP/CodeCoverage/Filter.php' (include_path='.:/usr/lib/php') in /usr/local/bin/phpunit on line 38 I know that is something wrong with my PATH. How can I fix it?
