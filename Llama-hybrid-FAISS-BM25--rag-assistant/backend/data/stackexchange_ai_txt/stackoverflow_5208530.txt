sending massive amounts of TCP data

So im working with C#, and i have to send lots and lots of data every time a client makes an initial connection.. I would prefer to have some way to track the progress of the message, and one way i thought to do that would be to split my large amount of data into 500 or more smaller portions, and send them individually. Would that be an acceptable practice? or is it better to send one gigantic message.
