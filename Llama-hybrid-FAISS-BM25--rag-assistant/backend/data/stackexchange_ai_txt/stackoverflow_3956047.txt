I just dealt with the same issue. The way I went about doing this is the following: Get the original string Get both the first and last 10 characters of the original string Get both the first and last 10 characters of the fragment returned by the Solr search Compare both, and fill in a variable when needed! $f_ellip = NULL; $l_ellip = NULL; if ($orig_body_beggining != substr((string)$hl_content->str, 0, 10)) { $f_ellip = "&#8230; "; } if ($orig_body_end != substr((string)$hl_content->str, 0, -10)) { $l_ellip = " &#8230;"; } $entry_body = $f_ellip.(string)$hl_content->str.$l_ellip;
