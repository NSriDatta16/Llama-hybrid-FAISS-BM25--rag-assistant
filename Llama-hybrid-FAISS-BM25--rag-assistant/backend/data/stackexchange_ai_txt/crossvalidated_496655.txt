The number of neurons and layers ultimately depends on the task that needs to be solved by the NN, which you haven't told us anything about. Assuming that you're doing binary classification an accuracy of 50% is of course no better than random guessing. It appears that there's a problem "outside" the Neural Network. This could be that there is no predictive relation between the input features and the class. It could also be the problem that your data is not normalized. If your MLP uses an activation function that expects the input to be within a certain range, than it's important that your features are normalized to that range.
