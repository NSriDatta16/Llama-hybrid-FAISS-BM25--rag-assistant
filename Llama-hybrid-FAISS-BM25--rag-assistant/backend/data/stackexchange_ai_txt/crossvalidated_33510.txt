Many of these comments assume that "frequentist" means "maximum likelihood estimation." Some people have a different definition: "frequentist" means a type of analysis of the long-term inferential properties of any inference method -- whether it's Bayesian, or method-of-moments, or maximum likelihood, or something couched in non-probabilistic terms (e.g SVM's), etc.
