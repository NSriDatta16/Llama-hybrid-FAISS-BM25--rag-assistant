By default, $_SESSION data is stored on disk in the /tmp directory of your server. As long as you have enough room in there AND you aren't hitting your PHP memory limit, you're fine. However, if you're attempting to cache a query that is the SAME for a larger number of users, you might want to use something like APC or memcache that isn't tied to the individual user. Otherwise, your essentially going to cache the same result 1x for each user, and not leveraging a cache across all users.
