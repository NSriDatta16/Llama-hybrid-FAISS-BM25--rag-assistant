Proper organization of public/protected/private functions in classes

Resharper (paired with StyleCop) has made me a bit of a neat freak when it comes to obeying most of its rules. One of the rulesets (I believe from StyleCop) enforces putting public functions first, then protected static, then protected, then private static, and finally private. The private functions are typically the ones backing up the functionality of the public functions as helpers. Let's say I have the StyleCop-enforced order of functions below: public FunctionA public FunctionB private FunctionAHelper1 private FunctionAHelper2 private FunctionBHelper1 private FunctionBHelper2 ...though that's not so bad, I find myself wanting to keep the supporting private methods close to the function that's calling them, so it looks more like this: public FunctionA private FunctionAHelper1 private FunctionAHelper2 public FunctionB private FunctionBHelper1 private FunctionBHelper2 What have you learned that guided the organization of methods in a class? What is StyleCop's reasoning for wanting the public/protected/private ordering? Does it really come down to a matter of preference, or are there benefits I'm not seeing?
