CDF and logistic regression

Is the probability calculated by a logistic regression model (the one that is logit transformed) the fit of cumulative distribution function of successes of original data (ordered by the X variable)? EDIT: In other words - how to plot the probability distribution of the original data that you get when you fit a logistic regression model? The motivation for the question was Jeff Leak's example of regression on the Raven's score in a game and whether they won or not (from Coursera's Data Analysis course). Admittedly, the problem is artificial (see @FrankHarrell's comment below). Here is his data with a mix of his and my code: download.file("http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7710864/data/ravensData.rda", destfile="ravensData.rda", method="internal") load("ravensData.rda") plot(ravenWinNum~ravenScore, data=ravensData) It doesn't seem like good material for logistic regression, but let's try anyway: logRegRavens If I understand logistic regression correctly, R does a pretty bad job at finding the right coefficients in this case. blue = original data to be fitted, I believe (CDF) red = prediction from the model (fitted data = projection of original data onto regression curve) SOLVED - lowess seems to be a good non-parametric estimator of the original data = what is being fitted (thanks @gung). Seeing it allows us to choose the right model, which in this case would be adding squared term to the previous model (@gung) - Of course, the problem is pretty artificial and modelling it rather pointless in general (@FrankHarrell) - in regular logistic regression it's not CDF, but point probabilities - first pointed out by @FrankHarrell; also my embarrassing inability to calculate CDF pointed out by @gung.
