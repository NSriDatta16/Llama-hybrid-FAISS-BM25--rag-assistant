There are two things in mind here. One is "annealing". This concept is not used to sample from a distribution, but to find miniums of functions, see stimulated annealing . When you fix the $\beta$, then you are using Metropolis-Hastings algorithm , used to draw samples from a distribution. As you correctly mention, the distribution changed. And the reason is that you are... using another distribution... Let's recap: you want to draw samples from $P(x)$. To that, you employed a MCMC with an acceptance $$A(x\rightarrow x') = \min\left(1, \frac{P(x')}{P(x)}\frac{g(x'\rightarrow x)}{g(x\rightarrow x')}\right)$$ where $g(x\rightarrow x')$ the conditional of proposing $x'$ given you were at $x$. If you use $P(x)=K(x)$, you sample from your posterior, if you use $P(x)=e^{-\beta E}$, you will sample from other distribution.
