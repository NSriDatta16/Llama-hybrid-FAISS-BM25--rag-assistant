What classification method to use

I have two sets of data from two experiments. All data can be divided in three classes, e.g.: $$\begin{array}{cccc}\rm{Parameter}1&\rm{Parameter}2 ...&\rm{Parameter}N&\rm{Class}\\\hline a_1&b_1&c_1&A\\a_2&b_2&c_2&B\\a_3&b_3&c_3&C\\...\end{array}$$ The values of the parameters define a class. I want to develop criteria based on one data set (with preassigned classes) so that I could assign classes to the second data set. As all the parameters have a certain meaning, I would not like to have a 'black box' method like neural networks, but I would like to have something like, "If Parameter1 is less than X and Parameter2 is within the interval [Y,Z] then it is class A." What is the best way to do it? Is there an implementation of such a way in Python?
