Yes, you are overfitting to the test set. There is a recent paper discussing this topic. Ideally, you'd find a way of regularizing the training so its outcome is less variable. Or you could train lots of models and average their predictions. If you can't find a way of getting around the problem, it is not really appropriate to report the best performing result without mentioning all the other runs, instead on ought to report the distribution of results (e.g. mean and standard deviation of performance metric).
