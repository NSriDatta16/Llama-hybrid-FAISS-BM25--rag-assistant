All those answers about error control are incorrect. The @ doesn't mean anything . That's how the property is called internally, but do not rely on this . Do not rely on print_r() or var_dump() when dealing with SimpleXML. SimpleXML does a lot of "magical" things that are not correctly represented by print_r() and var_dump() . If you need to know what's "inside" a XML fragment, just use ->asXML() on it.
