Are you locked into using an enum by something that you have no control over? If you're not, I'd suggest using an alternative, probably Dictionary rat; If you create a Dictionary and you populate it with your data, enumerating over it is somewhat simpler. Also, it's a clearer mapping of intent-- you're mapping numbers to strings with this enum and you're trying to leverage that mapping. If you must use the enum, I'd suggest something else: var rats = new List () {eRat.A, eRat.B, eRat.C, eRat.D}; As long as you're adding the values in-order and you keep it in sync, you greatly simplify the act of retrieving the next eRat.
