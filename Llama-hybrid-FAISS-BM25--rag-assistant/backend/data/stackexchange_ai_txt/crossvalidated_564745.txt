One simple idea could be to form all the differences $d_t = x_{t+1}-x_t$ and then use some robust estimator of the mean. Some trimmed mean would avoid the spikes, the level of trimming should depend on how frequent are the spikes. Others, with more time-series experience than me, could have better ideas ... this arXiv paper could be interesting: RobustTrend: A Huber Loss with a Combined First and Second Order Difference Regularization for Time Series Trend Filtering
