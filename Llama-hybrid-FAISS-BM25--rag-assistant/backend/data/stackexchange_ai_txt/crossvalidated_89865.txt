Your question raises so many issues that it is difficult to know where to start. First of all you need to make sure that the accuracy score you wish to optimize is a proper scoring rule, i.e., that it is not optimized by a bogus model using the wrong features. Second, it is rare in nature to have discontinuities in predictors other than time. Third, when there are no true discontinuities in predictors, any algorithm that attempts to find such cutpoints will yield answers that other analytical methods or other datasets will surely disagree with. The literature on the horrendous problems of dichotomizing continuous variables is now rather mature. One overview may be found at http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/CatContinuous . There are many methods for keeping continuous variable continuous, e.g., regression splines, random forests.
