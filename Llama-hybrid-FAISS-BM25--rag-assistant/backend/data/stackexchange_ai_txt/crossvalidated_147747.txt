How to calculate the absolute central moment of a Binomial distribution?

There is an experiment. The coin is tossed $n$ times with $p = 0.5$. The experiment is repeated $k$ times. I need to calculate the average central moment. For example, let $n = 5$ and $k = 3$. $[0, 0, 1, 1, 0], sum = 2, abs(0.5 * n - sum) = 0.5;$ $[1, 1, 1, 0, 0], sum = 3, abs(0.5 * n - sum) = 0.5;$ $[0, 0, 0, 1, 0], sum = 1, abs(0.5 * n - sum) = 1.5;$ averageCentralMoment $= (0.5 + 0.5 + 1.5) / 3 = 0.83$ However, if you repeat the whole experiment many times, the central moment is equal: averageCentralMoment = $0.94$ How can I calculate the limit for Average Central Moment without simulation?
