Check out System.Collections.ObjectModel.KeyedCollection - it might not suit your requirements but it seems like a good fit, as it provides an internal lookup dictionary that enables O(1) retrieval of items by index and approaching O(1) by key. The caveat is that it is intended to store objects where the key is defined as a property on the object, so unless you can mash your input data to fit, it won't be appropriate. I would include some more information on what data you are intending to store and the volume, as this might help provide alternatives.
