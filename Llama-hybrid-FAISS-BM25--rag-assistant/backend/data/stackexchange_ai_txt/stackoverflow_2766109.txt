A reference is an entity that is an alias for another object . A reference is not a variable as a variable is only introduced by the declaration of an object . An object is a region of storage and, in C++, references do not (necessarily) take up any storage. As objects and references are distinct groups of entities in C++ so the term "reference variable" isn't meaningful.
