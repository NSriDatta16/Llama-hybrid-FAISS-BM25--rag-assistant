ReEdit : You know, I really don't like my answer at all. I voted up the other answer but I liked his original answer because not only was it clean but self explanatory without getting "fancy" which is what I fell victim to: for row in doc.cssselect('tr'): for cell in row.cssselect('td'): if(cel.text_content() != ''): #do stuff here there's not much more of an elegant solution. Original-ish : You can transform the second for loop as follows: [cell for cell in row.cssselect if cell.text_content() != ''] and turn it into a list-comprehension. That way you've got a prescreened list. You can take that even farther by looking at the following example: a = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4] newList = [y for x in a for y in x] which transforms it into [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4] . Then you can add in the if statement at the end to screen out values. Hence, you'd reduce that into a single line. Then again, if you were to look at itertools : ifilter(lambda x: x.text_content() != '', row.cssselect('td')) produces an iterator which you can iterate over, skipping all items you don't want. Edit : And before I get more downvotes, if you're using python 3.0, filter works the same way. No need to import ifilter .
