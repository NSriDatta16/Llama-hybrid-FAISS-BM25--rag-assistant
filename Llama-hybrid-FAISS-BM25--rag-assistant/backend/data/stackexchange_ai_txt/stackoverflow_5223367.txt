ListView Scrolling

I have three items in a ListView. The reason I have chosen the ListView is so I can use a Divider and a List Selector on these items. However I do not need/want the scrolling aspect of the ListView. Ie. When I select/drag an item from the list, I dont want it to scroll.. Is it possible to disable this somehow? Or will I have to add the items using a LinearLayout and find another way of using a list divider and selector?
