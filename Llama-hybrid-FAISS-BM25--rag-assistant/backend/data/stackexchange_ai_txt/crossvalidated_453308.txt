hyperparameters optimisation with linear kernel

I want to conduct an SVM model-regression (i.e., support vector regression), using a linear kernel function . Does it make sense to perform a cross-validation hyperparameter optimization when the kernel function is linear? If so, what should be the range of values for each hyperparameter in the search? Thank you
