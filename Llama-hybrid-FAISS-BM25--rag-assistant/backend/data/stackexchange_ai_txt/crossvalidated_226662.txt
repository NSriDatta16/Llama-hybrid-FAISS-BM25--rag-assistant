Truncated Normal distribution: Theoretical mean outside truncation boundaries

I am working with a truncated normal as posterior distribution in a Bayesian estimation problem. Precisely, it is a normal distribution truncated at 0 from below. When calculating the parameters of the posterior distribution, I sometimes end up with a negative mean parameter $\mu = -8.0 $ and a variance of $\sigma^2 = 0.2$ . However, I try to sample from a truncated normal with these parameters. Is it even possible to obtain a sample within $[0,\infty)$ using these parameters? According to my understanding that would require at least $18\sigma$ to compensate the negative mean of $-8.0$ . I assume something is wrong in the calculation of the mean of the posterior distribution here, since - for me - it doesn't seem reasonable to have a negative (theoretical) mean for a distribution which is truncated at 0 from below. Am I right here or is it possible to overcome the negativity caused by the mean?
