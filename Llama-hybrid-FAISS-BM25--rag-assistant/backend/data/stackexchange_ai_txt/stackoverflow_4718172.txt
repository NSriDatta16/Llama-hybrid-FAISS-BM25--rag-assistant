Unfortunately this isn't supported very well today, but a future update may address the manipulations issue. A visual tree organized differently might help, if you can get the manipulations handled before being passed on along the visual tree. Grid Pivot Grid IsHitTestVisible = False // your overlay Grid // your "popup" And if this does not work, although the performance may not be great, having your "loading" page in a dedicated Popup, the manipulations will not be sent to the Pivot even if its underneath.
