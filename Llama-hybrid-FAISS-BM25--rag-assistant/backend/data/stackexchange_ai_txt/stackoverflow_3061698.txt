auto_inline - inadequate documentation

I want to disable inlining for a particular function. What the compiler does for everything else should be as specified in the project properties. I found a page on a forum which suggested the following: #pragma auto_inline(off) void func() { } #pragma auto_inline() The author suggested that calling auto_inline() with no arguments will set the compiler to revert to doing whatever the default action was before the call to auto_inline(off). Can anyone confirm that this works for visual studio 2008? I ask because the VS2008 documentation makes no mention at all of what happens if you call this function with no arguments.
