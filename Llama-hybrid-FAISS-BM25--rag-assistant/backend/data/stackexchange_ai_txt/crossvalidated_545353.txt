Time Series vs. Queueing Models

Generally speaking, queues are modelled using the Poisson process. Supposedly, this used to model the dynamic nature of queues, arrivals, birth-death and renewals. But just as a basic question: Why aren't time series models used to model and simulate the behavior of queues? In practice, couldn't a ARIMA style time series model be used to predict how many people will be waiting in the queue at equidistant time points? Is there a particular reason that queueing models like M/M/K models are generally used for these kinds of problems instead of classical time series models?
