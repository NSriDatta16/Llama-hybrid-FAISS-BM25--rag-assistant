I would strongly recommend to compile with the latest OS-version, since older versions might contain bugs. For example, I run into nasty bugs with correct identification of hdpi-drawables and mdpi-drawables if I compile my apps for 1.5, instead of 2.1. However, if you would like your app to work on older versions you might want to try compiling them to this version just to make sure you are not using any API-calls that does not exist for the older version.
