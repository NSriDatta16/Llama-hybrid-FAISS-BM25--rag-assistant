Is building deep learning architectures a trial and error scheme?

I have been reading many deep learning papers where each of them follow different architecture. I cannot see what the logical sense or the intuitive sense behind each layer in each architecture. I got a sense that many of those architectures are just arbitrary ones that we found them work in a perfect way for our application. I don't think science should be done like this. So I am sure I am missing somethings. Can someone point out for me to some general concepts and ideas I should follow to understand how I should design my deep learning architecture for my application? If there are materials/books or whatever help me to have a sense of how deep learning works (I know math, but not the logic or intuitive behind that) I appreciate it.
