How to classify and cluster this time series data

I have post already the question few months ago about my project that I'm starting to work on. This post can be see here: Human activity recognition using smartphone data set problem Now, I know this is based around multivariate time series analysis and tasks are to classify and cluster the data. I have gathered some materials (e-books, tutorials etc.) on this but still can't see a more detailed picture of how even I should start. Here's the tutorial that looks like it might be helpful but the thing is my data looks differently and I'm not really sure if this can be applied to my work. http://little-book-of-r-for-multivariate-analysis.readthedocs.org/en/latest/src/multivariateanalysis.html#scatterplots-of-the-principal-components So basically, my questions are: How I can start on some very basic analysis? How to read data so it any meaning for me. Any tips and advises will be much appreciated! Note: I'm just the beginner in data science.
