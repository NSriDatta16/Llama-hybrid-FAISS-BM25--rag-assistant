The last carry was dropped because it does not fit in the target space. It would be the fifth bit. If he had carried out the same addition, but with for example 8 bit storage, it would have looked like this: 00000100 11111101 -------- 00000001 In this situation we would also be stuck with an "unused" carry. We have to treat carries this way to make addition with two's compliment work properly, but that's all good, because this is the easiest way of treating carries when you have limited storage. Anyway, we get the correct result, right :) x86-processors store such an additional carry in the carry flag (CF), which is possible to test with certain instructions.
