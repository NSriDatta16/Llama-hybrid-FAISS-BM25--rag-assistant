A few newer techniques I have come across for assessing the fit of logistic regression models come from political science journals: Greenhill, Brian, Michael D. Ward & Audrey Sacks. 2011. The separation plot: A new visual method for evaluating the fit of binary models. American Journal of Political Science 55(4):991-1002 . Esarey, Justin & Andrew Pierce. 2012. Assessing fit quality and testing for misspecification in binary-dependent variable models. Political Analysis 20(4): 480-500 . Preprint PDF Here Both of these techniques purport to replace Goodness-of-Fit tests (like Hosmer & Lemeshow) and identify potential mis-specification (in particular non-linearity in included variables in the equation). These are particularly useful as typical R-square measures of fit are frequently criticized . Both of the above papers above utilize predicted probabilities vs. observed outcomes in plots - somewhat avoiding the unclear issue of what is a residual in such models. Examples of residuals could be contribution to the log-likelihood or Pearson residuals (I believe there are many more though). Another measure that is often of interest (although not a residual) are DFBeta's (the amount a coefficient estimate changes when an observation is excluded from the model). See examples in Stata for this UCLA page on Logistic Regression Diagnostics along with other potential diagnostic procedures. I don't have it handy, but I believe J. Scott Long's Regression Models for Categorical and Limited Dependent Variables goes in to sufficient detail on all of these different diagnostic measures in a simple manner.
