DBC (Design by contract) and AOP(Aspect oriented programming)

I was reading The Pragmatic Programer and by section about DBC ther talk abount how Effel enforces DBC pre and post Condition and Java,C#,C++ dose not. First thing that came to mind was use AOP (so i googles it DBC and AOP only old links came up) So what are other programes thoughts abount using AOP to inforce DBC in Java or C#?
