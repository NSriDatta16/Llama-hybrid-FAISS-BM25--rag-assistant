PCA time trajectory plots

I am studyng the effect of chemotherapy/surgery on the patients' metabolomics profiles and I have 4 time points. I would like to see if patients who achieved good outcome have a trajectory over the time that differs from not responders patients. I found an article where it is reported a similar situation and they carried out a PCA using the average PCA scores, but I do not have idea how to performed this analysis. Many thanks for the help.
