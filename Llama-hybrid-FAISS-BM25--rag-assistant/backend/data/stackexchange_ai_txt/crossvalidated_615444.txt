Without having the packages at the top of the code, I cannot determine what exactly these functions do. However, it seems like the culprit is that you are predicting values on a continuum and then trying to determine the confusion matrix. However, a confusion matrix requires discrete categories. When you have predictions on a continuum, probably every single prediction is at least a little bit incorrect. There are also likely to be more distinct predictions than categories, which is completely consistent with the error message that you have more levels (distinct values) in the predictions than in the original data. A way to solve this is to apply a threshold to the continuous output to bin the continuous predictions into discrete categories. There are issues with doing this, and I encourage all readers to go through that link if they are unfamiliar with this material. However, that will lead to predicted categories for which a confusion matrix can be calculated.
