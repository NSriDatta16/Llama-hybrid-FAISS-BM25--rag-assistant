If you want to look at difference then you can look at plots of the average difference, the average absolute difference, a Tukey mean difference plot (aka Bland Altman plot) and so on. You can also look at these numerically (except the last). And you can make a crosstab of the two questions and see how often they differ by any given amount (or you could make a table of the differences). However, you might be interested in the correlation. Then you could use the Spearman rank correlation. This might be closer to what you want, since if the two are highly correlated, they have much of the same information, even if they differ in value. E.g. if everyone scored 1 point higher on one question than the other, there would be perfect correlation even with the difference and you would only need one.
