@Joseph, notice that the variables are 8 bits wide, while the shift is 12 bits wide. Your solution works only for N If you can assume your array is a multiple of 4 you can cast the array into an array of uint64_t and then work on that. If it isn't a multiple of 4, you can work in 64-bit chunks on as much as you can and work on the remainder one by one. This may be a bit more coding, but I think it's more elegant in the end.
