How to organize spaces within Confluence (wiki)?

My company will be using Confluence to store and share our knowledge base on our IT systems, and could be used to cover topics from hardware administration to issues faced by programmers. I am curious about the best practice for setting up the global spaces. Is it better to have one large, catch-all space for the entire IT department or should the information be broken into multiple spaces focused on a particular domain? My concern is that breaking the information into several, smaller spaces will hinder the ability to link between related topics that might be categorized into different spaces. For example, we could have 2 spaces to cover our website and our main internal system. However, there is plenty of overlap between the website apps and the main internal system. Any advice that can be provided would be greatly appreciated!
