I disagree w/ArielBH. The issue here is the interplay between keyboard and logical focus, and unless you have changed all your Data Binding update triggers to PropertyChanged, you may miss some source data updates in certain scenarios (e.g. Toolbar button clicks). For instance, the default update trigger for TextBox.Text is LostFocus and clicking on a toolbar button does not blur the active TextBox focus. If you have some mechanism to register the controls, then you could explicitly force the data binding to update the source in the same place you'd be calling EndEdit in a WinForms app. It's not neat or elegant, but it gets the job done. If somebody has come up with a better solution, I'd be all ears as well.
