Displaying the results You said in comments I used stacking purely to display relationship of data. The actual quantity (duration) is irrelevant Stacking makes the length comparison difficult; for the ones that are close together in time, you'd need to look at the numbers to see a difference. If the values don't matter, one option is to plot the logs of the ratios instead (but with axes representing the percentage difference) With a plot more like this: you get a better sense of the relative speed of the various tasks under the two systems. However, it may be worth looking at plots where all of the individual values are represented (rather than just averages), so that an idea of the relative variability is also available. Testing for a difference The issue with any kind of statistical test is being very precise about what it is we mean to test. In particular, what null and alternative hypothesis we're dealing with, and under what assumptions. You have 5 numbers for each type of activity - are they just repetitions, or is there some kind of pairing across 5 different circumstances? Are you looking for a test within each kind of activity or something overall? R code to (approximately) generate the above plot: wl
