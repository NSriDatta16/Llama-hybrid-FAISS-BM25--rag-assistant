You could try linear regression with three explanatory variables, time, sin(c $\times$ time) and cos(c $\times$ time) where c is a constant chosen to correctly represent the period of the seasonality. Hopefully then the regression coefficients for the sin and cosine terms will account for the seasonality and that for the linear term would show the long term trend. Alternatively (and this is what climatologists would probably do) you could just look at the baselined dataset. Pick a baseline period of (say) 30 years and compute the average for each month. Then subtract that average from the values for the corresponding months in the data and plot/analyse that. That will remove a lot of the seasonality in the data.
