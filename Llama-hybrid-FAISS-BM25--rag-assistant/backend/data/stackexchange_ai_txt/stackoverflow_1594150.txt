Similar to McDowell's answer, but with more flexibility, is to declare an attribute that is a fragment. http://java.sun.com/j2ee/1.4/docs/tutorial/doc/JSPTags5.html#wp89854 e.g., //foo.tag tag file body: jsp file a fancy hello more fancy body this will produce this markup: a fancy hello body: more fancy body The main advantage is to be able to have two fragments, instead of just one with a tag.
