Logistic regression - Confidence interval for x axis

My question is very similar to the post Confidence interval for x-values given a probability in a logistic regression where ultimately no answer was given. I have also posted a similar version on the mathematica stack exchange, https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/questions/272716/logistic-regression-confidence-interval-for-x-axis?noredirect=1#comment681054_272716 , but it was suggested that I repost here. Based on the comments below, I found it necessary to include more detail in how the data is generated As an example consider the scenario where a cannonball is fired at a wall. There are only two outcomes: the wall collapses (1) and the wall does not collapse (0). I'm interested in the probability that the wall collapses as a function of the cannonball velocity. It is reasonable to expect that the probability vs velocity will have an S shape. Nevertheless, it is just an example. I have a set of test data: dataUpDown = {{24, 0}, {29, 0}, {34, 0}, {39, 0}, {44, 0}, {49, 1}, {44, 1}, {39, 1}, {34, 1}, {29, 0}, {34, 0}, {39, 0}, {44, 0}, {49, 0}, {54, 0}, {59, 1}, {54, 0}, {59, 0}, {64, 1}, {59, 0}, {64, 1}, {59, 0}, {64, 0}, {69, 1}, {64, 1}, {59, 1}, {54, 1}, {49, 1}, {44, 0}, {49, 1}, {44, 1}, {39, 0}, {44, 0}, {49, 0}, {54, 0}, {59, 1}, {54, 1}, {49, 0}, {54, 0}, {59, 1}, {54, 1}, {49, 0}, {54, 0}, {59, 0}, {64, 1}, {59, 1}, {54, 1}, {49, 1}, {44, 1}, {39, 0}} where the numbered pair will be referred to as $\{v_i,y_i\}$ . Here $y_i$ is a binary variable which only can take the values $0\,\text{or}\,1$ and $v_i$ is a continous quantity. In the example above $v_i$ is the cannonball velocity, and $y_i$ determines whether the wall collapses $(y_i=1)$ or not $(y_i=0)$ . The data above is generated with the so--called up/down procedure which works like this: Start with some initial velocity and fire If the wall collapses, decrease the velocity with a fixed amount If the wall does not collapse, increase the velocity with a fixed amount Step 2 and 3 is then repeated until a certain number of shots (e.g. 50) have been performed. We imagine, unrealistically, that if the wall collapses, it is immediately repaired. In reality, there will be some uncertainty in decreasing/increasing the velocity by a specific amount. As a consequence the velocity steps might not be uniform in an experiment. In mathematica this data generating procedure can be implemented as: (*UP-DOWN TEST*) (*Velocity vs perforation*) s = 13; \[Mu] = 50; step = 5; error = 0.2; (*Generate data according to up-down test*) dataUpDown = {}; Table[ If[shotNumber == 1, V0 = \[Mu] - 2 s,]; perf = RandomVariate[ BernoulliDistribution[1/(1 + E^(-((V0 - \[Mu])/s)))], 1][[1]]; If[ perf == 1, AppendTo[dataUpDown, {V0, perf}]; V0 = V0 - step, AppendTo[dataUpDown, {V0, perf}]; V0 = V0 + step]; , {shotNumber, 1, 50}]; Whether or not the wall collapses is determined by an underlying "true" probability function of the form $$ P(y=1|v) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-\frac{v-\mu}{s}}} $$ where I decide on $\mu = 50$ and $s=13$ for concreteness. Specifically the fate of the wall is determined by using a single random Bernoulli draw, where the probability input is the the true model above and the output is collapse (1) or not collapse (0). Since the data is binary I want to to a logistic curve fitting with the function $$P(y=1|v) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-\left(\alpha + \beta v\right)}}$$ I can then use some programming language (e.g. mathematica) to obtain a logistic regression by writing something like logit = LogitModelFit[dataUpDown, x, x]; I can define a 95% confidence interval for the probabilities by writing something like this (* Get predictions and upper and lower confidence limits for a + b*x *) pred = Table[1 - 1/(1 + Exp[parms.{1, x[[i]]}]), {i, 101}]; lower = Table[1 - 1/(1 + Exp[parms.{1, x[[i]]} - 1.96 Sqrt[{1, x[[i]]}.cov.{1, x[[i]]}]]), {i, 101}]; upper = Table[1 - 1/(1 + Exp[parms.{1, x[[i]]} + 1.96 Sqrt[{1, x[[i]]}.cov.{1, x[[i]]}]]), {i, 101}]; I have then constructed a confidence interval for the sum $\alpha + \beta x$ and used the logistic mapping to convert it to the probability interval. However, my question is how can I obtain a confidence interval on the $x$ values? I.e what is the uncertainty in the velocity, specifically in certain velocity quantiles. The question pops up naturally if one want to calculate the velocity $v_i = v_{50}$ where $v_{50}$ is the velocity required to have a 50% chance of making the wall collapse. By extension, I'm also interested in confidence intervals for quantities such as $v_{60}$ , $v_{70}$ , $v_{80}$ , $v_{90}$ , i.e. a confidence interval on the velocities.
