I'm a bit unsure as to what you mean by the 'heredoc' approach. Also, I think this question would be better accommodated on programmers. At any rate, to answer your question (which is a bit too open ended). Try to at least organize your project into distinct parts. Use an MVC based approach. You don't need to go full on framework, but layering on a template framework like Smarty will help you a lot. Or you can write your own light layer as well. As for your front end, code your site to work with basic functionality. Make sure everything works without Ajax/JS. Then start layering on increasing interactivity by using unobtrusive javascript techniques. This will ensure your site gets the widest possible audience while being able to leverage new technologies and methods. You can also use some HTML5 and CSS3 in there as well. Make sure you use a coding standard and stick to it . If you use a framework, they usually encourage you to stay in character when coding in any case. Lots of popular frameworks are available if you go the framework route. Including, but not limited to Zend , CakePHP , Codeigniter , symfony and many more. And feel free to use JS libraries to do all the legwork for you. Some of the most popular are jQuery , mootools and prototype
