You didn't include any info on filesystem or database, so here are some misc pointers. It is inevitable that you will lose a disk eventually, so its equally important to put a good backup and recovery strategy in place, and mirror your transaction logs, so you can handle a disk failure or even full datafile loss. 1) If possible, put at least one copy of your transaction log on a fixed disk. Don't put your sole transaction log to an external storage subsystem. (Assuming you use a db that supports log mirroring). 2) I agree with gbn, in practice, don't use write caching. I've lost databases on RAID arrays with battery backup. Configure the storage controller card for write-through. 3) Raw devices provide guaranteed writes, but its not worth the hassle. Some filesystems provide synchronous write options too, use one if possible. I am partial to VxFS, but I'm from the Sun world. On Linux, btrfs is eminent at least, but for now, Ext3 works fine if you setup your db properly.
