Monotouch is presumably a port of Mono to the iPod. Mono itself is an open source implementation of the .NET runtime (and some dev tools) in various *nix environments. This was a massive labour led by Miguel de Icaza who realised early the importance of .NET and set about porting it to open platforms. Incidently he receieved a great deal of support from MicroSoft itself as MONO gave ineteroparability between native .NET and mono. So the first answer is you need to be a well organised, hard working genius. The second answer is more Comp Sciency. "Turing Complete" is a the minimum set of functions that a system needs to be considered a programable computer. Its actualy a very small set -- subtract, compare, branch and read and store. The theory is that any "Turing Complete" system can do anything any other "Turing Complete" system can do. So given any reasonably complete programming language environment you should be able to emulate it using another program environment. There are numerous examples of this around. Jpython runs the emulates C python in a Java JVM. My two personal favourites are which runs original zX spectrum games in your browser and Knuth MIX assembeler machine both of which are pure javascript.
