XGBoost: predictive, descriptive (or both) model?

I have trained an XGBoost model for prediction. The algorithm is able to calculate variable importances. I was asked why I have not analyzed these variable importances and I did not because as I understood XGBoost is rather a predictive than a descriptive model. I am not sure what extent theses importances can be used to capture real importance (I understand that it may be dependent on the context). Am I right that XGBoost is rather a predictive model?
