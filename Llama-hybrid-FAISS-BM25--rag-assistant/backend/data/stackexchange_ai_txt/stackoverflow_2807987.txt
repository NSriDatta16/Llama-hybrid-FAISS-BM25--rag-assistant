Large file download for a Rails project

One client project will be online two months later. One of the requirements changed is to support large files (10 to 15MB per RAW camera file, expected 1000 to 5000 files download per day) download worldwide for their customers. The process will be: there is upload screen via paperclip to the rails local public folder a hourly task to upload to web storage (S3?) update the download url from paperclip url to the web url Questions: is there a gem/plug-in for this purpose? if no, any gem/plug-in for S3 to recommend? Questions about the storage provider: is S3 recommended? or other service to recommend? The baseline is: the client's web server does not and will not have the bandwidth to handle the downloads. Thanks
