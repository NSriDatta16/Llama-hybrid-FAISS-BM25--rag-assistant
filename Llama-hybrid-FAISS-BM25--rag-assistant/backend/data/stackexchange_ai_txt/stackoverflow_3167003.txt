It depends what you want achieve by doing this. I agree with @thomasfedb that you will likely messup the style of most peoples CSS by doing this transformation and will likely cause more trouble than its worth. It's my suggestion that you keep the data exactly as the user entered it, and then 'minify' it when you render it to the page. This will not save you and storage in your database, and it will increase your CPU usage per page render, but it will save you the bandwidth of all the extra new-line characters. Another option, presuming database storage is not much of a concern, is to store the data twice, once where the user edits, and once minified. Then simply minify and copy the user-editable field into the minified field whenever the user makes any changes.
