As mentioned above you could train two separate classifiers on both the data. This is useful because say you have more faith in the CNN features than histogram based features then you give that classifier's prediction more weight in the final output. Once you concatenate the features you are unable to use make use of this prior knowledge. If both features sets are equally informative with similar noise then concatenation should work fine as well.
