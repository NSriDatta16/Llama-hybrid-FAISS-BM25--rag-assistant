Combining multiple probabilities from a classifier. Propagating probabilities

Let's say I have trained a classifier that classifies images of animals into 10 different classes. And let's say that I have 20 different images of a particular animal and because I know the photographer, I know with certainty that all 20 images are of the same animal. So I use my classifier to make a prediction on what animal it is and get 20 predictions one for each image. The model predicts all the images to be a dog with varying probabilities. image 1: 80% dog image 2: 90% dog image 3: 75% dog and so on. What is the probability that the animal in question is a dog? Let's say they predict cat with smaller probabilities, 5%, 2%, 4% ... What is the probability it is a cat? I've tried a few different approaches, applying Bayes Theorem but I keep getting numbers that add up to be more than one. Could it really be just the average?
