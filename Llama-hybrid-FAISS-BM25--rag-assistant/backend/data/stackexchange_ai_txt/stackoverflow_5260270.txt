ASP.NET MVC is very different from ASP.NET WebForms . ASP.NET WebForms is aimed for rapid, "drag-and-drop" development. In some way, it tries to recreate the way you develop Windows Forms applications. This can be cool, but sometimes beginners get trapped by that similarity and forget that they are developing a web server application, trying to make things in a way which is improper in that context, finally realising that they have to learn a lot about and to deal with WebForms -specific intrinsics like page life cycles, PostBacks , ViewStates , etc. (let those who didn't struggle with one of those cast the first downvote). On the other hand, ASP.NET MVC is a much more flexible framework, and as such requires from you more discipline to get it right. it also requires from you to have a good understanding of engineering principles like REST and Model-View-Controller . The good thing is that there are (almost) no surprises because you are in control of (almost) everything. Personally speaking, I developed WebForms applications for several years, and it took some time to master it. As for ASP.NET MVC , it took me about 2 days to learn about the core concepts , watch the great NerdDinner tutorial, test and play with code, until I felt completely comfortable with that technology.
