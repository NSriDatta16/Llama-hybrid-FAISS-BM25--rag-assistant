You could treat the exact number of zeros unknown, but constrained between 0 and the observed number of zeros. This can surely be handled using a Bayesian formulation of the model. Maybe a multiple imputation method can also be tweaked to appropriately vary the weights (between 0 and 1) of the zero observationsâ€¦
