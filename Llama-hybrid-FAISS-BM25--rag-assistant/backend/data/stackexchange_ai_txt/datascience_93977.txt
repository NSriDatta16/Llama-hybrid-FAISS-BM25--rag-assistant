How to create a confusion matrix for one node of a decision tree?

I am doing past papers for my data science exam and was curious about one of the questions. They ask us to create a confusion matrix by hand for one node of a decision tree. I understand how to create a decision tree for an entire model, but I am unsure on how to create one for just one variable. Should the entire first row be 0s other than the class A as it should always predict class A or am I missing something. I have attached the decision tree and the exact wording of the question below. Thanks! "(iv) Present a confusion matrix for the [leftmost terminal] node."
