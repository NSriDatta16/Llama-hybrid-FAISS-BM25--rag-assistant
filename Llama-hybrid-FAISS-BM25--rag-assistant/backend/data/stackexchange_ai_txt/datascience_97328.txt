Your manual approach gives the MAE on the test set. Because you've set an integer for the parameter cv , the GridSearchCV is doing k-fold cross-validation (see the parameter description in grid search docs ), and so the score .best_score_ is the average MAE on the multiple test folds. If you really want a single train/test split, you can do that in GridSearchCV , see e.g. this SO post .
