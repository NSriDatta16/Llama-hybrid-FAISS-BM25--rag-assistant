My first action would be plotting the data and eyeball if there are data points that fall suspiciously far from all others. Then, in R I would plot a Residuals-vs-Leverage graph and check which data points fall beyond Cook's distance. Something like this should work: par(mfrow=c(2,2) ; plot(lm(payments~1, data=yourdata)) It's a standard diagnostics graph for visually assessing whether the data obey to the assumptions of linear models. This method is good for single outliers. To look for more "systemic" outliers, clusters of data, or multimodality, one option is cluster analysis. You can perform cluster analysis in R using package mclust . Here are some details about it: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mclust/vignettes/mclust.html Also, see the related questions (some with answers) that pop up in the right column of this page. - Cheers
