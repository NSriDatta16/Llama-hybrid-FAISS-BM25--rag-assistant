That's an attempt of a partial answer: I'd use a Mann Whitney test because it makes less assumptions. The logistic regression assumes a close form (namely logit) for the relationship between these two variables). Moreover, logistic regression assumes that $Y$ is Bernoulli given $X$: if this is not the case (e.g., an a priori number of samples with $Y=1$ and $Y=0$ as in a case-control study) was selected, I'm not sure if the results (such as p-values) would still hold. However, I already saw many people doing this. On the other hand, Mann Whitney does not seem to have problems with this, i.e., it holds whether or not it is a case-control study.
