Regular Expression - Getting Everything But Last Match

I have the following bit of HTML: Read the full interview with Nick Sambrato, Printmaker here: grainandgram.com/nicksambrato/ Cast: Grain & Gram My goal is to isolate the last set of paragraph tags. I'm trying this by match everything between the paragraph tags. My hope was that I'd get three results and I could manipulate the data. I tried the following regular expression: ]*>(.*?) It's only matching with the first set of paragraph tags. How do I get it to match with the first two? Thanks Update: I was thinking about this in the wrong way. I can't always assume that there will be X amount of information before the Cast text that I want. I can assume that Cast will be the last paragraph pulled, however. So the revised question: How can I match with everything EXCEPT the last paragraph? In other words, how do I match everything before " Cast:"?
