Using complex data types from Java in Axis webservice

I am currently developing a Java app which handles a SOAP webservice. The problem lies after I parse the WSDL [the Parser object from Apache Axis does it for me], and I create the call. When I try to invoke it, I have to pass a Object[] to assign the parameters [taken from the Action of the WSDL]. A normal action is easy, but when I have custom datatypes, I can't get it to fill it out for me. I try to pass Object[]{ new Object { }}, but it assigns the first field instead. I can't pass it already processed, because it changes the ' ' to '--lt --gt', and the server doesn't recognize it'. This is a fragment of the WSDL. And this is the troublesome Java Fragment QTY = (String) call.invoke ( new Object[]{ new Object[]{ tokenConexion.getToken (), tokenConexion.getSign (), tokenConexion.getCUIT () } });
