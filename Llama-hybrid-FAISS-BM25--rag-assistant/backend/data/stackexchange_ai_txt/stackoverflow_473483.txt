Not really sure what exactly your question is, but consider the following code: 10.times { puts "abc".object_id } This prints out 10 different id's. Why? Just because you know this string wont change doesn't mean Ruby does. If you think that "abc" should only be created once then what happens if you do: 10.times { puts "abc".upcase! } The upcase! method mutates the string to be upper case, on the next iteration the string created in the first iteration isn't the same anymore. Perhaps post a code example that is confusing to you?
