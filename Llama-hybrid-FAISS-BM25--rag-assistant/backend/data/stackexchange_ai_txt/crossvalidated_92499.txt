How to interpret PCA loadings?

While reading about PCA, I came across the following explanation: Suppose we have a data set where each data point represents a single student's scores on a math test, a physics test, a reading comprehension test, and a vocabulary test. We find the first two principal components, which capture 90% of the variability in the data, and interpret their loadings. We conclude that the first principal component represents overall academic ability, and the second represents a contrast between quantitative ability and verbal ability. The text states that PC1 and PC2 loadings are $(0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5)$ for PC1 and $(0.5, 0.5, -0.5, -0.5)$ for PC2, and offers the following explanation: [T]he first component is proportional to average score, and the second component measures the difference between the first pair of scores and the second pair of scores. I am not able to understand what this explanation means.
