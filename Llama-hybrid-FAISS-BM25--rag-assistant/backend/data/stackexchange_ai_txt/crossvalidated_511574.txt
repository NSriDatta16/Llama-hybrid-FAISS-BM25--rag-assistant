I don't have enough reputation to ask for clarification with a comment, so I'm going to incorporate my uncertainty about the question into the answer. First, it is not clear to me whether $x$ ("college degree") is time-variant in this model, which it would have to be in order to be included in a two-way fixed-effects model that eliminates all between-unit variation. The part of the question related to regressions of cross-sections of $x$ at each time period suggests you are interested in a between-unit relationship (individuals with or without college degree). On the other hand, the $H$ variable is clearly time-variant, and it seems like you are interested in the effects of its changes (AKA within-unit variation). If I'm wrong and $x$ is actually time-variant, and you want to include it in a fixed-effects model, then what you'd be measuring is the effect of getting a college degree at different values of $H$ that are deviations from the mean of $H$ for that individual over the whole panel. It would not be equivalent to saying it is the effect of having a college degree, as that, to me, has a between-unit logic. If I'm right that $x$ is time-invariant for individuals during the panel and $H$ is modeling change specifically (within-unit variation during the panel), then you need a model that can include both between-effects ( $x$ ) and within-effects ( $H$ ) (definitely not a standard fixed-effects model), and I have a potential solution. As you likely know, fixed effects models more often use unit demeaning rather than including unit/individual dummies ( $a_i$ ). Demeaning accomplishes the exact same thing as unit dummy variables, and both methods drop time-invariant variables, because $x_{it}$ (an individual's deviation from their panel mean) is always zero for time-invariant variables with unit fixed-effects. An alternative is the within-between fixed effects model. In this model $y$ is not demeaned, nor is there a $a_i$ . Instead, for each time-variant variable, there is a unit-demeaned version (within) and a second variable that is the average value of the variable for each unit/individual during the period (between). In this model, you can additionally include any time-invariant variable (like $x$ ), and it can be interacted with demeaned $H$ . The effect of $x$ is not truly decomposed (to me that sounds like mediation and not moderation/interaction), but something similar is achieved. The interpretation of the coefficient for $x$ outside of the interaction (the equivalent of $\beta_1$ in your equation) is the effect of having a college degree while values for $H$ (within-unit variable) are at their mean values for individuals during the panel (due to the individual demeaning process). I'm not sure if this satisfies a "decomposed" effect, but you are able to identify the between-individual effect of having a college degree or not, while each individual is at their individual, panel-average value of $H$ . This is all quite complicated to do in terms of transformations, but there is a package for R called panelr that takes care of everything. This page also explains the within-between model in much more elegant terms than I have here.
