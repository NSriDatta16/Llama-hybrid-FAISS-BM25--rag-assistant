Can I enable/disable breaking on Exceptions programmatically?

I want to be able to break on Exceptions when debugging... like in Visual Studio 2008's Menu Debug/Exception Dialog, except my program has many valid exceptions before I get to the bit I wish to debug. So instead of manually enabling and disabling it using the dialog every time is it possible to do it automatically with a #pragma or some other method so it only happens in a specific piece of code?
