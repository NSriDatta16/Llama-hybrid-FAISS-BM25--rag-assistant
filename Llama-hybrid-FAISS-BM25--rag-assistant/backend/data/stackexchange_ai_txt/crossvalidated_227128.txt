Not really, no. Take a look at this picture: In this case, we have two dimensions. Let's say we reduce it to 1 (just $U_1$). What will happen is that all the points will be projected onto $U_1$ so many points (an infinite number, in fact) will map to the same point on $U_1$. The same will happen with any dimensionality reduction via SVD.
