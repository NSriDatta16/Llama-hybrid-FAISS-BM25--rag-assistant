Embedding Rake in a C++ app? Or is there a Lake for LUA?

I've found a couple of questions about embedding Ruby in a C++ app. Almost all of the top-voted answers suggest using Lua instead. Given that a project I have in mind would be better served by the grammar already expressed in Rake (it's a rules engine), is there any easy way to embed Rake in a C++ app, or is there a Rake-like module for Lua? To clarify: I want this to be a self-contained app, if possible. It should have minimal pre-requisites, because it'll be running on a fairly bare-boned (Windows) OS.
