Is it necessary to publish the results of the model on the training data?

For my thesis I am doing a quantitative research where I use the logistic regression. To improve the validity of my findings, I am cross-validating the logistic regression with a holdout sample. The question that I have: do I need to publish the results of the model on the training data or is it enough to focus on the performance on the testing sample? I was wondering, because for the hypotheses-testing I only consider the results from the testing sample as relevant.
