prevent duplicated usernames with non-case-sensitive behavior in php/mysql

In my website usernames are saved like this robert and funny thing is that one can registers with the name Robert (Capital R). How would I prevent these somehow duplicated usernames? My project is in mysql/php if (mysql_num_rows(mysql_query("SELECT username FROM user_table WHERE username='$username'")) > 0){ die("duplicated usernames can't be saved , this username exists."); } Even with this code Robert can be registered.
