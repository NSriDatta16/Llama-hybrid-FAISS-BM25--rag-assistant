There is no answer to this question; everybody has different opinions. Personally I like ORMs for simple home projects but wouldn't go near one in an application I actually have to support, and much prefer to use stored procedures to give the database a well defined interface that is abstracted from the storage mechanism. Many people disagree with this point of view. Heck, even I'll probably disagree with it in a few years time. But it doesn't really matter what I think or what they think, if you're happy with what you're doing and find it efficient to code and easy to support, then it's elegant.
