What is sizeMax ? I do not see the declaration, please fix the formatting. A side note... you are blindingly calling malloc without checking if it worked or not...that is a dangerous assumption - never assume there is plenty of memory available as the heap could become very fragmented and when a call to malloc for a very small object in a fragmented heap could fail as there is not enough memory...
