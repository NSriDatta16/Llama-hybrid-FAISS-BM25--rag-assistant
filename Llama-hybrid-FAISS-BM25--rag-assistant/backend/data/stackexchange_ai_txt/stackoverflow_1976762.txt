One website, one domain, but two different technologies?

I need advice. I inherited a website that's been around a long time. The website gets a lot of organic traffic from Google. The business and website owner is upgrading the site to make the content more manageable. At the moment, a wordpress CMS powers half the site. Physical html pages make up the remainder of the site. Here's a summary: 1) Guide section which consists of a php wordpress driven blog found at http://mysite.com/guide . Individual pages in the guide section have urls such as http://mysite.com/guide/4930-hello-world or http://mysite.com/guide/489-welcome-to-my-site . The business owner spent 2 months populating these pages and is reluctant to scrap it for another system. 2) E-commerce section which consists of a thousand static/physical product pages. The product pages are NOT dynamically driven and no url rewrite rules are involved. The pages have urls such as http://mysite.com/products/239123-sofa.html and http://mysite.com/products/23-office-desks.html The owner wants to use a non-PHP ERP or CRM solutions to power the website's e-commerce section and streamline some of the business' accounting, inventory, marketing and work-flow operations. I have never worked with ERPs or CRMs before. Some questions I have are: 1) Is it a good idea to have one website under one domain driven by two different technologies? Wordpress manages pages such as http://mysite.com/guide/4930-hello-world while a Microsoft application manages pages such as http://mysite.com/products/239123-sofa.html . As mentioned earlier, the business owner is reluctant to scrap wordpress because he put considerable effort into populating it. 2) What challenges will I experience implementing url-rewrite rules (because it's two technologies under one domain, but different sub-directories)? I need to make sure the website retains its Page Rank and SEO goodies. 3) What server configuration challanges will I experience? I've never replaced a legacy system of this magnitude on my own before. I appreciate any advice or feedback you guys can offer. Also let me know if there's anything else I should research. Thanks
