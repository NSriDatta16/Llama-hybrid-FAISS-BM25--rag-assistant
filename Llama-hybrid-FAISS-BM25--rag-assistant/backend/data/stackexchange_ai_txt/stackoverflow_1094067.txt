I had to set the following in buildAgent.properties file system.FxCopRoot=c:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft FxCop 1.36 Make sure to escape the colon and backslashes. Then I had to create an artifact from my compile build configuration of the bin folder containing the assemblies I wanted FxCop to look at. Then I had to create an artifact dependency on that artifact in the FxCop build configuration; otherwise there were not any assemblies available for FxCop tp operate on. That did the trick for me.
