For a sand-boxed local file access with Webstart (and with JNLP-applets to, from Java 6, update 10, when the new plugin came out), use the services in the javax.jnlp package (linked from the Webstart documentation page . In this case, a FileOpenService and/or FileSaveService lets the user confirm the action and select a file in a filechooser, and you then get a FileContents object, which you can then read from or write to. You don't need special permissions for that, not even sign your code (but I think if you do, the confirmation dialog looks less intimidating, as it contains the information who wants this). If you want to see how it looks like from user perspective, use our Applet here and select custom picture .
