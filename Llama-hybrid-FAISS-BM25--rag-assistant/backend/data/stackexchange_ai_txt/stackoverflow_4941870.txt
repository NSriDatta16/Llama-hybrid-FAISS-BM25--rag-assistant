The risk with decryptable passwords is that people use the one password for various logins and accounts, not just for the application you are dealing with. With an encrypted password, a stolen/decrypted password could be tried out on users' other accounts (e.g. a stolen banking password could lead to access to their email). With a hashed password, there is no recovery. Theft of password hashes should never easily yield usable passwords Treat passwords as the property of the account owner. It's not yours to view, decrypt, or do other things with. If a user forgets their password, offer reset, and not retrieval.
