Unfortunately C# compiler does not perform tail call optimization , which is something that you want to happen in this case. CLR supports it, kinda , but you shouldn't rely on it. Perhaps left of field, but maybe you can write the recursive part of your program in F#? This way you can leverage guaranteed tail call optimization and reuse bits of your C# code. Whilst a steep learning curve, F# is a more suitable language for these combinatorial tasks.
