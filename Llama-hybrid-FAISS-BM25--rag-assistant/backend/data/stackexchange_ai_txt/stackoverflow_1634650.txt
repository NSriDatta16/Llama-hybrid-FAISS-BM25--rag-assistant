Best open source database for large web based application

I am beginning work on a relatively large web-based application with the potential for large throughput and storage of a large amount of data. My expertise lies in MS SQL Server but it is cost prohibitive for a startup project. Is there any alternative to SQL Server (standard) that can handle the same throughput, has similar features and is free ? Any advice is greatly appreciated, Thanks in advance, JP Update To answer a common point - SQL Express has limitations that make it a no-go for me. Specifically, correct me if i am wrong, it can address only 1 CPU, 1GB memory, has a max size of 4GB per database, etc. etc. Also, I am aware of bizspark. The problem is that once the project goes live one must pay for server licenses (i.e. Windows/SQL Server). Great for getting up and running but after that you must pay. (Correct me if i am wrong)
