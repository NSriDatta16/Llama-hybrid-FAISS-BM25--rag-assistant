The t-walk package implementing the t-walk algorithm allows you to define the support for your (log)likelihood function, if that is what you are after. Supp a function that takes a vector of length=dim and returns TRUE if the vector is within the support of the objective and FALSE otherwise. Supp is *always* called right before Obj. It also seems to be a pretty general sampling algorithm. From the package: The t-walk is a "A General Purpose Sampling Algorithm for Continuous Distributions" to sample from many objective functions (specially suited for posterior distributions using non-standard models that would make the use of common algorithms and software difficult); it is an MCMC that does not required tuning.
