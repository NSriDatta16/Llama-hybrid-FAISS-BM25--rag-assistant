Which Project Management Software is adequate for Software & Non-Software Projects?

PMS = (Project Management Software) I used trac for software development some time ago. Right now I'm searching for a new more powerful (scheduling, gantt charts, ...) free solution (as in free beer ;-) and free to install on my server) for my current software project. Besides the current software project, abstract project management features like issue-tracking & scheduling would be great for coordinating a group of volunteers for real-life projects as well. I would want one solution for both purposes, so that I have the hassle of installation, getting used to the system and administration only once. So I tried redmine but the problem is it seems to be designed for software projects only. I can't suggest such a solution for the volunteer-group if tickets/issues would have to be of type bug, feature, ... I shortlisted the following six PMS from the wikipedia comparison : Project.net Project-Open Redmine Trac Endeavour Software Project Management eGroupWare I guess they are all more or less fine for software development but would you consider any of these to be good for the non-software project as well? Cliff Notes: I would want a start page situation like in trac. The start-page is a wiki presenting the project and not the PMS. But you can log into the PMS from there. Feature-wish list : wiki, Issue tracking, revision control, scheduling & gantt charts, forums (least important) (Btw: I'm very aware that I can't expect everything to be perfect ;-) Do you know a suitable solution for software and real-life projects or a highly customizable PMS where I can easily remove sth. like "browse source"(trac) and rename things like ticket/issue-types "bug", "feature"? Any experience good/bad with the above mentioned six PMS? I would personally guess that "Redmine" and "Endeavour Software Project Management" are too focused on software projects.
