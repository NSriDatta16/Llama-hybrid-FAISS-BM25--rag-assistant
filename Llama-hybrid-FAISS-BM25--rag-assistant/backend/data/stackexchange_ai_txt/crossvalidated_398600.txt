Statistical tests to discriminate most important variables in populations

I have a dataset that looks like this : ID | group | feature1 | feature2 | .... 01 | 1 | 100 | cat | .... 02 | 1 | 104 | dog | .... 03 | 2 | 30 | horse | .... ..... I have around 10 variables (my features). I have 8 groups and 10 000 observations. My dependant variable is the variable "group". The variable group is an ordinal variable. All the other variables are independant. Some are "count of something", some are numerical some are categorical. (The example I gave is a fake representation). I want to know which features are significantly different between each group and which ones are the most important to describe each group. I don't want to do a PCA because I want to keep the variables themselves to explain each group. I can't take components of variables. I am trying to do an ordinal logistic regression. I get the results for the all population : I know if one variable has an impact on the variable "group" or not but I don't know between each group where the differences are significant. Does someone have an idea ? or give me a tip on the interpretation of the ordinal logistic regression. I started in Python the analysis but switched to R. So I am open to both options if you have librairies to give me. Thanks for your help and sharing your knowledge with me :)
