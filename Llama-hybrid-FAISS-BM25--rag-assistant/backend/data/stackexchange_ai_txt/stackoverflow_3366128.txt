Code Coverage report on unit tests for Windows CE code using TFS 2010

I have a unique combination of platforms in my solution that has stumped me. We need to generate code coverage statistics for unit tests that we're writing for our Windows CE code. We're using Visual Studio 2008 to write the CE code, of course, because VS 2010 doesn't support smart devices. Unfortunately, MSTest won't instrument CE assemblies for collecting coverage data, so we're compiling our test assembly as a regular Win32 library and using it to call the CE code we need to test. This is working fine on a desktop installation of Visual Studio, but we also need to incorporate this into our nightly build on the server. I have tried everything I can think of to get this to work. It's frustrating because I can manually do everything on my workstation, I just can't get TFS 2010 to do it for me automatically. Is anybody else writing unit tests for Windows CE code? I can't believe I'm the only one! Thanks in advance for whatever tips or tricks you might be able to offer...
