Pandas vs Linux Datascience

I joined a data science learning community in my college and we are using linux terminal commands and awk commands to practice gathering some information from big datasets stored in csv files. About 7140596 columns by 29 rows in a single file. A sample question would be: "What was the average arrival delay (in minutes) for flights in 2005?" where we have to sum the value of the delay for every row and divide by the total number or rows. I know that similar data manipulation can be done in Pandas in a Jupyter notebook and was wondering what are the advantages and disadvantages of each method. Thank you!
