I think auto-generating empty Javadoc is an anti-pattern and should be discouraged; it gives code the appearance of being documented, but just adds noise to the codebase. I would recommend instead that you configure your code editor to assist on a per-method and per-class basis to use when you actually write the javadoc (one commenter pointed to Eclipse's feature that does this).
