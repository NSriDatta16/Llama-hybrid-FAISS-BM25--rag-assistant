WPF Drag Drop - When Does DragLeave Fire?

I am getting DragLeave Events when dragging from a parent to child control. I would only expect to get this event when moving outside the bounds of a control. How can I implement this? Please refer to this simple sample application. Hilight and Drag this text If I drag text across the gray line, Stack.DragLeave will fire. I only expect to get this event when leaving the blue rectangle. Stack.DragLeave Count: and in the code behind Class MainWindow Private Sub Stack_DragLeave(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.Windows.DragEventArgs) Handles Stack.PreviewDragLeave countLabel.Content = countLabel.Content + 1 End Sub End Class
