How to deal with German "Umlaute" in an API request?

I am working with the API from the "Deutsche Bahn" for a small private data science project in R. However, cities with an "Umlaut" such as "Köln" or "München" etc. are cumbersome, since the request with the GET command, i.e., url_location yields entries like K ln Hbf which I cannot work with. Question: Is there any option in the GET command (which I could not find) or any alternative which is able to interpret these "Umlaute" appropriately? Or is there a way to substitute these strange " " parts afterwards?
