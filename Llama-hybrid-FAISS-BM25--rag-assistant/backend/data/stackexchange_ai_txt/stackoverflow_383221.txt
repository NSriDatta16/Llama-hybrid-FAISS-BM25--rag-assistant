It's the whole premature optimization thing. I think It's better to organise your code in a way that makes most sense to you, and then find a tool to combine the files for when you put the site live. There are a number of scripts out there that will do this for you. Having a large number of files per page will certainly knock performance. IE7- support two concurrent HTTP connections per server, IE8 increases this to 6 . I would imagine pipelining , as supported in HTTP 1.1, would mitigate the connection limit issue, but it is disabled by default in FF and IE, Opera has it enabled. The MS Ajax Control Toolkit actually has built-in script combining with the ToolkitScriptManager control. A good MSDN article , a tool for ASP.NET , and another .
