My employer uses ActiveState's PerlApp to produce executable versions of our apps with great success. We tested PAR and PerlApp before selecting our packaging method. At that time, PerlApp had faster load times. Several versions of each tool have come and gone since then, so I would recommend testing with each before selecting a tool. Executable packaging has been very effective for us. There are a few portability issues issues with Perl, but if you pay attention to perlport , it's easy to avoid most issues. Our biggest problems are always with Win32. From time to time, some simple thing will require stupid, bizarre work-arounds or digging into Win32 API for a platform specific hack. We have used both Wx and Tk guis. Frozen Bubble is a well known and widely available app you can look at.
