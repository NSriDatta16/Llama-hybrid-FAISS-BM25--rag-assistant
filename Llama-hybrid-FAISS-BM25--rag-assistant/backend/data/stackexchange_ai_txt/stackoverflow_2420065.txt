Your sample data are sorted. If this is guaranteed to be the case in reality, you should do as Andrey says, and use nested loops on the arrays themselves, breaking if/when you find an inequal pair of entries. If they're not guaranteed to be sorted, I'd dump each of them into a HashSet, and then you can use java's Set containsAll method. Edit: As Thomman pointed out, containsAll() ultimately relies on equals(). So in order to get the case-insensitive checking your question requests, you have two choices: 1) Upcase or downcase the strings on insertion into the sets. On consideration, I'm not crazy about this method, since not only will you lose duplicate entries, but you'll also fold entries differentiated by case. And so these lists would look to be equal to each other: String a [] = {"one","one","one", "Two"}; String b [] = {"One", Two"}; 2) The other choice is to put your strings into holder objects which override equals(), doing comparison in a case-insensitive way.
