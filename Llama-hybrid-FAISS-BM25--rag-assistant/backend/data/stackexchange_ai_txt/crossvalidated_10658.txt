Package Mclust is nice. The mclust function fits a mixture of normals distribution to data. You can automatically choose the number of components based on BIC ( mclustmodel ) or specify the number of components. There is also no need to convert your data into a data frame. Also, package Mixtools and the function normalmixEM fits a mixture of normals. Update: I recently discovered the mixAK package and the NMixMCMC function and it is terrific. It has many options, including RJMCMC for component selection, right left censoring, etc...
