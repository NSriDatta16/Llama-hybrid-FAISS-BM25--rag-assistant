predict if news article belong to specific category or not?

I am still new to machine learning. I am trying to build an ML model to predict if an article belongs to a category or not. for example, I have three categories : [war, politics, and crime]. I choose a category I want to check if the news article belongs to it or no and the model predicts if the article belongs to this category [yes/no] i think about two approaches : make three binary classifiers, a classifier for each category, predict [yes belong/no(not belong)] one classifier that predicts the category of the article. my questions: which approach is better for me ? (the one which gives the highest accuracy ?) how does the dataset of approach 1 look? maybe a file that includes two columns [article content, category] and category values be [1,0] (1 means yes belongs to this category) if I use approach two, How to handle the case That article does not belong to any of my categories. (should I check probabilities and set a threshold)
