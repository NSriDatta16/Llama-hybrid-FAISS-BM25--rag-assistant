InnoDB is a storage engine in MySQL . There are quite a few of them, and they all have their pros and cons. InnoDB's greatest strengths are: Support for transactions (giving you support for the ACID property). Row-level locking. Having a more fine grained locking-mechanism gives you higher concurrency compared to, for instance, MyISAM . Foreign key constraints. Allowing you to let the database ensure the integrity of the state of the database, and the relationships between tables.
