In a prototypical logistic regression model, the response variable is distributed as a Bernoulli . The parameter that controls the behavior of the Bernoulli distribution is $p$ , the probability of 'success'. So the model is trying to estimate a function that maps the covariate values to how $p$ changes. The binomial distribution generalizes the Bernoulli. Its behavior is governed by two parameters, $p$ and $n$ : The probability of 'success' and the number of Bernoulli trials, respectively. Logistic regression can be used with a binomial outcome just as with a Bernoulli. The number of trials is always given to the model in some form 1 , so it doesn't need to be estimated. That means that logistic regression with a binomial response is once again just trying to estimate a function that maps the covariate values to how $p$ changes. 1. For example, SAS requires that you provide the counts of events and trials, whereas R requires that you provide either the number of events and non-events, or the proportion of events and the number of events (cf., Difference in output between SAS's proc genmod and R's glm ).
