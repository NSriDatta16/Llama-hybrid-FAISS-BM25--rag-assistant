I would address this issue by encouraging you to change your approach since it looks like you're likely making more AJAX requests than necessary whenever more rows need to be added to the list (2+ instead of just 2). I would update include/ajaxActions.php?action=displayRow to accept a CSV of ids (or whatever it is you're passing in), and returning a set of row data, instead of data for just one row.
