The question is a bit unclear, but as far as I understand it you want, when given the list ("1 1 1" "dot" "2 2 2") as input to evaluate the expression (dot "1 1 1" "2 2 2") . In that case you can do this: (defun apply-infix (arg1 f arg2) (apply (intern (string-upcase f)) (list arg1 arg2))) (defun apply-list-infix (lst) (apply 'apply-infix lst)) (apply-list-infix '("1 1 1" "dot" "2 2 2"))
