Magento with Mailchimp -----adding checkboxes programmatically

I have just created a mailchimp account and I have one question. I'm quite new to mailchimp. In my customer dashboard (of magento) i want to create a list subscribe form. Now I have a list of checkboxes that i run using a for next loop. I want to put these checkboxes in my mailchimp form and according to what the customer choices, the mailchimp list is updated. Ex. I have various categories (Apparel, furniture etc) these are set up from Magento backend and they have to be dynamic. These checkboxes are set up in a table. In Mailchimp I want to create user lists or one list with a group containing sub categories, that are created by my Magento code. I was wondering if this is possible. Your help would be very much appreciated. Regards, Luke
