Its going to be all in what the team values in its documentation. I would suggest that documenting why/intent instead of how is important and this isn't always captured in self documenting code. get/set no these are obvious - but calculation, retrieval etc something of the why should be expressed. Also be aware of difference in your team if you are comming from different nationalities. Differences in diction can creap into the naming of methods: BisectionSearch BinarySearch BinaryChop These three methods contributed from developers trained on 3 different continents do the same thing. Only by reading the comments that described the algorithm were we able to identify the duplication in our library.
