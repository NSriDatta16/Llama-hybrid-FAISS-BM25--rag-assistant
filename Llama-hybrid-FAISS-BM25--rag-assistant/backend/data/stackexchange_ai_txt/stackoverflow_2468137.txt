Good tests double the time it takes to finish. If the management team dings you for taking longer, well then, this is where the metal hits the meat in real life projects, isn't it? I find TDD to be a zealot's practice, wastes time making tests fail, the compilation errors, refactoring tests and code to death, and the like. In the end, as long as you get good test coverage of the code you can save time by creating unit tests immediately after the feature compiles and starts to work.
