The questions you are posing may need quite long answers. I will try to summarize my opinions. 1. Your question concerns causality. That is really a deep concept to use in data analysis. Keep in mind that empirically observed covariation is a necessary but not sufficient condition for causality (The Cognitive Style of PowerPoint, of Edward Tufte). That being said, in order to ask causal question we should first define causality. A standard approach relies on the potential outcomes model (Neyman, 1923; Rubin, 1974), where we observe outcomes $Y$ , and some treatment $X$ which is suspected to affecting $Y$ . For simplicity, let us assume $X \in {0, 1}$ . Then, we postulate the existence of counterfactuals $Y(X = 0)$ and $Y(X = 1)$ , which denote the outcomes a given unit would experience under the possible values of $X$ . The causal effect of $X$ on $Y$ is then defined as $\tau = Y(X = 1) - Y(X = 0)$ . Without this framework (or alternative models that define some concept of causality), we would just observe correlations among variables. The difference is that if $X$ and $Y$ are simply correlated, then nothing can be done to affect $Y$ through $X$ , while if $X$ actually causes $Y$ , then we could exogenously vary $X$ so to modify $Y$ . So, to answer your question, you should implement any estimator tailored for causality. I suggest to have a look at the book of Imbens and Rubin (2015), which really is a bible for causal analysis. 2. This is a nice question. Such unobserved factors really invalidate causal analysis when they are correlated with either $X$ or $Y$ . If this holds, then we risk to attribute to $X$ some causal effect on $Y$ (as defined above) which is actually due to such unobserved factors (called confounders). What we should do is to include these variables in the analysis, so to control for their influence. The main issue is that they are often unobservable. 3. I do not think that prediction may help you understanding how much $X$ causes $Y$ - only about how much they are correlated, for the reasons described above. Anyway, this question seems to shift the focus from causality to prediction. For that, you could apply any machine learning predictor yielding a satisfying test error, thus using the estimated function to predict future outcomes by plugging $X$ values - formally, we estimate $\hat{Y} = \hat{f} ( \cdot )$ , and we predict a future outcome at time $t + h$ as $Y_{t + h} = \hat{f} ( X_{h + t} )$ , where $\hat{f} ( \cdot )$ has been estimated using $X_1, \dots, X_t$ .
