ASP.NET HttpApplication local storage

I need some HttpApplication local storage. I thought the ApplicationState was the place for this, but apparently this may be shared across HttpApplication instances in an Appdomain. public class MyHttpModule : IHttpModule { private object initializingLock = new object(); private static HttpApplication last; public void Init(HttpApplication context) { lock (initializingLock) { // always is false, as expected if (last == context) { } // is true for 2nd HttpApplication in AppDomain! if (last != null && last.Application == context.Application) { } last = context; } } } What's the best blace to use to store some data that's per HttpApplication that other stuff can access?
