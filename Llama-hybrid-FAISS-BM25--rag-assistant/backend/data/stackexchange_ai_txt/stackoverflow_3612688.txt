Best practice for organizing SQL queries in code?

I have a bunch of beautiful OOP code but the functions have these monstrously huge SQL queries. In 2010, should we really still be writing our queries in-line or is there an abstraction, like MVC, for SQL queries in PHP? Thank you for your insights. Edit: I probably should have mentioned this here. But as a professional PHP engineer, you wouldn't believe how often I've come across ORMs done horribly and (even worse!) ORMs programmed correctly that perform absolutely terribly (esp. on many-to-many and many join queries). I'm very negatively biased towards ORMs, with the exception of a few simple ORMs, like Kohana . I guess what I was looking for was a generic Dynamic SQL design pattern.
