The first approach is classical and trustworthy but can not always be used. To get bootstrap samples assuming the null hypothesis you must either be willing to assume a theoretical distribution to hold ( this is your first option ) or to assume that your statistic of interest has the same distributionally shape when shifted to the null hypothesis ( your second option ). For example, under the usual assumption the t-distribution has the same shape when shifted to another mean. However, when changing the null frequency of 0.5 of a binomial distribution to 0.025 will also change the shape. In my experience, otherwise in the case that you are willing to make these assumptions you often also have other options. In your example 1) where you seem to assume that both samples could have come from the same base population a permutation test would be better in my opinion. There is another option (which you seems to be your 2nd choice) which is based on bootstrap confidence intervals. Basically, this assumes that if your stated coverage holds that significance at a level of $\alpha$ is equivalent to the null hypothesis not being included in the $(1-\alpha)$-confidence interval. See for example, this question: What is the difference between confidence intervals and hypothesis testing? This is a very flexible method and applicable for many tests. However, it is very critical to construct good bootstrap confidence intervals and not simply to use Wald-approximations or the percentile method.
