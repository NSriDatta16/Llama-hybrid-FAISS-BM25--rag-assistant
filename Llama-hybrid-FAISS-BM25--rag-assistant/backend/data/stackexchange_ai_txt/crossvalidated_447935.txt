The question is very vague, so I expect they want to see your view on it, how you would solve it. Without more information there are many ways in which you could do this. One example would be using a logistic regression model, which would not only "classify" the players into churned or not churned, but would also give you the odds of a player doing so, given the time passed. Another example would be to fit a distribution to the data - time passed, say Weibull distribution, finding the parameters which best fit the data, and then selecting a quantile as your threshold of churned / not churned.
