It is not related with partial correlation, but something you can do to measure the effect a variable has on the outcome of logistic regressions is the Odds Ratio statistic. It can be interpreted as follow: for a one-unit increase in your continuous predictor variable, the odds of the dependent variable being positive (=1) increase by factor x . If you have a OR of 1.5 if means that a one unit increase in the continuous variable leads to a 50% increase in the odds of the event. The odds ratio of each variable can be obtained by the exponentiation of the trained model coefficients.
