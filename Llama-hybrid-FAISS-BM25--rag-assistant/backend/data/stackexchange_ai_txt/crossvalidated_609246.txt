AIC for ARIMA model

While studying univariate time series analysis, I got curious about how I can apply the AIC metric to determine the appropriate order for an ARIMA model. As far as I've investigated, in many texts ARIMA models assume the error terms to be white noise, not Gaussian white noise, which means that there is no distributional assumption on the error terms. Then, how can we define AIC properly for such ARIMA models? Or is it implicitly assumed to be normal?
