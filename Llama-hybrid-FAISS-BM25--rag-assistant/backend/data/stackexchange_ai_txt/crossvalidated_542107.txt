So as you point out in your question, individuals interested in only predictions are often not interested in verifying assumptions of their models. Another way to put this is that they are not interested in looking at (or computing, for that matter) standard errors corresponding to the coefficients they estimated for prediction. Standard errors are what allow an analyst to go beyond interpreting the coefficient itself and make inferences. Large coefficients and small standard errors signify confidence that a true (population) effect exists. Small coefficients accompanied by large standard errors suggest no true effect in the population. See the link below for a more detailed conversation on standard errors and logistic regression.
