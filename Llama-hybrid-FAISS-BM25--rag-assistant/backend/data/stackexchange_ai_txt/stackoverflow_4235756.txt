How can I deploy an Android application internally in an organization?

I would like to deploy an Android application internally in an organization. For the moment while developing the application, I have used e-mail to spread my application. Then the user has to install the Android SDK, install a driver for his phone and finally run the adb install MyApplication.apk to install the application. Is there any better ways to deploy Android applications internally? Is it even possible to manage updates? I read on a forum that applications can be deployed on a webserver. Then the user only has to download the application for installing. But when I tried to simply upload an .apk file to my webserver and visit the URL using the browser on my phone I got this message: mydomain.com Cannot download. The content is not supported on the phone. So how can I fix this? Is there any kind of MIME-type I have to set on the webserver? Doing the same thing as described in the link above on http://slideme.org/sam2.apk works fine, and the installation starts. The only thing I can find about this on Android Developers Publishing Your Applications is: You can publish your application using a hosted service such as Android Market or through a web server.
