since I assume your central storage is also SQL 2005, have you considered using what SQL Server 2005 offers out of the box to achieve your requirements? Rather than pool every 5 seconds, marshal and unmarshal TCP/IP, implement authentication and authorization for the TCP/IP pipe, scale TCP transmission with boxcaring, manage message acknowledgments and retries, deal with central site availability, fragment large messages, implement fairness in transmission and so on and so forth, why not simply use Service Broker ? It does all you need and more, out of the box, already tested, already tuned for performance and scalability. Getting reliable messaging right is not trivial and you should focus your efforts in meeting your business specifics, not reiventing the wheel.
