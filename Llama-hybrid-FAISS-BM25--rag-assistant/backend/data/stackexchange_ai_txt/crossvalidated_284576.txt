This is not my area, but something like logistic regression may work well, providing interpretable coefficients. (For more than 2 subsets, there is multi-class logistic regression .) I believe there are tricks in R to specify the various interaction terms . However including all of these is probably ill advised, in terms of model over-fitting and interpretability. You could start with no interactions, then explore incrementally adding 2-way ... k-way interactions.
