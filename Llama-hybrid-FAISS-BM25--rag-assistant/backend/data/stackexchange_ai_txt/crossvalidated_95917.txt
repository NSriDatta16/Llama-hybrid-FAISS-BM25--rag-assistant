One additional strength is that you can use MDS to analyze data for which you don't know the important variables or dimensions. The standard procedure for this would be: 1) have participants rank, sort, or directly identify similarity between objects; 2) convert the responses into dissimilarity matrix; 3) apply MDS and, ideally, find a 2 or 3D model; 4) develop hypotheses about the dimensions structuring the map. My personal opinion is that there are other dimension reduction tools that are usually better suited for that goal, but that what MDS provides is the opportunity to develop theories about the dimensions that are being used to organize judgments. It's important to also keep in mind the degree of stress (distortion that results from the dimension reduction) and incorporate that into your thinking. I think one of the best books out on MDS is "Applied Multidimensional Scaling" by Borg, Groenen, & Mair (2013).
