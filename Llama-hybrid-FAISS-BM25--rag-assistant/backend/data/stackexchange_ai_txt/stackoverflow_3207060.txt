Mailto body, special characters?

I'm trying to have a mailto: body with multiple paragraphs and a URL. I should probably note this is for a mobile web application. Is there a reason why I can't use \n (even inside JavaScript strings) for new lines? Instead, I'm using %0D%0A. I'd like to enclose my URL in <>'s so email clients can properly identify it as a URL, but when I try to do that the entire URL doesn't show up at all in the body. Is it being escaped, or something? How do I fix this/use <>'s to wrap it? Thanks!
