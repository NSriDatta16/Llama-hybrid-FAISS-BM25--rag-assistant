You have circular imports in your code: the same module is both required by and requires the use of a certain other module, which when you think of it like that, it clearly precarious. Most of the problems can be cleared up by using import a and later referring to a.b instead of from a import b or from a import * . In particular, never use from a import * . Wildcard imports clutter your namespace and makes your code less maintainable, readable, sane, and predictable. The difference between import a and from a import * is the difference between dragging a box into a room and pouring its contents all over the floor. It would be better if you could move shared code off to its own module or somehow refactor out the need for a circular import. Circular imports always indicate a design problem.
