What you have is a circular import: builder imports component, component imports builder. At the time builder imports component, builder is not yet fully constructed. Then component imports builder, which executes the rest of builder module (all after import component ). Later, when component is loaded, builder continues again with everything after import component . Note that the behaviour would be different if component was loaded first! Basically, you should not do circular imports. Try to organise the code in some other way.
