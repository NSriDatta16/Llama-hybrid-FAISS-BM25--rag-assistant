Secure password storage for a launchd daemon

In a normal Cocoa application it's typical to store any saved passwords in the Keychain and thus avoid many pitfalls. Now I'm writing a launchd daemon that needs to store a password and will run before any user has logged in. This means I cannot use the keychain like I normally do. I see in Keychain Access there is a "system" keychain, but I have been unable to find any documentation whatsoever on how to use it (or if this is the correct use for it). What is the best practice for storing passwords used by launchd daemons?
