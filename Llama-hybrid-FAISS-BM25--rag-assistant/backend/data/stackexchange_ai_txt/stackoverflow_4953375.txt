Found the problem: WordPress had churned out invalid HTML. When I went to validate CSS and HTML, the CSS checked out clean, but the HTML was full of surprises. I didn't realize until I went to page source in the browser and saw that WordPress had put in a lot of paragraph tags and other tags, some list tags, which I certainly had not entered into the Page editor. Anyway, the HTML validator pointed out a paragraph end tag just inside the box-container div. It had no business being there - there wasn't even a beginning paragraph tag. So I went back to the Page editor, eliminated all spaces between my HTML, and updated the Page. YAY! It's working just as it should. Lesson learned: don't trust WordPress HTML editor without validation. Many thanks to those who have replied. Especially helpful was the link to http://jsfiddle.net , very useful tool and reassured me that my CSS was correct.
