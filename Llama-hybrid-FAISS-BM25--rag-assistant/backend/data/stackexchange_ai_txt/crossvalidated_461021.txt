I'll go in a somewhat different direction and say that it depends... Of course any sampling is based on the notion that the sampling is truly random. Trying to account for non-randomness in the sample tremendously complicates the situation. This type of yes/no measurement is non-parametric. Such tests need a larger sample size than if the measurement was parametric. Presumably you're ignoring the problem of false positives and false negatives in the testing. False positives could be a real problem is the disease fraction is low. What is the actual fraction of the diseased? If only 0.1% of the population is diseased then on average one 1 in a 1000 tests would be positive. So the lower the infection rate, the larger the sample would need to be. How precise an estimate do you want? In other words do you want to know the infection rate +/- 20%, or to say +/- 1%. The more precise you want to know the value of the infection rate the larger the sample would need to be. There is a type of statistical testing called Acceptance Testing which can be used. Basically the important decision is how precise do you want the measurement to be? Then you keep sampling until that level of precision is achieved. So if 50% of the population is infected then a relatively small sample is needed to get to +/- 10% error in the measurement itself (e.g 50% +/- 5%). However if only 0.5% of the population is infected then a much larger sample is needed to determine that the disease level (e.g. 0.5% +/- 0.05%).
