VC2010 C++ - organizing source files

I had some questions about how to organize source files in a VC 2010 C++ project. The default filters that are included won't be sufficient as ultimately, I'm going to have a lot of .cpp and .hpp files so it's going ot be messy. I'd like to create a folder at the root of the project called "source" then create folders inside "source" for the various source file categories I'd like to use. When I right click the solution, I only get the option to add a filter, not a folder. I can create folders manually in windows explorer, then include them, but Then I lose my ability to add filters. Is there a way to add new folders (without using windows explorer) and still use filters? Additionally, is there something similar to $(CURDIR) that I could use to include the source file folder without needing an absolute path?
