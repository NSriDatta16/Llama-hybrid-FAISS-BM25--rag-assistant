more insights about Word2Vec implementation

As we know Word2Vec is non-contextual embedding (at word level). As per my knowledge, BOW is statistical embedding technique (word level). we can perform Word2Vec embedding in two approaches: 1. CBOW. 2. Skip-gram analysis am confused with BoW and CBoW as both methods output is numerical/continuous vector. then what is difference between these two? and can you please share the more insights about CBoW and Skip-gram architecture/implementation?
