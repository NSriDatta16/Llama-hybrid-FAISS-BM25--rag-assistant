Sorting and cleaning this dataset from overlapping periods is a task you can do with plain python, perhaps a bit more comfortable if you use pandas. Machine learning would be an additional overkill, it adds more complexity and is of no help for that task. Although I understand you are looking for a learning project, I do not recommend to use this one, and rather recommend to pick a task that is more often solved with machine learning.
