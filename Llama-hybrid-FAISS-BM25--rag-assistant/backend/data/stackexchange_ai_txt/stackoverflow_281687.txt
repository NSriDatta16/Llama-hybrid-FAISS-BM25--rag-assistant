aogan: The idea here is to leverage the flexibility of WPF databinding. I could set the entire UI in the code behind, but MS has developed this binding system and i wanted to easily take advantage of it. Also, this was a simple example for a more complicated problem. To everyone else involved, i've gone with PITAdev's solution. Thanks for the help.
