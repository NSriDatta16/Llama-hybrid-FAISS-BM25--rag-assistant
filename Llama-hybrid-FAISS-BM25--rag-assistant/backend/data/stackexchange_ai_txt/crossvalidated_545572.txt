if for any theoretical reasons your values can only range between a known minimum (0 in your case) and a known maximum (40 in your case or another value, say 100) you can rescale them to be between 0 and 1 and use fractional logistic regression. If there is no mass at 0 and 1 the beta function (beta regression) could also be a choice. I hope it helps Gio
