IMHO, I think you should just make the move to MVC. Here are a few reasons that I am making the transition: I like to be able to control my HTML output. [There are certain web controls that render different tags based on the browser. Additionally, it is nice to have control of the Client ID.] I like to be able to manage the state of my aplications. [As opposed to having WebForms try to manage it for me, passing larger chunks of data around than are strictly necessary.] I prefer to work in a test driven manner and I've found that I can get better test coverage with MVC. I've found that libraries like JQuery work incredibly well with MVC; I've found that making UI elements that were a pain in WebForms have become trivial in MVC. So, getting back to your question... can you build WebForms apps that utilize many of the lessons of MVC. Sure, and if you are going to build WebForms apps I'd recommend it as a good practice. Can you apply frameworks to make it more like MVC. Sure, but why would you want to when you can just use MVC?
