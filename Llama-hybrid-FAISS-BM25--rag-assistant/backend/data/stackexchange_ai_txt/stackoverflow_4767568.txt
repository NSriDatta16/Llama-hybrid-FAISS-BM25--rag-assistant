Do you really have this: $src If yes, you should do this instead: I can't understand where are you writing this. If it's the body of a node, you should be able to view the image if the content type has PHP mode enabled. But where does $src come from? It is a placeholder you wrote just here? I think I'm can't get something of your question. Anyway, hope this helps. â€”Alberto
