Best practice - How to implement an user authentication layer with multiple services?

I'm developing a website with Codeigniter that's probably going to relate and connect with multiple services and frameworks: Magento for e-commerce Wordpress for Blogging Maybe Buddypress for more social features Mailchimp for Newsletter delivery I shouldn't forget about Facebook Connect, I guess... Maybe it's a messy approach but I try to avoid inventing the wheel. And prefer to use the best software for the task. The thing is I will need an authentication layer to share an user object between all the services. My goal is to have a single register form that will grant you access to all services (shopping, blogging, subscribing to the newsletter). I'm thinking I should have my own user database and a global authentication system (is there something open-source?). Then, users on the services are created behind the scenes. Any ideas on how to approach this task?
