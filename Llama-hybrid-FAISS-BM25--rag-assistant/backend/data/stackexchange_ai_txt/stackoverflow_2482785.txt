Memory footprint of a parsed XML file in Classic ASP?

Anyone know of a way to find out the amount of memory/size of a XMLDocument once it has parsed a XML file? I've been doing "beer mat" calculations so far but have been asked to come up with some more legit numbers through monitoring some how. I need to create about 1500 XML files (via FreeThreadedXMl-DOM object), which verge between 3-9K in size and store them in Application vars but our SysAdmin is worried about us gobbling up too much memory. Other than the crude method of booting up a fresh IIS instance and then loading everything in and monitoring before and after memory usage in Task Manager I can't think of a way of doing it with a bit more accuracy. Update: Tried the crude method and it works really well. Loaded up 300 parsed xml docs into the application space and it gobbled them up really well. Multiplying that up to the 1500 odd files and it will barely push 60Mb of Memory for data storage. Perfect :)
