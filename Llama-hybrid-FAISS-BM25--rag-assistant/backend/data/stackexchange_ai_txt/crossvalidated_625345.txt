Discussion of aggregate effects is common in population health studies Most academic research on human behaviour aims to be useful to inform decision-making. This can occur at different levels of influence, from informing the decisions of individuals in how they act in their own personal lives, to informing the decisions of policy-makers, regulators, professionals, etc. A study on the effects of smoking on pregnancy could potentially inform the behaviour of pregnant mothers, but it could also potentially inform the behaviour of doctors, medical boards, public health bodies, cigarette-advertising regulators, corporate executives, politicians, etc. The latter are typically concerned with the aggregate effects of a behaviour on a larger segment of society than a single individual. One reason that researchers choose to frame their results in the way illustrated by Researcher A is that they wish to couch the issue in social terms and thereby appeal to people who can influence large-scale behaviour in their society, not just individual mothers who get to choose whether or not to smoke during pregnancy. This type of framing feeds naturally into policy questions that are informed by consideration of the aggregated effects of behavioural change in a whole society or a large segment of society. An individual mother might find the statement by Researcher B more useful, but a person working in population health research or policy is likely to find the statement by Researcher A more useful. Now ask yourself, who is most likely to pay attention to an academic study on smoking and pregnancy (or derivative works that incorporate this information)? An individual woman-on-the-street who smokes and falls pregnant, or a medical board? An individual woman-on-the-street who smokes and falls pregnant, or a public health body that gives advice on cigarette regulation? Etc. From a mathematical perspective, the statement by Researcher B is giving the inferred causal effect on an individual and the statement by Researcher A is then extrapolating this to a "large population" via the law of large numbers. The first is giving you a counterfactual statement based on smoking or not smoking for a single person and the latter is giving you a counterfactual statement for smoking or not smoking for a large group of people ("everybody vs nobody"). The latter is approximately correct so long as the population in question is large (as is the case for the population of Germany) and the individual effects can be considered to be either independent or close to independent. (Here I set aside the question of adequacy of the model, discussed in the other answer here.) Either of these methods of presentation capture an important aspect of the inferred causal effect, but one frames this as an individual effect and the other frames it as an aggregated effect in a larger society. Both will have their uses, but the latter is typically more useful in communicating with certain influential classes of people who have the power to influence behavioural-change at a social level.
