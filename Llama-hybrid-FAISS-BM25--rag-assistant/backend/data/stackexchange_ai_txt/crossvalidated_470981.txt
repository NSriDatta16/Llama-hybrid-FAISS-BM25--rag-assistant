Combining together 7 correlated normalized scores into one final score

I am currently analyzing drivers behaviour. To this, for each driver ID, I calculated some scores, as you can see in the correlation matrix below: All the scores are normalized, with 0 -> very good, 1 -> very bad. I want to assign to each driver some sort of number saying if he's a bad driver or a good driver. At first, I tried clustering based on the scores, but the result has been lackluster. (Also using PCA beforehand) Then, I want to define a function: $$ f : Scores -> Score_{final} $$ At first, I thought the final score could be the sum of each score. However, this would be equivalent to doing a linear combination with all scores weighting the same, moreover I am not taking into account the correlation between scores, thus leading to poor results. Does someone have any idea on how I could handle this? EDIT: Adding data as requested: Here I have a plot of the distribution of the scores: While here I have the cumulative distribution of variance explained by PCA, which leads me to believe that it is not useful: By the way, I have tried many different clustering techniques: KNN, DBSCAN and affinity propagation, all leading to a silhouette score of about 0.28
