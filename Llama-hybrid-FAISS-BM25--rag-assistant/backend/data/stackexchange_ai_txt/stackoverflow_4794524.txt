AJAX with Facebook Authentication

I have built an completely AJAX based application which has no page refresh and load everything using AJAX. Now I want to embed facebook authentication in a way it won't redirect the user to make page refresh. Currently the facebook works this way: User is being redirected to Facebook by clicking Facebook Connect button https://graph.facebook.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=xxxxxxxxxxxxxx&redirect_uri=http://www.xxxxxxxxxx.com/JoinFB.html?&type=user_agent&display=popup&scope=offline_access,publish_stream,sms,email,user_birthday,user_photos,user_photo_video_tags,user_checkins,friends_checkins It will after user action whether "Allow" or "Disallow" redirect to http://www.xxxxxxxxxx.com/JoinFB.html and I can then use Javascript to read user information. The problem is that can I overcome this page redirection process somehow using IFRAME or anything? How will I detect IFRAME as user allowed or not?
