No, there is no more efficient way to calc the dist. Any treatment with special cases p.x==q.x etc. will be slower on average. Yes, the fastest way to see if p and q are the same points is just comparing x, y, z. Since they are float, you should not check == but allow for some finite, small difference which you define.
