If you call session_start(), then a session will be created if the client isn't in an existing one. If the client doesn't support (or is configured to ignore) the cookies or querystring mechanism used to maintain the session, a new session will be created on every request. This may bloat your session storage mechanism with unused sessions. It might be a better idea to only call session_start() when you have something to store in the session (e.g. user login, or something else that robots aren't likely to do), if you feel this is likely to be a problem.
