First letter in the alphabet sucks (sorry) as discriminator. You do not neet to split them actually (you could just ask for "where name like 'a%'), but whatever you run for that gives you on average a 1/26 or so split of the names. Not extremely efficient. What do you mean with "creating a link - using a different field in the Database" - this sounds like a bad design to me.
