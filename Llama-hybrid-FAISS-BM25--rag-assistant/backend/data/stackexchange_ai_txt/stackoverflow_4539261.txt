Comparing multiple different dates and getting the average in PHP

I use a function called count_days($date1,$date2) that counts the number of days between two dates. But, my question is: the dates come from the DB, in an array like: Array ( [imac] => Array ( [0] => 2002-10-10 [1] => 2003-11-22 [3] => 2004-11-10 ) [iphone] => Array ( [0] => 2007-09-11 [1] => 2008-05-12 [2] => 2009-06-14 [3] => 2010-06-05 ) ) As you can see the products may have a different number of subarrays. I want to count the days between the first and the next date (and so on!) and then get the average of days.
