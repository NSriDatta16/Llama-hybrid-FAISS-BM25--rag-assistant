Use historical data to build surface with limited number of points

Lets say I have historical surfaces of data which vary slightly during time, but keeps similiar dynamics. I would like to use these historical data sets to estimate todays surface (given a limited number of points) using the dynamics of historical surfaces. Does anyone have an id√© to approach this? Have looked into PCA but can't establish a method that can be used. To clearify: 1. I have data of implied volatility surfaces during time. 2. I want to use these surfaces and calculate a new surface of returns. i.e the day to day difference for each volatility point. 3. However, i just want to use a limited number of points to build up the new "return" surface. I have historical return surfaces with similar dynamics which can be of help.
