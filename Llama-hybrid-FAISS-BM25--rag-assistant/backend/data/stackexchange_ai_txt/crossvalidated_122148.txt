What do the dip test output parameters mean?

This may sound like a silly question, but I'm not a statistician, mathematician, or programmer, really. I did quite a bit of googling, including looking into Stack Exchange, but couldn't find a clear answer. I have three plots and do the corresponding dip tests in R. > dip.test(x$V1, simulate.p.value = FALSE, B = 2000) Hartigans' dip test for unimodality data: x$V1 D = 0.0035, p-value = 0.9142 alternative hypothesis: non-unimodal, i.e., at least bimodal > dip.test(x$V4, simulate.p.value = FALSE, B = 2000) Hartigans' dip test for unimodality data: x$V4 D = 0.0046, p-value = 0.4947 alternative hypothesis: non-unimodal, i.e., at least bimodal > dip.test(x$V6, simulate.p.value = FALSE, B = 2000) Hartigans' dip test for unimodality data: x$V6 D = 0.0043, p-value = 0.6293 alternative hypothesis: non-unimodal, i.e., at least bimodal What do D and P mean? The density distribution of V6 (last image) looks the "most" bimodal of all, but has intermediate D and P values. I have to write a script and have to test for bimodality. How would you advise me to discern between bimodal and unimodal distributions?
