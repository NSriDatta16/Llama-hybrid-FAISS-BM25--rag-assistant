It's one of her many combinations that does not make a lot of sense when you bother to try to understand the methods. SVD tried to generate a projection where there is some kind of linearity in the factors. KernelPCA is used when you know non-linear relationships exist in your data. It's generally a bad idea to just stack method on method that you don't know well. It is, unfortunately, easier to get a good looking but wrong result than an okay looking sound result. You should rather spend that time to better understand your data, your problem, and the theory of the methods, to identify how to align these three. In the end, don't aim for a result, but for an explanation .
