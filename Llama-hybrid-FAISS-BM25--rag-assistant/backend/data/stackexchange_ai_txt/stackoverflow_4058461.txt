I've been struggling to get a dictionary version working, so here's the array version for you to extrapolate from: def sortkey(x): try: return (1, int(x)) except: return (0, x) sorted(get, key=sortkey) The basic principle is to create a tuple who's first element has the effect of grouping all strings together then all ints. Unfortunately, there's no elegant way to confirm whether a string happens to be an int without using exceptions, which doesn't go so well inside a lambda. My original solution used a regex, but since moving from a lambda to a stand-alone function, I figured I might as well go for the simple option.
