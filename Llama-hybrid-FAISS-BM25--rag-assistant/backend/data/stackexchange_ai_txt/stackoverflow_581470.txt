The use of undefined variables in if-statements

This snippet results in a JavaScript runtime error: ( foo is not defined) if (foo) { // ... } I have to define foo first, like so: var foo = foo || null // or undefined, 0, etc. ... And only then can I do: if (foo) { // ... } Why is that? Update: This was somewhat of a brainfart on my side of things: 'fcourse you can't access a variable which is not allocated. Fun stuff that you can do a typeof() on an undefined variable thou. I'm gonna accept miccet 's answer since I think it's the most elegant solution.
