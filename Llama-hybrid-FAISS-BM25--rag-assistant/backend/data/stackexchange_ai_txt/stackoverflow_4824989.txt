Take those data objects and build a separate Lucene index over them, storing the fields you need. Using your Person example, every Lucene document would be [Id, FirstName, LastName]. A search on this index would return the Id required to query your database for the complete data object. The actual indexing is easy, you just need to retrieve a list of data objects, iterate them, generate Lucene documents, and store them using an IndexWriter. You could work against either a filesystem directory for persistent storage, or a in-memory storage.
