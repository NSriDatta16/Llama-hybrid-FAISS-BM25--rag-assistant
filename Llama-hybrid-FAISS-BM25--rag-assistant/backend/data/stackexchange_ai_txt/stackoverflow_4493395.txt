This is what happens when you copy a folder with a .svn folder in it with windows explorer. Since they have the same information in .svn , they point to the same location on the server even if the local folders have different names. To keep TortoiseSVN informed of such copies so that it can do the correct thing, you should always do move/copy/rename operations with the TortoiseSVN context menu or by right-click dragging and selecting a TortoiseSVN action. In the next major release of SVN (1.7), the metadata will be centralized in one big .svn folder at the root of your working copy. Hopefully that will reduce the opportunity to mess up working copies with copy/move/rename operations in windows explorer.
