2060 Illegal instruction (core dumped) when importing Tensorflow in Python 3.8.18

I am attempting to run the experiments found here: https://github.com/risingfbk/p4ddle/tree/main/p4-ddos/p4ddle However when I run the line: ./experiment_**.sh I get this error: (python38) p4@p4:~/Desktop/p4ddle/p4-ddos/p4ddle/control-plane $ ./experiment_**.sh start lucid with the trace dns, with sampling at 1 packet over 1 Obtaining JSON from switch... Done Control utility for runtime P4 table manipulation RuntimeCmd: RuntimeCmd: here ./experiment_00.sh: line 28: 2060 Illegal instruction (core dumped) python3 lucid_cnn.py --predict_live localhost:22222 --model $ model --dataset_type $dataset_type The program fails at runtime, as it fails to compile lucid.cnn , the failure line being the import tensorflow as tf line. import json import csv print("here") import tensorflow as tf print("here") I have looked for a solution and found: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49092527/illegal-instructioncore-dumped-tensorflow which tells me to downgrade to Tensorflow version 1.5. This is not possible for me as I am using Python 3.8.18 , and the earliest version of tensorflow compatable is 2.20. Using this version also results in the same error. I think perhaps it may be a hardware issue? I am using a virtual box vm to run this in. The outputs for lscpu and sudo lshw -C display are shown below: Architecture: x86_64 CPU op-mode(s): 32-bit, 64-bit Byte Order: Little Endian Address sizes: 39 bits physical, 48 bits virtual CPU(s): 2 On-line CPU(s) list: 0,1 Thread(s) per core: 1 Core(s) per socket: 2 Socket(s): 1 NUMA node(s): 1 Vendor ID: GenuineIntel CPU family: 6 Model: 140 Model name: 11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-1165G7 @ 2.80GHz Stepping: 1 CPU MHz: 2803.210 BogoMIPS: 5606.42 Hypervisor vendor: KVM Virtualization type: full L1d cache: 96 KiB L1i cache: 64 KiB L2 cache: 2.5 MiB L3 cache: 24 MiB NUMA node0 CPU(s): 0,1 Vulnerability Itlb multihit: Not affected Vulnerability L1tf: Not affected Vulnerability Mds: Not affected Vulnerability Meltdown: Not affected Vulnerability Spec store bypass: Vulnerable Vulnerability Spectre v1: Mitigation; usercopy/swapgs barriers and __user pointer sanitization Vulnerability Spectre v2: Mitigation; Enhanced IBRS, RSB filling Vulnerability Srbds: Not affected Vulnerability Tsx async abort: Not affected Flags: fpu vme de pse tsc msr pae mce cx8 apic sep mtrr pge mca cmov pat pse36 clflush mmx fxsr sse sse2 ht syscall nx rdtscp lm constant_tsc rep_good nopl xtopology nonstop_tsc cpuid tsc_known_freq pni pclmulqdq ssse3 cx16 pcid ss e4_1 sse4_2 movbe popcnt aes rdrand hypervisor lahf_lm abm 3dnowprefetch invpcid_single ibrs_enhanced fsgsbase b mi1 bmi2 invpcid rdseed clflushopt md_clear flush_l1d arch_capabilities *-display description: VGA compatible controller product: VirtualBox Graphics Adapter vendor: InnoTek Systemberatung GmbH physical id: 2 bus info: pci@0000:00:02.0 version: 00 width: 32 bits clock: 33MHz capabilities: vga_controller rom configuration: driver=vboxvideo latency=0 resources: irq:10 memory:e0000000-e1ffffff memory:c0000-dffff Any help appreciated.
