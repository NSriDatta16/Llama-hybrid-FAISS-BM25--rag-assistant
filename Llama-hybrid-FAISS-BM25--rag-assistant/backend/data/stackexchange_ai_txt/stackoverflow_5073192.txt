Drag object with touchesMoved along offset vector / delta?

In the touchesMoved method, what is the math to have an object on the screen move along a dragging touch vector? For instance, if I touch beneath my object (Y > object.y), and drag "up", I want the object to move from its current x,y location along the same vector that my finger moves. Currently I have it working that the drag motion snaps my object to my finger's location, but sometimes my finger hits the edge of the screen before I get my object positioned correctly. If I know my "touch down location" and the "current touch location" what is the math to determine where to move object.position ?
