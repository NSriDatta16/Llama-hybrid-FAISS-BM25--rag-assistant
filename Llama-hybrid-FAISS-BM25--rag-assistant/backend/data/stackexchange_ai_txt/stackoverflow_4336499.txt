Panning and zooming over a large image just like in Bing Map control

I am looking for a solution where I am able to do all the gestures (flick, pinch, drag) with a local picture in my Windows Phone 7 application with acceptable performance. The Silverlight Bing Map control for WP7 does all of this perfectly, but it cannot do this with a local image . I started to write my own control, but I was wondering if there is anything out there written by someone else. Is there anything out there? Is it possible to reuse the Map control, but with my own image?
