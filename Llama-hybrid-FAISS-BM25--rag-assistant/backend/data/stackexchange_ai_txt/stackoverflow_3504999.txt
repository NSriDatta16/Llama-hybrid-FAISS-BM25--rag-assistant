How come this works and doesn't work in IRB?

I have Users . Users have_many :organizations If I do: User.find(:all).select {|u| u.organizations.first.name } it returns with: NoMethodError: You have a nil object when you didn't expect it! The error occurred while evaluating nil.name from (irb):33 from (irb):33:in `select' from (irb):33 Long story short: I am trying to find the names of the first organization from each user.
