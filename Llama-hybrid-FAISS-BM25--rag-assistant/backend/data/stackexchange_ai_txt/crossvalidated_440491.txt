By the most usual criteria of "best guess", that's not an optimal strategy. For example: If you want to miminize average square error : pick E(X) If you want to miminize average absolute error : pick median(X) If you want to miminize probability of error: pick mode(X) (maximum value of pmf) To use random strategies for guessing can be optimal is some scenarios where there is an opponent who can vary his strategy observing yours (eg. rock-paper-scissors), but that doesn't seem your scenario. Actually I got this question in mathstackexchange but I thought it is suitable for users on this site.
