What are good algorithms for detecting abnormality?

Background Here is the problem: A black box outputs a new number each day. Those numbers have been recorded for a period of time. Detect when a new number from the black box falls outside the pattern of numbers established over the time period. The numbers are integers, and the time period is a year. Question What algorithm will identify a pattern in the numbers? The pattern might be simple, like always ascending or always descending, or the numbers might fall within a narrow range, and so forth. Ideas I have some ideas, but am uncertain as to the best approach, or what solutions already exist: Machine learning algorithms? Neural network? Classify normal and abnormal numbers? Statistical analysis?
