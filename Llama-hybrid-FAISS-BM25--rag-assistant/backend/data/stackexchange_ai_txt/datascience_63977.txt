How does joint probability generate new data in generative model

Learning about different Machine Learning concepts, I came across Generative and Discriminative model. To infer from what I have studied, generative model is based on P(x,y)(Joint probability distribution) whereas discriminative model is based on P(y|x) which is conditional probability. But the question is why; infact HOW? How does joint probability give rise to new data meanwhile conditional probability just works on current dataset? Can anyone explain me with an intuitive example or maybe some link which would elucidate the concept ?
