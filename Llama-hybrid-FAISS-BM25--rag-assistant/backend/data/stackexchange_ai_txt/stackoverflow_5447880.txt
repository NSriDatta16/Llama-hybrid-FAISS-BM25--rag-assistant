Adding an one-out-of-two not null constraint in postgresql

If I have a table in Postgresql: create table Education ( id integer references Profiles(id), finished YearValue not null, started YearValue, qualification text, schoolName text, studiedAt integer references Organizations(id), primary key (id) ); I need to make a constraint so that either schoolName or studiedAt needs to not be null (one of them has to have information in it). How do I do this?
