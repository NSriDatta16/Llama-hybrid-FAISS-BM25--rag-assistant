Consider a "color cube" with RGB instead of XYZ. Split the cube into subcubes, but make them all overlap. Ensure they are all the same size. An easy to remember/calculate cube-pattern would be one that goes from 0-127, 64-191, 128-255 in all directions, making for a total of 27 cubes. For each cube, find what colors in the image fall into them. As you make the cubes smaller and smaller, the results will change less and less and begin to converge on the most popular color ranges. Once you have that convergence, take the average of the range to get the "actual color". That's about as much detail as I can go into with my boss hovering around the cubefarm :-)
