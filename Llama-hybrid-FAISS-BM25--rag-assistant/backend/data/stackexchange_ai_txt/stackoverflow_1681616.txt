OOP in Javascript with callbacks

I want to close my window (just a div with position absolute that is draggable) when I click on the close link This is my code: function ApplicationWindow() { this.window = $(' '); this.create = function create() { //..... var closeButton = this.window.find('.close'); closeButton.live('click', this.close); } this.close = function close() { this.window.fadeOut(200); }; } When I click on the close button the close function is executed, but the problem is that I get an error: "this.window is undefined". That is because the close function is passed as a callback I think, but my question is how I can solve this on a nice way?
