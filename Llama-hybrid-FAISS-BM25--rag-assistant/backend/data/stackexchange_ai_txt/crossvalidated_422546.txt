What happens when a time series is multiplied by an iid error

Let's say say I have a standard AR(1) process, apart from the fact that is multiplied by the $ε_i$ ~ $iid (0,1)$ . Would this affect the independence of the the AR(1) series? My intuition is no because this would just have a multiplicative effect and $ε_i$ is iid. I'm very new to time series and getting increasingly confused the more I think about it!
