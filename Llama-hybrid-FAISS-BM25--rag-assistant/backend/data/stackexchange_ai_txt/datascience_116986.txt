Possible NLP approaches to extract 'goals' from text

I am planning to take up an interesting NLP project. I want to extract 'goal' statements from lengthy reports. For example, the goals can be We would be reducing our carbon footprint by 50% by 2025 or Our company aims to increase the diversity in the work-force in upcoming months . Check below image for example text and highlighted goals. How can I go about the process of goal extraction, I would like to get some pointers on possible NLP approaches ?
