If you want to become a successfull developer you'll need to learn a lot of stuff. A main programming language (java) and CS basics (e.g. algorithms) are just two of them. Others are: a communication skills, testing (I'd say TDD but I don't want to start a fight), handling of databases, web stuff, OOD and many more. Also a lot of stuff that you might not use directly will still help a lot by broadening your horizon (functional programming, advanced CS concepts) There is no fixed order in which to learn that stuff. Since learning works best when you are motivated, just pick what you are interested in most or what is helping you most. Learn a little here, then learn a little there. Keep your eyes open and practice a lot and you will be fine. In your current situation I'd recommend to pick up an Algorithms book and implementing the algorithms there in java. It teach you java and algorithms. Also read "Clean Code", "The Pragmatic Programmer" and the SOLID http://www.butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.PrinciplesOfOod principles
