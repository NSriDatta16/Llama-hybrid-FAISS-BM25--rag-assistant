@Robertc, I know this question has been marked but I think I have a trick that you can use for your next project : Use your own environment variable! E.g. Before you make any call to the Logging Block Environment.SetEnvironmentVariable("MYDATE", "15/07/2010"); // In your app.config, in the appropriate Rolling flat file trace listener FileName=Log_%MYDATE%.log Note: This trick will only work if you restart your application daily.
