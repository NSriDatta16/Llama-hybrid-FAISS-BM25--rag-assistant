Those are the load averages for the past 1, 5 and 15 minute intervals. A load average above 1 means that processes are waiting on the CPU. Here is a Wikipedia article on load averages . Because your load averages are decreasing, it looks like you have short running, intermittent, heavy load on the server. It also means that you are likely CPU bound although that isn't necessarily so as memory or IO bottlenecks could cause a lot of context switching. That said, 1.36 isn't that high, so I would look at memory or IO constraints.
