The warning means exactly what it says: BNT contains some functions that have the same name as Matlab built-in functions. This has the potential to break some functionality, if the new functions are not compatible with the built-in versions, though it all depends on the path precedence , i.e. where Matlab goes looking for a function that you're calling. In short, if the new functions are compatible with the built-in versions, you should make sure that you add the path to your toolbox to the top of the Matlab path to ensure that it is always the toolbox versions that are being called (type path to check). I hope this is the case, otherwise you should reorganize the toolbox directory structure and put the offending functions in a directory called 'private' (see the path precedence for details). EDIT The linked documentation claims that the overloaded functions are compatible. Good luck!
