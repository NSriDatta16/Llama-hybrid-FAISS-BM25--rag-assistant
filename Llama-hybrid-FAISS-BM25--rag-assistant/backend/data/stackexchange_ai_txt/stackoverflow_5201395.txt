Javascript + Prototype: Can I retrieve list option clicked with the onChange event?

I'm having a little difficulty with some JS. I have a list that I only want a maximum of 10 items selected. The difficulty I'm having is that if a multiple select is made with a mouse drag, the onClick event doesn't fire - so I'm having to use onChange. BUT, with onChange - I cannot get the last option selected because I think that the DOM doesn't support it in the event. Here's an example: HTML: Test Test Test Test JS: Event.observe('mylist', 'change', checkList); function checkList(e) { var count = 0; var listObj = this; // Count selected items for (i=0; i 10) { var e = e || window.event; var tgt = e.target || e.srcElement; alert(tgt.nodeName + ' Index:' + tgt.index); } } If I us an onClick event then I get 'OPTION - Index 1' for instance. But using onChange I get the SELECT node instead. Is there a way I can reliably get at the clicked option?
