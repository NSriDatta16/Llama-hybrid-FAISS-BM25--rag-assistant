Simple wxPython Frame Contents Resizing - Ratio?

I have a wxPython app with one frame and one panel. On that panel are a number of static boxes, each of which has buttons and textboxes. I have just begun reading about sizers, but they seem like they might be more than what I need, or it could that they are exactly what I need but I don't know how to use them correctly! The frame currently opens at 1920 x 1080. If the user drags the bottom right corner to resize the app, I just want everything to get smaller or larger as needed to keep the same size ratio. Is this possible? Thank you! edit: additional info: I used wxPython 2.8 and Boa to construct the GUI. I am contemplating trying another gui ide. So after reading some more about sizers, I am thinking about doing the following: add a gridsizer and basically divide my window's elements into rows and columns, then set each row and column's size as necessary until I achieve the original layout. Then I guess set the rows and columns to resize correctly? Is this a decent idea?
