Organizing workflow with Mercurial and Netbeans (+ bitbucket.org?)

I've never worked with any version control systems before. Now I'm trying to learn Mercurial, but I'm confused (I've already read about 10-15 articles + hginit.com). I don't know how to organize the workflow. I have a testing server and a production server. I work from my office computer and from my home laptop. I make changes directly on the testing server, and every week or so copy new code to my production server. I also need wiki/issues/etc. pretty much everything bitbucket.org has. I know that's a bad way of doing things. Is there any tutorial or articles on how to organize the workflow? I'd also appreciate any schemes/sketches describing the process. Thank you!
