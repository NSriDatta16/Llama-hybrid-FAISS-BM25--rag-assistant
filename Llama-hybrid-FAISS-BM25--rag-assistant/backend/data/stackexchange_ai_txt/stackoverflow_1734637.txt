The GNU/Linux/FOSS model actually encourages tampering -- of a sort. Users and distro-makers must be free to modify (tamper with) the software to suit their needs. Even just recompiling the software (without changing any source code) for customization is something that is done quite often, but would break binary code-signing. As a result, the binary code-signing model isn't particularly well suited to GNU/Linux/FOSS. Instead, this kind of software relies more on generating signatures and/or secure hashes of the source packages. In combination with a reliable and trusted package distribution model, this can be made just as secure (if not more so, vis-Ã -vis transparency into the source code) as binary code-signing.
