Perhaps this is garbage collection: After ThreadCreateCurvedGraph() exits, myGraph goes out of scope and closes. You need to organise a way of the thread to hold on to the instance and wait (using a blocking wait) for it to close. Edit: For instance add: Application.Run(myGraph) to the end of the method.
