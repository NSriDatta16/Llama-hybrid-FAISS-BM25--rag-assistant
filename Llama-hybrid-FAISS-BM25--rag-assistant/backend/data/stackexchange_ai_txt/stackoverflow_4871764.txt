I have not used Clover. I have used Cobertura: it was easy to setup and gave the simple C1 coverage results we wanted and expected. There was some issue that it always ran all the tests twice (once with and once without instrumentation), even though we didn't feel we needed that. However, since the test suite was short enough, it never bothered us.
