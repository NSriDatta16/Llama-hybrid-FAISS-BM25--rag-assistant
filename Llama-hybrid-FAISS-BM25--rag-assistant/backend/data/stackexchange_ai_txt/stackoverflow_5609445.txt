I personally really enjoy using JAXB. You can take that sample XML and pass it to a XML schema (XSD) generator. Then take the XSD and generate your Java objects using the XJC tool. Once you have your Java objects generated, you can marshal (save/export/write) the XML or unmarshal (load/import/read) it using the Marshaller and Unmarshaller classes respectively. There used to be an online XML to XSD converter at http://www.flame-ware.com/products/xml-2-xsd/ but it seems to be down at the moment. You can download an express version of Visual Studio for free to accomplish the same thing, though. I like this tutorial for JAXB: http://download.oracle.com/javaee/5/tutorial/doc/bnbah.html I usually use SAX parsing only if I want full control over everything that's parsed as I'm parsing (hardly ever). I don't enjoy using the DOM method because it requires the entire XML document to be parsed before you can actually do anything with it and once it's parsed, you need to do more work to configure your parser/XML consumer to know what the fields are to actually do anything with it. As for your dynamic children, I would simply include in the schema an uncapped number of objects representing key-value pairs. It'll still save you time due to all the code generated for you. The XmlBeans library is similar to JAXB, but I prefer the latter since it was inducted into Java's core release while XmlBeans was not.
