How can WPF RIchtextbox display Unicode?

I use the WPF RichTexBox control in WPF project. The problem I get stuck in is it cannot display the unicode as the System.Windows.Forms.RichTextbox in Win Project. E.g : When I copy a paragraph of Chinese language and paste it to the WPF Richtextbox. The font is break and it cannot display. But when I use System.Windows.Forms.RichTextbox control then I display ok. So, how can I resolve this problem in WPF project.
