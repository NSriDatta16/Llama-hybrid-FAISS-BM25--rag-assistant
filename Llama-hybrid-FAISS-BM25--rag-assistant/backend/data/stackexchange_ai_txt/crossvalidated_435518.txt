Is initializing the weights of autoencoders still a difficult problem?

I was wondering if initializing the weights of autoencoders is still difficult and what the most recent strategies are for it. I have been reading different articles. In one of Hinton's papers (2006), it says: With large initial weights, autoencoders typically find poor local minima; with small initial weights, the gradients in the early layers are tiny, making it infeasible to train autoencoders with many hidden layers. If the initial weights are close to a good solution, gradient descent works well, but finding such initial weights requires a very different type of algorithm that learns one layer of features at a time. We introduce this "pretraining" procedure for binary data, generalize it to real-valued data, and show that it works well for a variety of data sets.
