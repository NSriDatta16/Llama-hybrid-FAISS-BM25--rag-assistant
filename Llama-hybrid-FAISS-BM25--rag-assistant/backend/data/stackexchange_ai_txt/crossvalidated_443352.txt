How to handle a feature (x1) with huge sample space for linear regression ? (n(x1) >> n(x2,x3,....))

I have a regression problem to solve, comprising of approx 2000 data points. I have some 7-8 features, but one of the feature has a huge sample space, meaning When I one hot encode this Feature, it generates 6000 columns. Overall I have 2000 * (6000 + 7) data set. Upon trying to reduce (2000 * 6000 ) dataset using PCA, it gets reduced to 2000 * 1500 ( capturing 0.8 variance ). But still one feature represented by 1500 columns and other 7 features represented by 7 columns, creates a huge imbalance. How should I proceed ?
