You can access Cognos PowerPlay cubes offline using the Cognos Powerplay version 7.x client, which I believe is packaged with the Transformer application that is used to create the cubes. It will most likely be better than anything you develop yourself. To my knowledge, there is no API for accessing the data stored directly in the cubes with a programming language. At least not in 7.x.
