You're rendering it with OpenGL, right? If you want to do it the easy way, you can have your pixel shader swizzle the colors in realtime. This is no problem at all for the graphics card, they're made to do faar more complicated stuff :). You can use a shader like this: uniform sampler2D image; void main() { gl_FragColor = texture2D(image, gl_FragCoord.xy).gbar; } If you don't know about shaders, read this tut here: http://www.lighthouse3d.com/opengl/glsl/
