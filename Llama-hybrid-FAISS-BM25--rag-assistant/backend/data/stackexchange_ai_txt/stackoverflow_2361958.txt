HorizontalScrollView shrinks GridView to small line

When I put a HorizontalScrollView around a GridView, the GridView gets compressed into a small column on the left. The Gridview's vertical scrollbar even appears on the left. The HorizontalScrollView's width is set to fill_parent and the GridView is also fill_parent. I don't know why this is happening. I tried setting the GridView's visibility to GONE and VISIBILE like someone recommended but it doesn't do anything. However if fastScroll is enabled on the GridView, then dragging the fast scroll tab vertically causes the GridView to expand horizontally and it keeps expanding past the last column.
