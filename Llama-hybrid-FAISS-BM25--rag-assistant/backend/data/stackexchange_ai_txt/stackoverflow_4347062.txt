I'm not particularly familiar with AdWords, but in general, most website analytics tools have both options, and the JavaScript option is better because it can provide more details about the user. The noscript option, by loading a 1x1 image, simply logs a request on the server-side, and this contains very limited information such as your IP address and your browser's user agent string. Using JavaScript can give you additional information such as display resolution, referring page and whether plug-ins such as Flash/Java are installed.
