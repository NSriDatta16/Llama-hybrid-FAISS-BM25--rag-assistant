Is there a way I can only make one CSS id, and one javascript function to change all inputs? Yes, you can attach one event handler to many elements simply by assigning it as a function; the subject element comes in as ‘this’. You don't even need an ID. For completeness, since no-one else seems to have said it, it's quite possible to have the advantages of non-inline, unobtrusive event handlers without dragging in the whole of jQuery (which is probably a bit excessive if all you want is a few highlighting inputs): function inputFocussed() { this.style.backgroundColor= 'yellow'; }; function inputBlurred() { this.style.backgroundColor= 'white'; }; // Bind to input[type=text] // var inputs= document.getElementsByTagName('input'); for (var i= inputs.length; i-->0;) { if (inputs[i].type=='text') { inputs[i].onfocus= inputFocused; inputs[i].onblurred= inputBlurred; } }
