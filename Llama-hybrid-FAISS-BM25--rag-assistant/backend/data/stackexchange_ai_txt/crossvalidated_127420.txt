Abstractly, regression is the problem of calculating a conditional expectation $E[Y|X=x]$. The form taken by this expectation is different depending on the assumptions of how the data were generated: Assuming (Y|X=x) to be normally distributed yields with classical linear regression. Assuming a Poisson distribution yields Poisson regression. Assuming a Bernoulli distribution yields logistic regression. The term "regression" has also been used more generally than this, including approaches like quantile regression, which estimates a given quantile of $(Y|X=x)$.
