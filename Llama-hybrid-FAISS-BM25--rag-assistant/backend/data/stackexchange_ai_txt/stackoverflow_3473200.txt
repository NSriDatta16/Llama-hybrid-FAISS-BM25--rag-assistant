iOS/iPhone best practice for handling events

I am just starting out with iOS programming. I'm currently looking through the MoveMe example and had a question about event handlers. In the example, they have the MoveMeView (subclass of UIView ) handle events ( touchesBegan:withEvent: , etc.). It seems like this belongs on a controller though, not the view. Is there a standard way of doing this, or any guidelines on the division of responsibility between a view and a controller?
