Testing for causality with Support Vector Machines

Can a support vector machine (SVM) be used to test for causality between 2 or more variables? I know that the original purpose for SVM is classification. I also know that there is a variation of the SVM which is used for regression. The latter is called Support Vector Regression (SVR). However, is there any paper/ study that used a Support Vector Machine/ Regression to test the causality between 2 or more variables?
