How to forecast changepoints from Gas Concentration Data?

So I'm trying to predict when gas concentrations change from sensor conductivity readings over a day. The gases randomly change concentrations around every 80-120 seconds and are kept constant between changes. There are two gases - methane and ethylene. Right now, I'm just trying to predict when the changepoints occur in methane concentrations. I've added a variable that indicates whether that gas concentration changes. Next, I've split the data into train and test (where the train data is the first half of the day, and the test data is the last half of the day). For reference, here are some time plots of the sensors and the gas concentrations: One of the sensors from the dataset was broken (sensor 2), so it was removed. I have tried fitting sklearn's logistic regression and linear SVC to predict the changepoints, and even set the classweights to balanced since there are very few changepoints (data measurements were taken every 1/100th of a second). However, logistic regression ends up predicting too many changepoints for the test data and linear SVR fails to converge. Since my approach wasn't working, I was looking for suggestions of how to approach this problem.
