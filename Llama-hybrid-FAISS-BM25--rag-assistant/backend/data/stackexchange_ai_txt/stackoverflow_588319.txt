Generic delegate or generic cast problem

How can i make the following code compile? Action > func = x => Console.WriteLine(x.ToString()); public void Apply (MyClass target) { func.Invoke(target); } I know it doesnt work because a MyClass isnt a MyClass , but what can i do? Can i make the function generic? or Can i cast target? either way, how? If it helps, nothing in the func will ever do anything T1 or T2 specific. I know this assumption could make it fragile, but unit tests should catch any issues. Edit: I'm avoiding the problem at the moment with loads of empty interfaces that i'd rather do away with! Thanks
