Arraylist of custom classes inside My.Settings

I have a Visual Basic .Net 2.0 program. I'm moving the settings from an older settings file, to an app.config program settings file. I'm trying to do this as nicely as possible. So, I added my setting as shown in this image . On load I do this: If My.Settings.databaseConnectionSettings Is Nothing Then My.Settings.databaseConnectionSettings = New ArrayList() End If This is my custom class: Imports System.Xml.Serialization Public Class DatabaseConnectionSettings Private _nickname As String = String.Empty Private _username As String = String.Empty Private _password As String = String.Empty Private _database As String = String.Empty Private _server As String = String.Empty Private _ssl As Boolean Public Sub New() _nickname = "" _username = "" _password = "" _database = "" _server = "" _ssl = False End Sub Public Sub New(ByVal nickname As String, ByVal username As String, _ ByVal password As String, ByVal database As String, _ ByVal server As String, ByVal ssl As Boolean) _nickname = nickname _username = username _password = password _database = database _server = server _ssl = ssl End Sub Public Property nickname() As String Get Return _nickname End Get Set(ByVal Value As String) _nickname = Value End Set End Property Public Property username() As String Get Return _username End Get Set(ByVal Value As String) _username = Value End Set End Property Public Property password() As String Get Return _password End Get Set(ByVal Value As String) _password = Value End Set End Property Public Property database() As String Get Return _database End Get Set(ByVal Value As String) _database = Value End Set End Property Public Property server() As String Get Return _server End Get Set(ByVal Value As String) _server = Value End Set End Property Public Property ssl() As Boolean Get Return _ssl End Get Set(ByVal Value As Boolean) _ssl = Value End Set End Property End Class And, this is how I use it: Dim databaseSettings As New DatabaseConnectionSettings( _ Me.txtNickName.Text, Me.txtUser.Text, Me.txtPass.Text, Me.txtData.Text, _ Me.txtServer.Text, Me.chkSSL.Checked) 'This statement will increment the arraylist count' My.Settings.databaseConnectionSettings.Add(databaseSettings) 'This statement will save everything but the array list' My.Settings.Save() 'This statement reloads everything, but the array list. The array list count after this goes to zero.' My.Settings.Reload() 'If I remove this, program works fine until next run.' So, the question is, how do I get that arraylist of my DatabaseConnectionSettings saved to persistent storage? I want to do this in the cleanest way possible. That is, I don't want to have to convert it to a string or save it to a separate file every-time I want to use it. I would like to be able to use the My.Settings accessor method. Note, it's working perfectly, except it's not being saved to storage.
