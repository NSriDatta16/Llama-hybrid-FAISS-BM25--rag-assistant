How much extra storage does MySQL fulltext index consume?

I am looking for a way to estimate how much extra storage will be needed if a MySQL TEXT column gets a fulltext index. Intuitively speaking the size of the fulltext index is dependent on the total length of text but what exactly is affecting it?
