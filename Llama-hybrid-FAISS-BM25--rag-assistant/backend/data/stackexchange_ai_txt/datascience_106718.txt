The target you will want to use will depend entirely on your goal with this analysis. In your case you are asking whether you should set your target to either fare or fare/km . As you stated, fare/km does make more sense if you want to predict the price per kilometer of your ride (i.e. was there surge pricing? how does price change by time?). However, consider the question "How much do I expect to earn from a customer X?". Then price on Uber does not depend only on the distance. It also depends on the current supply and demand, the pick-up location (region), etc and predicting a fare/km might obfuscate the total cost of the ride. For example, we want to predict ride cost. Our features are pick-up location day of week time of day We can expect that the average ride cost at 3am from a clubbing district will be higher (people heading home from drinking, more kilometers) let's say 100\$ rides, 25km. In comparison at 8pm (when people might be going from restaurants to night clubs, less kilometers) 20\$ rides, 5km. However, if you used the fare/km, then the two would have the same target.
