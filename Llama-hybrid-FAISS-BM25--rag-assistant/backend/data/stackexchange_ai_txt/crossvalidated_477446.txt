Logistic regression decision boundary when a straight line does not separate the classes well

I have two classes that I would like to classify them by using logistic regression. But the decision boundary misclassify two of my red clusters My question is that why logistic regression classifies them wrongly and at least does not involve one of the small clusters? How they can be related to the term linear regression in the sigmoid function? How should I rearrange the red clusters to reduce the misclassification?
