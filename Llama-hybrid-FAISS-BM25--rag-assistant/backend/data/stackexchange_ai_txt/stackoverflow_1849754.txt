Best practice for building a "Narrow your results" product filtering feature

I'm building a "Narrow your results by" feature similar to Best Buy's and NewEgg's . What is the best practice for storing the user's filter selections in a URL that can be shared/bookmarked? The obvious choice is to simply keep all the user's selections in the query string. However, both of these examples are doing something far more cryptic: Best Buy: http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olstemplatemapper.jsp?id=pcat17080&type=page&qp=crootcategoryid%23%23-1%23%23-1~~q70726f63657373696e6774696d653a3e313930302d30312d3031~~cabcat0500000%23%230%23%2311a~~cabcat0502000%23%230%23%23o~~nf518||24363030202d2024383939&list=y&nrp=15&sc=abComputerSP&sp=%2Bcurrentprice+skuid&usc=abcat0500000 It appears they're assigning some unique value to the search and storing it temporarily on their side. Or perhaps wrapping their db id's in a bunch of garbage because they believe in security through obscurity? Is there some inherent disadvantage to keeping things simple like this? www.mydomain.com?color=blue&type=laptop So when I select a 17" screen size as a filter, it would simply reload the page with the additional query string tacked on: www.mydomain.com?color=blue&type=laptop&screen-size=17 Also, to clarify, I would likely use corresponding ids from the database in the URL to make validation and parsing easier/faster, but the question remains about whether there's some problem I'm missing in my simple approach. Thanks in advance!
