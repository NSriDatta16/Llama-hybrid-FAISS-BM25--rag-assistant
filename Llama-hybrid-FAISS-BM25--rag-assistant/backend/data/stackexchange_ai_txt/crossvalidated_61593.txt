In a basic mixed effects model, $$E[Y_{it}|X_{it}] = \alpha + \sigma_i^2 + \beta X_{it}$$ clusters having just one observation contribute influence to both the estimated variance of the random effect and the slope of the fixed effect. This is because the random intercept is never actually estimated. While some numerical solvers produce estimates for random intercepts, they are actually post-hoc statistics calculated after joint estimation of the random effect variance and the fixed effect slope. If you fit mixed effects models with unbalanced designs, it's important to verify the normality of these estimates (this can be a strong and influential assumption when there are a small number of clusters). As an example, suppose I run a health care clinic and we're verifying the management of AIDS in subjects on antiretroviral therapies, such as effivirenz. If I combine prevalent cases at baseline and incident cases during follow-up, my analysis is now sensitive to the distribution of incidence. For instance, suppose 70% of my cases were diagnosed two years ago, and have had successful management of disease while 30% of my cases are incident and have high viral loads before starting therapy. I now have an uneven bimodal distribution of random intercepts (viral load at "visit 1") and my fixed effect is biased toward the null (when it's actually suggestive that it's effective in managing disease). A GEE on the other hand makes no assumption about the distribution of random effects and is consistent for the population averaged effect estimate: $\beta_M$ (M for marginal) rather than $\beta_C$ (C for conditional). These models are related to one another, but on average $\beta_M \leq \beta_C$ yet tests of inference about $\beta_M$ can often be of higher power.
