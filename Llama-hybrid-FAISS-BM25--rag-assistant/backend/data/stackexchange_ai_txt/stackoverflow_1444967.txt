Some theories: My first thought was that I would consider caching to be a factor here - if the tasks and values are still on the stack or in recent short-term memory, you may find it is able to send them faster. As time increases, the chance it's still available decreases, so it would on average take longer. However, I would expect there to be an upper limit if this were the case...some point at which it's always in cache. An alternative reasoning is that there's a memory leak or some performance degradation over time in your app/test/platform. This would also (if it exists) mean that the longer you wait, the longer it has time to degrade the performance, and thus the longer it would take to send. ALSO - if you're taking longer between packets to send them - you may exceed the address learning timeouts - both IP tables and MAC tables. If these tables/caches have expired, they'd need to relearn them before forwarding the packet on. Good luck!
