Infragisitcs ultrawingrid columnchooser and column filters

I have an Infragistics UltraWinGrid and I'm using its built-in column chooser. However there is an issue whereby if a user has a filter on a particular column, then hides that column, the filter is still applied to the data. I would expect that if the column is hidden then its filter should no longer apply OR I should at least be able to set this somehow. I've looked and can't find a way of doing this. Any ideas?
