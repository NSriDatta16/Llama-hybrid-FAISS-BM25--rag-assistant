How can I determine if the means between these two small groups are statistically the same?

Group 1: 0.965116667, 0.972716667, 0.821216667, 0.870816667, 0.816216667 Group 2: 1.046016667, 0.794616667, 0.923416667, 0.927816667, 0.780816667, 0.729616667, 0.710816667, 0.788116667, 0.661316667, 0.750416667, 0.913716667, 1.0147166667 These are numerical data points generated by doing the same experiment in my Biochemistry lab on two different days. How can I conclude if their averages are statistically different from each other? Would it be appropriate to use equivalence testing? How can I do that? Can I just do a Welch t test (t.test in R) without testing for Normality?
