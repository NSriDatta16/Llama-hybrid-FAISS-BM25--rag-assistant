Generating an XML file from a script

I've recently have a reason to include into our build script the creation of an XML configuration file. The most straightforward way I can think of to do this is to hard-code the XML content as a string into the script and then to simply create a file and write that XML string to the file (named appropriately etc). Is there a more elegant or efficient way of doing this? The build script that I am looking to modify is written in VBScript.
