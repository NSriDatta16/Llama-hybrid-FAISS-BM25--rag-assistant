I think you will find this paper helpful: D. Kunin et al., " Loss Landscapes of Regularized Linear Autoencoders (2019). The authors discuss the convergence of linear autoencoders to the principal subspace and how regularization enables the recovery of the actual principal components (not just the subspace). You might also find this paper helpful: E. Plaut, From Principal Subspaces to Principal Components with Linear Autoencoders (2018). This paper gives an elaborate introduction to LAE and their relationship with PCA.
