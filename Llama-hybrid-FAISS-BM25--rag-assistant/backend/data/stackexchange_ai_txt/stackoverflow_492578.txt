If you are implementing MD5 through a VBA module then there are several options. I haven't tried this, but a quick search for "md5 vba" returned this basMD5.bas file. It is not one of the common open source licenses though. From the " MD5 Homepage (unofficial) " in the Visual Basic section: Francisco Carlos Piragibe de Almeida has created a DLL with a BAS wrapper module for use in VB projects (19K download) and an ActiveX in-process server wrapper around the original DLL (includes the DLL) (1394K download). (appears to be broken -- 2005-11-14) MD5 for VB . Reference by benjamin pritchard. MD5 for VB and VBScript . Reference by Dominik Deobald.
