By running a logistic regression model, the objective is to get the chance of a binary outcome based on the different predictor variables. Since the result is a chance, what is modeled is actually: $$ log \left(\frac{P_{+}}{1 - P_{+}}\right) = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}x_{1} + ... + \beta_{n}x_{n} $$ So the coefficients you get from R are the $\beta$ values. The function you have so far in Excel computes correctly the right hand side (RHS) of the above equation, but to get the probability $P_{+}$, you need to solve the equation for it. Let's call the RHS, $\mathbf{Bx}$ $$ log \left(\frac{P_{+}}{1 - P_{+}}\right) = \mathbf{Bx} \\ \frac{P_{+}}{1 - P_{+}} = e^{\mathbf{Bx}} \\ \frac{1}{e^{\mathbf{Bx}}} = \frac{1}{P_{+}} - 1 \\ \frac{e^{\mathbf{Bx}} + 1}{e^{\mathbf{Bx}}} = \frac{1}{P_{+}} \\ P_{+} = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-\mathbf{Bx}}} $$ To your results, apply this transformation and you should get the same results as the predict function in R.
