On Windows XP and later Use the GetAdaptersAddresses instead of GetAdaptersInfo. There is a set of functions implementing IP Helper APIs . see the delphi web page at Magenta Systems Edit: from Remok comment : GetAdaptersInfo returns ERROR_NO_DATA if there is ONLY an IPv6 address configured. That's why MSDN recommends using GetAdapterAddresses.
