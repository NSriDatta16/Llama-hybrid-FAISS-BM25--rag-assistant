C++ is not even close to being dead. My experience: Bloomberg, Reuters, and all their bank/trading clients who want low latency market data feeds use C++. (Fidelity, JPMorgan, BNP, Citibank, etc.) The defense industry uses C++. (among other languages - Java is also popular) These industries also use java and other languages, but C++ is hard to beat. Note also that there is a HUGE existing C++ code base that will take a long time to go away (if ever) It is not hard to know and use them both. Don't worry too much about a particular language. That is not the real crux of developing software.
