Open source classification algorithms, preferably in C++

I am in search of open source classification algorithms. I am working on a computer vision project that uses classification for scene recognition. I wish to bench test a range of machine learning algorithms for the classification stage. The implementations must be on open source licenses and preferably written in C++. All and any help would be highly appreciated. Thanks in advance.
