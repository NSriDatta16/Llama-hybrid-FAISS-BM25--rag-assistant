What are the known "gotchas" with regards to the Chain of Responsibilty pattern?

I have been finding myself using the Chain of Responsibility pattern often (3 times is often for me) in my current project and I'm wondering if I have become a little over-enthusiastic about the solution. Specifically, I have been using the Apache Commons chain project . So, far I have been quite impressed by how it has simplified a number of complex interchangeable pieces of app logic into a more cohesive and organized whole. However, a few of the newer people on the project seem to have difficulty "getting it." What are your experiences with it? What problems have you encountered in its implementation? So far, the only problem I have noticed that it is when you are trying to deal with objects that need to be closed. Having those objects stored in your Context class makes for a pain when you have completed the execution of your chain. I was able to work around this using Filters instead of Commands, but it seems a little unintuitive because your close statements are often very far away from where the object was instantiated. Anyways, I would love to hear the thoughts from some developers who have more experience that I with this pattern. Thanks in advance.
