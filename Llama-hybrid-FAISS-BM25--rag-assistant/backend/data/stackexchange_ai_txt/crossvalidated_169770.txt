What is the best algorithm for predicting rare events?

I heard somewhere that logistic regression is a good candidate for this, but it doesn't work really well for me. Instead, Random Forests proved to be very efficient in my observed population. The Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Algorithm Cheat Sheet says that we should use One-class SVM (or PCA-based anomaly) for binary cases. What is the best algorithm? Or is there no explicit response to this type of question, and it depends on the data set?
