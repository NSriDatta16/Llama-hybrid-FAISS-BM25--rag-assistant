Nested Models for Likelihood Test

If I have a logistic regression model with 3 predictors, $x_1$, $x_2$, $x_3$, and then I remove $x_3$ from my model (left with only $x_1$ and $x_2$), are those models nested? And therefore I can use the likelihood ratio test ($\chi^2$ with 1 df in this case) to test if $x_3$ is necessary to keep in the model. Or are these models not nested because they do not include the exact same variables?
