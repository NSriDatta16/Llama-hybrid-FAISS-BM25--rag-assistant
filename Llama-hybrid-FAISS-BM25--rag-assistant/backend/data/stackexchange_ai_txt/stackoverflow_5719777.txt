You'll need to change your Timer's schedule() call to timer.schedule(new TimerTick(), 0, 1000); The way you're calling it right now is saying to run it once after a second delay. This way says to run it now and every second. You probably want to use timer.scheduleAtFixedRate(new TimerTick(), 0, 1000); though, because it will make sure that on average your TimerTask is ran every second rather than with a normal schedule() call that says it will try waiting a second then executing, but it could fall behind if something slows it down. If scheduleAtFixedRate() is delayed, it will make multiple calls quicker than on the 1 second delay so it can "catch up." Take a look at http://www.blackberry.com/developers/docs/5.0.0api/java/util/Timer.html#scheduleAtFixedRate(java.util.TimerTask,%20long,%20long ) for a more detailed explanation.
