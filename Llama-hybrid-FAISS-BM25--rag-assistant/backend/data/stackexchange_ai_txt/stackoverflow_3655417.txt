Rails3: Cascading Select Writer's Block

I have a big, flat table: id product_id attribute1 attribute2 attribute3 attribute4 Here is how I want users to get to products: See a list of unique values for attribute1. Clicking one of those gets you a list of unique values for attribute2. Clicking one of those gets you a list of unique values for attribute3. Clicking one of those gets you a list of unique values for attribute4. Clicking one of those shows you the relevant products. I have been coding Rails for about 4 years now. I just can't unthink my current approach to this problem. I have major writer's block. Seems like such an easy problem. But I either code it with 4 different "step" methods in my controller, or I try to write one "search" method that attempts to divine the last level you selected, and all the previous values that you selected. Both are major YUCK and I keep deleting my work. What is the most elegant way to do this?
