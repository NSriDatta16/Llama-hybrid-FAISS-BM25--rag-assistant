This answer uses the fundamental matrix approach with an absorbing Discrete Time Markov Chain (DTMC). Define $X_n$ as the number of plays until a win. $\{X_n,n=1,2,\ldots\}$ is a DTMC. Let the transition probability matrix $\mathbf{P}$ be a $35\times 35$ square matrix. $P_{ij}$ is the probability you transition from state $i$ to state $j$. State 35 is a dummy state that indicates you've won. $$\mathbf{P}_{35\times 35}= \left[ {\begin{array}{c c c c c c} 0 & 1-p_1 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & p_1\\ 0 & 0 & 1-p_2 & 0 & \cdots & p_2\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1-p_3 & \cdots & p_3\\ \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & & \ddots & \vdots\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & p_{34}\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 1\\ \end{array} } \right] $$ There is one absorbing state (35) and 34 transient states. The matrix $\mathbf{P}$ can be written in canonical form $$\mathbf{P} = \left[ {\begin{array}{c c c c c c} \mathbf{Q} & \mathbf{R} \\ \mathbf{0} & \mathbf{I} \\ \end{array} }\right]$$ where $\mathbf{Q}$ is a $34\times 34$ square matrix, $\mathbf{R}$ is a $34\times 1$ column vector, and $\mathbf{I}=\left[ 1 \right]$ is a trivial $1\times 1$ matrix. The fundamental matrix $$\mathbf{S}=\left(\mathbf{I}_{34\times 34}-\mathbf{Q}\right)^{-1}$$ has the interpretation that $S_{ij}$ is the expected number of times the process is in transient state $j$ given that it started in transient state $i$. Summing across the rows of $\mathbf{S}$ gives the total number of plays until absorption (winning) given you started in state $i$. Since we always start the game at the beginning, the quantity of interest is $$ E[N] = \sum_j^{34} S_{1j}=7.5632$$ References: https://math.dartmouth.edu/archive/m20x06/public_html/Lecture14.pdf
