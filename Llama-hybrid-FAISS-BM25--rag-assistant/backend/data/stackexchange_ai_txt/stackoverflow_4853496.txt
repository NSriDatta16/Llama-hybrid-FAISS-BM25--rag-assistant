The main purpose of refactoring code into classes and modules is to improve readability and maintainability. A trivial program like this would be made substantially less readable by such a refactoring, so it is difficult to offer meaningful advice on how it should be split up. The best answer I can offer is that it shouldn't. Tackle some bigger projects, and then you can learn the use of modularisation techniques in their proper context. "Any intelligent fool can make things bigger, more complex, and more violent. It takes a touch of genius -- and a lot of courage -- to move in the opposite direction." â€” Albert Einstein
