C# In-Source Documentation Generation for NON-Programmers

The software group I currently work in has recently decided to start documenting our codebase. The initial approach they have been taking was to use the built in triple slash /// method of documenting. A newer issue we began to find was that the result of running this through doxygen is a very nice representation of the codebase but for a programmer to use, where we had intended for this documentation to be readable by our Systems Engineers who will often come to us asking what a task is doing exactly. Is there an easy way to document our code using the /// method and doxygen in a manner that if we run it a certain way, we can generate a document that JUST contains the Systems engineering version of documentation without all the extra fluff of a standard programmers documentation that would scare away a systems guy such as methods and member variables etc.? Any alternative solution suggestions are also welcome. I'm sorry if this is a little confusing as to what we are trying to accomplish, I can adjust as responses come in. Thank you.
