Not intended to be too presumptuous here, but I think you should look at whether Subversive or Subclipse actually solves problem in a different way than you intended. For instance, it is very much possible to ignore files and directories from being checked in, via Subclipse. On the other hand, if you really want to hack away via the command prompt from Eclipse, you must install the Target Management project (supported for Eclipse Europa and Ganymede). Once you have that installed, you can launch a remote shell to your local machine and then type away on the command line :). PS: I haven't used this approach ever; Subversive satisfied all my requirements of a SVN plugin in Eclipse.
