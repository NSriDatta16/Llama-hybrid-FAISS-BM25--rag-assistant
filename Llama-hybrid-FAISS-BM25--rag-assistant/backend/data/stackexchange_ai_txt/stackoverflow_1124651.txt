Note that they're not malloc and free that are used, but operator new and operator delete . Also, unlike your code, by using new you're guaranteeing exception safety. The nearly equivalent code would be the following. AnObject* anObject = ::operator new(sizeof(AnObject)); try { anObject = new (anObject) AnObject(); } catch (...) { ::operator delete(anObject); throw; } anObject->~AnObject(); ::operator delete(anObject) The reset you're proposing is valid, but not idiomatic. It's difficult to get right and as such is generally frowned upon and discouraged.
