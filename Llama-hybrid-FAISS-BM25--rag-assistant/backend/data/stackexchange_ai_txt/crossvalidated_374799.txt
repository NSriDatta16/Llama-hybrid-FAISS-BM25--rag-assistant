huge difference between estimates of binomial regresssion when including random effect vs when not

I'm trying to estimate the average score for two groups of students. I use a binomial regression model. The total_ans is the total question they've have answered, which may be different for different students. Model 1 directly estimates model In model 2, I use a random effect to better account for individual variances. model I'm surprised that there is such a big difference between the results in the two groups. What might be the reason for this? more info:group 1 has 1434 students, group 2 has 119 students. these are naturally occurring groups
