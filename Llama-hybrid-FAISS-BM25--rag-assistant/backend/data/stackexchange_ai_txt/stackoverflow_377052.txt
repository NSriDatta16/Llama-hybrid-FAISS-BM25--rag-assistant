It's a bit hard to see from the fragment you're posting, but judging by the symptoms I would look at the AllWordsMatcher (look for static state). If AllWordsMatcher is stateful you should also check that you're creating a new instance for each thread. More generally I'd look at all the instances involved in the matching/searching process, specifically at the working objects being used when multithreaded. From past experience, the problem usually lies there. (It's easy to look too much at the object graph representing your business data Container/DataItem in this case)
