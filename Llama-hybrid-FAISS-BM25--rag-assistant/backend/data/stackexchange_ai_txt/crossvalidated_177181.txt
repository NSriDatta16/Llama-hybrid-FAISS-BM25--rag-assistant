Is this an ongoing project, where you need to identify the time when the mean (for instance) of the process changes? If so, you should look up either changepoint models or else hidden Markov chains. In particular, if this is a sequential problems it won't be dealt with well by the usual multiple comparison approaches (which assume a fixed number of comparisons).
