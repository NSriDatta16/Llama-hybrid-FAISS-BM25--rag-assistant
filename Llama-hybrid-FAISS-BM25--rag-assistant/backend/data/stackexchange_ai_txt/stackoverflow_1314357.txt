Using WADL implies that you just might be gracious enough to actually define the data / documents you are passing back and forth. Say you are passing some XML fragments, they might actually be part of a defined schema. Whether or not you use the DL to generate code is not very important to me. What matters, in my subjective opinion, is that it is important to have a formal agreement on interfaces between business partners. Even if what is passed is obvious, it helps to identify who has to fix what later if somebody changes the previous interface. Data format is just as much a part of an interface as verb names.
