You are exactly describing the problem setting of kernel $k$-means; when you cannot represent a data point as a Euclidean vector, but if you can still calculate (or define) the inner product between two data points then you can kernelize the algorithm. The following webpage provides brief description of the algorithm: Kernel $k$-means page This kernel trick is a very popular and fundamental idea in Statistics and machine learning. Wiki page on the kernel trick If you are interested, the book Learning with Kernels from by Bernhard Sch√∂lkopf and Alexander J. Smola will be a very nice introduction. This note from Max Welling seems very nice; also, if you are using R you can take a look at this R package . MDS might be a one way to solve your problem, but it does not directly attack the problem you want to solve; while kernel k-means does.
