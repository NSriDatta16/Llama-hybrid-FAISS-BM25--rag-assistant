Paperclip and Amazon S3 URL is too long

When the an image is stored to Amazon S3 using Paperclip the url of the image is too long: e.g. http://s3.amazonaws.com/railsapp/Users/am/Desktop/railsapp/public/system/avatars/1/thumb/16110022.jpg?1171724004 (this is basically http://s3.amazonaws.com/[bucketname]/[path on mac to image]) This is in my user model: has_attached_file :avatar, :styles => { :thumb => "100x100>", :medium =>"250x250>" }, :default_style => :thumb, :default_url => "/images/:attachment/missing_:style.png", :storage => :s3, :s3_credentials => "#{RAILS_ROOT}/config/amazon_s3.yml" How can I make the url shorter and so that it doesn't include the long link to the file? At the same time, is there a way to prevent the original file (not the resized ones) form being saved?
