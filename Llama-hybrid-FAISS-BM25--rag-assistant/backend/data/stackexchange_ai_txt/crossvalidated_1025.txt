Calculating averages leads to a different dataset than simply reducing the number of data points. If one heartbeat per minute is much faster than the other heart beats you will lose the signal through your smoothing process. If you summary 125-125-0-125-125 as 100 than the story that the data tells is different through your smoothing. Sometimes the heart even skips beats and I believe that's an event that interesting for however wants to look at plotted heart rate data. I would therefore propose that you calculate the distance between two points with a formula like d=sqrt((time1-time2)^2 + (bpm1-bpm2)) . You set a minimum distance in your program. Then you iterate through your data and after every point you delete all following points for which d is smaller than your minimum distance. As the unit of time and bpm isn't the same you might want to think about how you can find a way to scale the units meaningfully. To do this task right you should speak to the doctors who in the end have to interpret your graphs and ask them what information they consider to be essential.
