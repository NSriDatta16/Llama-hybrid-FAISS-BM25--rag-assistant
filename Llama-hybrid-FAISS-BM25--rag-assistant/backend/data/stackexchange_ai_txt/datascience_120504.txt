Can I use LLM to explain codebase?

I am a Data Engineer, and I am currently assigned a task to refactor an outdated code and rectify any bugs present. However, I am unable to comprehend the code written in the existing codebase. Furthermore, the developers who worked on this codebase did not provide any documentation. Consequently, I am inquiring if there is a feasible method to convert the entire codebase into an extensive text document. Subsequently, I would like to utilize ChatGPT to translate the codebase into a comprehensive document(very long text, with folder structure tree and code inside src) that I can use to embedding. I do not require an in-depth explanation of the code; rather, I am seeking a more abstract-level understanding, such as the purpose of specific files, the functionality of particular folders, etc.
