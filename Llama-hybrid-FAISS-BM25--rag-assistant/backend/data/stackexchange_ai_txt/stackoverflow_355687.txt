How to check a procedure/view/table exists or not before dropping it in db2 9.1?

How do we write below pseudo code in db2, If (Proc exists) Drop Proc Create Proc Else Create Proc One solution I found, after googling is to ignore the return codes. Do we have a more elegant way to do this? Thanks Update: With the help of the answer below we wrote a proc as below to drop the procedures CREATE PROCEDURE SVCASNDB.DROPSP(IN P_SPECIFICNAME VARCHAR(128)) SPECIFIC DROPSP P1: BEGIN -- Drop the SP if it already exists if exists (SELECT SPECIFICNAME FROM SYSIBM.SYSROUTINES WHERE SPECIFICNAME = trim(upper(p_SpecificName))) then begin DECLARE v_StmtString VARCHAR (1024); SET v_StmtString = 'DROP SPECIFIC PROCEDURE SCHEMA.' || p_SpecificName; PREPARE stmt1 FROM v_StmtString ; EXECUTE stmt1; end; end if; END P1
