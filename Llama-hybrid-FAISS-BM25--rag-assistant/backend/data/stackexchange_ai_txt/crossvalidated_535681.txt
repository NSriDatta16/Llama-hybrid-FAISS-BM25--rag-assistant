Use an ordinal response model such as the proportional odds semiparametric ordinal logistic regression model. When judging variable importance use its likelihood ratio $\chi^2$ statistic. But use the bootstrap to get a confidence interval for the importance ranks as often variable importance is hard to nail down. Also don't assume the predictors are linear. Much more on this may be found in RMS .
