VS2010 Express: Theme "New Item..." Stylesheet; Where Is It?

Started checking out VS2010 Express. I have it installed on my home laptop and my work PC. This "problem" occurs on both systems. In past versions of VS I thought I was able to add style sheets to a theme by right-clicking on the theme folder, selecting "New Item...", then clicking the Style Sheet item. In VS2010 Express, Style Sheet is not present as an option. Only Skin, XML, and XSLT are present. Is there a way to add Style Sheet to the list of selectable items? My current workaround is to create a style sheet outside of the theme folder, then drag it into the theme folder. Thanks, Sam
