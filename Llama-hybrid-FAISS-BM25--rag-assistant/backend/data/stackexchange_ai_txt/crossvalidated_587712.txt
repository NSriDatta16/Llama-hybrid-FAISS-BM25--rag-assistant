Confused about the use of Probability Density Functions in machine learning

I am a bit confused about the usage of probability density functions in machine learning. Lets say I have two classes $C_1$ and $C_2$ which are lets say gaussian . Then I can classify a point $x$ by taking the class for which the posterior is bigger. So I just calculate the following two expressions: $$P(x|C_1)P(C_1) \;and\; P(x|C_2)P(C_2)$$ When doing such calculations in our lecture we always talked about probabilities. As far as I know we always "acted" as if these are probabilities but this isn't technically right? I mean plugging in $x$ into the functions doesn't give you a "probability" but I am assuming that it gives you something proportional to the probability.
