Best linear unbiased estimator

I have a sample of N stocks. I have the following information: For each stock i, I have an estimate of variance (of returns) $\hat{\sigma}^2_{i}$. I also have a fitted variance, denoted by $\hat{b}_{i}$, estimated as follows: $\sigma^2_{i} = \sum\limits_{k} X_{i,k} * \beta_k + \epsilon$ where $X_i$ is NxK-matrix of known independent variables. Then $\hat{b}_{i} = \Sigma X_{i,k} * \hat{\beta}_k$ is the fitted variance, and where $\hat{\beta}_k$ is the OLS estimator of $\beta_k$. I would like to combine each stock's variance estimate with the cross-sectional average, like $\hat{\sigma}^2_{i, shrink} = w * \hat{\sigma}^2_{i} + (1-w) * \hat{b}_{i}$ The question is: what would a robust methodology to determine the appropriate weight $w$, that would minimize the standard error of this estimate $\hat{\sigma}^2_{i, shrink}$? Thanks,
