As Ben mentioned, Replication is one reason. Another is load balancing. For example, Hotmail uses many database servers and customer data is broken up across the databases. To have all of their customers' data on one server would not only require massive storage requirements, but the response times would be horrible. In other cases, the data may be separated by function. You may well have two sets of data which are either not connected, or at least very loosely so, and in such cases, it may make sense to separate that data from the rest.
