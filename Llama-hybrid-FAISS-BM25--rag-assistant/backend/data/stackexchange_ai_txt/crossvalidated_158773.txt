Imagine (for example) that measurements were increasing over time. Then if you measure Group1 before Group2, the difference in their means will include the effect of the difference in time. So some clever person says ... "Okay, so let's do half Group 1, then do Group 2 and then do half Group1"... and that would work fine if the effect of time on the average measurement was linear .... but what if it increased and then decreased? By randomizing times, you eliminate the biases that would be caused by the fact that you measure group values at different points in time when time itself impacts the outcome, even if it does it in ways you don't anticipate.
