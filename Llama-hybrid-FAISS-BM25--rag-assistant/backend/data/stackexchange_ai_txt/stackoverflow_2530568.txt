Awesome, to find a question about my own extension on the front page of StackOverflow. Anyway, it's easier using a selector. This should do the job: #rtBtmBox p:nth-child(3) . However, if that paragraph has more contents, you might need something different (post or link the whole page if so). A regex that will probably work is: [^]*?
