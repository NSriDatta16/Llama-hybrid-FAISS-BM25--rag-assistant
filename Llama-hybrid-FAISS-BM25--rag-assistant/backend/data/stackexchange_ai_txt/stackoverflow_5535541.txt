Officially, only RDBMSs known to Hibernate are supported, so there's no support for nosql databases yet. There is a GSoC project proposed for developing support for AppEngine, and one of the research projects that XWiki is participating in, Compatible One , also needs cloud storage for XWiki. So, official support for clouds is going to come pretty soon.
