It depends on access to training data, computational budget, and desired performance level. Training embedding from scratch will require both training data and computational resources. If you have access to both, there is an increased chance of improved performance for subsequent supervised learning models. Using pre-trained embeddings require no training, thus no training data or computational resources. Those embedding may or may not be useful for the specific supervised learning task. One option is a hybrid approach of taking pre-trained embeddings and then fine-tuning them with project-specific data. This has all the advantages of using pre-trained embedding and can leverage task-specific data. This assumes you have access to the necessary computational budget and technical skills.
