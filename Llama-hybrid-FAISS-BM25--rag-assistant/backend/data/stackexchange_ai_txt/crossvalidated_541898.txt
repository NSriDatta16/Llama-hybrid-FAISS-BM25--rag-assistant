NN for resource management of an VM

Are there any papers/projects that deal with neural networks learning/adaptation for resource management (learning of system behavior and resource adaptation such as memory, CPU for an VM)? e.g. some logs are being observed by an NN that classify whether more resources are needed for the next particular time interval. Maybe you have an advice to above-written scenario and can give some tips on such points as and more: which type of model should be taken how to collect and preprocess data (system logs) other challenges etc. thanks!
