Being given a roadmap with a moving X is frustrating. TDD or no TDD.. 'having to spend majority of the time changing the tests instead of the code' indicates either that the specs were changed radically or you just over-mocked yourself a.k.a "fragile tests". I'd need more input from you to comment further. Spike/Prototyping means trying to build something as a proof of concept or validation a design. With this definition, I'd say that you don't need to TDD your proto because your primary goal is learning / reducing the unknowns. Once you've done that you should throw away your proto and build your production version with automated tests (use TDD now). You ship these to the customer not 'tested prototypes' However if manual testing has been working well for you, persist with it. I like to prove to myself and others that my code works at the push of a button - avoid human boredom of repetitive tasks and get thorough testing. Shipping Prototypes will bite you sooner and harder than you ever imagine. Take it from me.
