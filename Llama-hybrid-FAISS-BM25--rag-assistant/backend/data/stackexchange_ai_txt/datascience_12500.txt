Understanding genetic algorithms

What is a genetic algorithm, and what are its practical advantages over other algorithms? Is it similar to any commonly used machine learning algorithm like linear/logistic regression, neural networks, or tree-based methods like gradient boosting and random forests? I've heard it's based on "mutated" combinations of other models. Does this make it more like an ensemble?
