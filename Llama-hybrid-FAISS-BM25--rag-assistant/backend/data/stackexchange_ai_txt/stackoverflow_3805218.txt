MVC 2. My page jumps to the right when I change my selection in a dropdownlist

I am using nested master pages, which may or may not cause the problem here. My view looks like this; Christmas Shutdown Administration Before entering the Christmas shutdown dates, make sure you have entered in the Christmas bank holidays. Select the year: model.SelectedYear, Model.YearList)%> Enter the Christmas Shutdown dates here: Date Day Shutdown? $(function () { $("#SelectedYear").change(function () { var year = $("#SelectedYear").val(); $("#wholepage").load("/ChristmasShutdown/Create/" + year); }); }); The drop down list is in the second paragraph. The div #wholepage is defined in the main master page; --%> $(function () { $(".datePicker").datepicker({ showOn: 'both', dateFormat: 'dd/mm/yy' }); }); Staff Holiday Planner (SHP) v> The nested master page is as follows; So why is it when I change the selection in the drop down list that the page jumps to the right? How do I stop it?
