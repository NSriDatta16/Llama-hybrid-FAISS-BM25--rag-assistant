Does seasonality frequency matter in exponential smoothing?

I'm pretty new to time-series forecasting and I hope that someone could help me out. Referring to Holt-Winters' multiplicative method in https://otexts.com/fpp2/holt-winters.html , how does frequency of time series affect the performance of the model's predictions? Specifically, is there a difference if I take m = 7 vs m = 365? If it does, then is there any situation where the predictions are the same for different values of m? Thank you so much in advance.
