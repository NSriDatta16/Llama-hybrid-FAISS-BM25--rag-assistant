Why type of help can we get on stack Exchange: Datascience?

I have a text classification dataset. The aim is to predict the category of an article based on its title. I have about 100 categories and 10 thousands instances. I've tried models like RNN, LSTM. I've tried pre-trained word embedding models like GloVE. LSTM gave better results than RNN. I also got an improvement with Glove. As for BERT, I expected to have a better performance, but it was the opposite, as I had the worst performance with this model. I've never implemented BERT before. I've only followed tutorials and books I've read (so I don't know if it's because BERT doesn't perform well in this case or if it's because I haven't implemented it properly). So my problem isn't necessarily a bug in my code. But improving the performance of my model. Is this platform designed to help improve a model's performance (The reason I ask is that it's a bit like asking for a free lunch, asking people to improve their own model.) ? If so, I'd like to share the link to my dataset with the code I've written, including how I implemented the architecture of my BERT model. Thank you for your understanding
