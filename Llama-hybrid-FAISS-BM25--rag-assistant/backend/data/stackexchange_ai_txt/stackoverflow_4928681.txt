touchesMoved drag on UIImage after CGAffineTransformRotate Causes image to spin off screen

I'm not sure why after calling this CGAffineTransform method on a UIImageView and then trying to drag it, causes it to spin out of view. Any help is appreciated. - (void)setRotation:(Float32)rotation { CGAffineTransform transform = CGAffineTransformIdentity; transform = CGAffineTransformMakeTranslation(0.0,0.0); transform = CGAffineTransformRotate(transform, degreesToRadians(rotation)); [self setTransform:transform]; } - (void) touchesMoved:(NSSet*)touches withEvent:(UIEvent*)event { CGPoint pt = [[touches anyObject] locationInView:self]; CGRect frame = [self frame]; frame.origin.x += pt.x - startLocation.x; frame.origin.y += pt.y - startLocation.y; [self setFrame:frame]; }
