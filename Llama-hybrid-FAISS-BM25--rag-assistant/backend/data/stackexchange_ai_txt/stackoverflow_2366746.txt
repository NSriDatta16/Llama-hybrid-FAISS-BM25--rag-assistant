You can't, end of story. Even using email confirmation only proves that the email address was valid at that time. It could then be shut down a second later! Same for any other Internet based ID systems like OpenID, they can be set up and shut down just for the duration of the registration process. Even credit card ID can be one off since the invention of the disposable "debit" credit card. Only government ID systems are likely to be valid for any length of time. There are major security implications when collecting and validating government ID's though, and it is different for each country. It would be easier if all the governments could work together on one common system with a shared validation system including biometrics. Then Mossad couldn't steal passports so easily! They should set up a global community to organise it, maybe they could call it the UN? It shouldn't take long to sort out :-)
