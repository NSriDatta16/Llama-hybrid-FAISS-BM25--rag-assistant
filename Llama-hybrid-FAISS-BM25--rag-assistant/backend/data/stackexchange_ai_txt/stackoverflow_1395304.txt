If I read your question correctly and since you didn't mention it yourself you might be looking for the AdornerDecorator Class , which Provides an adorner layer for elements beneath it in the visual tree . Assuming from its name that ScrollPresenter is derived from ContentPresenter , it's worth noting that for implementing advanced custom controls you might want to surround their ContentPresenter by an AdornerDecorator , just like the Window Class does, see for example Donâ€™t forget the AdornerDecorator for a nice real work scenario involving drag&drop too. That is, by means of the AdornerDecorator you'll ensure the required AdornerLayer to be contained within your custom control, hence removing the need to retrieve it elsewhere by walking up the visual tree, e.g.: Depending on your particular scenario you might need an AdornerDecorator for your custom windows, your custom controls or both. See Adorners Overview for more details on the adorner architecture.
