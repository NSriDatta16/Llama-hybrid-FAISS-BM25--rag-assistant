There's a derivation of the average treatment effect formula on p. 240-241 of Guo and Fraser's Propensity Score Analysis , which has a chapter devoted to IPW. This is a useful book aimed at the applied researcher, but it also contains references to the primary literature. I don't know of any other textbook that covers this material very well.
