Is their a point in running a realization (simulation) for more than 1 iteration?

Let's say I have a schedule of jobs assigned on workstation, and I create a distribution for each combination of job/workstation based on historical data. I can now 'realize' the duration of one schedule by sampling the duration of jobs from the fitted distributions, doing this, we realize the schedule for 1 iteration. Would there be a point in realizing the schedules for more than one iteration? The goal would be to get a general overview of the length of a schedule, but if we run it for lets say 1000 (or an infinite) number of iterations the average total length would simply return to a sum of the average of the distributions we sample from. The only reason I can think of that we an overview of the variance of a schedule, am I missing something here?
