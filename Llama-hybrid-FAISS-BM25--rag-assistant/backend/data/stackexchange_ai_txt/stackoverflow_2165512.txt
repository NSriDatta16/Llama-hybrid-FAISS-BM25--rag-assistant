Context-based getElementById is 1000 time slower than native getElementById. Do selector engines like sizzle use a cleverer strategy?

Being interested in building html chunks off-dom before to insert them in the dom, I have done some testing using dynatrace. I used bobince's method : Is there any way to find an element in a documentFragment? I found it to be almost 1000 time slower (in IE7), which surprised me a lot. Since the function is pretty basic, I was wondering about the strategy used by engines such as sizzle. I would like to know if there is some more efficient ways to do context-based node selection ?
