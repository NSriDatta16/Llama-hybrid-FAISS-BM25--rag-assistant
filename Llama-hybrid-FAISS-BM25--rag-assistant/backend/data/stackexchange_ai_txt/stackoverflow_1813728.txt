In my experience blocks are the biggest contributing factor to making Ruby elegant. what's more elegant than writing each to iterate over arrays/hashes/etc... arr = ["one", "two", "three"] arr.each { |e| puts e } However I believe it's more than this, the elegance of the Ruby language also comes from the libraries. Most libraries have kept to using the unique Ruby 'style' for function names, such as 'each' for iteration or the usage of '!' and '?' at the end of function names for destructive/boolean returning functions, this is what really keeps Ruby 'elegant'.
