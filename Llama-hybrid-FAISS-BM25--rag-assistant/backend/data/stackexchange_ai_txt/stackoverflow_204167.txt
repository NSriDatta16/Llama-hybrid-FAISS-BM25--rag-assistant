How to get folder sharing on Windows Mobile emulator to work

I am developing an application using Windows Mobile 5.0, under embedded VC++ 4.0, and using the emulator for debugging. I need to copy some files onto the emulator and planned on using the option to map a directory to the emulator storage card. Problem is, this option is greyed out when I run the emulator. From the emulator help i get 'On the Emulator, run a Windows CE OS that supports the ability to connect to a directory on the development workstation. ' How do I accomplish this? I have seen the command line option /sharedfolder but can't get at this from platform manager under EVC++ 4.0. All comments welcome.
