(If you’ve never seen ANOVA as a regression, pretty much nothing in this post will make sense, so we’ll have to discuss that.) You’re basically doing ANOVA but with the response variable being a multinomial distribution instead of normal. In ANOVA, we compare a model that always predicts the overall mean (intercept only), and a model that that uses group membership as a predictor. If the latter model has a much better fit, then you conclude that the group membership affects the outcome. This is what the F-test does. You have the same idea but with a different response. ANOVA fits a mode by using square loss (least squares). Multinomial logistic regression uses maximum likelihood, so we compare the likelihoods of the two models: one that always predicts the overall proportions of each group (intercepts only) and one that also uses group indicator variables as predictors. If the model with group membership variables are predictors has much higher likelihood, we conclude that the group membership affects the response. This is quite analogous you the F-test. This is called a likelihood ratio test. I know that VGAM has machinery for fitting multinomial logistic regression models and conducting the likelihood ratio test, though I am not sure about nnet.
