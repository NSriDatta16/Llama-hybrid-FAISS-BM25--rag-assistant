How we can aggregate prediction from a forecast?

Let's say that I have a time series forecast of form: May 104.4 June 103.5 July 107.4 September 109.2 Afterwards I would like to compute an aggregated forecast for the period. Can I just compute simple mean of the forecast's means and prediction intervals? Is that a valid solution?
