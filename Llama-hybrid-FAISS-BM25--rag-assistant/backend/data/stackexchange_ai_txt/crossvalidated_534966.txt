Conversion rates without sample sizes (i.e. counts of those who convert vs. those who do not) are not useful. 25% could mean 25 out of 100 or 2500 out of 10,000. The precision of the estimate in the latter is greater than that of the former. If your design is a classic two groups-binary outcome, you can use any number of the tests I write about here . Significance here though is not really useful since large samples will nigh always yield a significant result. It might be better to analyze the expected loss vis a vis a Bayesian analysis.
