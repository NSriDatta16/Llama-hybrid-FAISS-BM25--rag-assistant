SVM-Light displays corrupted precision/recall results

I run SVM-Light classifier but the recall/precision row it outputs seem to be corrupted: Reading model...OK. (20 support vectors read) Classifying test examples..100..200..done Runtime (without IO) in cpu-seconds: 0.00 Accuracy on test set: 95.50% (191 correct, 9 incorrect, 200 total) Precision/recall on test set: 0.00%/0.00% What should I configure to get valid precision and recall?
