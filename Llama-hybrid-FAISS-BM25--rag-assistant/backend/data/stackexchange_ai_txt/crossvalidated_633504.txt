EDA and Model Selection for Forecasting while avoiding Data Leakage

How to do EDA and model selection for time series forecasting without data leakage? Im assuming just checking for missing values is ok. But is graphing the entire time series considered data leakage? I would avoid using stationarity tests and seasonality tests(and seasonal subplots) on the entire dataset, only on the training. But then my next question is: Assume I am using SARIMA/ARIMA, doing model selection with AIC and then doing walk forward evaluation, where i retrain the regression coefficients every window. If I want to redo the model selection for every few years that pass in this walkforward evaluation, is it valid to also do stationarity tests and seasonality subplots/tests on those windows? Like if I have an sliding window starting at point 1 to 1095; once my window is 730 to 1825, and I do model selection again on this window, and so on.
