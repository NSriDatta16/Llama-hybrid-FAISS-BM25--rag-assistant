Try SELECT group1 As Group, "X" as ColType, amtA1 as ColA, amtB1 as ColB, amtC1 as ColC UNION SELECT group1, "Y", amtA2, amtB2, amtC2 UNION SELECT group2, "X", amtA1, amtB1, amtC1 UNION SELECT group2, "Y", amtA2, amtB2, amtC2 UNION SELECT group3, "X", amtA1, amtB1, amtC1 UNION SELECT group3, "Y", amtA2, amtB2, amtC2 You can now easily group based on the "Group" column. although I would be having a "discussion" about table normalisation with someone in your organisation.
