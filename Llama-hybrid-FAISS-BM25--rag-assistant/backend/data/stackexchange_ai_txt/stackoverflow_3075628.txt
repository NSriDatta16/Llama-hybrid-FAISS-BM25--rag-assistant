Vista batch or vbs? read,write txt files, compare strings, run svn cmds

Would like to create a script that runs as a scheduled task in Vista to perodically check the revision number of an SVN repository. Compare the svn revision number to a revision number in a local text file. When the revision number changes do stuff. Overview: Get the current svn revision number. Store it in a text file. Read a one line text file into an environment variable, trim it to 4digits. svn revision numbers are in the following format: xxxxM Read one line from a local text file into an environment variable, trim it. Local revision numbers are stored in a text file in the following format: line1 ... bla. line2 ... bla, bla. "hostname text Rev[xxxx]". near last line. last line. compare the revision numbers. If they do not match, run svn update, rewrite the local text file with the current svn revision number. started on a batch file and began to wonder if this would be better suited to vbs.
