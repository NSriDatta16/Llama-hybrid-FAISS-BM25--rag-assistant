I had the pleasure of writing some plugins for ReSharper to make additional changes to the code layout and style (as per coding guidelines of a company I work at). It's not very easy, but the API is fairly rich, albeit very poorly documented, so using Reflector will be mandatory. I would suggest looking at the source code for great existing plugins, such as Agent Johnson and StyleCop for ReSharper . You can also try to get help at the ReSharper Open API forums at JetBrains. EDIT: Apparently I can't read. I thought you meant plugins for ReSharper. In that case I would begin by starting with the Visual Studio SDK, learning how to interact with the code, build the AST, etc. There are many examples provided in the SDK.
