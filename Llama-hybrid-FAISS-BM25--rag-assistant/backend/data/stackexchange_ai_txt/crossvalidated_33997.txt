The following may be good places to start. Clinical Prediction Models: A Practical Approach to Development, Validation, and Updating by Dr. E.W. Steyerberg Regression Modeling Strategies: With Applications to Linear Models, Logistic Regression, and Survival Analysis by our moderator, Dr. Frank E. Harrell I particularly like case studies. Dr. Harrell's book has one on "Predicting Cause of Death" and "Survival of Titanic Passengers". Dr. Steyerberg's book has a number of helpful case studies as well.
