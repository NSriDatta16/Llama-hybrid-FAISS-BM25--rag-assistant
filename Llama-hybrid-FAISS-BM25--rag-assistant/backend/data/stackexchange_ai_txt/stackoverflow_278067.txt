I agree with the first part of edg's answer, but where he says: "By setting objects to null when they are dead you can encourage the GC to reuse the memory consumed by those objects, this limiting the growing consumption of memory." is incorrect. You never need to set an object to null since the GC will eventually collect your object after it goes out of scope. This was discussed in this answer on SO: Setting Objects to Null/Nothing after use in .NET
