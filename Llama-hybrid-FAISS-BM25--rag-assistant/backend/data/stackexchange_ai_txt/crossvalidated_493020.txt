It looks to me like $\mathcal{N}(\mu,\tau^2)$ is the prior distribution of $a$ . Thus, you don't estimate $\mu$ , it is a parameter that describes your initial belief of $a$ -- often this is set to $0$ to encourage low weights unless you have reason to believe another mean is better. So after you see more data, you compute the posterior mean of $a$ using bayes rule. Then you can either set $a$ as the argmax of the posterior and perform linear regression (MAP estimate), or you can integrate out $\mu$ to derive a predictive distribution of $y$ , again using bayes rule.
