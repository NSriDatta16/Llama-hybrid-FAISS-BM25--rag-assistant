There are several ways to approach this problem, but the most straightforward I can think of is this one: If the population equation is $y = \alpha x^2 + \beta x + \gamma$ then the vertex is at $x_v = -\frac{\beta}{2\alpha}$ (as long as $\alpha\neq 0$) Equivalently, $2\alpha x_v-\beta=0$. Correspondingly, the fitted equation is $\hat y = a x^2 + b x + c$ and the estimated vertex is at $\hat{x}_v = -\frac{b}{2a}$ (if $a\neq 0$). Consequently, a set of values that form a $1-\alpha$ confidence interval (perhaps better called a consonance interval in this case) for $x_v$ are the values, $d$ which would result in acceptance of: $H_0: 2\alpha d-\beta=0$ at significance level $\alpha$. Such a set of values might be constructed relatively readily. (Indeed one needn't even be very smart about it, since without doing any algebra we can work our way out from $\hat{x}_v$ until the decision on the hypothesis test changes to rejection, and then perform a binary search, though this assumes the set of values resulting in acceptance form a single interval.) However, it looks to me like it's reasonably analytically straightforward, since we can, for any given $d$, write a t-interval and at a fixed significance level, for $2\alpha d-\beta$; that will involve $d$ in both the numerator and denominator of the t-statistic, simple manipulations yield a quadratic inequality in $d$, $Q(d) The equality is easily solved (involving coefficients in terms of $a$, $b$ and their variances and covariances), and it's then a matter of checking that $Q(\hat x_v)$ is negative and lies between those points of equality, whence you have a simple interval of values of $x_v=d$ that would not lead to rejection and which contains the naive point estimate $Q(\hat x_v)$. (criticism of this idea is encouraged; I may well be missing some obvious issue) A second approach would be to simulate or bootstrap the distribution of $\hat x_v$. The bootstrap distribution of $\hat x_v$ could be obtained by resampling (with replacement) $n$ rows of the augmented data matrix $A=[X|y]$ and computing the pseudo-sample point estimate $\hat x_v^*$ each time; there are various techniques for generating an interval from that, including the relatively simple 'take the middle $1-\alpha$ of the resampling distribution of $\hat x_v^*$'. Another form of bootstrap would be a parametric bootstrap (basically a kind of simulation) - one way to do that: if we condition on the observed $x$, we could simulate from the distribution of $y-\hat y$ to generate new samples, $y^*$ and proceed in similar manner to the nonparametric bootstrap above (but here we're simulating only the noise and condition on $x$, rather than the bivariate $(X,y)$. Simulation could be performed in a number of other ways. We could for example, simulate the distribution of $-\frac{\hat\beta}{2\hat\alpha}=-\frac{b}{2a}$ under normal assumptions and the same pattern of $x$s, though I believe the shape of that could depend on $\sigma$ (its best if some pivotal quantity is used as the basis for the simulation). Given we're trying to find an interval for a particular $x$, another way to look at the problem is as a kind of inverse regression problem , but there are some details to sort out here.
