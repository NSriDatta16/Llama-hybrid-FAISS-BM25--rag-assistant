What machine learning model would be indicated for this? You need more data. 30 data points is not a lot to work with, regardless of the approach. At best, I would say collapse the features onto the few principle components and then do a linear regression. That's about as best you could do from what you're telling us. What feature selection models would be useful, if any? None would be useful. Feature selection is known to be deficient for many reasons (many of which you can find here by searching other posts). At best, you can collapse the data into the first few principle components.
