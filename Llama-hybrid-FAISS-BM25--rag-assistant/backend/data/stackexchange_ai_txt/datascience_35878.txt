250 Categorical values

I have a dataset which has only categorical values. As I came across a few articles people suggested that KNN / Random forest would work for dataset like this. Though in R it couldn't handle as if contains more than 53 categories. Whereas in Sklearn, I used linear regression against each column to the column which I was predicting. After which I created a weighted average of all the outputs. But I'm pretty sure it's not the right way. Can anyone suggest a better way? PS : The dataset contains 4 columns with only categorical values. With 200 - 250 different categories in each column.
