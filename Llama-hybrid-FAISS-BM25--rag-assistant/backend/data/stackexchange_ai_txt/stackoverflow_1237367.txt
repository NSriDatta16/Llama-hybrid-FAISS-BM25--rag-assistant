including Modules in controller

I have done a module in lib directory in ruby on rails application its like module Select def self.included(base) base.extend ClassMethods end module ClassMethods def select_for(object_name, options={}) #does some operation self.send(:include, Selector::InstanceMethods) end end I called this in a controller like include Selector select_for :organization, :submenu => :general but I want to call this in a function i.e def select #Call the module here end
