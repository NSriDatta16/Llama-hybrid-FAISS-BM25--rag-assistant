Can I stop events from being dragged past start and end boundaries?

When events are draggable in fullcalendar, I can drag them up past the start hour and down past the end hour. This happens with a minTime and maxTime configured and when they are not configured (i.e. midnight to midnight). I need events to not be allowed to be dragged past the hour boundaries of the day or configured time range. I don't see anything in the documentation about stopping this behavior. Has anyone run into this issue and come up with a solution or does anyone have a solution to resolve this problem?
