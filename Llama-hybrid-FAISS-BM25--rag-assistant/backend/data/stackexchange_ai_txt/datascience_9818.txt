Is there any domain where Bayesian Networks outperform neural networks?

Neural networks get top results in Computer Vision tasks (see MNIST , ILSVRC , Kaggle Galaxy Challenge ). They seem to outperform every other approach in Computer Vision. But there are also other tasks: Kaggle Molecular Activity Challenge Regression: Kaggle Rain prediction , also the 2nd place Grasp and Lift 2nd also third place - Identify hand motions from EEG recordings I'm not too sure about ASR (automatic speech recognition) and machine translation, but I think I've also heard that (recurrent) neural networks (start to) outperform other approaches. I am currently learning about Bayesian Networks and I wonder in which cases those models are usually applied. So my question is: Is there any challenge / (Kaggle) competition, where the state of the art are Bayesian Networks or at least very similar models? (Side note: I've also seen decision trees , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 win in several recent Kaggle challenges)
