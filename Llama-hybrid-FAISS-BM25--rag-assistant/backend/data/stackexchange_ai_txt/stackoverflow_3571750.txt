*langPtr is the character 'E', not a pointer to that character. Edit: Whoops the question has changed and you are now using langPtr not *langPtr. I'll have another look. Hmmm. Okay sorry I should probably be offering comments rather than an answer, but having started an answer I'll continue it. Interestingly your code compiles fine in C++ rather than C, which we can probably take as an indicator that the problem is a subtle one. The compiler's error message is literally correct. The identifier langPtr is a variable not a constant, since you can change langPtr to point at other const char s. One work around is to substitute the string literal "English 1" rather than use langPtr in the array. The same workaround expressed slightly differently is to use the preprocessor to define langPtr instead, so; #define langPtr "English 1" Admittedly this is ugly, but maybe it will meet your needs. Finally, I would counsel against initializing any array in a header file. Declare variables in header files. Define (i.e. initialize) variables in .c files. Good luck.
