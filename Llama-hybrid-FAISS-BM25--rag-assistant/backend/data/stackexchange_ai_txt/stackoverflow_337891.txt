Does anyone know of a good article for creating MVC based components/ extension methods?

I've a couple of extension methods I've been developing for a couple of projects, they currently rely heavily on some AJAX to make bits and pieces work. The problem is that they require copying and pasting JavaScript files to the project you want to use it in. As this JavaScript file only needs to be used once (all instances of the rendered control use the same file) I'd like to do something like add the script element to the headers collection of the page it's used on via a web-resource (embedding the file as a resource in the assembly). In Web-forms this wasn't a problem - you could add a script block to the headers with a specific ID and simply check for it on page load. What's the MVC equivalent - is there an equivalent? I'd like a solution that doesn't require the consumer to copy and paste/ add lines to pages or config...any thoughts?
