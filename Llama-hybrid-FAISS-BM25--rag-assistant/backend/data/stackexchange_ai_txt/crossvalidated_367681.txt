Predict credible interval of Poisson-distributed response based on Lambda credible interval

I am approaching Bayesian inference. Could you review my steps and give me a hand with my model predictions? I am using a N-mixture model to predict how many individuals N of a rare species inhabit a site i based on the number of individual y observed at multiple visits k of the same site i (probability of detection p Ni ∼ Poisson(λ) yi,k ∼ binomial(Ni,p) βs and γs are the estimated effects of covariates that affect species abundance and detection probability: log(λ) = β0 + β1*x1 + β2*x2 logit(p) = γ0 + γ1*x1 + γ2*x2 So far: I sampled the posterior distribution of each β and γ (mean and standard deviation) with MCMC; since the posterior distributions of βs and γs were normal, I simulated 1000 times log(λ) and logit(p) using functions such as fun1 I used the link function on the simulated values (e.g., exponentiated the predicted log(λ) ) and created 95% credible intervals by selecting the interval between the 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles of my simulations. Now, what I need to do is to find a credible interval for $N_i$. I explored two approaches, but I wonder which one is correct (if any of the two $i$s) since results are different: a) simulate for each predicted lambda a discrete value using rpois. This returns credible intervals between discrete values, such as an average prediction abundance of 0.3 with 95% of predictions between 0 and 2 (Increasing the simulation number did not change the interval too much). b) use a loop to simulate for each lambda 1000 predictions with rpois, and then average them to obtain 1000 average predicted abundance values. This returns credible intervals between continuous values, such as an average prediction abundance of 0.3 with 95% of predictions between 0.15 and 0.45 (Increasing the simulation number tend to narrow the credible interval around the predicted mean). Any insight on which approach is correct (or on alternative approaches, if these approaches are not valid) will be much appreciated.
