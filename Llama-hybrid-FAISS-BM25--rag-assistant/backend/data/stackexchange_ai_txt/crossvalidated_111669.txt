time-series analysis Vs statistical signal processing

Is there a way to identify when to use time series analysis or signal processing. Time series data analysis can be divided to signal processing and normal time series analysis. In signal processing the data is analysed in frequency or time domain. In the frequency domain a spectral analysis is done by using Fourier or wavelet analysis. Normal time series analysis methodologies is divided to parametric and non parametric methods. For Example: ARIMA model. Why in some cases wavelet analysis is done? Its done specially from raw data signals from mechanical processes. Can't i do a ARIMA on this raw signal data? Are there any parameters in which i can i can identify when to use a wavelet analysis or a ARIMA model given a series of data?
