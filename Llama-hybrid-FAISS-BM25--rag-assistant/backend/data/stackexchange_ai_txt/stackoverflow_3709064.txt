Magento keeps record of all items sold in sales_order_entity , which you can retrieve like this: select * from sales_order_entity where entity_type_id = (select entity_type_id from eav_entity_type where entity_type_code = 'sales/order_item' ); By grouping by entity_id and counting the result, you can get an accurate total of the quantity_sold for a date range. You can see how Magento does this in Mage_Reports_Model_Mysql4_Order_Collection . From the code, it appears that Magento does in fact respect the date parameter. Just to be clear, this means that there is no single place where you can retrieve an "ordered_qty" number without more complex queries. The most obvious reason some products show as 0 is that they haven't sold anything.
