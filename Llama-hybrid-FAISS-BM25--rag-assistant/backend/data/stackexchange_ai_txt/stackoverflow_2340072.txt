What benefit does the user get from being told "There was a problem serializing the catalog"? I suppose your problem domain might be an extraordinary case, but every group of users I've ever programmed for would respond the same way when reading that message: "The program blew up. Something about the catalog." I don't mean to be condescending towards my users; I'm not. It's just that generally speaking my users have better things to do with their attention than squander it constructing a fine-grained mental model of what's going on inside my software. There have been times when my users have had to build that kind of an understanding in order to use a program I've written, and I can tell you that the experience was not salutary for them or for me. I think your time would be much better spent on figuring out how to reliably log exceptions and relevant application state in a form that you can access when your users tell you that something broke than in coming up with an elaborate structure for producing error messages that people are unlikely to understand.
