Multiple Imputation is never a bad approach. You could also do Full Information Maximum Likelihood. Good review and comparison here and here . But if you're going that route, consider using Stan to fit the ML imputation simultaneously with your regression as a single Bayesian model, since LASSO is a special case of Bayesian regression anyway .
