You state that the logistic models predict 0 for all validation examples. I assume you are taking a classification perspective on logistic regression where you are rounding a probability less than 0.5 of winning down to 0 = "lost" and a probability above 0.5 up to 1 = "won". I suggest you examine the probability of wining as a function of item price. I think you are interested in measuring the effect size of item price on probability of winning. In logistic regression it is common to look at the odds ratio. The odds ratio tells you the change in odds of success (e.g., winning) for a one unit change in the predictor (e.g., item price). You probably also want to account for the uncertainty in the estimate. Therefore, I suggest you calculate the 95% confidence interval for the odds ratio $ (OR_{LL}, OR_{UL}) = exp\left(\hat{\beta_1} \pm z_{1-\frac{\alpha}{2}}s_{\hat{\beta_1}}\right) $ where $\hat{\beta_1}$ is the estimated coefficient of item price in your model.
