In addition to the comment made by Oxbowerce , you can reason about it as follows: in a real case, you would expect the distribution of your X_train data to be similiar to the X_test data , so applying the MinMaxScaler transformer to the X_test data fitted "only" on X_train means (or should mean) no actual difference compared to fitting it also with X_test; after all, what this scaler does is finding the min and max values of such distribution and rescaling with these values. Nevertheless, you could refit your transformer from time to time in a production scenario if you get more and more data with all that available new data...
