It doesn't. Varchars define a maximum length. They use as much or as little space (plus a small fixed overhead) as the data they contain. The only thing you may need to consider is the total row length and this varies depending on what storage engine you use. See 13.2.14. Restrictions on InnoDB Tables : The maximum row length, except for variable-length columns (VARBINARY, VARCHAR, BLOB and TEXT), is slightly less than half of a database page. That is, the maximum row length is about 8000 bytes. LONGBLOB and LONGTEXT columns must be less than 4GB, and the total row length, including BLOB and TEXT columns, must be less than 4GB. If a row is less than half a page long, all of it is stored locally within the page. If it exceeds half a page, variable-length columns are chosen for external off-page storage until the row fits within half a page, as described in Section 13.2.11.2, “File Space Management”. and 10.5. Data Type Storage Requirements : The maximum size of a row in a MyISAM table is 65,535 bytes. This figure excludes BLOB or TEXT columns, which contribute only 9 to 12 bytes toward this size.
