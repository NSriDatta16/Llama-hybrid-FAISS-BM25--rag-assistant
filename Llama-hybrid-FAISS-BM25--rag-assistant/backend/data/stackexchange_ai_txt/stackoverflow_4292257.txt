Android: Why create specific images for ldpi, mdpi and hdpi?

I'm currently trying to support a larger range of devices with my Android app. However, even after reading through what the Android Dev Guide has to say on the issue, I'm unsure as to why I should provide different graphics for ldpi, mdpi and hdpi. I understand that the images will automatically be scaled, so I can just supply hdpi graphics and let the device do the rest. Will the scaling quality be lower if the device does it? Will it be a performance issue? Right now I'm more worried about multiplying APK size by three.
