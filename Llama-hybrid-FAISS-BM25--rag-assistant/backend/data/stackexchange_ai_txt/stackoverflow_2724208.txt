You forgot I want performance . A DBMS is a pretty low level data storage mechanism, and in systems with billions of rows, performance can be important. Therefore, if you want this sort of auditing system, you can build it yourself using the tools available to you (eg. triggers). Just as in a filesystem, not all files are appropriate for version control, in a database not all rows would be appropriate for version control either.
