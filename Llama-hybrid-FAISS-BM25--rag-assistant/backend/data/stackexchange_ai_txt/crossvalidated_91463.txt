Kyung et al. (2010), "Penalized regression, standard errors, & Bayesian lassos", Bayesian Analysis , 5 , 2 , suggest that there might not be a consensus on a statistically valid method of calculating standard errors for the lasso predictions. Tibshirani seems to agree (slide 43) that standard errors are still an unresolved issue.
