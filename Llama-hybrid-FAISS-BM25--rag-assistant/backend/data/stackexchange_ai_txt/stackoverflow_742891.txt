ASP.NET - Can you use Dynamic Data without Linq to SQL?

I have an application that creates database tables on the fly. I'd like to create an interface to CRUD this data. But because the tables are created as the application runs, I canâ€™t create the Linq to SQL classes by dragging them onto the designer. However, I do know in my code what the tables I want to edit are. Can anyone tell me if it is possible to supply a feed to Dynamic Data via: SQL query Or a DataSet, Rather than the Linq to SQL paradigm?
