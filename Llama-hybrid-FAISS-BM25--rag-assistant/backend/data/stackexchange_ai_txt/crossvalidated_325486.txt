Log return of sp500. Stationary vs strictly stationary

By first glance of this time series; will you say it is stationary? I can easily see some "seasonality" which means that this is not strictly stationary since the distribution will not be the same; higher variance around 1987 and 2008. But is it weakly stationary? The expected value at any timepoint will be zero, so I will say yes it is weakly stationary. Am I right?
