Directory structure of Zend framework and MVC on a shared hosting?

Ive just completed a small site with ZF in MVC pattern on my localhost and am now wondering what would be the most suitable way of structuring the directories.. I've read somewhere that it's best to have "application", "library" folders in a same folder one level above the "www" directory and set the include_path in the index.php file..so that all the core files are inaccessible from intruders or whatnot..? I run multiple sites on one shared hosting so what would be the best directory structure that is most organized and maintainable? Any suggestions and comments are greatly appreciated! Thanks
