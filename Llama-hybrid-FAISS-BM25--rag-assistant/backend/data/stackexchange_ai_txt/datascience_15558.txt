There are several ways in which you can achieve your desired result: Implement the make_scorer function from Scikit learn Make modification to the class_weight argument In regards to your SVM question take a look at the below code: class sklearn.svm.SVC(C=1.0, kernel='rbf', degree=4, gamma=0.0, coef0=0.0, shrinking=True, probability=False, tol=0.003, cache_size=300, class_weight=None, verbose=False, max_iter=-1, random_state=None) In the above example, the class_weight function can be changed to 'auto' or you can pass dictionary values which have the user-defined class weights.
