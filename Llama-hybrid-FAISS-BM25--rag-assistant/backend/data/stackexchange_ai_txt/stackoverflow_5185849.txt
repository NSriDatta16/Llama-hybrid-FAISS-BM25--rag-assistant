The best way and more maintainable way would be to use hashCode and use contains. public int hashCode() { return fooName.hashCode(); } This is must faster than for: loop. Althought it doesn't provide you O(1) complexity but it guarantees (theoretically) fixed retrieval ~ O(1) Also get() method does the same on hashMap. It uses hashCode to retrieve the object from the Map.
