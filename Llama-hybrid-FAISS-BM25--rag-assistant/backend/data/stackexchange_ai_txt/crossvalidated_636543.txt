How to choose a point that has both optimal value and low variance

I have a Gaussian Process Regression model that models the cost of a certain process. Once trained, I want to find the point $x$ corresponding to which the regression predicts the lowest cost. Simply choosing the point with the lowest expected value $\mu(x)$ does not seem intuitive because if the lowest point has high uncertainty (i.e. high variance, $\sigma$ ) then we might be better off choosing a point which is slightly sub optimal but has lower uncertainty. Edit: This is different from a Bayesian Optimization routine because I am not looking to acquire new points to update the model, I am looking to acquire new points to draw inference from the GP at its current state. I want to improve my likelihood of choosing the most optimal point such that when I run my process with those parameters, my cost is the minimum. A simple solution might be to consider a linear combination of both predicted mean ( $\mu$ ) and variance ( $\sigma$ ) instead of just mean $\alpha(x) = \mu(x) + \lambda \sigma(x)$ So now I am finding an optimal point $x$ wrt $\alpha$ rather than $\mu$ I am trying to see if anybody else has been able to solve this problem in a different way. I was unable to find any similar work online.
