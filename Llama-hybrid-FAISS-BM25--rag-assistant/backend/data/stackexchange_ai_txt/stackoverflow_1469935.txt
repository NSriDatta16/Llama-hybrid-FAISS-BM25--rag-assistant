What version of PyDev are you using? A recent one (1.5) or the old one referred by the Google tutorial? See this thread . There is a similar issue with PyROOT Since PyDEV plugin does not read $HOME/.pystartup , touching functions/ classes is not a solution. Because it analyze the syntax and structures of python modules to be imported not on-the-fly but when I set the PYTHONPATH from Eclipse's preference panel. So does your PYTHONPATH reference the Google library? They might be an issue with code completion in 1.5 which could force you to disable code analysis: Pydev 1.5.0 code anlaysis breaks code pyqt4 code completion - ID: 2855598 have pyqt 4.5.4 installed. Initially I had pydev 1.4.8 the open source version installed and code completion worked fine. After updating to pydev 1.5.0, pyqt code completion stopped functioning. After disabling the Pydev code analysis in "eclipse preferences -> pydev -> editor -> code analysis -> do code analysis?" , code completion began working again for PyQt classes etc.
