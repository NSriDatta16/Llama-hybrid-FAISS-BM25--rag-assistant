To my knowledge, to use ARCH/GARCH models you should have autocorrelation This applies to a squared time series, not raw, but this is actually what you have in your graph, so that is OK. It is a bit difficult to see, but some autocorrelations and partial autocorrelations at early lags (lag 1, perhaps also lag 2) appear to be statistically significant, though their sizes are not large. Thus, there are (weak) ARCH/GARCH patterns, and the time series is not white noise (though not necessarily very far from it).
