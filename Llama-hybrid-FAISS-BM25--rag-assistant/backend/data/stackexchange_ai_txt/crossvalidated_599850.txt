Approaches for testing a weighted coin to find the true probability

I have a question I've been wondering about. Say you have some weighted coin and you have a reasonable belief that it has a 1/10 chance of heads on a flip (although this is not necessarily the true probability). And after 5000 trials you obtain 455 successes. Is there any particular method that would be preferred for a) testing against the null hypothesis P=0.1 and b) estimating the true probability of heads on each flip? Would a Bayesian approach be significantly different than just doing a binomial test? Thanks in advance!
