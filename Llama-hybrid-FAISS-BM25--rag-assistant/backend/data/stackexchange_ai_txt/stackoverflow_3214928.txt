I put this demo with scripts and examples included together: http://www.mlynn.org/2010/06/mobile-device-detection-and-redirection-with-php/ This example utilizes php functions for user agent detection and offers the additional benefit of permitting users to state a preference for a version of the site which would not typically be the default based on their browser or device type. This is done with cookies (maintained using php on the server-side as opposed to javascript.) Be sure to check out the download link in the article for the examples. Hope you enjoy!
