In Magento, is there a way to remove attribute from configurable product after already created?

In Magento, I have have a bunch of configurable products already created and now have a client that has changed their mind and wants to remove one of the attributes. I'm having a hard time figuring out how to do this b/c I keep getting an error message saying: This attribute is used in configurable products. You cannot remove it from the attribute set. I have tried going into the attribute and changing Use to Create Configurable Product from "yes" to "no", but that didn't seem to do anything when trying to remove attribute from existing products
