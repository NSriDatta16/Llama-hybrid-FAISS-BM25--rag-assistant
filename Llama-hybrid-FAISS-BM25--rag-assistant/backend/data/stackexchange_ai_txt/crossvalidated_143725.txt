This two-block Gibbs sampler is the only generic case when sub-chains remain Markov chains per se, because $(X_1^{(n)})$ is generated via the kernel $$K(x_1,x_1^\prime)=\int f_2(x_2|x_1)f_1(x_1^\prime|x_2)\,\text{d}x_2$$ See our MCMC book for more details, but this is a case of interleaving property that also guarantees that the $X_1^{(n)}$'s are positively correlated with a correlation decreasing with the time difference and that Rao-Blackwellisation always reduce the variance of the resulting estimate. Two Markov chains $(X^{(t)})$ and $(Y^{(t)})$ are said to be conjugate to each other with the interleaving property (or interleaved ) if $X^{(t)}$ and $X^{(t+1)}$ are independent conditionally on $Y^{(t)}$; $Y^{(t-1)}$ and $Y^{(t)}$ are independent conditionally on $X^{(t)}$; and $(X^{(t)},Y^{(t-1)})$ and $(X^{(t)},Y^{(t)})$ are identically distributed under stationarity.
