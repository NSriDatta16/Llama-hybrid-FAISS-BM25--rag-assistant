Suppose we have 800 school-age subjects in Group A, of whom 683 are enrolled in school. And in Group B suppose corresponding numbers are 1001 out of 1100. Test of proportions. Then a test of proportions, prob.test This test uses the normal distribution to approximate normal probabilities, but sample sizes are large enough for good approximations. in R, gives the following results: prop.test(c(683,1001), c(800,1100)) 2-sample test for equality of proportions with continuity correction data: c(683, 1001) out of c(800, 1100) X-squared = 13.991, df = 1, p-value = 0.0001837 alternative hypothesis: two.sided 95 percent confidence interval: -0.08708815 -0.02541185 sample estimates: prop 1 prop 2 0.85375 0.91000 It is not clear whether the continuity correction is appropriate for such large samples. Here is the (very slightly smaller) P-value without the correction. prop.test(c(683,1001), c(800,1100), cor=F)$p.val [1] 0.00013692 Using a two-sample t test. If we use a t test on the same data, then we are comparing samples x and y : In x for Group A we have 683 $1$ 's and the rest of the observations are $0$ 's. In y , we have 1001 $1$ 's and the rest are $0$ 's. The t test is only approximate because data are not normal, but the sample size is large enough for the P-value to be a good approximation. The P-value is about 0.0002 or 0.0001 either way, so there is strong evidence that the groups differ. x = rep(1:0, c(683, 800-683)) y = rep(1:0, c(1001,1100-1001)) table(x) x 0 1 117 683 table(y) y 0 1 99 1001 t.test(x,y) Welch Two Sample t-test data: x and y t = -3.7026, df = 1495.5, p-value = 0.0002211 alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 95 percent confidence interval: -0.08604969 -0.02645031 sample estimates: mean of x mean of y 0.85375 0.91000 The P-value is about 0.0002, leading to the same interpretation as for the test of proportions. I would do the test of proportions, but would not want to disparage use of the t test.
