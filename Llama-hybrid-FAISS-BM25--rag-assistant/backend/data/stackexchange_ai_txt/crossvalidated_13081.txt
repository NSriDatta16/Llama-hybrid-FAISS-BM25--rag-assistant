For a combination of R with many of the methods you describe, in addition to the Maindonald and Braun text mentioned by @Jeromy Anglim, I would suggest you take a look at these two books by Julian Faraway: Linear Models with R Extending the Linear Model with R Both have reasonably simple introductions to the various topics, the latter covers a vast range of more modern approaches to regression, including many machine learning techniques, but does so at a faster pace with less description, and both exemplify the techniques via R code. You can get a code off the R Website's Books Section to give you 20% off the RRP if you buy direct from Chapman & Hall/CRC Press, but do check the Amazon price or similar for your region as often the reduction on Amazon is competitive with that of the publisher's price after the discount. One of the good things about this pair of books is that they give you a good flavour of the modern methods with enough detail to then explore the areas that you want to in further detail with more specialised texts. Some of the content that went into those books is available in an online PDF by Julian, via the Contributed Documents section of the R Website. I encourage you to browse that section to see if there are other docs that might get you started without you having to shell out any cash. An early version of the text that turned into the first edition of Maindonald and Braun's text can also be found in this section.
