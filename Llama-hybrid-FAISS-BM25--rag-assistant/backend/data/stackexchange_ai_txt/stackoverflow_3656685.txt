Somehow I doubt your statement "With Windows these two steps are possible with the Adobe Distiller" . I'd need to see with my own eyes that this works before I can believe it. This is especially true for the "replace multiple subsets of the same font with a single subsets" . (But I'm not in a position to verify or falsify the statement myself right now... so I'll just take it for a fact for the time being.) Type 3 fonts are described in a fully-fledged version of PostScript. Type 1 fonts are described by using a subset of the PostScript language. Replacements of embedded fonts are a non-trivial task when processing PDF files. I'm not familiar with any Ghostscript-related utility that could do that. callassoftware.com has a very powerful commandline utility for sale called pdfToolbox CLI 4 . It is available for Windows, Linux, Mac OS X and Solaris. pdfToolbox4 is capable of achieving practically everything you can imagine in so-called PDF preflighting jobs. This includes un-embedding of font subsets and re-embedding them again with their full sets (do it in 2 separate steps, so it might produce the result you want). That's about the only tool I can think of which could help you. (BTW, a part of callas' PDF preflighting technology is licensed by Adobe to pose in Acrobat 9 Pro as its own preflighting tool...)
