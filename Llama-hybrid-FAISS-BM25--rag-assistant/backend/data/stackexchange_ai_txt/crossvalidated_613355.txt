The point of doing statistical inference of any kind, be it hypothesis testing, creating confidence intervals, or using Bayesian methods, is to use the available data (the known) to infer something about a greater population from which the data are drawn (unknown) and quantify the uncertainty in your inference since you are dealing with the unknown. If you only have the known, you do not have to infer anything about the unknown, and hypothesis testing is superfluous. That said, it would be unusual to have the entire population under study. Indeed, the full “population” is typically a data-generating process (DGP) that is infinite. It might be that you really do have the entire population you want to study, but even if you do, it is possible that you really want to know about the DGP, and you can use the data to draw inferences about the DGP.
