organizing xcode 4.0 copy bundle resources

Is there an easy way to organize the files within the Copy Bundle Resources in xcode 4.0? I have multiple targets for my project, and every time I add files, I need to, most of the time, add them to every project. It would help a great deal if I had an easy way to catch myself when I mistakenly forget to copy resources to every target (other than just looking at the count of files in the bundle, which will eventually diverge from being the same for each project). It'd be a lot easier if I could make folders within the resources list, but it doesn't seem I can. At the very least it might help if I could automatically alphabetize them.
