Differences between Objective-C 2.0 vs. CLR in regards to memory managmenet

I've been learning to develop applications on the cocoa touch platform. I've come a long way but one piece that I can't wrap my head around is memory management. I thought I'd take a route of comparison rather than trying to start from scratch. I can't find much on the difference between the CLR (.net) and Objective-C 2.0 so I'm wondering if the stack overflow community can help me with this question. What are the key/important differences in memory management between Objective-C 2.0 and the CLR? With regard to Objective-C 2.0, I'm developing on the iPhone OS and the autorelease functionality is discouraged. I guess I'm looking for a comparison of the two... Since I'm coming from a .NET background, what might be things I need to know about Objective-C 2.0 memory management? Thank you all!
