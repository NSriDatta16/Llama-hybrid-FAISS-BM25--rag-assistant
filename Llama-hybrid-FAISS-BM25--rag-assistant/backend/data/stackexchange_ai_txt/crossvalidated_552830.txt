Property of unbiased estimators

If $f(x)$ and $f(y)$ are both unbiased estimators of $\mu$ , aka $E[f(x)]$ = $E[f(y)]$ = $\mu$ , is it possible that $f((x+y)/2)$ is also an unbiased estimator of $\mu$ ? We know $f((x+y)/2)$ would be unbiased if the function $f$ satisfies the linearity condition, so $f((x+y)/2) = (f(x) + f(y)) / 2$ . But what if linearity condition doesn't hold? Could we think of an example? Some context: I am thinking about this in the context of the sigmoid function in a neural network. When ensembling two models, we can average the probabilities, e.g. $\frac{sigmoid(x) + sigmoid(y)}{2}$ . If each probability is an unbiased estimation, the ensemble probability would also be unbiased. But if average in the log odds space, aka use $sigmoid(\frac{x + y}{2})$ . Would it still be unbiased?
