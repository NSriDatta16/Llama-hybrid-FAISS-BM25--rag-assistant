I've made very good experiences with answering these questions first: How does the team prioritize work? (I would recommend putting todos into a sequence building a backlog) How does the team track what needs to be done? (I would recommend breaking things down step-by-step into User Stories and track them using a tool like PivotalTracker) How can you make sure the team is self-organizing? (Let the team pull work from the backlog, run daily status meetings and a retrospective every couple of weeks) How can you optimize how fast features get delivered in optimal quality? (This way of thinking should replace the idea of maximizing capacity utilization) How can you make the work visible? (Visibility builds trust and momentum - you can start collecting metrics and putting up a screen showing all kinds of graphs)
