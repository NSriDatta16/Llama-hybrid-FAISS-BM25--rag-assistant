I see you've had no answers yet - I'm certainly not sure of what the right answer is for you, but here's my view for what it's worth. I might have misunderstood, but if I was trying to enforce fine-grained access controls for roles/groups to resources, I would do it in the application rather than in the data storage solution. I don't know if that's an option for you in this case, but if you do that security in the data layer, you might run into problems down the line with a lack of flexibility and perhaps even vendor lock-in if you end up using proprietary extensions. Very interested in any supporting/conflicting perspectives here.
