Am I interpreting logistic regression coefficient of categorical variable correctly as a probability?

Since this is easy to get wrong, I wanted to spot check my line of thinking: I have a logistic regression $Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X$, where $Y$ is a binary response and $X$ is a categorical variable with four categories. If one of the categories has a coefficient of $c$, then is it correct to say that the probability of a sample being positive increases by $e^{c}/(1+e^{c})*100$ percent if it is a member of that category? This answer and what I've been taught seems to suggest this, but I just wanted to double check since this is a categorical variable. EDIT: Increases in probability relative to the level of the categorical variable left out in the regression, so to speak.
