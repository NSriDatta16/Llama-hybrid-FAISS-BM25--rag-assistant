The CakePHP way to run crons is to build your own shells to do the tasks. Shells allows you full access to all of your controllers through the command prompt. Be sure to read this documentation when starting: http://book.cakephp.org/view/108/The-CakePHP-Console It shows you how to build your own shells (app/vendors/shells/), how to organize your shells into tasks, and how to properly run your shell as a cron job. I do it a slightly different way than the documentation describes. My cron statement looks like: * * * * * (cd /path/to/my/cake/app; sh ../cake/console/cake daily;) 1> /dev/null 2>&1 From there I simply have a shell called app/vendors/shells/daily.php User->processDailyTasks(); } } ?> This is far better and more stable than using curl in a cron job.
