Without getting down into the "whine" mode.. I'd choose to answer the "Dealing with it" part of the question. I've reached the following options from my experience Somewhat-Easy way: Quit and find a place that is more to your liking... I say somewhat easy because of misc. sub-problems: 'agile' workplaces may not exist in your immediate vicinity.. relocation may not be a feasible approach, the people in an agile workplace may be 'non-agile', The middle path: Continue to be agile personally. Help and teach others who are interested.. Maybe the org. will change slowly for the better.. Hope for the best and pray that you do not reach the 'quitting point of no-return' The super-hard way: Strive to bring about change in your organization. This is not everyone's cup of tea. The culture of an organization cannot be changed within a short time... you need a "Local Sponsor" in management to start anything substantial. Couple that to the fact that you can't really change another person except yourself. So if you're passionate, patient, relentless, highly optimistic and willing to slug it out, I'd recommend " Fearless Change " with all my heart. (source: informit.com )
