No stylesheet was loaded

I am using C# code in aspx pages to covert the infopath xml pages into html. Here is my code: XPathDocument myDoc = new XPathDocument(@"C:\Users\rameshgandhik\Documents\infopath forms\ram.xml"); XmlTextWriter myWr = new XmlTextWriter(@"C:\Users\rameshgandhik\Documents\infopath forms\ram.html",null); XslTransform myXsl = new XslTransform(); myXsl.Transform(myDoc, null, myWr); // Here i am getting an error. At myWr in Transform method it is showing an error that "No stylesheet was loaded.". Can any have the idea about this error......... Please tell me the solution....
