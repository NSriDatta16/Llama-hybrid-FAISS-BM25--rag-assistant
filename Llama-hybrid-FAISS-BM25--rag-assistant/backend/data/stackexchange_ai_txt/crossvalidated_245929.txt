Hypothesis Testing of means

Can anyone help me out with this question? My notes & textbooks just aren't giving me the explanations I need. The average household size in a certain region several years ago was 3.14 persons. A sociologist wishes to test, at the 5% level of significance, whether it is decreased now. Preform the test using the information collected by the sociologist: in a random sample of 75 households, the average size was 2.98 persons, with a sample standard deviation 0.82 person. 1. State the null and the alternative hypotheses. A. Ho: = 3.14 & Ha: B. Ho: = 3.14 & Ha: > 3.14 C. Ho: = 3.14 & Ha: ≠ 3.14 D. Ho: = 2.98 & Ha: ≠ 2.98 E. Ho: = 2.98 & Ha: > 2.98 I believe the answer would be B, but I am unsure if that's correct. 2. Compute the value of the test statistic. A. -1.69 B. -2.73 C. 1.69 D. 2.73 E. -0.195 I tried using this formula, but I am not getting any of the above answers. t= mean - standard deviation/ s/√n I believe the answer is A. I plugged the numbers from the problem into the STAT-TESTS- Z-Int. What is the rejection region? A. (- infinity, -1.96] B. [1.96, + infinity) C. (- infinity, -1.64] D. [1.64, + infinity) E. (- infinity, -1.96] ∪ [1.96, + infinity) I believe the answer would be A. because it is a left-tailed test since the test statistics is negative. 4. Based on the evidence can you make a decision for the sociologist. I believe you do not reject Ho.
