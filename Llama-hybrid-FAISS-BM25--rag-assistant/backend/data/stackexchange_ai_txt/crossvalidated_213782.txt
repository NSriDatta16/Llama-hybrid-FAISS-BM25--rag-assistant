XGBoost on Python: Plot performance

following the instructions from https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python/python_intro.html after building my model, i tried on Jupyter (using Mac OS X, Chrome browser) import pandas as pd import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt plt.style.use('ggplot') xgb.plot_importance(bst) xgb.plot_tree(bst, num_trees=2) xgb.to_graphviz(bst, num_trees=2) but i have some problems: the to_graphviz does return me a plot, but its too big, and i can't see it whole. Its cut on the right side the first two commands (if i put a # in front of the last line) don't show any plot at all. is there something like a.show() missing ? Instead i get the following output "matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x12f0ee7d0" (between <>) can anyone help ? thank you
