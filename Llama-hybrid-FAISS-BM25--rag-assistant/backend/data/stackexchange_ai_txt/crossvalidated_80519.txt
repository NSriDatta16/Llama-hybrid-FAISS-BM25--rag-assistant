Number of observations used for ARIMA modeling

Our professor keeps on writing in his slides that when you test different ARIMA models on your time series, one always has to keep T fixed. I assume he is talking about fitting your model using the same number of observations. If you try a model with a higher lag, you loose one observation to fit the data on. Is this correct? Is this why he writes restrict your sample? We have 214 observations, should I for example to be on the safe side only use 205 observations? And how does Eviews know to always use the same number of obersations? Ref screenshot: Thanks in advance.
