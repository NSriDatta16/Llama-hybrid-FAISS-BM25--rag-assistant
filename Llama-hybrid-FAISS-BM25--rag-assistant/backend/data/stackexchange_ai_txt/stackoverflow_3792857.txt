You most certainly don't want to go messing with the file system directly. Let the OS worry about that. If you have to ask this question, you probably don't have the requisite knowledge to manipulate things at that level with greater efficiency that the OS does. Rather than adding data in the middle of a huge file, consider a different solution that allows you to append data to the end of the file. (Or is some more efficient way). Also, if you're dealing with a huge amount of data, maybe a database would be more efficient than a gargantuan file. I would be interested in hearing more about what you're trying to do. Perhaps there's an easier way.
