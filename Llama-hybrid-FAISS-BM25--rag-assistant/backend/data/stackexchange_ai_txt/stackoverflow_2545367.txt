WYSIWYG editors for complex web site/applications just never measure up IMHO . The problem comes down to wanting control of the HTML/CSS markup, yet also the flexibility to create a GUI via drag-n-drop. (the 2 are almost polar opposites) Take a very simple example. In WYSIWYG mode, I type/create (pretend that World is on the line right after Hello (the Markdown editor forces me to add an extra line break)): Hello World What HTML should the editor create? Hello World Hello World Hello World Hello World (and a zillion more possibilities) I still think the best thing you can have is an editor/IDE that understands your component/tags and provides auto-completion and code-assist/intellisense - paired up with a very quick deploy option to test changes ASAP in real browser(s)
