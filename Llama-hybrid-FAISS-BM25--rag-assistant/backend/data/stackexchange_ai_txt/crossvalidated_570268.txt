It seems like the early fusion, mid fusion, or late fusion in this paper: Multimodal Bottleneck Transformer (MBT): A New Model for Modality Fusion . Multimodal features are just more dissimilar features, and sometimes you can change one modal into another. For instance, you can change (predefined) events into words. If your features are put as a whole into the neural network earlier(the inputs can be treated as the first hidden/fusion layer), feature fusion would happen earlier, otherwise later. Late fusion has its benefits: restricting feature connections to later layers, allowing earlier layers to specialize in learning unifeature features; and you can also benefit from early fusion because if your input features share lots of similar sub-features, they can connect earlier. It depends on the features of your features/inputs. In your specific scenario, it would be better to decide if the two features matter in time order. If so, it would be better to encode the time order in some form, either in early fusion or late fusion layer.
