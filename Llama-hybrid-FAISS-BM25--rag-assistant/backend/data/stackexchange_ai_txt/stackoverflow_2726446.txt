You can use a technique similar to MIP mapping for efficient zooming. In a nutshell, you prepare images that are 1/2, 1/4, 1/8 and so on dimensions of your original image and load/display them according to required zoom level. This will save some scaling computations at the cost of storage space (roughly 1/3 more storage space will be needed). As for panning the idea could be to have some tiles preloaded around the visible area. If a user is panning in a particular direction the panning speed could taken into account to preload more tiles in that direction.
