No, in PHP if you want to run object's method or read/write property from inside of object you must write $this to refer that object instance. PS. You can do at the beginning of each method something like this: $s = $this and use $s then, but it's strongly unrecommended , you shouldn't do that and it will be best, if you forget that you read this paragraph :)
