The class-model does not affect anything with your code. As long as your class is said to inherit from UIViewController SubViewController : UIViewController then you are fine. Depending on how many classes you are modeling at once you may have hundreds of lines very close together and you may not be able to see a specific arrow unless you drag your SubViewController way away from everything else. try selecting just that class and see if you get the arrow then. Even if you don't see the arrow it does not mean you have a problem, if you want to be sure that UIViewController is the superclass of SubViewController then just add this chunk of code to your SubViewController class: +(void)initialize { NSLog(@"My class is: %@, my superclass is: %@.", [self class], [self superclass]); }
