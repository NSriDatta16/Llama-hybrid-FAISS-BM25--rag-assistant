Confidence interval for a multiple of regression coefficient

I am trying to model relationship between length of stay of patients in hospital(Y) vs Age in years(X). The data set I've got doesn't specify the unit of length of stay. So now estimated value of my coefficient for age is $ b_1 = 0.084 $. So if a patient was 12 years older than he is currently then his stay will increase "on an average" by 1 unit of time. However I can only give a precise (say 99% precise) estimate by confidence interval. But this confidence interval will have small boundaries like 0.003 to 0.3, which is slightly unexplanabale for layman listener. One way is that I create a new random variable $ b_2 =12b_1$ and its standard error will be $ 12 \cdot \hat s\{b_0\} $. And this variable will be t-distributed with $ n-2 $ degrees of freedom. Using this I can build 99% confidence interval on the true value of my new random variable $b_2$ . And then I can use it for interpretation. Am I doing it correctly?
