How do I prevent dragging outside the parent container in Flex/Flash?

I have a canvas onto which I draw shapes like rectangle etc. When I move the shape using my custom mouse down/mouse move handler, the shape can go outside the parent bounds. I am checking if the child is outside the parent's bound to snap it back: var bounds:Rectangle = this.getBounds(this.parent); var p:Point; if (bounds.x this.parent.height) { if (!p) p = new Point(0,0); p.offset(0,-bounds.y-height+this.parent.height); } if (bounds.x+bounds.width > this.parent.width) { if (!p) p = new Point(0,0); p.offset(-bounds.x-width+this.parent.width,0); } if (p) { trace("invoking snapInside ", p); snapInside(p); The snapInside method gets called when I go outside the left or top boundary. But when the child is dragged outside the right or bottom boundary, I find Flex/Flash runtime automatically expands the parent's height and width. So say the parent size was initially 800x600, if child Y bounds exceed 800 by say 20 pixel, I find the this.parent.height automatically resized by flex to 820!! How do I prevent the parent from resizing when child goes outside the original bounds of the parent ?
