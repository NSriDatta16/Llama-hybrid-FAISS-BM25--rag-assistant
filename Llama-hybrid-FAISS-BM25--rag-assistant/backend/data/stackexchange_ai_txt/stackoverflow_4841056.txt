Looks like you're using RBJ's biquad cookbook recipe. A biquad peaking filter with an average gain of 1.0 has a gain above 1.0 at certain frequencies. If you don't want clipping, you either have to use a gain of less than 1.0, or use an attenuator or AGC on the input so that the peak frequency boost never gets to a level that will clip. It's a problem without an AGC, since some customers expect a peaking or bass boost filter to make things louder, and you have to attenuate the average level to actually lower to completely prevent clipping at the peaking frequency.
