The exponentiated numberofdrugs coefficient is the multiplicative term to use for the goal of calculating the estimated healthvalue when numberofdrugs increases by 1 unit. In the case of categorical (factor) variables, the exponentiated coefficient is the multiplicative term relative to the base (first factor) level for that variable (since R uses treatment contrasts by default). The exp(Intercept) is the baseline rate, and all other estimates would be relative to it. In your example the estimated healthvalue for someone with 2 drugs, "placebo" and improvement=="none" would be (using addition inside exp as the equivalent of multiplication): exp( 1.88955 + # thats the baseline contribution 2*-0.02303 + 0 + 0 ) # and estimated value will be somewhat lower [1] 6.318552 While someone on 4 drugs, "treated" , and "some" improvement would have an estimated healthvalue of exp( 1.88955 + 4*-0.02303 + -0.01271 + -0.13541) [1] 5.203388 ADDENDUM: This is what it means to be "additive on the log scale". "Additive on the log-odds scale" was the phrase that my teacher, Barbara McKnight, used when emphasizing the need to use all applicable term values times their estimated coefficients when doing any kind of prediction. This was in discussions of interpreting logistic regression coefficients, but Poisson regression is similar if you use an offset of time at risk to get rates. You add first all the coefficients (including the intercept term) times eachcovariate values and then exponentiate the resulting sum. The way to return coefficients from regression objects in R is generally to use the coef() extractor function (done with a different random realization below): coef(test) # (Intercept) numberofdrugs treatmenttreated improvedsome improvedmarked # 1.18561313 0.03272109 0.05544510 -0.09295549 0.06248684 So the calculation of the estimate for a subject with 4 drugs, "treated" , with "some" improvement would be: exp( sum( coef(test)[ c(1,2,3,4) ]* c(1,4,1,1) ) ) [1] 3.592999 And the linear predictor for that case should be the sum of: coef(test)[c(1,2,3,4)]*c(1,4,1,1) # (Intercept) numberofdrugs treatmenttreated improvedsome # 1.18561313 0.13088438 0.05544510 -0.09295549 These principles should apply to any stats package that returns a table of coefficients to the user. The method and principles is more general than might appear from my use of R. I'm copying selected clarifying comments since they 'disappear' in the default display: Q: So you interpret the coefficients as ratios! Thank you! – MarkDollar A: The coefficients are the natural_logarithms of the ratios. – DWin Q2: In that case, in a poisson regression, are the exponentiated coefficients also referred to as "odds ratios"? – oort A2: No. If it were logistic regression they would be but in Poisson regression, where the LHS is number of events and the implicit denominator is the number at risk, then the exponentiated coefficients are "rate ratios" or "relative risks".
