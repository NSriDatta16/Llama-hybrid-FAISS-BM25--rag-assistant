I just ran into a similar problem. I'm not sure if I 100% understand the solution but I basically got it working like this: $.get('/ajax.php?action=roomList&restriction='+limit, function(data) { $('#roomList').html(data).fadeIn(); $('.cb').colorbox({maxWidth:500,maxHeight:700}); }); In my links I have class = cb to hook into colorbox. The maxWidth and maxHeight are there because on firefox the new colorbox that popped up was HUGE for some reason... If anyone has a more elegant solution please let me know. I remember when I used to use thickbox there was a similar process for ajax loaded content since the new stuff wasn't around when the original page loaded.
