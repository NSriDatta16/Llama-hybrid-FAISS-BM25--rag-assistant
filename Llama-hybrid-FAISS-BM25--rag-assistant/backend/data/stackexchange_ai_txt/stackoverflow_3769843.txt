You have two options to choose from, the first being to roll your own subclass of JTree that goes roughly like this: public class MyTree extends JTree { public MyTree() { final MyTreeModel m = new MyTreeModel() super.setTreeModel(m); super.setSelectionModel(m.getSelectionModel()); } /** * your tree model implementation which fiddles * with sm when "move" is called */ private class MyTreeModel implements TreeModel() { private final DefaultTreeSelectionModel sm; public MyTreeModel() { this.sm = new DefaultTreeSelectionModel(); } public TreeSelectionModel getSelectionModel() { return this.sm; } } } This way you always have the selection model at hand when needed and you can modify it in your move method. On the other hand similar functionality already exists in the drag and drop support, and the boilerplate to support DnD in considerable but managable (plus, you get, well, DnD support in your tree). The problem is that I do not know how to trigger a DnD event programmatically.
