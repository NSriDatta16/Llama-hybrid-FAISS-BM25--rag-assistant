Hot Encoding in production

I am using spark to perform random forest classification in a data frame with following structure amount marital gender sector 10000 married male agri 12421 single male agri 14000 single female business 20000 marital female business I am trying to predict the sector, using other variables. As you can see marital and gender both are categorical, spark can only handle numeric data thus these have to hot encoded Expected structure amount marital_married marital_single gender_male gender_female sector 10000 1 0 1 0 agri 12421 0 1 1 0 agri 14000 0 1 0 1 business 20000 1 0 0 1 business Questions: How predicted model handle new class in marital, does the model always expect the same data format that is a wide dataset which is hot encoded for every possible combination for every categorical column? How does the model predict the sector, as a number(1) or as string (Agri)? Basically i am trying to understand how models which use hot-encoding work and how they are used in production grade settings! Hope I was clear in my questions
