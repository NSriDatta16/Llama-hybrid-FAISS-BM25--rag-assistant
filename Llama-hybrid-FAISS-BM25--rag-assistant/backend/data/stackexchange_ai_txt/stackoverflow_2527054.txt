You could check the userAgent like this: return navigator.userAgent.indexOf(\"Mac OS X\") != -1 But, this isn't a reliable method as it can be spoofed...but since there is no javascript absolute for this, not a terrible option. Feature detection is a better alternative if you want to see what the browser will/won't support...depends if you're after metrics of actually enabling/disabling features.
