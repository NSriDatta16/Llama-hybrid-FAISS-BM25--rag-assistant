What non-Bayesian methods are there for predictive inference?

In Bayesian inference a predictive distribution for future data is derived by integrating out unknown parameters; integrating over the posterior distribution of those parameters gives a posterior predictive distributionâ€”a distribution for future data conditional on those already observed. What non-Bayesian methods for predictive inference are there that take into account uncertainty in parameter estimates (i.e. that don't merely plug maximum-likelihood estimates or whatever back into a density function) ? Everyone knows how to calculate prediction intervals after a linear regression, but what are the principles behind the calculation & how can they be applied in other situations (e.g. calculating an exact prediction interval for a new exponential variate after estimating the rate parameter from data)?
