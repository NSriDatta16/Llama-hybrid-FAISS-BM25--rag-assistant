I just uploaded a brand new online Sankey Builder. You can upload data, configure via a wide range of tools and save. It allows you to drag and drop fields from your data to customize the Sankey Flow and dynamically add filters on any field in the diagram to squeeze the data. It has automatic highlights of bands across the diagram to highlight data relationships, and you can even mix and match colors. It features automatic paging for large data sets! A sort feature operates by value or field in ascending order. All settings can be saved for a future visit. The tool includes a share feature which allows you to enable or disable any of the settings. The unique URL created by the tool allows you to distribute the Sankey Diagram to visitors for a read-only interactive version of Sankey Builder! Check out the demo (see below). You can even build a free Sankey diagram which is hosted for free. Simply visit http://SankeyBuilder.com and signup (all you need is an email address). That will get you access to SankeyBuilder for free. Demo: http://sankeybuilder.com/sankeybuilder.aspx?url=bbe34d97f8 and Tutorials are at http://sankeybuilder.com . Hope this helps.
