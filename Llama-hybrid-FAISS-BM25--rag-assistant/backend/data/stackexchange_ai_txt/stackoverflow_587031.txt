Interestingly, Jakob Nielsen recently (March 2008) posted an "update" to his classic usability guidelines, listing some situations in which he now considers it a better idea to put the site name on the tag before the specific page name / page content. From http://www.useit.com/alertbox/microcontent-brand-names.html : Start search engine links with your company name when both of the following conditions hold: The link appears as a hit for queries that typically produce a SERP (search engine results page) that's full of junk links. You have a widely recognized and well-respected company name. ... Note that this new guideline applies only to the links that appear in external search engines, such as the GYM (Google, Yahoo, Microsoft). Amazon.com is currently doing this. For example, the title of the Amazon.com page for the classic "Gang of Four" design patterns book is "Amazon.com: Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software": http://www.amazon.com/dp/0201633612/
