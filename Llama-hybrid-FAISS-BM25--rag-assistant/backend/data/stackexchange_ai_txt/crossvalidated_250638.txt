Are neural networks able to separate these classes?

I know that MLP can separate classes even if the decision boundary is nonlinear. However, in all cases that I've seen the boundary was just a single 'unclosed' line. Is the MLP able to solve the problem when one class is inside the other? (i.e. the decision boundary is not unclosed line but a circle) What about the situation when one class is separated by some points of the other class? (i.e. two circles are needed) If the answer to any of the above is "yes", what is the minimal architecture that is able to do such separation (type of network, number of layers, number of units)?
