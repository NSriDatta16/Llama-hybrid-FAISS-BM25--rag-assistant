I would like more details regarding your actual problem, but here is my suggestion to apply artificial neural networks for decision making. One way of approaching this problem is by using priori as one of the parameters for a deep neural network. This could be treated as similar as a classification problem with the basis of supervised learning. The desired decisions and its parameters can be labelled and the output layer can have as many neurons as the desired number of decisions. Then series of training and validation can be conducted until the training reaches expected accuracy. Best, Sangathamilan Ravichandran.
