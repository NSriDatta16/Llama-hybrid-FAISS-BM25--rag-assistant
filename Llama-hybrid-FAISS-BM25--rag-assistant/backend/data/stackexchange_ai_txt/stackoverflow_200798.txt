That depends on what exactly you want to achieve, but the function String.substring() will be in there somewhere: String myString = "Hello World"; This will print the substring starting from index 6 to the end of the string: System.out.println(myString.substring(6)); This will print the substring starting from index 0 until index 5: System.out.println(myString.substring(0,5)); Output of all the code above: World Hello Combine this with the other String functions ( indexOf() . etc.) to achieve the desired effect! Re-reading your question, it looks as though you may have been looking for String.split() . This will split your input string into an array of strings based on a given regex: String myString = "Hi-There-Gang"; String[] splitStrings = myString.split("-"); This will result in the splitStrings array containing three string, "Hi" , "There" and "Gang" . Re-reading your question again, String.split is not available in J2ME, but the same effect can be achieved with substring and indexOf .
