Speeding up database access

I have a database containing records collected every 0.1 seconds, and I need to time-average the data from a given day to once every 20 minutes. So I need to return a day's worth of data averaged to every 20 minutes which is 24*3 values. Currently I do a separate AVG call to the database for each 20-minute period within the day, which is 24*3 calls. My connection to the database seems a little slow (it is remote) and it takes ~5 minutes to do all the averages. Would it be faster to do a single query in which I access the entire day's worth of data then average it to every 20 minutes? If it helps to answer the question, I have to do some arithmetic to the data before averaging, namely multiplying several table columns.
