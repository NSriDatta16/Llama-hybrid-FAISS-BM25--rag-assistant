From the documentation: wxTopLevelWindow::RequestUserAttention void RequestUserAttention(int flags = wxUSER_ATTENTION_INFO) Use a system-dependent way to attract users attention to the window when it is in background. flags may have the value of either wxUSER_ATTENTION_INFO (default) or wxUSER_ATTENTION_ERROR which results in a more drastic action. When in doubt, use the default value. Note that this function should normally be only used when the application is not already in foreground. This function is currently implemented for Win32 where it flashes the window icon in the taskbar, and for wxGTK with task bars supporting it.
