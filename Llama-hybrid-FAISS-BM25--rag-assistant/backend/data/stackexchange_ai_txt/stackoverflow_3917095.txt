On state select change country

I have two lists (one of states) and one of (countries). I want to have it so when a user selects Alberta it sets the country to Canada, and so on and so forth. I have the following javascript var states = new Array(12) states[0] = "AB"; states[1] = "BC"; states[2] = "MB"; states[3] = "NB"; states[4] = "NL"; states[5] = "NT"; states[6] = "NV"; states[7] = "NS"; states[8] = "ON"; states[9] = "PE"; states[10] = "QC"; states[11] = "SK"; states[12] = "YK"; function oc(a) { var o = {}; for(var i=0;i State List Alberta British Columbia Manitoba New Brunswick Newfoundland Northwest Territories Nunavut Nova Scotia Ontario Prince Edward Island Quebec Saskatchewan Yukon Territory Country List Canada United States Europe Now the problem is it doesn't seem to be working. I'm setting up an array, and then converting it to an object using oc function then checking to see if it is in the object list and if it is set the proper country selected to true. Any help?
