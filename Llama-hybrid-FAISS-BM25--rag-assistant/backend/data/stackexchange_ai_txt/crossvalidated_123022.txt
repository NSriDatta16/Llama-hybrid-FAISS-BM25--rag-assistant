One approach is to try dimensionality reduction techniques, such as principal components analysis (PCA) . But, maybe even better approach is to perform an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) , which not only will reduce dimensionality, but will allow to hypothesize some (latent) factor structure and generate some theoretic model (based on EFA and subject domain ). This theoretic model can then be tested by confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) on a real data set. Further options would involve path analysis , which, along with CFA , is referred to under an umbrella term structured equation modeling (SEM) . The difference between SEM and a closely related term latent variable modeling (LVM) is that SEM is generally considered as an exploratory and/or confirmatory approach, whereas LVM might be considered as a predictive SEM approach. The R ecosystem provides a wealth of options in terms of tools for various types of multivariate analysis , which I have mentioned above. References to these tools are mostly clustered within these two CRAN Task Views : http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Multivariate.html and http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/SocialSciences.html (though the lists are not always complete - for example they don't include lavaan package, which might be listed in some other CRAN Task View , if at all).
