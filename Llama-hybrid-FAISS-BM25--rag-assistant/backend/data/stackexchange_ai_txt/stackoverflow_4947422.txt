It depends on what your priorities are. I tend to only use $_GET if I specifically want the URL to be "hackable" to allow people to either directly link to the page or to allow them to navigate around if they're paying attention. Because of this, I tend to use very clear $_GET variable names with easy to modify values, such as numbers. Ex: "foo.com/?theme=1" If you don't especially need either capability, there's no particular reason to use a $_GET at all - store the data somewhere else.
