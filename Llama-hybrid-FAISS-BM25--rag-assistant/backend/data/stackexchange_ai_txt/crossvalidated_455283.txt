Complementary log-log regression

Can someone explain the general approach to conducting complementary log-log in R? I can hardly find any information on complementary log-log. Now I was capable of running a complementary log-log, but on how to interpret the results. R gives me Z-values. Is the next step to calculate probabilities? Is it comparable to logistic regression? I would really like to know about the complementary log-log procedure and examples would be cherry on top of the cake.
