How may I convert Perplexity to F Measure

In the practice of Machine Learning accuracy of some models are determined by perplexity, (like LDA), while many of them (Naive Bayes, HMM,etc..) by F Measure. I like to evaluate all the models with some common standards. I am looking to convert perplexity values to precision, recall, f measure etc. Is there a way to do it? Or may I calculate F Measure for LDA? I am using Python's NLTK library for Naive Bayes, HMM, etc and Gensim for LDA. I am using Python2.7+ on MS-Windows. If any one may kindly absolve my query.
