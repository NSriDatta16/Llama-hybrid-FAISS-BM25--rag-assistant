Book recomendation introducing multilevel models for a pure mathematician

Is there a good book on Multilevel model s (random intercept, random slope, fixed effects, etc.) written for mathematicians which treat the theory rigorously? My background is essentially is in the area of stochastic analysis, stochastic partial differential equations, Markov chain Monte Carlo and computer graphics (beyond that, I'm interested in machine learning). So, I'm new to this stuff and don't whether there might be something out there which is appropriate for me.
