Core Data: Can't Use Previously Saved Object

I am really stuck with these two things. What I am trying to do: My entity is simple. It's a "record". It has a "name (NSString)" and "parent (relationShip)" "parent" connect to itself, entity "record". Ok, now I want to create "parentRecord" and "simpleRecord". I try to do with that code: groupRecord = (record *)[NSEntityDescription insertNewObjectForEntityForName:@"record" inManagedObjectContext:self.managedObjectContext]; groupRecord.name = GroupTextField.text; [self saveContext]; It's "parentRecord", I save it for a future use, and catch in "groupRecord" variable. Now I have to create a "simpleRecord". This is a code: record *newRecord = (record *)[NSEntityDescription insertNewObjectForEntityForName:@"record" inManagedObjectContext:self.managedObjectContext]; newRecord.name = textField.text; [newRecord setMyParent:groupRecord]; //and it crashes here! I rearranged this code, so * I don't do [self saveContext]; * in "parentRecord". Just use it from variable groupRecord . And save it in "childRecord" block. Then all is fine. Records save to storage and I can read it from there. Why does it happens? What should I do, if I want to create "parentRecord" first, SAVE IT ,and later - "childRecord"? Why can't I use previously saved object? NSManagedObjectContext is the same - what's wrong? I am good enough with "classic" SQL, but Core Data is killing my brain. Thanks to everyone. Update: Look, saveContext is out of reasons to crash. Here is: Create parent entity. Set it to variable of appDelegate. Save context (for a parent). Create childEntity. Set parentProperty from variable of appDelegate. App crashes! And: Create parent entity. Set it to variable of appDelegate. ///////////Save context (for a parent). Create childEntity. Set parentProperty from variable of appDelegate. No any crash. Savecontext this time. All is fine now. Parent property - is just a name of the property. It is not some additional setup for a parent in MOM file. I want to do entity with hierarchy. And there is NO some additional methods, that Xcode create for me - just a properties.
