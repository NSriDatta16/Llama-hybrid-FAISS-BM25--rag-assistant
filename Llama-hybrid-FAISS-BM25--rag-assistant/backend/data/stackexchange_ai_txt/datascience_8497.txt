How to determine window size for modeling user behavior

I am working in mining time series data for modeling user behavior. I collected the data from 37 smartphone users during 42 days(6 weeks). I want to use data during 3 weeks as model and the remaining as test (test performance of my model). The visualization of our data is following below: In here, I want to ask what is the good window size for modeling user behavior, is one hour, one day, one week etc? or may be is there any good methods for determining window size?
