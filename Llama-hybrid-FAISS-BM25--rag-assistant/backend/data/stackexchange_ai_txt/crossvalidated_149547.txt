How to z-normalize multi-dimensional time series?

z-normalization for 1-dim time series is simple. $z_i = (x_i-m)/s$ Here, $x_i$ is the element of series for each time index $i$. $m$ is the mean, and $s$ is the standard deviation. For n-dim time series, I can estimate $m$ easily, but I don't know how to estimate $s$. Do I need to estimate covariance matrix and multiply its inverse? Also, the number of elements of time series is smaller than the dimension of each element.
