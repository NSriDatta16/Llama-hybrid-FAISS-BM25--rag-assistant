GlobalAlloc() will return a memory block filled with zeroes (thanks to GPTR flag), not a string. There's no point in checking. You'd better checked that the pointer returned is not null. If that is not enough for you an just check if (*hwndTitleValve == 0 ) { } A valid empty string will store a null terminator at the very beginning.
