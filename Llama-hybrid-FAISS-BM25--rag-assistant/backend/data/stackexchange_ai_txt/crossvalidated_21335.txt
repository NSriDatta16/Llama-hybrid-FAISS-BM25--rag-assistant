Bayesian updating of continuous variables given mutual information

I have very little stats training, so this may be a very obvious and boring question, in which case I apologise. Given two real-valued continuous random variables A and B, and given prior probability distributions $f_A$ and $f_B$ for each, how do I perform a Bayesian update when given the extra evidence that b>a with probability p? Thanks in advance.
