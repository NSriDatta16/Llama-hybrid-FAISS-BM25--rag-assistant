Is it necessary to remove redundant variables from a random forest classification model?

I am running a random forest model in the following variables(attached): Is it necessary with Random Forests Classifier to remove highly correlated variables or should I leave the model as is? If I were going to remove 'redundant variables', what is the best approach? My workflow currently is: Calculate pearson's correlation coefficient assess the variable importance chart and systematically remove correlated variables to important ones, one by one and run the model and observe performance. I will stop removing variables once the OA, CA, UA decrease. The other method I was doing was removing the least important variables one by one and running the model but Pearson's Correlation Coefficient might be a more defensible approach. Thanks
