Edit : Assuming that the script is your own and not malicious: You should not have any code between and - Otherwise you have got a tag as a direct child of which is not allowed. Put the tag inside at the correct place where you want the script to execute, to correct the structural issue but you need to provide some more information about the exact error messages you are seeing about security as I'm not aware that Google shows error messages within its search listings and I dont have Google Toolbar installed to know what that does; but I don't believe it has typos in it ;) So please provide more information about the exact security warnings once you've fixed - and validated (with the W3C Validator) - the structure of your HTML. Edit : If the script is not intended to be there and has appeared outside of your desire: Have a look in the HTML source where the script is present; and compare to your own ASPX pages to find out where the script is appearing. If it is being rendered by one of your controls you need to examine where the value is coming from. If it is a database, you need to focus your attention on what gets the information into the DB in the first place. If the script is injected and not into one of your controls then you should talk to your ISP I would think.
