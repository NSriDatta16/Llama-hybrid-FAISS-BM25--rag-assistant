It's hard to do this in general without knowing more about the visitor patterns (e.g. Maybe people check back every two weeks). Fortunately, if you have historical data from a similar website (per the comments), you can use this to predict unique monthly visitors. There's a lot you could do here, so I'll go through the simple options, with pointers to more complicated approaches in bold . 1. Inspect Historical Data Let's assume you have the historical containing weekly and monthly unique visitor counts for other similar sites. You can start by plotting monthly ~ weekly (weekly on x-axis, monthly on y) and seeing what the relationship is. Hopefully, it will be straight line, e.g. Monthly visitors = 3.5 * Weekly visitors . 2. Fit a simple model If the relationship is linear, you can fit a linear regression model. $$\text{Month} = \alpha + \beta \text{Week} + \epsilon$$ This should ideally be a poisson regression , and if the relationship is not linear you can use polynomial (linear or poisson) regression , but linear regression is good enough for now. You can then plug in the number of weekly unique visitors to your new site, and get a predicted number of monthly visitors, given the trends on the other sites. This approach assumes that the trends are the same across all sites. If this isn't the case, your simple model will be overconfident , in that it underestimates how uncertain you should be about the predictions it makes. More on this below. 3. Fit a more complicated model You probably have other information about your sites, and weekly/monthly predictors (e.g. the number of non-unique visitors). Go ahead and add them to your model and see if the predictions about monthly visitors become more accurate. Now you're doing machine learning ! 4. Fit a multilevel model Since you have data from multiple websites, this is a good place to use a multilevel regression model , where the relationship between predictors (weekly visits) and outcomes (monthly visits) is allowed to vary between websites: $$ \text{Month} = \alpha_{\text{site}} + \beta_{\text{site}} \text{Week} + \epsilon \\ \alpha_{\text{site}} \sim N(\mu_{\alpha}, \sigma_{\alpha}) \\ \beta_{\text{site}} \sim N(\mu_{\beta}, \sigma_{\beta}) $$ or, using lme4 , # Linear regression lmer(month ~ 1 + week + (1 + week|site), data = data) # Poisson regression glmer(month ~ 1 + week + (1 + week|site), data = data, family = poisson(link = "log")) However, this is a fairly advanced topic, and may not be worth the effort for your problem!
