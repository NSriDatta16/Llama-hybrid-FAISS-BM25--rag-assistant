Three dimensional Javascript array

I am trying to build a 3D Javascript array, but I am unsure of how to do it, basically I have 3 arrays, Provinces, Cities and Malls all in succession, so I want to create a 3D array to store all the data in and then write some jQuery/Javascript to get out what I need. I have a script that can populate a drop down list with array items, but now I am adding an extra dimension to it and I am getting a little confused as to how to proceed, here is the code I have thus far, The jQuery: model[0] = new Array( 'Arnage', 'Azure', 'Brooklands', 'Continental', 'Corniche', 'Eight', 'Mulsanne', 'Series II', 'Turbo R', 'Turbo RT'); model[1] = new Array( '412', '603', 'Beaufighter', 'Blenheim', 'Brigand', 'Britannia'); model[2] = new Array( 'Inyathi', 'Rhino'); model[3] = new Array( 'Amandla', 'Auto Union', 'Horch'); function makeModel(obj){ var curSel=obj.options[obj.selectedIndex].value ; var x; if (curSel != 'null'){ $('#model').css({'display' : 'block'}); $('#model').html(" "); for (x in model[curSel]) { $('#sub').append(" " + model[curSel][x] + " "); } }else{ $('#model').css({'display' : 'block'}); } } The HTML: Make: Select one one two three four So as you can see, the above code generates a drop down menu of models depending on what make I select, now what I want to achieve now is adding one more level to it, so they will click on a province, then the cities drop down will appear, and when they choose a city, the malls will appear. What would be the best way of approaching this? Thanx in advance!
