You got it. Solution b won't scale up so solution a is key, as far as performance are of concern. By the same time, why should you constrain GetProductDetails() method to grab every data in a single request (hence the SQL view approach) ? Why not have this method perform 3 requests and say goodbye to your messy logic : One for id and name retrieval One for the colors list One for sizes list Depending on the SQL engine you use, these 3 requests could be grouped in a single batch query (one round trip) or would require 3 reound-trips. When adding additional properties to your class, you will have to decide whether to enhance the first request or to add a new one.
