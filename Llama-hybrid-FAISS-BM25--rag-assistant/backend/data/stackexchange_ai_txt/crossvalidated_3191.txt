I am compiling a quick series of guidelines I found on SO (as suggested by @Shane), Biostar (hereafter, BS), and this SE. I tried my best to acknowledge ownership for each item, and to select first or highly upvoted answer. I also added things of my own, and flagged items that are specific to the [R] environment. Data management Create a project structure for keeping all things at the right place (data, code, figures, etc., giovanni /BS) Never modify raw data files (ideally, they should be read-only), copy/rename to new ones when making transformations, cleaning, etc. Check data consistency ( whuber /SE) Manage script dependencies and data flow with a build automation tool, like GNU make ( Karl Broman / Zachary Jones ) Coding organize source code in logical units or building blocks ( Josh Reich / hadley / ars /SO; giovanni / Khader Shameer /BS) separate source code from editing stuff, especially for large project -- partly overlapping with previous item and reporting Document everything, with e.g. [R]oxygen ( Shane /SO) or consistent self-annotation in the source file -- a good discussion on Medstats, Documenting analyses and data edits Options [R] Custom functions can be put in a dedicated file (that can be sourced when necessary), in a new environment (so as to avoid populating the top-level namespace, Brendan OConnor /SO), or a package ( Dirk Eddelbuettel / Shane /SO) Analysis Don't forget to set/record the seed you used when calling RNG or stochastic algorithms (e.g. k-means) For Monte Carlo studies, it may be interesting to store specs/parameters in a separate file ( sumatra may be a good candidate, giovanni /BS) Don't limit yourself to one plot per variable, use multivariate (Trellis) displays and interactive visualization tools (e.g. GGobi) Versioning Use some kind of revision control for easy tracking/export, e.g. Git ( Sharpie / VonC / JD Long /SO) -- this follows from nice questions asked by @Jeromy and @Tal Backup everything, on a regular basis ( Sharpie / JD Long /SO) Keep a log of your ideas, or rely on an issue tracker, like ditz ( giovanni /BS) -- partly redundant with the previous item since it is available in Git Editing/Reporting [R] Sweave ( Matt Parker /SO) or the more up-to-date knitr [R] Brew ( Shane /SO) [R] R2HTML or ascii As a side note, Hadley Wickham offers a comprehensive overview of R project management , including reproducible exemplification and an unified philosophy of data . Finally, in his R-oriented Workflow of statistical data analysis Oliver Kirchkamp offers a very detailed overview of why adopting and obeying a specific workflow will help statisticians collaborate with each other, while ensuring data integrity and reproducibility of results. It further includes some discussion of using a weaving and version control system. Stata users might find J. Scott Long's The Workflow of Data Analysis Using Stata useful too.
