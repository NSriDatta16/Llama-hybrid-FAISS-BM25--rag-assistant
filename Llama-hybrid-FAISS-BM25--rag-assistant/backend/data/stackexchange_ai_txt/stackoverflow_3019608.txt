Since you're talking about Matlab, you probably want to try out IPython, which is a shell for Python offering much more functionality than the standard interpreter shell you get when executing Python. Among this functionality is the ability to load/save workspace sessions, create macros out of session input etc., which is probably more like what you are used to in Matlab (I actually use both and find IPython to be much more elegant, but YMMV): http://ipython.scipy.org
