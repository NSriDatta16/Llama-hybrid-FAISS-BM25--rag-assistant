You should take a look, if classical imputation methods or time series imputation methods are better for your problem. Here are the differences: Classical approaches mostly work on inter-attribute correlations. (which means correlations between the prices of different items on one day) Time series approaces mostly work on inter-time correlations. (which means correlations between prices of several days for one item) edit This paper explains the differences a little bit more detailed and also gives some algorithm advice for R ( https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1510/1510.03924.pdf )
