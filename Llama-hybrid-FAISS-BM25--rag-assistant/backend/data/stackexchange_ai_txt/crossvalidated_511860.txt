You can use Principal Component Analyses (PCA) to cluster multiple time series, see for example this questions . There are Python or R implementation available, for example, for Dynamic Factor Models (among others). The factors are time-varying and can be further investigated or used for forecasting . One drawback of this approach is of course that the factors have no direct economic meaning.
