Algorithm to determine how positive or negative a statement/text is

I need an algorithm to determine if a sentence, paragraph or article is negative or positive in tone... or better yet, how negative or positive. For instance: Jason is the worst SO user I have ever witnessed (-10) Jason is an SO user (0) Jason is the best SO user I have ever seen (+10) Jason is the best at sucking with SO (-10) While, okay at SO, Jason is the worst at doing bad (+10) Not easy, huh? :) I don't expect somebody to explain this algorithm to me, but I assume there is already much work on something like this in academia somewhere. If you can point me to some articles or research, I would love it. Thanks.
