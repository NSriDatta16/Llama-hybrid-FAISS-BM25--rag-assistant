Skimming over your code, you should at least test following conditions genoma1.NumberofGenes = genoma2.NumberOfGenes genoma1.NumberofGenes <> genoma2.NumberOfGenes genoma1.NumberofGenes = -1 genoma1.NumberofGenes = 0 genoma1.NumberofGenes = 1 genoma2.NumberofGenes = -1 genoma2.NumberofGenes = 0 genoma2.NumberofGenes = 1 genoma1.NumberOfGenes = HighBound - 1 genoma1.NumberOfGenes = HighBound (Max Integer?) genoma1.NumberOfGenes = HighBound + 1 genoma2.NumberOfGenes = HighBound - 1 genoma2.NumberOfGenes = HighBound (Max Integer?) genoma2.NumberOfGenes = HighBound + 1 Your testing effort could greatly benefit from mocking the numberGenerator object and have it return a fixed value. This would give you following additional conditions to be tested numberGenerator.GenerateInteger = LowBound - 1 numberGenerator.GenerateInteger = LowBound numberGenerator.GenerateInteger = LowBound + 1 numberGenerator.GenerateInteger = HighBound - 1 numberGenerator.GenerateInteger = HighBound numberGenerator.GenerateInteger = HighBound + 1 numberGenerator.Generate = True numberGenerator.GenerateBool = False Testing ALL possible combinations with given intputs calls for 432 testcases (6.6.6.2) Using a pairwise testgeneration tool reduces this to 39 testcases. When all your tests pass, you should run a coverage profiler to verify you haven't missed a coding path. Every path should get executed at least once. By now, you have code that has most of the bugs removed. By now, you have code that most likely still contains some bugs. (sad but true).
