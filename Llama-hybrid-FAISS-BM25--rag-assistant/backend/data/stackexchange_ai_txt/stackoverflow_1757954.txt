Not an answer, but a question regarding the various LINQ solutions proposed above. How efficient is LINQ? I have not written any "real" programs with LINQ yet, so I'm not sure on the performance. In this example, the "listOfTimes" collection implies that we have already iterated over some file system based objects to gather the times. Would it have been more efficient to do the analysis during the iteration instead of later in LINQ? I recognize that these solutions may be more "elegant" or nicely abstract the "collection as database" idea, but I tend to choose efficiency (must be readable though) over elagance in my programming. Just wondering if the cost of LINQ might outweigh the elegance here?
