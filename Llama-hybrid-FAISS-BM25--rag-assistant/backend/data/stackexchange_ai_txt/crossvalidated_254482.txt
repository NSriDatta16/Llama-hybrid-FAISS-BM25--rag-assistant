I have done prediction model on sparse data and it is a big challenge to get your model calibrated in these cases. I will tell you what I did, you can get some help from that. I made 20 bins of predicted probability and tried to plot average predicted and actual probability of success. For average predicted probability, I took average of the bin range. For average actual probability, I calculated actual success and failure count in the bins, from which I got actual (median) probability of success in the bin. To reduce impact of outliers, I removed the top and bottom 5% data before taking actual median probability in each bin. Once I got these I could easily plot the data.
