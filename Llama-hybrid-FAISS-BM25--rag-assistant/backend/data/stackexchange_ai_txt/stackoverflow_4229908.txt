Templating with Javascript or Django?

I'm building a Django web application which has a lot of html generated on the fly by ajax requests. Right now I use Django's templating language to build up html and then pass this new HTML as a string in JSON object which is then injected into the page with jQuery. This works fairly well, but with Javascript being so fast in modern browsers and with so many javascript template libraries being made I'm wondering if I should push everything clientside. So my question is: Given the that my average "page" with all requests to and from it has to compile around ~300 templates (each of about 15 or so lines with 5 or so substitutions) out into HTML during its lifetime is there significant performance advantage to doing templating in the browser? In addition can anybody reccomend a 'fast' Javascript templating library? I've heard good things about underscore.js, mustache.js and jQuery template.
