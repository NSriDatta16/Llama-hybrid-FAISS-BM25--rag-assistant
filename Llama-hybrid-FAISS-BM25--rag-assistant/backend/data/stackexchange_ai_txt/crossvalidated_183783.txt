You should always reference your quotes. The only reference on the Internet I found with this quote "For each model, we determine the best fit parameters from the peak of the N-dimensional likelihood surface. For each parameter in the model we also compute its one dimensional likelihood function by marginalizing over all other parameters." (p.3) is an cosmology arxiv paper on WMAP by Spergel et al. (2003). If you turn the page after this quote, you will find an equation defining the expectation under the "marginal likelihood" as $$ = \int d^N α\mathcal{L}(α)α_i\,.$$ This means that the "marginal likelihood" is $$\int d^{N-1} α_{-i}\mathcal{L}(α)\,.$$ If I quote from the previous sentences of the paper as well "For each model studied in the paper, we use a Monte Carlo Markov Chain to explore the likelihood surface. We assume flat priors in our basic parameters, impose positivity constraints on the matter and baryon density (these limits lie at such low likelihood that they are unimportant for the models. We assume a flat prior in τ , the optical depth, but bound τ this means that the authors take a Bayesian stance with a flat prior in their parametrisation.
