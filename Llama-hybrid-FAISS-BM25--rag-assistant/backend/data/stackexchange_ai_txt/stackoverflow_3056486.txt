Pedantically speaking, your application is already using all cores. There's no one specific core allocated to the process, as you say above (unless you make a explicit effort to tie your process to one specific core). The process uses all cores, but it uses them sequentially : it runs a little on one core, then it runs a little more on another core and so on. I.e. on average the CPU time your application consumes is spread evenly across all cores in the system. Since only one core is used at any given moment of time, the CPU load will never cross the 25% limit (your system, apparently, has 4 cores). If you want to cross the 25% limit, you have to be able to use two or more cores simultaneously , meaning that at least some of the code has to run in parallel . In order to do that the application has to be written specifically to run in parallel. An ordinary single-threaded application will never do that by itself.
