Optimal output from continuous inputs

I have data consisting of a continuous dependent variable and several continuous independent variables. I need to figure out the optimal values of the independent variables that will maximize the dependent variable. This might be a pure optimization problem as opposed to a statistics problem, but I can't find any resources on the web that solve this problem. Edit: The data is already collected, so this is not a design problem. Edit: To give some context, let the dependent variable be the amount of drug compound needed to kill an organism. The independent variables are various structural properties of the compound, which can be tweaked as desired. I want to find the "best" structure for the compound- the one that minimizes the dependent variable. These independent variables can be thought of as "knobs". The question is: What value should I set each knob to to minimize the dependent variable?
