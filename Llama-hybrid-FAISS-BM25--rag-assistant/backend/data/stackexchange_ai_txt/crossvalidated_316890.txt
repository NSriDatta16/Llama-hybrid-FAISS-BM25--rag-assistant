What model could you use with a non-binary categorical response variable?

Sorry if this is a simple question, I couldn't find satisfactory answers easily on Google, but I'm trying to create a model that predicts whether an input belongs in 1 of X categories. So multiple numeric explanatory -> non-binary categorical response variable I've only learnt about linear and logistic regression in class, and I don't think either apply here. I've seen tutorials on random forests, is this what I'd have to use?
