ANOVA, even a 3-way ANOVA, is a special case of linear regression. For one-way ANOVA, the typical "nonparametric" flavor is the Kruskal-Wallis test, so it seems like you would want some kind of 3-way Kruskal-Wallis test. Much as ANOVA is a special case of linear regression, the Kruskal-Wallis test is a special case of proportional odds ordinal logistic regression. Consequently, there is a sense in which the nonparametric flavor of 3-way ANOVA is a proportional odds ordinal logistic regression model on the variables, their two-way interactions, and their three-way interactions, much as the parametric flavor of 3-way ANOVA would be linear regression on the variables, their two-way interactions, and their 3-way interactions. This is the first I've heard of the Scheirer-Ray-Hare test, but its Wikipedia article makes it sound like it can handle any number of factors, not just two, so perhaps your inability to include three factors is a software issue. Additionally, the Wikipedia article makes it sound like the Scheirer-Ray-Hare test is another special case of the proportional odds ordinal logistic regression.
