Setting up restful routes as a total newb

I'm getting the following error: Unknown action No action responded to show. Actions: activate, destroy, index, org_deals, search, and suspend Controller: class Admin::HomepagesController Routes: map.root :controller => 'main' map.admin '/admin', :controller => 'admin/main' map.namespace :admin do |admin| admin.resources :organizations, :collection => {:search => :get}, :member => {:suspend => :get, :activate => :get} To note: This is a controller inside of a controller. Any idea why this is defaulting to show? Update: I updated what the routes syntax is. Read that article, and tried quite a few variations but its still adamantly looking for a show.
