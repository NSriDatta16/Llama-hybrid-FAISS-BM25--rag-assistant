Since the two components that together explain almost 80% of the variance are orthogonal, most likely there is no single "activity" measure. If I were you, I would study the two components, trying to understand what types of activity they measure, on which variables they depend etc. I would also study the PCA plots to understand whether there are for example distinct groups of users. It might be that a single score is just not sufficient to describe a person. We are complex beings after all. Failing that, I would need to decide what weights to assign to the components, turn them to ranks, multiply by these by the weights, sum them and so get an arbitrary score that might or might not describe what you want to describe. You are looking for a surrogate -- but a surrogate of what? What do you want to know about a particular user that the score is supposed to reflect.
