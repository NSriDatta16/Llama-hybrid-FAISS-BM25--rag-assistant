Testable hypotheses construction; minimum predictive strength vs. significance

Is this null hypothesis TESTABLE? Research Question: "Can a predictive model utilizing logistic regression be built which predicts at least one customer will churn in 90 days, and this individual prediction will be at a minimum of 70% confidence, using a chosen set of independent variables?" Null Hypothesis: "A predictive model utilizing logistic regression cannot predicts at least one customer will churn in 90 days, with this individual prediction being at a minimum of 70% confidence, using a chosen set of independent variables." If so, how do you test the "70% confidence" of the particular churn event that allows you to reject the null hypothesis, at the p Or, is this the only way to write the null hypothesis, and the strength of the model must be left to the discussion section? "There is no significant relationship between the full model using the chosen independent variables and customer churn." (With r-square and chi-square showing the significance of the full model.)
