How does predictive model for the Eurovision Song Contest work?

I've encountered interesting prediction of Eurovision Song Contest http://mewo2.com/nerdery/2013/05/12/eurovision-2013-first-predictions/ it based on some kind of Bayesian model I assume but I don't understand how it works (the description is too sketchy for me). Along the lines it says that it uses Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler but what exactly does it sample?
