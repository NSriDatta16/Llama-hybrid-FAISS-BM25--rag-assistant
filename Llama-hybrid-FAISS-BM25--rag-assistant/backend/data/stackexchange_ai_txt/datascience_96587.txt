PCA provides the eigenvalue corresponding to each feature. This value is used to decide the number of features to retain after dimensionality reduction. The features/pc are sorted in descending order based on their eigenvalues and the top N features are preserved after the dimensionality reduction. The plot above shows bar's with eigenvalue's of each principal component represented as pc after performing PCA on the dataset.
