Using Xcode 3.2.4, open the organiser window and navigate to the Team Provisioning profile in the profiles section to the left. At the top of the window you should see a refresh button next to the "Automatic provisioning" checkbox. Clicking that should prompt you for your developer credentials and recreate the profile for you EDIT: You can also right click the device in organiser once it's connected to your machine and manually request that it be added via the context menu
