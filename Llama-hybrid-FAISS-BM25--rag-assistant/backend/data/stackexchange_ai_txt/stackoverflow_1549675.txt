This depends on what you're targeting exactly. If you're just looking for non-web-based email traffic running across the local machine, then you simply monitor the ports you're looking for (IMAP, POP, SMTP, etc) with a library like libpcap (or SharpPcap for .NET maybe). You'll probably need to parse the contents of the messages to get what you're looking for, but that's not too tough. With some more information on what you're trying to do exactly, I might better be able to help you.
