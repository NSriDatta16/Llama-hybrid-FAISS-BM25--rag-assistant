Welcome to the site! The usual approach to missing values is to handle them manually. There are a few algorithms which can do this automatically, such as LightGBM and XGBoost , but in most cases it's better for model performance to decide on how you should indicate that a value is missing in your data. For example in with a Pandas dataframe in Python, I may decide to replace all NA/NaN values in a particular column which should contain positive integers with -99: dataframe[column] = dataframe[column].fillna(-99)
