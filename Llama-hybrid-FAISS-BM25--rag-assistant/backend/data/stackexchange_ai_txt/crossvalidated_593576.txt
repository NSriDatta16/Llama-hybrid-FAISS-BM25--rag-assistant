You may find this paper helpful. This problem, sparse data in one or more cells of the cross-tabulation of your predictor and outcome variables (as you present above) which causes extreme parameter estimates, is referred to as separation . The solution is usually one or another form of regularization (Alternatively, you can omit the covariate(s), which cause the separation, but I'll ignore that here). There are several such options discussed in the linked paper. Potentially the easiest to implement would be data augmentation. Another option would be to estimate the model in the Bayesian framework. Using even modestly informative priors on the log odds ratios would provide the regularization needed to get sane results (and narrower intervals). You could try estimating the model with R package brms . It uses the same syntax as lme4 so you wouldn't really need modify your model specification, you'd just need to add priors for the model parameters.
