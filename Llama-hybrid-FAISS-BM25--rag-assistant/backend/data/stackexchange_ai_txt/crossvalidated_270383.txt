I believe that this is really a terrific question although somewhat vague. Here is my attempt at an answer: In practice it depends on which space you want to interpret the data in. (So what do I mean by this?) Perturbation and Powering reduce to standard Addition and Multiplication upon Log-ratio transformation. Thus lets say that you have transformed the data using the ALR transform $(X_i^{alr} = X_i/X_D)$. Then your simple linear regression can be interpreted as you would normally interpret a linear model but now your variables are log-ratios. Now a very interesting question is What is perturbation and powering when you are not thinking in terms of log-ratios. The best answer I have found to this question comes from this paper . In it the authors describe how perturbation can be seen as the updating of prior information to posterior information in a Bayesian setting. They also describe how distance in the Aitchison geometry is a measure of something called evidence-information which is slightly different than Shannon Information. They also discuss powering in the paper but I find it easiest to view powering as repeated perturbation (that makes the most intuitive sense to me). Overall, I think the first option (describing the linear models in the transformed space) is by far the easiest way to communicate it to laymen. More specifically, choose your log-ratio transform of interest and find log-ratios that have meaning, then describe a standard linear model acting upon those log-ratios.
