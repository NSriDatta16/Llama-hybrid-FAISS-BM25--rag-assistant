You've got the right idea, but I've used a fair number of SVM packages (Weka, LibSVM, PyML, etc) and none of these require you to "pre-transform" your data into a higher dimensional space. In fact, the whole idea behind the "kernel trick" is that you don't actually have to compute the mapping explicitly. You just need to load in your data, choose your kernel and hyper-parameters, and you're off!
