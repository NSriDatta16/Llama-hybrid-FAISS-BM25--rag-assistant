Given that each run (for one sample point) takes you at least one hour, standard optimization or machine learning ideas are probably not right. I would look into experimental design , specifically fractional factorial designs . This Algorithm for generating a multi-level fractional factorial design is a somewhat similar question with answer, and another idea that factorial designs. Another alternative to factorial designs could be algoritmically generated optimal designs. For mre specific advice we need more details, like How many parameters do you have to tweak? What kind of parameters? categorical, how many levels? Continuous?
