I came across a wonderful quote that almost argues for the same point, but not quite -- since it is an opening paragraph in a textbook that is mostly about frequentist statistics and hypothesis testing. It is widely held by non-statisticians, like the author, that if you do good experiments statistics are not necessary. They are quite right. [...] The snag, of course, is that doing good experiments is difficult. Most people need all the help they can get to prevent them making fools of themselves by claiming that their favourite theory is substantiated by observations that do nothing of the sort. And the main function of that section of statistics that deals with tests of significance is to prevent people making fools of themselves. From this point of view, the function of significance tests is to prevent people publishing experiments, not to encourage them. Ideally, indeed, significance tests should never appear in print, having been used, if at all, in the preliminary stages to detect inadequate experiments, so that the final experiments are so clear that no justification is needed. -- David Colquhoun, Lectures on biostatistics , 1971
