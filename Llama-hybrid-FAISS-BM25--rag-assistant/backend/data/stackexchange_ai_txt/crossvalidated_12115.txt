Time series autocorrelation definition: why does the denominator not include a lagged variance?

The definition for the $k$-th lag auto correlation is $Cov(y_t,y_{t-k})/Var(y_t)$. My question is why should not it be $Cov(y_t,y_{t-k})/[Var(y_t)\cdot Var(y_{t-k})]^{0.5}$. In another words, what is it different from the correlation coefficient between $y_t$ and $y_{t-k}$?
