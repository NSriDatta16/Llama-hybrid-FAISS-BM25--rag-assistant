I don't think Goodfellow et al. are saying that Hinton introduced the concept of distributed representations, just that he co-authored a chapter in the PDP book that provided a good description of distributed representation. I re-read the PDP book recently (my first neural network book from back in 1989) and skimmed the chapter, and it doesn't seem to me to be claiming any priority on the idea. I think it has earlier roots in biological neuroscience and the concept had been around for a while. It is what a lot of neural systems do, so Hinton was unlikely to be the only one in the group (and outside it) that noticed. The PDP book is describing the body of work by a large group of researchers working on different aspects of parallel distributed processing, and most of it is of a summary/tutorial nature.
