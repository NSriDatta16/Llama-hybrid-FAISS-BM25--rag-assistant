If you are doing a simulation the minimum number of required runs depends on your objective (What are you trying to estimate and with what accuracy?). If you are trying to estimate the average response then the standard deviation of the sample average is the $\dfrac{\text{Population Standard Deviation}}{\sqrt{n}}$. So if $d$ is the required half-width for $95\%$ confidence interval for the mean you want $d= 1.96 \times \dfrac{\text{Pop.Std.Dev}}{\sqrt{n}}$ or $n=\dfrac{ (1.96 \times\text{Pop.Std.Dev})^2}{d^2}$. Doing more simulations (assuming all samples arre generated by a random process) does nothing to hurt the estimation in terms of accuracy or bias. The coverage of an approximate confidence interval will differ from the exact $95\%$ coveraged desired and the error in coverage should decrease with increasing $n$. As mentioned by Macro and MansT, you can bound the Monte Carlo estimate of coverage based on the variance of the binomial proportion being $\dfrac{p(1-p)}{n}$.
