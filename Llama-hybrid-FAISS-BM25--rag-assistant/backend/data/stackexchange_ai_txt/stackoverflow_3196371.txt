I'll answer my own question here with how I laid it out in this environment with many distinct teams. For any other developers taking on the TFS admin role, I'd again throw out the suggestion to divide your TFS Collections where the projects won't have any cross-over between teams. This could be however you define it - customers, separate teams. This helps to allow teams to see & contribute to projects that they're concerned with. Create new or leverage existing AD security groups for the purpose of granting read/write to each appropriate Group in the Collection. Allow/deny permissions to each Group for the Collections as they're needed.
