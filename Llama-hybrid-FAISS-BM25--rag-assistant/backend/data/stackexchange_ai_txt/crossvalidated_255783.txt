Confidence interval for xgb-forecast

experts! Maybe, you know how to calculate confidence interval for xgboost? Classic formula with t-distribution can't help, because my data aren't normally distributed. Or doesn't matter? If you'll suggest some literature, it will be very useful, but approaches in R and Python (in context of library xgb) good too. Perhaps, it looks like this , but how it compute? And found this - it's right or not? P.S.: I can't add some pictures, related with my data (limit of links), sorry.
