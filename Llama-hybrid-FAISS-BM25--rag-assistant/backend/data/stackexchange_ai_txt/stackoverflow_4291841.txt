Magento already has a Maintenance Mode should you need it. More discussion about it is here . Generally all your changes will probably be custom modules, and each module has it's own version and set of applicable install/upgrade scripts. Whenever you increase the version number in a module's config.xml file Magento automatically finds and runs the corresponding upgrade script. If all your database changes are made via that script then you have nothing to worry about. This is how I expect my staging-to-production sites to work and only very rarely do I need to make any other changes in the admin, exceptions are things like adjusting links in CMS content. I never copy data directly from the staging database. More discussion about this is here .
