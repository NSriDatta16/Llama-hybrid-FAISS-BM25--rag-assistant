How to retrieve grandchild objects from a parent using linq

I have several parent > child > grandchild relationships in my db schema. Usually, I have the parent and I want some information about the grandchildren. For example, I have a user who has a collection of social networks which have collections of friends. I find myself writing this code over and over again. var friends = new List (); foreach (var socialNetwork in user.UserSocialNetworks) { foreach (var friend in socialNetwork.Friends) { friends.Add(friend); } } Is there a more elegant way to do this with linq? What I'd really like to be able to do is "user.Friends" but I'd have to put a foreign key to user in the friend table and that doesn't smell right. Here is what that would look like: User {Id,..} SocialNetwork {Id, UserId, ...} Friend {Id, SocialNetworkId, UserId, ... } Thoughts?
