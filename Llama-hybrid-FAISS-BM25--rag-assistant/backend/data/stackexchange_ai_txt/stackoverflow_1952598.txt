User-Agents are removed by Chinese mobile networks?

Kindly confirm the information below. a. Chinese mobile networks are blocking the useragent strings. b. The user-agent send to the server are in different encoding for Chinese mobiles. Please let me know whether a or b is true and also pour in your experiences on the identifying the user agents in Chinese mobiles. Everywhere the term Chinese mobile means a mobile in China with Chinese mobile network. Thanks in advance. [changed]
