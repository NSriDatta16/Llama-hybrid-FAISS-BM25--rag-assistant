Which model should I use? Logistic regression?

Here is the data I have: Response variable : It contains proportions and it takes discrete values 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1. But there are 109 possible discrete values Predictor variable.1: Discrete and ordinal. It contains these values 10, 20, 30, 40. Predictor variable.2: Discrete and non-ordinal. It contains these values 'a', 'b', 'c'. Neither normality (checked with Kolmogorov-Smirnov and by looking at a qqplot) nor homoscedasticity (checked with Fligner and by looking at a plot) are respected. Which model should I use in order to infer whether any of the two predictor variable influence my response variable? What about a logistic regression? Would it work?
