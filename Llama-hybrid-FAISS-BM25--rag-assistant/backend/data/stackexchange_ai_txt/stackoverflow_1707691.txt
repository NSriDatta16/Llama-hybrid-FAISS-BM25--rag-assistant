For memory leak detection you can use the open source FastMM4 memory manager for Delphi . "FastMM is a lightning fast replacement memory manager for Embarcadero Delphi Win32 applications that scales well in multi-threaded applications, is not prone to memory fragmentation, and supports shared memory without the use of external .DLL files." It is great for speed, leak checking and memory sharing between dll's. Also very useful is the FastMM4 Options Interface which helps to configure FastMM4.
