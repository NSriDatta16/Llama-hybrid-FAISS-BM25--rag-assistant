Good question (+1), the documentation seems quite vague. I'm not sure if there is a "harder" source, such as the POSIX specification for instance. Thinking a bit pragmatically, here is GNU libc's implementation. It returns a pointer to a static string buffer, so it cannot return 0. In response to p00ya's comment, the safe (and also very pragmatical, heh) thing to do in the face of conflicting, vague or incomplete specifications is of course to assume the worst, and not assume that the return value will always be a valid string.
