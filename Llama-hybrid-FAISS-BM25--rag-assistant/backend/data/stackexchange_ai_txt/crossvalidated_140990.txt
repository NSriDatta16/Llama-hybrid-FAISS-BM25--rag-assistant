Using Kalman filters to impute Missing Values in Time Series

I am interested in how Kalman Filters can be used to impute missing values in Time Series Data. Is it also applicable if some consecutive time points are missing? I cannot find much on this topic. Any explanations, comments and links are welcome and appreciated!
