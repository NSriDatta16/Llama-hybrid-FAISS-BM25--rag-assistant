VAEs optimize the ELBO given below: $$L(x; \theta,\varphi) = E_{z∼q_\varphi(z|x)}[\log p_\theta(x|z)] − D_{KL}(q_\varphi(z|x)\Vert p(z))$$ In it, KL divergence (subtracted term) has range $[0, \infty]$ . Cross entropy, i.e. the expected value of $\log p_\theta(x|z)$ , is the sum of weighted values of $\log p_\theta(x|z)$ , hence it lies in $[-\infty, 0]$ . Therefore, the term is always negative. There are different expressions that you can find here .
