This is user specific so I would store it in a persistent cookie. So when a user authenticates you could query the database to fetch the required information and issue a persistent cookie which will expire in 24h. Then in the partial you would check whether the cookie exists and fetch the necessary data from this cookie and if the cookie doesn't exist query the database and reemit the cookie. When the user logs out you could remove the cookie although that's not strictly necessary because when he logs back in (with the same or other username) you would query the database once again and reemit the cookie. And because we live in 2011 and HTML5 is knocking on our doors instead of cookies I would probably use the HTML5 Local Storage and if the browser doesn't support it fallback to cookies.
