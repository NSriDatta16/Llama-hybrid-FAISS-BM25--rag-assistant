Neural Nets, Lasso regularization

How does one implement lasso regularization or elastic net on neural networks? (feed forward in particular). I know that closed form solutions for this problems don't exist, still how are they implemented? How do I compute the gradients? Attention, I'm familiar with both procedures and what they accomplish, what I'm asking is how to implement them, how to formulate the gradients.
