Use of kernel density estimate in Naive Bayes Classifier?

This question is a follow up to my earlier question here and is also related, in intent, to this question . On this wiki page probability density values from an assumed normal distribution for the training set are used to calculate a Bayesian posterior rather than actual probability values. However, if a training set is not normally distributed would it be equally as valid to use a density value taken from the kernel density estimate of the training set to calculate a Bayesian posterior? In its intended application this kernel density estimate would be taken from a theoretically ideal empirical data set generated by MC techniques.
