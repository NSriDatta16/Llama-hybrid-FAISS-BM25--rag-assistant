C#, Java, Python3, as far as I know, are all Unicode based programming. I found no one above mentioned Python , so I added it. Python has a fantasy feature: everything (function, class, module, variable, class instance) is object and every object can attached a document to describe it. This feature may be useful for organizing code and executing script interactively. For example: # Python code in interactive mode >>> def MyFunc(): '''This is self-included document. It can be write in multi lines.''' print('foobar') >>> print(MyFunc.__doc__) This is self-included document. It can be write in multi lines. >>> MyFunc() foobar
