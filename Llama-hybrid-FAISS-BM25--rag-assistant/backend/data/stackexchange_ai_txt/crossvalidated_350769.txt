The answer is yes. The most important ingredient of PCA analysis is the data covariance matrix $$S = \mathbb E(XX^{T})-\mathbb E(X) (\mathbb E(X))^{T} $$ Then by choosing a vector $\mu$ in the same space of $X$, we can calculate $$\mu^{T} S \mu = \mathbb E((\mu^{T}) X(\mu^{T} X)^{T})-\mathbb E(\mu^{T} X) (\mathbb E(\mu^{T} X))^{T}$$ Since $ \mu X$ is a number so that $\mu^{T} S \mu$ is the variance of "the cloud of data " has in the direction $\mu$. Note also, $S$ is positive semi-definite, so that it can always be diagonalized $$S = P^{T}\Lambda P$$ in which $P$ is an orthogonal matrix, and $\Lambda$ is a diagonal matrix whose diagonal entries are the variances. so we have $$\mu^{T} S \mu = (P\mu)^{T} \Lambda (P\mu)$$ it can be easily seen from $(P\mu)^{T} \Lambda (P\mu)$, if we project the data onto a plane, the maximum variance will be captured when the plane is spanned by the two leading principal components.
