How to find proper nouns in string?

I'm trying to identify proper nouns in a user-submitted 3-4 sentence paragraph. I'm OK with the function being flawed somewhat as I have a team of moderators validating just about everything. An example of an incoming paragraph is below. Nick Swisher homered off James Shields to key a five-run burst in the first inning and the New York Yankees beat Tampa Bay 8-3 on Tuesday night, opening a 2 1/2-game lead over the Rays in the AL East. I'd like the function to take the following keywords/proper-nouns out. Nick Swisher, James Shields, New York Yankees, Tampa Bay, Rays, AL East I'm thinking I could explode the string and seperate the words by spaces. Then I'd check each word to see if the first letter is capitalized. If it is, return it. If not, move on to the next word. But what about multi-word keywords/proper-nouns? How do I get the function to check the word after a already found first letter capped word? So the function would find Nick but how do I tell it to check the next word, too? So check if next is capped and if so, return Nick Swisher. If not, just return Nick. And going one further, what if it's a 3 word phrase? New is found, York is found, how do I get it to find Yankees, too?
