Logistic regression is trained by minimizing logistic loss (or maximizing likelihood, what is equivalent), so it will be guaranteed to minimize this loss, rather then something else. It predicts probabilities, so you cannot calculate accuracy from the outputs, unless you decide on some decision rule to make clarifications. Using $\hat y > 0.5$ is just one such rule . When you "round" the predicted probabilities to turn them to classifications, you loose precision, so you can optimize loss, while accuracy would keep the same. Accuracy is not the best metric to care about.
