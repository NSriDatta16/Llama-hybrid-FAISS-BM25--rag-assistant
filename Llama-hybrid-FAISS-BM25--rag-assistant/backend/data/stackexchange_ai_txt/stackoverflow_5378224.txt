If you have complete control over the kiosks, then the easiest thing to do would be to add a unique ID of some sort to the user-agent registry key . If you don't have complete control, then a permanent cookie might be your only route. If you go with the permanent cookie you could require the client to enter some sort of password/code/id to register the machine before populating the cookie. That would help identify the clients and also prevent unauthorized computers from accessing the system.
