Unsure whether to use bootstrap or not

I've only recently came across the bootstrap procedure and I'm not entirely well versed in statistics so apologies if I'm completely wrong here. I'm looking at the average temperatures across a month generated by a climate model. I have an ensemble of 25 simulations, so I have temperature information for each day over 25 runs. My procedure so far was to take the mean June temperature for each simulation so I have 25 in total, then perform resampling 1000 times to get the sampling distribution of the mean. I did this because I thought 25 data points was quite low to reliably draw conclusions, but I've realised that I could just get the mean over all the temperature data from all the simulations, so 25*30 data points total. Which approach is more appropriate here?
