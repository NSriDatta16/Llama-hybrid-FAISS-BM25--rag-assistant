Can any of the standard techniques (logistic regression, lda, qda, svm) be used to perform asymmetric classification?

Suppose I care about mispredicting one class much more than another. Is there a way I can communicate this information to the standard classification techniques? The only way I can think of is adjusting the threshold, but I wonder if there is a better way.
