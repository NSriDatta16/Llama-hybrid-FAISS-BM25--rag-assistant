WPF Image.Source caching too aggressively

I have an instance of System.Windows.Controls.Image , and I set the contents programmatically as such: Uri location = new Uri(uriString); image.Source = new BitmapImage(location); Sometimes I know that the image on the server has changed and I want to refresh it, but every time I repeat the above code I get the same image. This seems to be a caching problem, but the two obvious solutions — RequestCacheLevel and BitmapCacheOption — seem to do nothing. This code has the same result: var cachePolicy = new RequestCachePolicy(RequestCacheLevel.NoCacheNoStore)) { CacheOption = BitmapCacheOption.None }; image.Source = new BitmapImage(location, cachePolicy); // Still uses the cached version. The only way I've found to force a refresh is to append a throwaway query string to the URI, which seems to work, but also is a complete hack: Uri location = new Uri(uriString + "?nonsense=" + new Random().Next()); image.Source = new BitmapImage(location); // This forces a refresh How can I prevent these images from being cached, and/or force a refresh?
