Correcting specific non normal distribution

I have run a multilevel model (time series cross section data; xtmixed) and am checking if the assumptions hold. Given the non-normality of my residuals, and after having corrected potential linearity issues, it seems I would need to manipulate my dependent variable to meet regression's requirements. Here is the distribution of my DV: My ideas so far are: - relying on hints form sigmoid curves (but I am really not familiar with that); - recodifying my DV to create a categorical variable out of a continuous variable. EDITING MY OWN QUESTION: Here is how the distribution of my residuals look like: Should I worry about it? EDITING Bis And here is my Q-normal plot for response var
