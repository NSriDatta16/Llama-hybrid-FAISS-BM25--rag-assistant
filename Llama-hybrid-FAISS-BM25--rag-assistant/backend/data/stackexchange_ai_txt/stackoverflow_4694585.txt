If you want to use models created by the controller (that rendered HTML page which reference the Javascript in which you intend to use groovy code) in the Javascript code, then you can use this technique: This technique does not need to change URL mappings and does not require you to create extra controller. In your view GSP add javascript as follows: In views folder create a "javascript" folder. And create a file named: _yourJavascriptFile.gsp You can not only use all the GSP code in your _yourJavascriptFile.gsp file, but you can also use all the models created in your controller (that is rendering the view). NOTE: There is nothing special about javascript folder. You can name it anything you want OR use an existing view folder. This is just a matter of organizing and identifying your HTML spitting GSP from Javascript spitting GSPs. Alternatively, you can use some naming conventions like: _something.js.gsp etc.
