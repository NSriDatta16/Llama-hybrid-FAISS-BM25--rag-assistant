How to detect rare events in Time series?

I am working on a time series dataset in which each time step can be classified under 4 classes: ~EOI : P(~EOI) = .85 EOI-1 : P(EOI-1) = .05 EOI-2 : P(EOI-2) = .05 EOI-3 : P(EOI-3) = .05 where EOI is Event Of Interest. Due to the huge class imbalance in ~EOI and EOI-X , I planned to use the boosting technique and build 1 classifier to identify EOI / ~EOI events and then a sub-class classifier which would classify the 3 EOI events. On further inspection I fear that for ~EOI class, there may be too much randomness and the may not have any distinguishable pattern and may just be noisy data. I tried the Classification approach(traditional ML + NN approach), but i feel that could be set up for failure. Another approach 1 approach that I could think of was to apply an auto encoder to do Anomaly detection. But before I invest time and effort there, i needed some opinion/advice on the same. Please suggest alternative approaches or possible pros/cons of my current approach
