Importance sampling helps you estimate quantities for a target distribution (that you cannot generate samples from) using a proposal distribution (that you can generate samples from). Please see this great post by Xi'an on importance sampling . To actually generate samples from the target distribution (or the posterior in a Bayesian analysis, where the posterior would now be your target distribution), we would need to use a more sophisticated algorithm like Metropolis-Hastings.
