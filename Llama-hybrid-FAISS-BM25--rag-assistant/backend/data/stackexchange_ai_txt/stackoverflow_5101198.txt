One of the recent testing-related cool things that came from Microsoft is Pex . Lifted from the project page: Pex automatically generates test suites with high code coverage. Right from the Visual Studio code editor, Pex finds interesting input-output values of your methods, which you can save as a small test suite with high code coverage. Microsoft Pex is a Visual Studio add-in for testing .NET Framework applications. Definitely worth checking.
