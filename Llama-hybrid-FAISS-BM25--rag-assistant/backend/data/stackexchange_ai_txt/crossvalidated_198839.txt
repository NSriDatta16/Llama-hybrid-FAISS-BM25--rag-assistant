Evaluate Random Forest: OOB vs CV

When we assess the quality of a Random Forest, for example using AUC, is it more appropriate to compute these quantities over the Out of Bag Samples or over the hold out set of cross validation? I hear that computing it over the OOB Samples gives a more pessimistic assessment, but I don't see why.
