You could use a normal LOB column type and set the storage parameters for that field so it's on a seperate tablespace. Create the tablespace somewhere that can handle having huge amounts of data thrown at it and you'll minimise the impact. To be seriously super paranoid about disk usage you could additionally compress the tablespace by marking it as such. Something along the lines of: CREATE TABLESPACE binary_data1 DATAFILE some_san_location DEFAULT COMPRESS STORAGE(...)
