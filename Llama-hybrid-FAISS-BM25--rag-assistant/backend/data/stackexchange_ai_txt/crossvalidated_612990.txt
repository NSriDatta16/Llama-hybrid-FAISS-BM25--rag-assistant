FOURIER SERIES "Not a machine learning algorithm," you say? I disagree. A Fourier series is a linear regression with infinite (nonlinear) features. $$ \hat y_i = \hat a_0 + \hat a_1\cos\left( \dfrac{ 2\pi \times 1x_i }{ P } \right) + \hat b_1\sin\left( \dfrac{ 2\pi \times 1x_i }{ P } \right) + \hat a_2\cos\left( \dfrac{ 2\pi \times 2x_i }{ P } \right) + \hat b_2\sin\left( \dfrac{ 2\pi \times 2x_i }{ P } \right) +\dots $$ Even with a finite number of features, you can get as close as you want to the modulo function, which is, ultimately, just a sawtooth function that we know a Fourier series can approximate well almost everywhere. For the kind of periodic behavior that the modulo function exhibits, trigonometric functions and Fourier series seem like a natural place to look. EDIT If you want to have the period be variable (as in $z(x, y) = x\mod y$ ), perhaps consider an interaction term in the Fourier regression.
