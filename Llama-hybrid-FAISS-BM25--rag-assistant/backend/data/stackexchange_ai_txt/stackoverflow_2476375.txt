No, does not work. You dont want anything that requires signiciant storage on client side then. If you get that large (by toring fo rexample images etc.), the storage requires more than a normal workstation has anyway to be efficient. You better go with something centralized then. Simple math - it simlpy is not feasible to have tond of gb on every workstation AND be efficient there. It simply makes no sense.
