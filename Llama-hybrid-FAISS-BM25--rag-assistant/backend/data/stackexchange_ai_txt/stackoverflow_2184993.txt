Java Class Architecture for swing GUI programming

I am writing an application that requires a large amount of swing GUI components. I am having a lot of trouble organizing the class. Is there a methodology to organize and neatly layout class architecture? I find my constructor confusing it consists of many components being initialized followed by several event handlers. In addition, I have numerous anonymous and inner classes and my main class has become bloated. However, when I put the inner class event handlers in separate files I have trouble accessing the components of my main class. Is there a methodology to internally organize large swingGUI applications?
