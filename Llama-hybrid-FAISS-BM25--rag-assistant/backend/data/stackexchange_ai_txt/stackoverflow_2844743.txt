Google Contacts Data API and PHP

I'm developing a PHP application to retrieve the list of contacts from a GMail account. I'm looking for a solution which would enable the user of my application to provide the login and password to their Gmail account in my application (as opposed to getting redirected to Google) and then automatically do the retrieval. The retrieval process can be run in PHP or JavaScript (which would then feed the list of contacts back to PHP using Ajax). Is it possible to do that? Which JavaScript API should I use for that? Can someone point me at the right chapter in Google Contacts Data API documentation?
