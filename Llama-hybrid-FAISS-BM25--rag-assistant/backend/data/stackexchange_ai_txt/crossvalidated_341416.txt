Firstly, you didn't say anything about how many objects or features you are working with -- which can be helpful for the optimal classifier choice. Furthermore, a lot of analysts implement complex models before knowing how to perform microsurgery so that a meaningful description of class separation can be made. It's always best to start by using straightforward multivariate linear regression first when the targets are -1, +1, such that you regress all the +/- variates on to the predictors. Reason is, because you first need to know if the class separation between +/- is linearly separable . If RF is breaking down, try LREG (multivariate linreg), followed by k-nearest neighbors, discriminant analysis, learning vector quantization, and then support vector machines with RBF kernel, and then neural networks. With regard to the 5-fold CV, since you didn't provide your total sample size, you should evaluate 2-, 5-, 10-fold, and LOOCV CV approaches.
