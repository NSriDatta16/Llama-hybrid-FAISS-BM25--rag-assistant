I tend to unit test the data access layer, it is always a pain in the ass because you have to setup a proper database with proper data. There are data generators out there that can help (like RedGate's Data Generator) make the setup process simpler. My thinking behind just testing the DAL, is that you are essentially testing the stored procedures themselves with the added .Net DB code which I don't think we need to worry about unit testing. This way you can leverage all the tools and processes you already have for unit testing. It seems like a lot of effort to develop a separate framework for something that can (IMHO) be performed equally well with existing tools. I have an open mind though. If there are benefits I am overlooking please do tell me. Cheers, V
