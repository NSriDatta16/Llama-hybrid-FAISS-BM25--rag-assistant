pvals.fnc does not work with random intercept and slope. How to get p-values?

I am doing LMM in lme4, and have installed languageR to run pvas.fnc(), but it does not work with random intercept and slope. This is the message: Error in pvals.fnc(lmer1) : MCMC sampling is not yet implemented in lme4_0.999375 for models with random correlation parameters For model with only random intercept, this function works fine. Then what should I do to get the p-values?
