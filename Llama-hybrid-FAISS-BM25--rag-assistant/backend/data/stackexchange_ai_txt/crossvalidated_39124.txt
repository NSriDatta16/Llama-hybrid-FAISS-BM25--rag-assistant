Unlike PCA- Laplacian eigenmaps uses the generalized eigen vectors corresponding to the smallest eigenvalues. It skips the eigen vector with the smallest eigen value (could be zero), and uses the eigen vectors corresponding to the next few smallest eigen values. PCA is a maximum variance preserving embedding using the kernel/gram matrix. Laplacian Eigenmaps is posed more as a minimization problem with respect to the combinatorial graph laplacian (refer papers by Trosset).
