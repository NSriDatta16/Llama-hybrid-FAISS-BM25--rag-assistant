In the end I figured that setting widgets to RadioSelect one by one was less code even though I have a lot of NullBooleanFields . The producted by RadioSelect widget is enough structure to style on, even though it requires CSS3 selectors. Not DRY, but less hassle. One needs to be pragmatic and move on. If someone could provide code to change the default widget for NullBooleanField from NullBooleanSelect to RadioSelect on the forms.py level, I'd happily accept the answer.
