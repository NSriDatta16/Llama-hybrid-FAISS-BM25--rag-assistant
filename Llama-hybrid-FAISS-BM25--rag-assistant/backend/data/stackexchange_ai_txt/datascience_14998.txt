Sharing Jupyter notebooks within a team

I would like to set up a server which could support a data science team in the following way: be a central point for storing, versioning, sharing and possible also executing Jupyter notebooks. Some desired properties: Different users can access the server and open and execute notebooks that were stored by them or by other team members. The interesting question here is what would be the behavior if user X executes cells in a notebook authored by user Y. I guess the notebook should NOT be changed: Solution should be self-hosted. Notebooks should be stored either on the server or on Google drive or on self-hosted instance of owncloud. (Bonus) Notebooks will be under git versioning control (git may be self-hosted. Cannot be bounded to GitHub or something of that sort). I looked into JupyterHub and Binder . With the former, I didn't understand how to allow cross users access. The latter seems to only support GitHub as the storage of the notebooks. Do you have experience with either of the solutions?
