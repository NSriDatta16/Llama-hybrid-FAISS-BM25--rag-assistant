We've made good experiences with the media repository from Fedora Commons ( http://www.fedora-commons.org/ ), which allows you to store media assets alongside their associated metadata. We did not have any problems with scalability or customization nor was it difficult to exchange the underlying storage layer with a triple store (if this would be needed in your case). If you need to index your data using Solr you can use a predefined meta data field ("RELS-EXT") to store XML based data.
