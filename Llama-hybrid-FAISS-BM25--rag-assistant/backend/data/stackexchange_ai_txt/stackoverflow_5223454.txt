Do you mean automatically translate the WPMU sites into individual WP installations? I doubt anything exists. It would involve copying WP files, making necessary directories and creating configuration files, all the DB tables, dealing with the differences in DB and files from WP vs WPMU (image storage, plugins, etc)... One solution, provided you have a handful of sites and not hundreds, can be to export the blog content via wp-admin > tools > export and importing back via wp-admin > tools > import once you have the new blog running. You will probably have to adjust the path for the images on the exporting XML files to agree with WP directory structure.
