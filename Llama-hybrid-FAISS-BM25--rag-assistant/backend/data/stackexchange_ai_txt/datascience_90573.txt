Transforming RGB to inputs for neural network

I have the RGB values from image and i want to make the neural network to recognize and see the colors like humans, is there an algorithm to train neural network with color images? How can i make the neural network to recognize for example a blue object in more colors(orange, yellow,red,black...and so on)?
