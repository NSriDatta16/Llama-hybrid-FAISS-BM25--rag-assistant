Why don't my LWP::UserAgent credentials work?

I'm trying to access a protected file. Server is using digest authentication - which I can see from the printed out response. Here is the sample code: use LWP; use strict; my $url = 'http://somesite.com/aa/bb/cc.html'; my $username = 'scott'; my $password = 'tiger'; my $browser = LWP::UserAgent->new('Mozilla'); $browser->credentials("http://somesite.com:80","realm-name",$username=>$password); my $response=$browser->get($url); print $response->content; Name of the realm I got it from the popup window I get when I try to access that resource from the browser. Same username and password are working extremely fine in the browser and I'm able to see the content but when I run the above script it always says 401 Authorization required . How does LWP work? Do I need to ask LWP to send MD5 hash (digest) of the username and password or is it like internally it checks which authentication to use and sends the corresponding (basic/digest) way of sending credentials. My questions are How can I set LWP so that it sends digest of username and password? What if the server is using windows NTLM authentication protocol? How should I go about in such a situation? any quick help is highly appreciated !
