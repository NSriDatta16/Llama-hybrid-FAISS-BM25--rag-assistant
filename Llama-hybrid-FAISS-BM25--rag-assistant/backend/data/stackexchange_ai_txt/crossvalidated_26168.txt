In addition to all the other great advices I suggest to get your hands dirty by participating in online competitions, see Sites for predictive modeling competitions Regarding books etc. you should take a look at: Machine learning self-learning book? Can you recommend a book to read before Elements of Statistical Learning? Regarding degrees I agree with @asjohnson that a certificate does matter less, at least I can confirm this for the area I am working in (Data Mining / ML on the web). It might be different for more "academic" areas like bioinformatics though. Being able to demonstrate that one is a) enthusiastic and b) has done actual work ("smart and getting things done") by showing off a small portfolio (e.g. online competitions ... ) should be more effective IMHO.
