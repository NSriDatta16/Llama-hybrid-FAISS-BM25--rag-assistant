How to deal with visually overlapping clusters

I have done hierarchal clustering (average) and silhouette method shows 6 as the best k. However visualising I see that most of the clusters are overlapping. Any way to deal with the overlapping clusters? Does overlapping clusters show the problem with clustering? Some stats: $average.between 0.8199681 $average.within 0.5613382 $n.between 18215 $n.within 5438 $max.diameter 1 1 $min.separation 0.1666667 $within.cluster.ss 37.59716 $clus.avg.silwidths (1)0.2679033 (2)0.2181911 (3)0.1480349 (4)0.1988496 (5)0.3415294 (6)0.2011643 $avg.silwidth 0.2187254 hopkins(Cluster, n=nrow(Cluster)-1) ## Seems to be clusterable as the value is 0.36 ## Also checked VAT library(factoextra) fviz_dist(dist.mat, show_labels = FALSE, order = TRUE)+ labs(title = "SR") ##Dist mat library(vegan) dist.mat
