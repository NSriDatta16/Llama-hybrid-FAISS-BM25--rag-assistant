Steps of a clustering problems composed by right-skewed data and large number of zeros

I'm trying to cluster a dataset based on 190 diabetic patients and 20 columns (features of patients) and many of these features have most zeros (to understand better, the median of 8 of 20 features is 0), with non-normal distribution. The steps I've followed are: extraction feature z-standardization of the variables application of PCA for dimensionality reduction execution of k-means results analysis I'm not sure about the results. I had to eliminate features that were too important according to the pca, but that in my case study are actually not so relevant (for example, in these features, due to standardization, the value of few non-zero values ​​is higher and hence there are features weighing more than others; this creates forced clusters, composed only of occurrences that dominate these features). In my opinion, both z-standardization and K-means aren't correct approach for my final purpose but in literature I didn't find a solution. What do you think are the correct phases in this specific problem? Thanks for the help.
