"Connect with Facebook" is simply an earlier design of the same button. If you really want to use that, you could fetch the code for "Login with Facebook", adjust it to look like "Connect with Facebook" and put it inline, but I would recommend against it, as such a solution is fragile and will break when Facebook changes something on their side.
