If I understand your question, you can use three separate tables. First, have the table of acronyms/definitions, then have a table of Organizations. Finally, have an AcronymOrganization table, that just references a key from the acronym table, and a key from the organization table. This way, you can have as many acronyms for an organization as you please. After you set up the database, you need to use a couple inner joins to join the three tables, collecting only the acronyms for the appropriate organization ID.
