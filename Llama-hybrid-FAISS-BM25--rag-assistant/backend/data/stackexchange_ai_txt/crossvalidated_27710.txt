Of course, any broad statements are bound to be overly broad. But my experience has been that econometrics is concerned about causal relationships and statistics has become more interested in prediction. On the economics side, you can't avoid the "credibility revolution" literature ( Mostly Harmless Econometrics , etc). Economists are focused on the impact of some treatment on some outcome with an eye towards policy evaluation and recommendation. On the statistics side, you see the rise of data mining/machine learning with applications to online analytics and genetics being notable examples. Here, researchers are more interested in predicting behavior or relationships, rather than precisely explaining them; they look for patterns, rather than causes. I would also mention that statisticians were traditionally more interested in experimental design, going back to the agricultural experiments in the 1930s.
