There are many areas that can be the culprit. You may have an #if or #ifdef DEBUG, or you could have (more likely) some source or xib that is not included in the Beta Target. You should be looking in the log, whether during its run via Xcode or after when you plug the device back into your Mac and look at the log file using the Organizer window, for more details of the crash. If it is related to clicking on a button, look at the path between the the button's actions set in the xib and the selector in your code. Sprinkle some NSLogs in there to help you out.
