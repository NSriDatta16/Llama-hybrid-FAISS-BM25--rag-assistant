If the second page is invoked via a GET, then you simply have to use your browser to save the URL to your favourites - if it's invoked via a POST, then this isn't directly possible. There are some workarounds, but using GET is the simplest option. EDIT: Also, if the operation is 'read-only' - i.e. it simply requests data and doesn't affect any long-term data storage values, the the HTTP spec reccomends using GET anyway.
