An interesting task on machine learning

There are 5 programs. Each program is a binary classifier, which classifies letters - "Spam" and "Not spam." All classifiers determine the category correctly in 60% of cases, regardless of other classifiers. Suppose that there is a new classifier that starts each of the modules and classifies the letter in the way that at least 3 out of 5 would classify it. What accuracy will such a classifier have? I assume that this is solved through the Bayesian theorem.
