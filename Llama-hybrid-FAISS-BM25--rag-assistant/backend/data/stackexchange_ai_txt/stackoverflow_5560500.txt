Working with IsolatedSTorageSettings for Windows 7

I was working with windows 7 application development and trying to create the same application given on their website to create and add notes (its an app to save notes in windows phone 7). The example has used IsolatedFileStorage to store each note. That is a new file is created everytime we create a note. I wanted to understand how to work with IsolatedStorageSettings where instead of creating a new file for every note I could maintain a note object in the isolated storage. Could someone point me towards some good examples/tutorials online for the same? Thank you
