If it's a fixed record you can get the size of a record and then divide the total file size by that amount to get the number of records. If you're just looking for an estimate, what I've done in the past is just read the first x rows (e.g. 200) and use that to come up with an average row size which you can then use to guess the total number of records (divide total file size by average row size). This works well if your records are going to be fairly uniform and you don't need an exact count. I've used this on large files (do a quick check to get the file size, if it's over 20 MB then get an estimate rather than reading the entire file). Other than that, the only 100% accurate way is to go through the file line by line using ReadLine.
