If you want a single array that contains both a.Manufacturer.Name and a.Name for each of the assets, you can do that with a slight modification of CMS's answer: var assetsInStorage = from a in assets.Assets where a.Name.Contains(prefixText) orderby a.Name ascending select new[] { a.Manufacturer.Name, a.Name }; At this point, assetsInStorage is an IEnumerable which also counts as an IEnumerable > . We can flatten this down to a single IEnumerable using SelectMany and then turn it into an array. return assetsInStorage.SelectMany(a => a).ToArray(); In this way, you're not required to select only a single string value.
