This is not a time series question. ARIMA or GARCH are completely irrelevant. There is exactly one question you need to consider, and we can't tell you the answer: what happened at the end of the series, and (a) will the recent increase continue, or (b) does this represent a step change such that the series will go back to a slower increase as before the recent spike from the level now achieved, or (c) is this a one-time effect that will dissipate such that the series will go back to its trajectory before the spike, or (d) something completely different. Your answer to this question will determine how you model, and it will utterly dominate your forecast. It does not matter at all what autoregressive order you model the rest of the series with if your choice between a-d makes a huge difference in your forecast. Any time series dynamics are of a distant secondary importance to the exactly one question. Thus: leverage your domain knowledge about what process exactly you are forecasting, what happened recently and what is likely to continue. If you do not have domain knowledge yourself, talk to people who do and get their informed opinion. Yes, that may result in multiple different answers. Consider forecasting multiple scenarios. Ideally, work with whoever consumes your forecast to make decisions and understand the decisions to be made with their tradeoffs. Related: How to know that your machine learning problem is hopeless?
