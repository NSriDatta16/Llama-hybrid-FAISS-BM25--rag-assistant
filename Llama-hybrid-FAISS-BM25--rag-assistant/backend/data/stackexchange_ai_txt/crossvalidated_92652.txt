So there are series of R package for doing similar thing; but in a different context. The examples are from gene expression data, where they have expression measurement in a course of time series. You just to look into their example, make your data look like them and run the analysis. Some of the method use Dirichlet Processing mixture model like this and some others are extended version of conventional clustering methods like this one . Mfuzz is another R package and also this one I hope it helps you
