How do I Combine two CNN models (h5 format)?

I have two CNN models, both of them are trained on the same dataset. How do I combine/ensemble both to make predictions on test data? # Load Keras Models model1 = tf.keras.models.load_model('/kaggle/input/models/model1.h5') model2 = tf.keras.models.load_model('/kaggle/input/models/basic_cnn.h5') How to combine these 2 models to make model3 ? I have to use predict_generator function to predict from the ensembled model3.
