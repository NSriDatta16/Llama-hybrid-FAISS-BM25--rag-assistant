You certainly can. I have gone through a very similar migration. We always compiled our web apps, but we migrated from VSS to SVN and then setup cruisecontrol and nant to automate our builds and deployments. We used to just drag and drop with windows explorer which was down right painful. As it happens I have been blogging on this process. My last post specifically covers using cruisecontrol.net and NANT: http://www.mattwrock.com/post/2009/10/22/The-Perfect-Build-Part-3-Continuous-Integration-with-CruiseControlnet-and-NANT-for-Visual-Studio-Projects.aspx
