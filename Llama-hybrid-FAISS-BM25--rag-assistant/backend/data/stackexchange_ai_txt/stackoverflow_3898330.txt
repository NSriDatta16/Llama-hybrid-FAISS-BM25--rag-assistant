I just added a VMA function to the TTR package to do this. For example: library(quantmod) # loads TTR getSymbols("SPY") SPY$absCMO A couple notes from the documentation: ‘VMA’ calculate a variable-length moving average based on the absolute value of ‘w’. Higher (lower) values of ‘w’ will cause ‘VMA’ to react faster (slower). The pre-compiled binaries should be on R-forge within 24 hours.
