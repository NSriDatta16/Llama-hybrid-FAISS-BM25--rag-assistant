Setting user agent of a java URLConnection

I'm trying to parse a webpage using Java with URLConnection. I try to set up the user-agent like this: java.net.URLConnection c = url.openConnection(); c.setRequestProperty("User-Agent", "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.4; en-US; rv:1.9.2.2) Gecko/20100316 Firefox/3.6.2"); But the resulting user agent is the one I specify, with "Java/1.5.0_19" appended to the end. Is there a way to truly set the user agent without this addition?
