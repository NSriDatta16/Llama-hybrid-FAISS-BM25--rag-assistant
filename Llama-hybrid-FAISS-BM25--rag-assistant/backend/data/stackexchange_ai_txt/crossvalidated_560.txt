I use the Gelman-Rubin convergence diagnostic as well. A potential problem with Gelman-Rubin is that it may mis-diagnose convergence if the shrink factor happens to be close to 1 by chance, in which case you can use a Gelman-Rubin-Brooks plot. See the "General Methods for Monitoring Convergence of Iterative Simulations" paper for details. This is supported in the coda package in R (for "Output analysis and diagnostics for Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations"). coda also includes other functions (such as the Gewekeâ€™s convergence diagnostic). You can also have a look at "boa: An R Package for MCMC Output Convergence Assessment and Posterior Inference" .
