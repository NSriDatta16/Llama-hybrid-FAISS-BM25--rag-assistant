Interview Question at Gaming Company

I came across the following interview question : In an online gaming company, customer churn is defined in terms of the number of days of continuous inactivity of the player. So how will you find the optimum number of days for which if the player is inactive, then he can be considered as churned? I was thinking something along the lines of a Bayesian approach but I am not sure how to go ahead. Any help in the right direction would be much appreciated.
