This technique is (really) often used in Javascript, with objects (when you are using string as keys, in JS, you are using objects, not arrays) ; for an example, see scriptaculous Draggable . Now, for a couple of pros and cons that immediatly come to mind : pro : you can use any number of parameters you want, and still have them named and there is no "only parameters at the end of the list are optionnal" con : phpdoc is not fine : it seems there is only one parameter, and there is not much indication on what it does con (consequence of the previous one) : when you are using an IDE with code-hints, it cannot display names/description for each parameter : you always have to check the documentation. That single "con" is enough for me : I only use that way of passing parameters if there is no other (reallistic) way.
