I wouldn't recommend mapping directly to System.Drawing.Image. Not only is it disposable (NHibernate would have to dispose it and I'm not sure it can), but also if you fetch a collection of clsSettings you'll be creating lots of Image instances, thus wasting CPU and memory if you don't use all of them. Instead, map to a byte[] with sql type varbinary and you handle converting from and to Image as necessary. Example . Also worth checking out is this project about large object storage support for NHibernate , seems to be more efficient than mapping to a byte[] and it's also an excellent article about all options.
