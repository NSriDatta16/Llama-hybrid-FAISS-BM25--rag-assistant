We have used Cantata and vectorcast in the past for Unit testing and code coverage. We also use the Greenhills tools and both of these tools work with the greenhills development tools. We run most of our test on the PPC simulator and just run test that rely on hardware on the Target hardware via a JTAG pod. Canatata and Vector cast are very similar with catata just slightly easier to use and have slightly more features but the small extras make a big difference in the user experience. Generally if you want to achieve a high level of branch coverage you need to design your code for testability. The more you test the more you learn about writing testable code. We also tried PC testing versus embedded testing gave us problems because of endianess but this is only a problem at the hardware layer. In addition these tools are certified to RTCA/DO-178B standard.
