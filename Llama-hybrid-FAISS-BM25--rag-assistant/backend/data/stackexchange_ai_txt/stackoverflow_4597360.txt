You should follow that wiki link, but I don't usually keep the RSM file separate, I usually link the TD32 (remote debug) symbols right into the main EXE, it works better. I wrote some of that wiki. My experience is that: (1) delphi 7 is still the most reliable remote debugger. (2) Delphi 2009, 2010, and XE work very well, and have been getting better, and the only remaining gotcha that I have found is that you might have to restart both your computers sometimes, in order to get the remote debug agent up. Inability to set breakpoints, or to see those blue circles that indicate that debug info is available usually means you should modify your project linker settings. I have used 2009, 2010, and XE remote debuggers heavily, and they work.
