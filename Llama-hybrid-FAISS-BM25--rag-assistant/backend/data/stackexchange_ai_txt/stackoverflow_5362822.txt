This is what I interpreted the problem statement: "User is allowed to enter the numbers as many times but when it enters 0, the program would display the average of the numbers being entered prior to 0 and exit" You may go this way: public static void main(String args[]) { float no = 0; float average = 0; int count = 1; if(args.length == 0) { printf("No number being entered...program exits"); System.exit(0); } if(args[0] == 0) { displayAverage(average); return; } for(count;count hope this may helps..
