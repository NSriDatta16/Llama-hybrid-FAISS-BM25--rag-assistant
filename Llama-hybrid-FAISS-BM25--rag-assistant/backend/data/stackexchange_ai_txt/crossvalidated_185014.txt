The average value of the $6$ correlations must be at least $-\frac 13$. More generally, for $n$ variables, the lower bound is $-\frac{1}{n-1}$; see this answer for a short proof. So, as pointed out by userE, it is entirely possible that one of the unknown correlations has value $-1$, or, for that matter, $+1$. Since you are seeking an upper bound on the maximum, you will be disappointed by the answer: the upper bound is $+1$ (which you knew even before you thought of $4$ random variables) and cannot be improved upon.
