As a new Rails developer, is it better to jump in the deep end with a large project or start small?

So I have a project - which I guess can be considered a relatively 'large-ish' project, that I want to build. However, I am completely new to Rails. I am intimately familiar with UX & front-end development, but dealing with the back-end is new to me. I really want to learn though, and I remember DHH famously saying that the best way to learn is just to do it. However, I was recently speaking to an experienced Rails developer and he said it might be better to build smaller projects - so I can learn in shorter durations and not get discouraged. Then I spoke to another experienced Rails developer and he said that there is something to be said about jumping in the deep end. So what do you guys think? What are the pros and cons of both?
