I use Atlassian's Bamboo continous integration server for my main PHP project (along with their other products such as fisheye (repository browsing), jira (issue tracker) and clover (code coverage)). It supports SVN and now supports Git and it has a great user interface. It is available for linux, windows and mac and can run standalone on its own tomcat server which is great for people (like me) who does not like to take days to setup their tools). Although it may look expensive, being a lone developer myself I purchased the starter kit license for 10$ (10$ by software). This is great for small teams and it is worth the look.
