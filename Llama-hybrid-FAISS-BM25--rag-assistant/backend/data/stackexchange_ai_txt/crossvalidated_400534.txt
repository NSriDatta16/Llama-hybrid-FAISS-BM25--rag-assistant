Forecast equation for ARIMA(0,1,q) in R

I am trying to figure out how R computes predictions for a fitted MA process of integration order 1. Consider the following trivial example of fitting an ARIMA(0,1,1) process to random data in R: set.seed(12345) y Relevant output: > mod Series: y ARIMA(0,1,1) Coefficients: ma1 -1.000 s.e. 0.034 > predict(mod, n.ahead = 1) $pred Time Series: Start = 101 End = 101 Frequency = 1 [1] 0.2451972 I expected the predicted value to be given by: $\hat{y}_{101} = y_{100} + \theta \hat{\varepsilon}_{100}$ which, in R, would be computed as: > y[100] + mod $coef*mod$ residuals[100] ma1 0.2499258 Can anyone explain why this is different from the predicted value of 0.2452 given by the predict function?
