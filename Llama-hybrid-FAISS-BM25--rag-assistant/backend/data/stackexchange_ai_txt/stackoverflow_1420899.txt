why doesn't the framework work around this and hide this problem from me and give me the right answer,0.69!!! Stop behaving like a dilbert manager, and accept that computers, though cool and awesome, have limits. In your specific case, it doesn't just "hide" the problem, because you have specifically told it not to. The language (the computer) provides alternatives to the format, that you didn't choose. You chose double, which has certain advantages over decimal, and certain downsides. Now, knowing the answer, you're upset that the downsides don't magically disappear. As a programmer, you are responsible for hiding this downside from managers, and there are many ways to do that. However, the makers of C# have a responsibility to make floating point work correctly, and correct floating point will occasionally result in incorrect math. So will every other number storage method, as we do not have infinite bits. Our job as programmers is to work with limited resources to make cool things happen. They got you 90% of the way there, just get the torch home.
