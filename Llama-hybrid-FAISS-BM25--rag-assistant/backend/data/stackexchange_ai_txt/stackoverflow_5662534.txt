There's a description of the algorithm used by the shazam service (which identifies a music given a short possibly noisy sample) here : http://www.ee.columbia.edu/~dpwe/papers/Wang03-shazam.pdf From what I understood, the first thing done is to isolate peaks in the spectrogram (with some tweaks to assure an uniform coverage), which will give a "constellation" of pair of values (time;frequency) from the initial spectrogram. Once done, the sample constellation is compared to the constellation of the full track by translating a window of the sample length from the beginning to the end and counting the number of correlated points. The paper then describes the technical solution they found to be able to do the comparison fast even with a huge collection of tracks.
