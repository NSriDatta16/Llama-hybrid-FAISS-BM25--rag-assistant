Your main question seems to be how you would go about analyzing this binary data. I will get to that in just a second, first I would note why your data are not Normal. Normal data are continuous (i.e. they can take any value in a range) but your data are not, they are binary or more generally categorical data. Thus you cannot say they are Normally distributed. As to what test you should use, there are specific tests for categorical data. A good introductory text is Agresti's Categorical Data Analysis. A nonparametric test would be used when data violates the assumptions of the traditional test you would use. While this data violates the assumptions of a test based on Normality it does not violate the assumptions of a test based on the binomial distribution, which is probably what you should use to model this data. One type of analyses that immediately comes to mind is logistic regression. In logistic regression you are modeling the probability of a success(traditionally a 1 would be a success, but this is dependent on the situation) given some explanatory variable (in your case tool). So you would be testing to see if the model that takes tool into account does a better job of estimating the success probability(average number of 1's per tool group) than a model that assumes a constant probability regardless of tool group. If you don't have access to Agesti's CDA book a basic intro that incorporates SPSS is found here http://www.appstate.edu/~whiteheadjc/service/logit/intro.htm And some of the assumptions of the test are pointed out here: https://statistics.laerd.com/spss-tutorials/binomial-logistic-regression-using-spss-statistics.php In conclusion your data are not Normal, but you do not need to use a nonparametric test. I would suggest logistic regression. By learning some of these Categorical techniques you will greatly broaden the types of analysis you can do.
