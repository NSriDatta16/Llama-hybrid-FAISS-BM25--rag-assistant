For what you need, you can use a tool like JarJarDiff[1] and get the differences between the new and the old version of the API jars. Then the task is transformed to verifying that you don't use any of the incompatible API's. Though not automatic, this approach draws your attention to the changes and not only to the binary compatibility. If you just want to check binary compatibility, the easiest is to recompile the project against the new JAR. A bit more difficult (and much more brittle) is to scan the classpath and invoke each method of each class, looking for linkage exceptions. Note that this naive approach will not test all possible paths and offers little benefit. [1] http://depfind.sourceforge.net/tasks/jarjardiff.html
