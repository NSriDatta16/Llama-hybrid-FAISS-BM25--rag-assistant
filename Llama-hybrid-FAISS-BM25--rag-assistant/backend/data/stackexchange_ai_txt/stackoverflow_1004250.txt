Ipso facto, any algorithm you can think of which requires lots of random disk I/O (random being the key word, which helps to throw the principle of locality to the birds, thus eliminating the usefulness of a lot of caching that goes on). I could see certain database systems gaining from this though. MySQL, for instance using the MyISAM storage engine (where data records are basically glorified CSVs). However, I think very large hashtables are going to be your best bet for good examples.
