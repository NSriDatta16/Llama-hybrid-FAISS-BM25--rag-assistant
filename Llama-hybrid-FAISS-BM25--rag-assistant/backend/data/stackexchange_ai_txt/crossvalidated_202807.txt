How do I know if I have enough features for a ML

Is there any way I can figure out if what the data I have can provide any reasonable prediction? Say, if I have 20 features, for example, how do I check that these features are actually useful for neural network. I am not sure if correlation can provide me any help here. Is there any other way? Thanks!
