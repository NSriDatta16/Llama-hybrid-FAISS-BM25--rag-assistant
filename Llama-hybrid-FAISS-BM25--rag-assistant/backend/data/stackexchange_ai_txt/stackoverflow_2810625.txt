I had exact the same problem! I had been searching and searching for days because all the babble about "put the -vm c:\program files\java\jdkxxxxx\bin" in the ini ar as argument for a shortcut did not at all help ! (Do I sound frustrated? Believe me, that's an understatement! I am simply furious because I lost a week trying to make Maven reliable!) I had very unpredictable behavior. Sometimes it compiled and sometimes not. If I did a maven clean , it could not find the compiler and failed. If I then changed something in the build path, it suddenly worked again!! Until I went to menu Window → Preferences → Java → Installed JRE's . I added a new JRE using the location of the JDK and then removed the JRE. Suddenly Maven ran stable! Maybe this is worth putting in letters with font-size 30 or so in the Apache manual? With all due respect, this is simply outrageous for the Java community! I can't imagine how many days were lost by all these people, trying to work out their problems of this kind! I cannot possibly imagine this is released as a final version. I personally would not even dare to release such a thing under the name beta software... Kind regards either way.... After a week of tampering I can finally start developing. I hope my boss won't find out about this. It took me lots of effort to convince him not to go to .NET and I already feel sorry about it.
