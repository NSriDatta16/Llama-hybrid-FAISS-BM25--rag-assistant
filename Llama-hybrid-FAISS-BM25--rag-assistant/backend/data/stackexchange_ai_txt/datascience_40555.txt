CNN - Is this a Toeplitz Matrix?

I have been reading through Chapter 9 of www.deeplearningbbook.org , where convolutional networks are being described. The following image represents the output of a 2D convolution, without kernel flipping. The book goes on to describe this matrix as a Toeplitz matrix where, for univariate discrete convolution, each row of the matrix is constrained to be equal to the row above shifted by one element. I fully understand this statement since w , x , y and z are constants in their respective columns with shifting elements. However, there is no mention of diagonal-constants which are a key feature of such matrices. As per Wikipedia (link above) and several other sources: a Toeplitz matrix or diagonal-constant matrix, named after Otto Toeplitz, is a matrix in which each descending diagonal from left to right is constant. Going back to the image above, does this mean that, for instance, aw == cx == gy ? How can this be ensured when all elements are different?
