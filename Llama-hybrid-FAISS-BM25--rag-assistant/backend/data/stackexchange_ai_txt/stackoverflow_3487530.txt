Using ASP.NET HttpCache to buffer data from a web service

What problems might I encounter by using the HttpCache to buffer data from a web service, as opposed to storing the same data in a database table? In a hypothetical situation whereby the service was temporarily unavailable, if the server needed to reboot during that time there would be no way to re-populate the cache. So for that reason, is it possible to persist the cache like you could do with SqlServer Session state? I read the HttpCache is implemented using the Singleton pattern. Does that mean I should be using Mutex when working with objects coming from the cache? What will happen if the cache is being updated on the one hand by a separate threaded process while also being read by a different thread? Thanks.
