First , Marjan, Thank you for your answer, I am very sure I had clicked the refesh button in that time, but there was still nothing changed.... After many experiments, I found that if I inserted an auto-increment id into table fields as primary key , this strange behaviour would not happen, although i have done this , there is another strange behaviour , I will show my code snips , as below: procedure TForm9.btn1Click(Sender: TObject); var sqlCommand: string; connection: TADOConnection; begin connection := TADOConnection.Create(nil); try connection.ConnectionString := 'Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0;Data Source=Test.MDB;Persist Security Info=False'; connection.Open(); connection.Execute('insert into aaa (TestField1) values (''Test'')'); connection.Execute('select * from aaa'); connection.Execute('delete * from aaa'); // breakpoint 1 beep; // breakpoint2 finally connection.Free; end; end; Put two breakpoints at line “delete” and “beep”, when codes stoped at breakpoint1, you can refresh the database , and you would find that the record was inserted, continue running when the codes stoped at the breakpoint2, you would find the record was still in there..... If at this time you pressed ctrl+f2, the record would be not deleted.... if connection.execute is a real sychronouse procedure , this should not happend. sorry for checking your answer so late, because i am on our dragon boat festival...
