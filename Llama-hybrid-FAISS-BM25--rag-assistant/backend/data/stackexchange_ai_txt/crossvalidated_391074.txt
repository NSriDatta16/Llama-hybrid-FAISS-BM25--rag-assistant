There is a straightforward (and if I may add, elegant) solution to this exercise: since $1-F(x)$ appears like a product of two survival distributions: $$(1-F(x))=\exp\left\{-ax-\frac{b}{p+1}x^{p+1}\right\}=\underbrace{\exp\left\{-ax\right\}}_{1-F_1(x)}\underbrace{\exp\left\{-\frac{b}{p+1}x^{p+1}\right\}}_{1-F_2(x)}$$ the distribution $F$ is the distribution of $$X=\min\{X_1,X_2\}\qquad X_1\sim F_1\,,X_2\sim F_2$$ In this case $F_1$ is the Exponential $\mathcal{E}(a)$ distribution and $F_2$ is the $1/(p+1)$ -th power of an Exponential $\mathcal{E}(b/(p+1))$ distribution. The associated R code is as simple as it gets x=pmin(rexp(n,a),rexp(n,b/(p+1))^(1/(p+1))) #simulating an n-sample and it is definitely much faster than the inverse pdf and accept-reject resolutions: > n=1e6 > system.time(results system.time(x system.time(x with an unsurprisingly perfect fit:
