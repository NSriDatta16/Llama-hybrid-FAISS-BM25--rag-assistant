A tool would do the actual testing for you, given the right inputs. Whereas a framework gives you the necessary help to do the testing. Like in the case of White, it just helps you get controls and provide mouse clicks and stuff. It doesn't actually run anything on its own. Nunit is another framework at a slightly higher level, you run your test cases, it just tells you whether it passed or not. An example for a tool can be a defragmenter, it actually performs the action. Just tying to explain my point of view.. Hope it helps!
