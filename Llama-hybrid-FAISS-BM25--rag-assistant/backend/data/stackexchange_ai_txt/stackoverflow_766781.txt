Here's how I've seen it done. Align the directory structure along related technology lines. This is probably team-based right now. Use a database or something to map binaries (or source files) to team members. Then when things move around, all you have to do is update the database. If you make the root pretty broad, you'll have less reorganization to do later than if you make it small.
