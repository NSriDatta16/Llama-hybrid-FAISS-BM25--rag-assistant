This isn't the most elegant, but how about something like: cp 462[5-9] 46[3-9]? 4[7-9]?? 5??? 6[0-2]?? 63[0-4]? 635[0-3] otherDirectory which would copy files named 4625 to 6353 inclusive to otherDirectory . (You wouldn't want to use something like 4* since that would copy the file 4 , 42 , 483 , etc.)
