Sample Error vs. True Error

$\newcommand{\error}{\operatorname{error}}$I'm reading Mitchell's Machine Learning and am on Chapter 5, evaluating hypotheses. In it, he defines sample error and true error: The sample error, denoted $\error_s(h)$ of hypothesis $h$ with respect to target function $f$ and data sample $S$ is : $$\error_s(h)=\frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{x \in S}{\delta(f(x), h(x))}$$ where $n$ is the number of examples in $S$, and the quantity $${\delta(f(x), h(x))} = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if }f(x) \neq h(x) \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$$ The true error, denoted $\error_D(h)$ of hypothesis with respect to target function $f$ and distribution $D$, is the probability that $h$ will misclassify an instance drawn a random according to $D$: $$\error_D(h)= \mathbb{P}(f(x) \neq h(x))$$ What is the distribution $D$ referred to here? It seems like true error is really just looking at the proportion of examples that $h$ misclassifies. I'm a little confused about why $D$ is being introduced here at all...
