In what cases linear SVM and LDA are equivalent?

Lately I've been training some binary classifiers for a school project, and I realized that my linear SVM in most cases gives almost identical AUC scores as my LDA classifier. I used C=1 for the SVM and automatic shrinkage (using the Ledoit-Wolf lemma) for the LDA. What circumstances can produce such similar results for two classifier having so little in common?
