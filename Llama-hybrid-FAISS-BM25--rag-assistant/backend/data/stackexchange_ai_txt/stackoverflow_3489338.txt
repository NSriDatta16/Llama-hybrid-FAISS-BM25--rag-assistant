It sounds like you're understanding bits and pieces of the problem, but you're still not quite getting the "Big Picture". Yes, it's possible to call a shell script from a Java program. Easy, in fact! Yes, generally, you should be able to see anything that's printed to stderr or stdout. And yes, you should be able to redirect stderr and/or stdout to a file. Your problem is evidently that you're not seeing WHAT you expect to see, WHEN you expect to see it. This is normal, this is expected ... and, in the bigger scheme of things, this is HIGHLY DESIRABLE. The central issue, I believe, is "I/O buffering". Buffering is a Good Thing. I strongly encourage you to: 1. Create a simple, single-threaded command line Java test program that calls a shell script. Elaborate the test program with threads. Depending on how the program is structured, you may or may not get "expected results". Substitute a C program (or another Java program) for the shell script Experiment, and see what you learn. Good luck - and please DON'T just jump to the first conclusion that seems half-way plausible. Always TEST your theories. PS: And repeat my mantra: "I/O buffering is Good" ;-) PPS: Q: This question has been viewed only 38 times so far! A: "You must learn patience, young Grasshopper" ;-) Q: This is kinda critical for me! A: "Humility must you learn, too" ;-)
