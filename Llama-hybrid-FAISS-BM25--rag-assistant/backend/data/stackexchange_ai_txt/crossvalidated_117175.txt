If you are familiar with ordinal logistic regression models and mixed-effects models with lmer in the lme4 package in R , you may want to check out the clmm (cumulative link mixed models) function in the ordinal package. This function, built on lmer , may prove especially useful if you have covariates to control for. I suppose this answer may be more relevant to Brian's problem than that of @user45094; I am not sure if SPSS has something like cumulative link mixed models.
