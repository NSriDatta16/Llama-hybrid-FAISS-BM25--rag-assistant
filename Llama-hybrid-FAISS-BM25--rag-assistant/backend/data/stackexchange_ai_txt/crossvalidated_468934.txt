Can you explain how OLS for non-linear data is working in statsmodels OLS implementation?

reference: https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/examples/notebooks/generated/ols.html#OLS-non-linear-curve-but-linear-in-parameters How is OLS in this implementation working? Is it finding the best line for each point along the way and recursively building the entire line? There is not much online about OLS for non-linear data. I'm questioning my results and hoping to find someway of explaining how OLS in stats models can produce a model like this. Any explanation or references is appreciated. Thanks. I'm doing a time series model trying to predict one parameter called "activity". Following along the documentation for stats models (link) they show modeling non-linear data using OLS. I used the OLS with my dependent variable being the activity for that day and the independent variables as lagged days of 1,6,7,8 and 10 days behind my predicted date. I used about 80% of the days before as the training set and the remainder as a test.
