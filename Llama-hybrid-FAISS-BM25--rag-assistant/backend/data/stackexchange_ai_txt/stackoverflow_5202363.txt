Lua - simple iterator assignment?

I'm new to Lua so please bear with this simple question :) I'm simply trying to iterate over a table, and modify it's values. however, it seems I can't modify directly the "value" part? code: for id,value in pairs(some_table) do value = value * some_math_here end will i actually need to modify some_table[id] instead, or is there a more elegant way?
