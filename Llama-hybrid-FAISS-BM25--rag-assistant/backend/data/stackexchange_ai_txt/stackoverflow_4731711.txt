one problem I had was having a draggable element that too wide to be dropped on to a droppable element if the tolerance option is at the default value of 'intersect'. 'intersect' means the draggable can be dropped when it 50% of it is over the droppable. And that's impossible if its more than twice as wide. My draggables had a variable value, so their width varied and whether they could be dropped varied too. I used 'pointer' instead and it goes by where the mouse is.
