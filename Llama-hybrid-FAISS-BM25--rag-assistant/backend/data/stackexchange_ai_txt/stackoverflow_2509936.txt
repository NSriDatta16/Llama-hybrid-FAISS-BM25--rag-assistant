Look at using Linq2Sql (In your project add a new Linq to Sql Classes dbml file and drag your tables onto it from the server exploter), it will map your tables to classes and a datacontext, which you can use to create new data objects to update your tables. It will automatically track and insert the necessary rows and manage the relationships between them DataContext db = new DataContext(); Questionnaire q = new Questionnaire(); q.UserId = 1234; Feedback f = new Feedback(); f.Questionnaire = q; db.Feedbacks.InsertOnSubmit(f); db.SubmitChanges(); A great place to start is with Scott Gu's introduction on his blog http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/05/19/using-linq-to-sql-part-1.aspx
