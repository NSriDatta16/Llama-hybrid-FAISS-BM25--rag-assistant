The main thing you need to know is that adjacent (vertical) margins mere so if you have: p { margin: 1em 0; } ... Paragraph one Paragraph two The space between them will be 1em not 2em. Padding is separate. If the paragraphs had padding it would be inside their boxes. The source of truth for all these things is the W3C CSS standard. For example, collapsing margins : In this specification, the expression collapsing margins means that adjoining margins (no padding or border areas separate them) of two or more boxes (which may be next to one another or nested) combine to form a single margin. In CSS2, horizontal margins never collapse. Vertical margins may collapse between certain boxes: Two or more adjoining vertical margins of block boxes in the normal flow collapse. The resulting margin width is the maximum of the adjoining margin widths. In the case of negative margins, the absolute maximum of the negative adjoining margins is deducted from the maximum of the positive adjoining margins. If there are no positive margins, the absolute maximum of the negative adjoining margins is deducted from zero. Vertical margins between a floated box and any other box do not collapse. Margins of absolutely and relatively positioned boxes do not collapse. Please consult the examples of margin, padding, and borders for an illustration of collapsed margins. Borders are a little different, particularly in tables where they can collapse into each other or not depending on CSS. Now the story doesn't end there of course. Browsers can vary on how they calculate combinations of width, margins, borders and padding but that's largely diminished by forcing browsers into standards mode (with a DOCTYPE) and a large topic in and of itself (as is what you do to minimize these sorts of problems).
