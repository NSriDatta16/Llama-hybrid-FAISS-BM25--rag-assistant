I don't know of anyone embedding WPF controls into an XNA game window. This would be a very difficult thing due to the fact that they both use DirectX for rendering. Since you're allowed to do anything with XNA, that would make WPF overlays and whatnot very difficult. If you're looking for in-game controls, try out NeoForce . Going the other way is much simpler (read: actually supported). I know that you can embed an XNA window into a a Windows user control -- see this for a quick demo. I have used a technique similar to that to make an editor for my game. Unfortunately, integrating directly with WPF would be troublesome as well (due to the same reasons you can't put WPF controls in an XNA GameWindow). However, you could embed that control onto a WindowsFormsHost and that might work nicely (haven't ever tried it). Obviously, this will not work on Xbox 360, since WinForms and WPF aren't available there, but you typically don't put your editor on 360 anyway. ALSO: I hope you're not using XML serialization to load your game files at run time -- that's what the XNA Content Pipeline is for.
