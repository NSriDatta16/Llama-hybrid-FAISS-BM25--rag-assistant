Cross-platform desktop notifier in Python

I am looking for Growl -like, Windows balloon-tip-like notifications library in Python. Imagine writing code like: >>> import desktopnotifier as dn >>> dn.notify('Title', 'Long description goes here') .. and that would notify with corresponding tooltips on Mac, Windows and Linux. Does such a library exist? If not, how would I go about writing one myself? Does Mac come with a default notifier? Is Growl something that I should install separately? On Windows, I assume this may require pywin32 ? On Linux, assuming GNOME, is there a GNOME API (using gnome-python) that does this? Can I make notifications 'sticky' (i.e., don't fade out ever) on all platforms? Update : My preference is to not depend on gigantic GUI frameworks like PyQT4 and wxPython for a simple task such as this.
