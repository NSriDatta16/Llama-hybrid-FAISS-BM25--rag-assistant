Regarding question 1, let the output of ca.jo be x , then you can get the cointegration vectors as x@V . This will contain the coefficients "inside" the ect1 term. Regarding question 2, the coefficient on compp.dl1 will the be effect of lagged (rather than contemporaneous) compp on dem . Keep in mind that compp might be affected by dem at the same time as it is affecting dem (that is, compp might be endogenous w.r.t. dem ), although it need not necessarily be the case. See the vignette of package "vars" and/or Pfaff "Analysis of Integrated and Cointegrated Time Series with R" for more details.
