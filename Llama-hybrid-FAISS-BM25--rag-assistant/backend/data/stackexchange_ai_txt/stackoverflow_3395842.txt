Updating User field in SharePoint

I am harnessing batch update of SharePoint list in order to update my list items. I have a field of SPUser type named as 'UserName'. If i try to update the value of that particular field using batch, am obtaining unexpected error. I tried out both the username as well as the ID of the user. It was futile. How could I update a SPUser field in batch update? Any responses would be warmly welcomed Regards, Raghuraman.V
