Agree. Many of the functions that you'd want to call would be functions that you'd have to P/Invoke from C#. Callbacks from the OS to your C# program aren't pretty either, with stuff like System.Runtime.InteropServices.CallingConvention. Now, for stuff like the aforementioned Password Managers, this might not matter much. That's really just a fancy database, with smart import/export/storage/transformation features. Still, it would be useful if they could interact with other programs. You simply cannot inject a C# DLL in random processes.
