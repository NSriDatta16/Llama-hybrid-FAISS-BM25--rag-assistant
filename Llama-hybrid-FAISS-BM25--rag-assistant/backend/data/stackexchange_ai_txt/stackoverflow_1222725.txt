WatiN Test Project Best Practices

After building up and running lots of WatiN tests, what are some good ways to organize the tests? If I was asked "Do we have a test that does X, then Y?" How would I look that up? Would it be with all tests surrounding X or Y? It seems after getting lots of tests in here, organization becomes a bit of an issue. I'm just looking for some advice to help us keep our tests well named and organized, thus, more maintainable.
