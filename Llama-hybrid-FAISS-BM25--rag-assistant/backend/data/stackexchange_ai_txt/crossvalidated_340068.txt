How to forecast hierarchical time series with external unique external regressors for each base time series?

I have hierarchical time series with 70 base time series, forming 4 level of hierarchies. I am using forecast() function in R from the package forecast. The documentation reads: When xreg and newxreg are passed, the same covariates are applied to every series in the hierarchy. Is it possible to tweak, in such a way that correct regressors are used for individual time series? Thank you very much.
