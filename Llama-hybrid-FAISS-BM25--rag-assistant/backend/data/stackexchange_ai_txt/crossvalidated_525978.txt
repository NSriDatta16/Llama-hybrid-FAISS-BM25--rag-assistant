Really nice answers so far! For the mathematical proof regarding robin's first sentence, (i.e. Wavelets are useful to detect singularities in a signal ), originally by Yves Meyer, see Singularity Detection and Processing with Wavelets (Mallat and Hwang, 1992). Not only they are useful, they are guaranteed to concentrate around singularities and make them quantifiable via their Lipschitz measure, kind of an "if and only if" condition. This said, I'd like to reflect on robin's hypothesis that singularities can be an anomaly, and possibly broaden it by rather saying that, since wavelet representations concentrate more on singularities, the result is generally sparser, and a sparser representation can allow to identify anomalies more reliably (even if just as a consequence of having less parameters). Of course, not everything can be solved with wavelets, this is not the 90s anymore. Now we throw neural networks at everything!
