No provisioned iOS device is connected

I know this question has been asked before - but there are different causes, and the one I'm interested in is as a consequence to updating the test device to iOS4.2. (I've tried the steps suggested by other threads - they don't help in this case.) I made the mistake of agreeing to this upgrade on the device - Now my development process is broken. In XCode, I try to build and run, and I get the error: "No provisioned iOS device is connected" However - If I drag the apk file into iTunes, I can synch and install to the device that way. I'm a paid up Apple developer. I have provisioning profiles that always used to work before. I have XCode 3.2.4. I'm reluctant to upgrade. The download looks like it will take 7 or more hours from the country I'm currently in - plenty of time for a glitch, and a failed download. (But I will try tonight - I may get lucky). Can anyone suggest how I can get XCode to test apps on the device WITHOUT the 3.52GB upgrade?
