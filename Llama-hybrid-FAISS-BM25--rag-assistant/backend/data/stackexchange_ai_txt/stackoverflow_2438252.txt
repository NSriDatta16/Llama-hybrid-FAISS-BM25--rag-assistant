Smell is a sort of hashing. A smelling hash function transforms a huge variety of chemical compounds to a small piece of information (several things may smell alike). Living organisms learn to distinguish the "buckets" such "hashing" puts the objects to, and tend to infer behavioral patterns that rely on such a function. This applies to taste as well.
