So, assuming temper is your "target" times series, $y(t)$, what you're essentially trying to do is get a sense of other indicators $\vec{x}(t)$ and how the effect/predict the target. ARIMA is probably not the way to go. A good, multivariate way to do this is to use python statsmodels, which has VAR implemented -- called Vector Auto Regression -- that allows for multiple time series $\vec{x}(t)$ to predict a target time series $y(t)$. It's essentially ARIMA -- when the target time series regresses on its own history -- applied to multiple variables. ARIMA is very sensitive to missing values/variables, so you'll probably want to fill them in using mean/last-value or exlude that variable/time period from the study. If you want to do something SUPER simple, in order to get a sense of what indicators "matter" in predicting mood outbursts, you might want to just correlate/regress $y(t)$ with a lagged set of predictors $\vec{x}(t-\tau)$ -- $\tau$ being 1,2,3,4 days, etc. -- and see which are significant. You can do this at mulitple lags to get a sense of effect; or, construct a cross correlation function in python statsmodels to get a full, univariate picture.
