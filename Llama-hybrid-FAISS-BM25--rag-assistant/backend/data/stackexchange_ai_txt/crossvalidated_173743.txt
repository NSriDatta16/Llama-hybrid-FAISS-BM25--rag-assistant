You are not doing clustering , and there is also no suitable data or task here for learning . What you want to do is categorizarion , probably with a rather simple aggregation statistic. For every user: select all his books select all categoies of his books return the most frequent book category as user category By the usual terminology: Machine learning requires training data, and you want to transfer this information to unlabeled data. Clustering is when you do not know what classes exist. You have only one kind of data. For ML you need to have training data, and data to predict for. But at the same time, you have book categories - you don't want a clustering algorithm to do something different. A clustering algorithm will yield Clusters "1", "2" and "3". It cannot tell you what makes the cluster special. Try above approach (there probably is no "tool" or "algorithm" gor that, you should be able to formulate this as SQL query). It's easy to understand, and predictable. Simple wins.
