The commenters are correct in saying that various tests allow you to check for stationarity or not when in doubt. For anyone looking into this question, there's an enlightening discussion around your cross-post in the Quantitative Finance section . And I'll repeat my QF answer here too: ———————————— They probably can be modelled using a weakly stationary process. To quote Section 1.2.1 from these lecture notes : [Asset] returns [...] typically fluctuate around a constant level, suggesting a constant mean over time. [...] In fact most asset returns can be modeled as a stochastic process with at least time-invariant first two moments. Mathematically, a time series $\{ Y_t \}$ is weakly stationary if, for all time indices $k,s,t$ $\text{E}[Y_s] = E[Y_t]$, i.e. the first moment (the mean) is constant $\text{Cov}[Y_t, Y_{t+k}] = \text{Cov}[Y_s,Y_{s+k}]$, i.e. the second moment is constant From a visual inspection of your series of asset returns, the mean/first moment does indeed appear to be constant the series clearly exhibits the phenomenon of volatility clustering , implying that it has a non-constant "conditional volatility" / exhibits heteroskedasticity - however we cannot make any visual judgements as to the behaviour of the un conditional volatility.
