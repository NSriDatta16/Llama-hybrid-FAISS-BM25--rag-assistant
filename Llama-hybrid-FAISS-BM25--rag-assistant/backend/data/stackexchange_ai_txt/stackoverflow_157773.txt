How can I easily turn a .Net Windows Form app into an Asp.net app using Visual Studio 2005?

I have a pretty basic windows form app in .Net. All the code is C#. I'd like to turn it into an Asp.net web app. How can I easily do this? I think there's an easy way since the controls I drag/drop onto the windows form designer are pretty much the same that I drag/drop onto the aspx design page. Note: the windows form app doesn't make any network requests or anything... just reads some text files from the local machine.
