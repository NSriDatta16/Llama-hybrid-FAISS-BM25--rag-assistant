The thing will work but you need to remember it's going to affect your tags too. Consider this example.: this links to http://static.oursite.com/login which is not what we wanted. we wanted http://oursite.com/login If you use a PHP function call for creating your links, that won't be a problem as you can just make sure it spits out absolute URL. But if you (or your designers) hand-code the tags then you're stuck with the same problem again, just now with instead of . EDIT: I should add the above paragraph is assuming you serve images from a different host name like we do. If you don't then obviously that won't be a problem.
