If you need to pull all the tags anyway, and the limit to the top n is simply a presentation thing, Fragsworth's answer is probably the way to go. If you aren't using the remainder of the tags somewhere else, I'd argue that this is really something that should be happening in the database query...you would want to be doing an 'ORDER BY count DESC LIMIT n' on the query to avoid pulling a bunch of tags that you aren't going to use. However, it appears that django-tagging is hard coded to always group/sort by tag ids and names. I'd say the right solution is to file a bug against that, and get an api exposed that will give you back the top n tags.
