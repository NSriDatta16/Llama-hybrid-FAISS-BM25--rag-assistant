That approach sounds right, another approach is to try to reduce the dimensions of the dataset and observe if the data is separable in the lower dimension space (via plots) there are different algorithms for doing this and they all maintain different structural properties, but the commonly used approach is the PCA and LDA. Other methods exists such as the MDS which maintains the global distances.
