How to implement pan/zoom on gigapixel bitmaps?

In my project, I'm using (uncompressed 16-bit grayscale) gigapixel images which come from a high resolution scanner for measurement purposes. Since these bitmaps can not be loaded in memory (mainly due to memory fragmentation) I'm using tiles (and tiled TIFF on disc). (see StackOverflow topic on this ) I need to implement panning/zooming in a way like Google Maps or DeepZoom. I have to apply image processing on the fly before presenting it on screen, so I can not use a precooked library which directly accesses an image file. For zooming I intend to keep a multi-resolution image in my file (pyramid storage). The most useful steps seem to be +200%, 50% and show all. My code base is currently C# and .NET 3.5. Currently I assume Forms type, unless WPF gives me great advantage in this area. I have got a method which can return any (processed) part of the underlying image. Specific issues: hints or references on how to implement this pan/zoom with on-demand generation of image parts any code which could be used as a basis (preferably commercial or LGPL/BSD like licenses) can DeepZoom be used for this (i.e. is there a way that I can provide a function to provide a tile at the right resulution for the current zoom level?) ( I need to have pixel accurate addressing still)
