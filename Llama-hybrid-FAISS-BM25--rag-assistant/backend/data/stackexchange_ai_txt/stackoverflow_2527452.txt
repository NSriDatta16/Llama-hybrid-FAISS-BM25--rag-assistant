Are you sure branch labs does not already exist (as in this thread )? You can't have both a file, and a directory with the same name. You're trying to get git to do basically this: % cd .git/refs/heads % ls -l total 0 -rw-rw-r-- 1 jhe jhe 41 2009-11-14 23:51 labs -rw-rw-r-- 1 jhe jhe 41 2009-11-14 23:51 master % mkdir labs mkdir: cannot create directory 'labs': File exists You're getting the equivalent of the "cannot create directory" error. When you have a branch with slashes in it, it gets stored as a directory hierarchy under .git/refs/heads . Note that labs must not be an existing branch , as ddruganov points out in the comments : git switch -c 19023-commerce/19033-commerce-view 19023-commerce # Fails with: fatal: cannot lock ref 'refs/heads/19073-commerce-view/99999-test-branch': 'refs/heads/19073-commerce-view' exists; cannot create 'refs/heads/19073-commerce-view/99999-test-branch' As explained in " git push: refs/heads/my/subbranch exists, cannot create ": If branch b exists, no branch named b/anything can be created. Likewise, if branch dev/b exists, dev/b/c cannot be created. This is a git internal limitation.
