Can I classify a healthy population into clusters found in an injured population?

Just a bit of context: We are applying Machine Learning algorithms in the field of Human Biomechanics. In a previous project, my colleagues identified three different subgroups in an injured population performing a movement utilising hierarchical clustering. In order to be able to classify new subjects, we developed a classification algorithm (using the same dataset) that was able to allocate each case to the predefined cluster. We currently are working in another study that involves new comparing injured and healthy subjects performing the same task in which the clusters were found. My questions are, is there any way to know to what extent clusters found in injured athletes apply to healthy athletes? If I used the same algorithm and features, what could be the effects/consequences? can I justify it? What are the limitations? Any answer or directions to literature will be greatly appreciated as I am struggling to find any similar situation in the literature/internet. Thanks everyone. Cheers!
