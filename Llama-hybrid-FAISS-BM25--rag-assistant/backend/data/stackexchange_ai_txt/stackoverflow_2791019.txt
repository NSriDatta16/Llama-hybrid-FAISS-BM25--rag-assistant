Apache and linux file permissions can't browse file or directories

I just copied my magento site over to a local server running CentOS 5.4. The browser said it can't locate the location of the stylesheets. The stylesheets are within /skin/frontend/my_new_interface/design2/css. I tried to view in the browser and I can't view any of the files within the css directory. I verified a million times that I'm typing in the correct location. I can view files within /skin/frontend/my_new_interface/design2. Can't browse directories within browser however. I typed in ls -l css and get: -rwxr-xr-x 1 apache apache listed for all the files I tried chmod -R 755 and the directories I changed the apache conf Options Indexes But still when I browse the directories I get Forbidden. However, in another fresh installation of magento in the same www dir, I am able to browse directories. As far as I can tell both installations have same ownership and permissions. I also tried find . -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \; find . -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \; which was recommended in the magento wiki I've just run out of ideas.
