Assuming that most of the strings for e.g Manufacturer or Model Name etc will occur many times, you can treat them as categorical features. You can then numerically encode them (for example, with one-hot encoding) and fit a classifier. This seems like a fairly suitable problem for a tree-based model, so I'd check out scikit-learns implementations of decision tree and random forest classifiers.
