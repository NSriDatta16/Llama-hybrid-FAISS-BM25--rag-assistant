Just a couple of ideas off the top of my head Basic Provide an example of how to bind a click event to all paragraphs, except the last one (covers basic dom selection & event handling) Example of how to fade in a div from an invisible state Advanced Write an selector filter to return only nodes with lower case values. ie $.expr[':'].lowercaseOnly = function(el, i, m) { ... } I also agree with @Coronatus answer. A good jQuery developer should have a solid knowledge of js.
