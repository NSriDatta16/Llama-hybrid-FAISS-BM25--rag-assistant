How to deal with gaps/NaNs in time series data when using Matlab for autocorrelation and neural networks?

I have a time series of measurements (heights-one dimensional series). In the observation period, the measurement process went down for some time points. So the resulting data is a vector with NaNs where there were gaps in the data. Using MATLAB, this is causing me a problem when computing the autocorrelation ( autocorr ) and applying neural networks ( nnstart ). How should these Gaps/NaNs be dealt with? Should I just remove these from the vector? Or replace their entry with an interpolated value? (if so how in MATLAB)
