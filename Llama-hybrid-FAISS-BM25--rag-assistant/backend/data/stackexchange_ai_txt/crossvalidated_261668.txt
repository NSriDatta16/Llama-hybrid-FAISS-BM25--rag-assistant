Basically, logistic regression works in terms of log odds of one class ("success") given another ("failure") that servers as a "default" class and translates them to probability using inverse of logit function. Multinomial regression is an extension of logistic regression to case of $K>2$ classes. It works in terms of log odds of some class given some other "default" class. This means that when using multinomial regression we focus on pairwise relations with the "default" class. So for $K$ classes we need $K-1$ sets of linear predictors, since we are looking at $K-1$ comparisons between classes. Yes, this means that we are ignoring other pairwise relations and assume that they are irrelevant given the relation with the "default" class.
