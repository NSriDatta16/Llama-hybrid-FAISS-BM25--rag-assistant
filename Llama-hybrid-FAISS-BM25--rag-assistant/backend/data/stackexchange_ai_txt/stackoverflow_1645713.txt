revoked client certificate

I have little problem. I used certificate authority in windows server 2003 and revoked client certificate. The client certificate is in revoked certificate . I try verify this client certificate on revocation in winform app in windows server 2003. Code is here : private bool VefiryCert(X509Certificate2 cert) { X509Chain chain = new X509Chain(); chain.ChainPolicy.RevocationFlag = X509RevocationFlag.EntireChain; chain.ChainPolicy.RevocationMode = X509RevocationMode.Online; chain.ChainPolicy.UrlRetrievalTimeout = new TimeSpan(0, 0, 1000); chain.ChainPolicy.VerificationFlags = X509VerificationFlags.AllFlags; X509VerificationFlags.AllowUnknownCertificateAuthority; return chain.Build(cert); } But this client certificate is verify as true . I am confuse, where can be problem ? How can I check revocation list, which is loaded in winform application and used on verification this client certificate? So the problem is I verify client certificate, which is in revoked list (in certification authority) with method VefiryCert, an the certificate is verify as TRUE. Can somebody help me ?
