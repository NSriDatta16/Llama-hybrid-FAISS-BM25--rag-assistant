What does this gated recurrent unit notation mean?

I'm trying to replicate the algorithm found in this paper: http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.07285 . And I'm struggling to understand the notation of equation 3 on page 4, which is given as: Is z(c,m,q) a matrix of the individual vectors? That wouldn't make sense, though, because the last two elements look like they would be scalars. I've read the paper and it doesn't say much about this equation. Perhaps they aren't revealing the full function and are only listing used parameters? Any ideas? The equation is used for gating in a recurrent neural network. Edit: I understand what the individual parameters mean, but I don't understand how to define z(c,m,q), which I will need to know before I can implement equation 4.
