Would it be possible to optimize this from the other side? If so, just let the logging application always log the line to a file while truncating it (i.e. > instead of >>) Some optimization might be achieved by "guessing" though, just open the file and with the average log line width you could guess where the last line would be. Jump to that position with fseek and find the last line.
