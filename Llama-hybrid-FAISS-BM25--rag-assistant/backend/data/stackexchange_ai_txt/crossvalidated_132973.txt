Here is my afterward thoughts. I think it's because ML is largely deal with classification, and classification is no need for transforming y (y is categorical). ML usually deal with large independent variables (e.g. thousands in NLP ) and logistic regression doesn't require normality; I think that's why they don't use Box-Cox power transformation due to speed consideration. (note: I'm not familiar to power transformation.)
