How to estimate standard deviation from the smallest and biggest in a batch or batches?

I have one or more batches. For each batch I know the size of the biggest item in the batch, and I also know the size of the smallest item in the batch. What would be the best way to estimate the standard deviation of the sizes of the items? The two variations on this are: a) where I know the size of each batch (which differs from batch to batch) and b) where I do not know the size of any of the batches. I assume or guess that the best estimate of the mean would be the mean-average of all the figures.
