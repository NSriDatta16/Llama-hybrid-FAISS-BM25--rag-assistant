Business Audit log - recommended library or approach?

do you know any good Java library for audit logging? Or at least good book/article to help choose good approach to build audit log for an application? Library requirements: - define common audit metadata (userId, time, IP, ...) - define audit message types (transaction sent, message received, ...) - lock/sign individual audit messages (for non-repudiation) - search audit log based on metadata - etc. Edit: I'm not looking for automated solution, I'm perfectly happy with calling something like: AuditEvent event = new TransactionSentEvent(userId, account, amount, ...) AuditLog.audit(auditEvent); The point is to have the infrastructure behind it - safe storage to database, non-reputability etc.
