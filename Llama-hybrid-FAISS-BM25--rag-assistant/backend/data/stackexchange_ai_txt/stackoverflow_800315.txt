Which status field do you mean? Do you mean when replying to a meeting request or when sending information about a meeting? Either way, the answer is in the vCalendar standard document. I think you mean the STATUS field. Wikipedia has an example of this field as: BEGIN:VCALENDAR VERSION:1.0 BEGIN:VEVENT CATEGORIES:MEETING STATUS:TENTATIVE DTSTART:19960401T033000Z DTEND:19960401T043000Z SUMMARY:Your Proposal Review DESCRIPTION:Steve and John to review newest proposal material CLASS:PRIVATE END:VEVENT END:VCALENDAR http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VCalendar#vCalendar_1.0 The standards document for the format is: http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2445.txt You might also try creating an event in outlook, saving it as a vCard, and then opening the vCard in notepad. This will show you how outlook saves the information. The documentation leads me to believe that you can only set a Busy or Tentative status: 4.8.1.11 Status Property Name: STATUS Purpose: This property defines the overall status or confirmation for the calendar component. Value Type: TEXT Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be specified on this property. Conformance: This property can be specified in "VEVENT", "VTODO" or "VJOURNAL" calendar components. Description: In a group scheduled calendar component, the property is used by the "Organizer" to provide a confirmation of the event to the "Attendees". For example in a "VEVENT" calendar component, the "Organizer" can indicate that a meeting is tentative, confirmed or cancelled. In a "VTODO" calendar component, the "Organizer" can indicate that an action item needs action, is completed, is in process or being worked on, or has been cancelled. In a "VJOURNAL" calendar component, the "Organizer" can indicate that a journal entry is draft, final or has been cancelled or removed. Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation: status = "STATUS" statparam] ":" statvalue CRLF statparam = *(";" xparam) statvalue = "TENTATIVE" ;Indicates event is ;tentative. / "CONFIRMED" ;Indicates event is ;definite. / "CANCELLED" ;Indicates event was ;cancelled. ;Status values for a "VEVENT"
