Assuming you have to do this in Python and that you have a large enough file that list slicing isn't sufficient, you can do it in a single pass over the file: last_line = None for line in file: if last_line: print last_line # or write to a file, call a function, etc. last_line = line Not the most elegant code in the world but it gets the job done. Basically it buffers each line in a file through the last_line variable, each iteration outputs the previous iterations line.
