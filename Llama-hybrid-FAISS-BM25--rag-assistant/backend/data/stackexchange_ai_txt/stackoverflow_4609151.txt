How can I stop a specific agent in Clojure? When are their states garbage-collected?

If an agent is working through its queue in the background in Clojure, how can I stop it without stopping all agents? When I am finished with an agent and I let it fall out of scope AND it finishes working on its queue, is it garbage collected along with its final state?
