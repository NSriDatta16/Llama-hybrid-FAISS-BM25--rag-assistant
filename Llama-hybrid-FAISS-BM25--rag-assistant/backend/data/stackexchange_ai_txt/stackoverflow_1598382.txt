Sharing hardware resources with WCF service clients

So I am embarking on creating a desktop WCF service that, at its core, access hardware attached to a serial port. Obviously there is only one port, and several entities that are derived from that hardware (nodes in a Zigbee network if you care) need to be shared with all service clients equally. A quick look at Chapeter 8 of Juval Lowy's "Programming WCF Services" seems that he recommends putting the shared resource into a static class, but static classes raise my hackles immediately as a bad code smell. Is there some more "elegant" way to share these resources, or is a static class truly the accepted best practice here?
