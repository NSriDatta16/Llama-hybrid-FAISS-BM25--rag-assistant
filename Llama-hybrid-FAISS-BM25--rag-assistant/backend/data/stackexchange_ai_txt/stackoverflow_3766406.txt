One way of preserving state data within a page is with fragment identifiers on the url, eg. #filter1, #filter2, and then using the handy hashchange plugin for jQuery to execute code (i.e., reload the relevant part of the page with fresh results) when the url fragment changes via the onhashchange event. It's also nice because the different states can be bookmarked and cached. http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-hashchange-plugin/
