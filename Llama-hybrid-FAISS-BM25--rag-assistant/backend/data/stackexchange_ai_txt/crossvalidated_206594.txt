I think that you deliberately paint a pessimistic view of science produced by statistics. Indeed, in my opinion, statistics is not just a set of tools providing p values. There is also a state of rigour, care and alertness about some possible effects involved in the procedure of scientific induction... and while to my mind, everything you state is roughly true, here are some of my opinions on why we have some guarantees about the knowledge we produce: First in general, a conclusion should not be reached only under the argument of a p value lower than a given threshold. Second, to my knowledge arguments of the kind of "over half of published scientific results are wrong" are relevant and interesting but are computed on the basis of p values approximately equal to 0.05 (see e.g. Confusion regarding p-values and false discovery rate ). For lower p values the effect is much lower than the announced one and in practice, it is not rare to obtain p values much lower than 0.05. Moreover, many times a given hypothesis is confirmed by several sub-hypotheses which again reduces the announced effects. Third, the question of reproducibility is genuine but is also a problem that must be dealt by the statistician by identifying and dealing with confounding effects, group designs ... and this can be done very well if it is done with expertise and rigour. Finally, as I understand it, an archetypal statistical study must more or less stand on the following 5 successive steps: Formulate one or a few hypotheses Design the corresponding study Acquire the data Analyse the data Make conclusions about the above hypotheses (and only these ones) This general guideline prevents us from fishing expeditions as a tool to produce general conclusions. To conclude, I would say that your intent to protect us against bad scientific conclusions by over-thresholding p-values is a bit illusory. I would prefer protecting us against bad scientific conclusions by ensuring and encouraging warned and proper analyses (and I would like to think that this is a reason why so much qualified persons are here to help others on this site).
