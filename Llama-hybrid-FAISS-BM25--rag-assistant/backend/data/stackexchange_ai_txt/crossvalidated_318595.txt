Your formula is correct, at least according to what is taught in most classical textbooks. One catch, however, is contained in your phrase "assuming the normal distribution" --- this approximation may be quite poor even for relatively large sample sizes: Interval Estimation for a Binomial Proportion (Brown, Cai, DasGupta, 2001) Fortunately (see the cited paper) there are simple adjustments that make the confidence intervals have a coverage probability closer to what you specify (in your case 95 per cent). I do not fully comprehend your last sentence with the "X", but it lets me suspect that the following explanation may be useful to you: the confidence interval changes from sample to sample, while the unknown true proportion is fixed. Thus the correct reading is something like "the [random] confidence interval covers the true proportion about 95 per cent of the time in when sampling repeatedly". In any case, the test outcomes ought to be at least approximately independent for the normal approximation to work.
