Train NN or SVM to classify stock signals

I am applying Neural network and SVM to predict buy-hold - sell signals. I have trained nn and SVM in R. I used nnet function to train NN and svm to train SVM. I provided 20,000 data points to train and 2000 data points to test. training data set contain list of 10-15 technical indciators and buy-sell-hold signals. The problem I am having is it is not predicting the buy -sell - hold signals with good accuracy on the testing data. I have used sigmoid function in nnet and radial function in SVM. Any suggestion, how to improve the accuracy of the prediction?
