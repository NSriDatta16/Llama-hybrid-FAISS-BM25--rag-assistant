There is no such thing as a TCP fragment. The IP protocol has fragments. TCP is a stream protocol. You can assemble the stream to its intended order by following the sequence numbers of both sides. Every TCP Packet goes to the IP level and can be fragmented there. You can assemble each packet by collecting all of the fragments and following the fragment offset from the header. All of the information you need is in the headers. The wikipedia articles are quite useful in explaining what each field is http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_header#Packet_structure http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4#Header
