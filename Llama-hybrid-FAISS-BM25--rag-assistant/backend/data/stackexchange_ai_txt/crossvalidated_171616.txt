As it was already mentioned, this is called thinning, however, as Kruschke noticed it is "rarely useful" and quoting Link and Eaton (2012), he writes that ... basic conclusion of the article is that thinning of chains is not usually appropriate when the goal is precision of estimates from an MCMC sample. (Thinning can be useful for other reasons, such as memory or time constraints in post-chain processing, but those are very different motivations than precision of estimation of the posterior distribution.) The paper published in Methods in Ecology and Evolution is freely avilable from the publisher . So it is disputable if thinning is that much helpful, i.e. the inner loop may not be that important in the code and in many cases can be simply omitted with saving the whole simulation output.
