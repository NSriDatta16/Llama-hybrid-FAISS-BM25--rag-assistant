running junits and cobertura with maven

In our project, we run both junits and cobertura using maven. The problem I am facing is that, junit test cases are running twice, once before the jar creation process and then once again for generating cobertura coverage reports. When running cobertura and junits with ant, we run junits only once since, cobertura runs along with junits. Is there a way to configure the above case with maven. I know we can use "maven.test.skip" property to skip junits. But when I do this, I am not able to see junit xml & html file reports. Also, in maven how to configure junits to run in batch or parallel ? thank you!
