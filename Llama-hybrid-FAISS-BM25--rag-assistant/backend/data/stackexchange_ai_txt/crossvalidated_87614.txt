Insignificant slope with statistically significant r value

I collected data of 60 countries to identify whether there is a relationship between average income per person and average life expectancy. However, I am having some trouble interpreting my lin-reg and r value. y = 0.000437x + 67.68 r = 0.814 Does this inconsistency have to do with the nature of my data? Considering that that the data for income is in the 10-30 thousands, while the data for life expectancy is all below 100, would that influence the reliability of the persons r correlation test? If so, how? Also, I have checked and double checked both calculations a number of times, on the calculator, manually, on excel and through an online calculator and I still get the same answers. If someone could help me interpret this, that would be very helpful.
