Question about retraining a regression model

Exercise. Suppose you train a Ridge model to a regression problem that has a normalized perfomance measure (say K) that attains a value in the interval [0,1], where 0 means that the model is terrible and 1 means that the model is perfect. Suppose that you evaluate the trained model and obtain in the training set K = 0.22 and in the test set K = 0.21. Which of the following options should you apply? $ (a) $ Train the model again decreasing the value of the regularization coefficient, $\lambda$ ; $ (b) $ There isn't need to do anything. The model obtained is satisfatory ; $ (c) $ Train the model again increasing the value of the regularization coefficient, $\lambda$ . My attempt. According to the values of $K$ , our adjust to the data is clearly not satisfatory, in the sense that the values for $K$ are pretty small. Since, for higher values of $\lambda$ , we know that the adjust to data is worse and the complexity of the model is more important, if we want to obtain better values for $K$ , we should train our model again, with a smaller value for our regularization coefficient, $\lambda$ , to give us better results for $K$ . Therefore, I would choose option $(a)$ . What ChatGPT says. Given that the performance measure K is normalized and attains a value between 0 and 1, we can conclude that the model's performance is not terrible but not perfect either. The difference in the performance measure between the training and test sets is also not significant. Therefore, there is no need to retrain the model with a different value of lambda. Option (b) is the correct choice: there is no need to do anything, and the model obtained is satisfactory. My question. I agree that the difference between training and test sets is not significant but I am not so sure about the perfomance measure is good at all. Is ChatGPT wrong here? Thanks for any help in advance.
