Joint density and univariate time series models

Is the picture below an example of univariate time series model since I am observing the same random variable just at different time points? Can joint density be used to explain univariate time series models since we use the same term joint density for models where the same random variable is just observed at different time points or do we need observations of multiple variables (X, Y) over different time points?
