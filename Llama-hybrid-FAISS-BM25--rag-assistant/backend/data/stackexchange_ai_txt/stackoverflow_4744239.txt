NSWindow resize control covered by NSView

I have an NSView subclass sized to fit a regular NSWindow window (right to the edges). The view draws a background color, and when the app runs, it covers up the standard window resize control in the bottom right hand corner. You can still resize the window by dragging the corner. If I resize my view so it doesn't quite go to the edge of the window, it's clear that the resize control is being drawn, but being overlapped by my view. Anyone know of a way to fix this? Will I have to draw the resize control myself? Here's a screenshot showing what I mean.
