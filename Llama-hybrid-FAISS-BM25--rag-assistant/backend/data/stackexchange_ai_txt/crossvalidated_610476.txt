From my experience, finding ARIMA (p) and (q) parameters from the ACF/PACF plots yields better results than auto.arima, measured as lower RSME and/or lower MAPE errors. Note that ARIMA is a statistical model, and the output of the auto-correlation plots relate directly to the auto-regression (AR) and moving average (MA) parts of the model. I acknowledge that it's not very practical though, especially when one needs to develop several ARIMA models at once (eg. to predict sales of several products, etc). This is where auto.arima comes in handy, as it automatically finds a decent set of parameters. It's not always the best parameters (ie. not necessarily the lowest forecast error metrics), but typically decent parameters yielding not so different error metrics as compared to manual search. These automatic processes for picking the best model are based on some Information Criterion, such as AIC or BIC, which increasingly penalizes the inclusion of more parameters in the model. So these methods tend to find a balance between a good performance and a simple model - is to say, they find the best performance with a simpler model. They do so as typically the inclusion of more parameters tends to yield lower error metrics, even though the model may be running into overfitting - it is thus a way to avoid overfitting. In conclusion: If I am developing 1 (or very few) models, I'll search parameters manually through ACF/PACF for the best performance. If I am developing several ARIMA models, I'll conduct the search automatically by auto.arima for the sake of practicality, without fearing a major loss in performance.
