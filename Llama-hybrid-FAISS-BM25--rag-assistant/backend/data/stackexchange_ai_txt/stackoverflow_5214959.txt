Serializing html and css, and storing in mysql

I am in the process of developing an html template generator. I would like to store the templates in a mysql database (or text files if that would be more efficient). I am looking for the best way to serialize the html and css, and then reproduce the original efficiently. Javascript and php will be used to create/edit/and remove elements from both the browser and the database for later reproduction. Elements can be added such as div, p, a, etc. and nesting should not be an issue. The main problem I am having is if a div is nested within a div and a paragraph element is nested within the second div at a later time, how would all of this be stored in a database? Elements will be deleted and new elements will be added in random order. I hope this was somewhat clear. I am not really looking for code, but suggestions on how all of this would work together. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance
