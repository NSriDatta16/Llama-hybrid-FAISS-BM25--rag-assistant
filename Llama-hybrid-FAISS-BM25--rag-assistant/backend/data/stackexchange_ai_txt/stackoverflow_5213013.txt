How to add items to a JComboBox from an External File?

Please i need some help in adding items to a JComboBox in Java from an external file. Here is my code so far: //Loading the Names: File Names_File = new File("Data" + File.separator + "Names.txt"); FileInputStream fis = null; BufferedInputStream bis = null; DataInputStream dis = null; String str_Data = ""; //For storing the input from the file. try { fis = new FileInputStream(Names_File); // Here BufferedInputStream is added for fast reading. bis = new BufferedInputStream(fis); dis = new DataInputStream(bis); str_Data = dis.readLine(); //Reading the line from the file. StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(str_Data); //Tokenizing the line. //The below line adds only one item. The objective is adding all the items. //*** Requesting help here *** cmb_Name.addItem(st.nextToken("|")); //*** Requesting help here *** // Disposing and closing all the resources after using them. fis.close(); bis.close(); dis.close(); } catch (FileNotFoundException e) { System.err.println("Error: File not found!"); JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, "Error: File not found!", "Error Message", JOptionPane.ERROR_MESSAGE); } catch (IOException e) { System.err.println("Error: Unable to read from file!"); JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, "Error: Unable to read from file!", "Error Message", JOptionPane.ERROR_MESSAGE); } Mainly the format of my external file is as follows: James|Robert|Alice The names are separated by the "|" symbols. My above code is adding only one element namely ("James") in this example. I need to add all three maybe in a loop or something. The idea is that i don't know for sure how many names will be in my external file. Thus using simple counters will not help. Any suggestions are greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance for your help
