Pearson Coefficient This is not a good way to know if the factor is really influencing the response variable. As an extreme example, the following patters all have correlation of -0.06, but do not explain the influencing factor. ANOVA - F-test or T-test The anova model is only valid for LINEAR regression as SSE + SSR = SST, but its not equal for non linear regression. Also we do not have P-values for non linear regression. WHY? Correct null hypothesis value for each parameter depends on the expectation function, the parameter's place in it, and the field of study. Because the expectation functions can be so wildly different, itâ€™s impossible to create a single hypothesis test that works for all nonlinear models. But confidence interval for each parameter estimate. Use your knowledge of the subject area and expectation function to determine if this range is reasonable and if it indicates a significant effect. Least Square + L2 Norm (a.k.a LASSO or Ridge Regression) It is very widely used constraint with the least square The L2 Norm makes the parameter estimate of less relevant predictors close to zero. Can be used in linear and non linear way. Random Forest (RF) For Categorical predictors, the gini index of random forest are a good way to select categorical features. RF can also model non linear boundaries.
