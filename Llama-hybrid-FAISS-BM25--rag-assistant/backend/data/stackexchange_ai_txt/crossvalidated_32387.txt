As far as I understand from looking at section 2, the authors seem to explain their rationale for the bootstrap test as follows- "the $x_i$ were sampled from $x$, and so their average $\delta(x_i)$ won’t be zero like the null hypothesis demands; the average will instead be around $\delta(x)$... The solution is a re-centering of the mean – we want to know how often $A$ does more than $\delta(x)$ better than expected. We expect it to beat $B$ by $\delta(x)$. Therefore, we count up how many of the $x_i$ have $A$ beating $B$ by at least $\delta(x)$." The authors want to test if the gain is non-zero so they write the p-value as $\delta(x_i)
