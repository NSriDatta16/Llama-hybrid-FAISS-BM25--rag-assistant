XML parser: implementation design

I've always assumed XML documents are a convenient way to store information. Now I've found in XML a good way to "instruct" my application. Delicous. My problem is integrate the XML parsing in application classes. I'm using C# System.Xml interface, I think it's good and portable (right?). Is there any standard interface which defines methods to organize recursion on xml tags, or methods to implement common xml implementations (maybe in a base class)? Initially I can think to write an interface which defines void Read(XmlReader xml); void Write(XmlREader xml); What what about nested tags, common tags and so on... P.S.: I don't think to implement this using LINQ, except in the case it's supported also in Mono (how to determine this)? Thank you very much! :)
