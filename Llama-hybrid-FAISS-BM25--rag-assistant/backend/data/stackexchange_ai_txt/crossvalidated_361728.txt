There are a few options. I'll describe each and then give you some key words to look for in searching for more about them. You could run a logistic regression, predicting speeding from whether or not the person was in an SUV. However, since your observations are not independent (i.e., some came from the same people), your standard errors are going to be biased. A way to address this is to fit a logistic regression and then adjust the standard errors using what are called "sandwich estimators" (they are called that because the matrix notation looks like a sandwich). These can also be called "robust standard errors" and are often used when referring to clustered or panel data. You could fit a generalized estimating equation (GEE) with a logistic link function. This is similar to the first option, but you are using a different method of estimation and you specify how you think the errors are correlated with one another (in practice, this choice seems to not matter a whole lot, but is still necessary to make beforehand). You could fit a multilevel model/mixed effects model with a logistic link function. This is similar to the two above, except now you are modeling variances a little differently. Instead of just treating the dependencies as noise, you can model these variances (such as random intercepts or slopes). You would not be able to model the random effect/variance around the effect of SUV or not if you only had two observations per person, though, because that model isn't identified (i.e., you don't have enough observations for each person in both conditions to model variance in the effect of condition). Since you are mainly interested in the effect of condition and not other aspects, then this might not be the best fit for youâ€”but it is a popular option. You can calculate confidence intervals for any of the above options. (Note that I kept referring to logistic regression because it's the canonical link function, but there are other options you might see out there, such as a probit link function). To get background on logistic regression in general, look into "generalized linear models." Searching for "robust standard errors" or "sandwich estimators" will get you more information on #1. Searching for "generalized estimating equations" or "GEE" will get you more information for #2. And people refer the #3 as multilevel models/mixed effects models/hierarchical models interchangeably. You'd want to look for information on models that are generalized mixed effects models, etc., because you are looking for generalizing it to dichotomous outcomes. If you are an R user, #1 is sandwich package, #2 is gee or geepack packages, and #3 is lme4 or nlme packages.
