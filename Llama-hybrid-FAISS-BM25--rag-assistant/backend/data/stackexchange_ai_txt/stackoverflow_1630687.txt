It looks from your code like you're using a static hashmap, not static classes, so you're sharing the map between all users. There are a few problems I see with this- Your map is not thread safe, which could be an issue with conflicts between object creation and retrieval. Given the potential sharing/threading issues, where else are you putting objects into the map? Your ControllerAbstract objects have state, and you can run into a situation where multiple requests will be using the same controller. For example, will any requests add to the children hashmap in their own ControllerAbstract objects? You could have multiple requests using the same ControllerAbstract - e.g. if request 1 wants to add or delete to it's ControllerAbstract.children map while request 2 referencing the same object decides it needs to iterate through the children you'll get a ConcurrentModificationException. Servlet construction is managed by the container. If you're going to have to hardcode the url to have it exist in the servlet's constructor, is it just a constant string? If so, wouldn't it be easier to just declare it as a constant in the ControllerAbstract object? If not, where's it coming from? In any case what your doing is altering the map of controllers whenever the container decides it needs to create a new servlet.
