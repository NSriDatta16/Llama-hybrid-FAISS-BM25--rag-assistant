You have done a great job modifying header files and stuff, but as a windows user I miss a classical - build your dll and forget it. It seems really weird that this application does not seem to have a simple dll that php extension and everything else can link to. I need to write my own kwd producer, so i will link against all the source files (i heard there are lib files somewhere, but building example indexer with VS7 i didn't seem to find a way to make them, yet). On the plus side, to my disbelief I was able to compile simpleindexer example after following your last paragraph in read-me file. and still - a nice VC6 project file wouldn't hurt.! :)
