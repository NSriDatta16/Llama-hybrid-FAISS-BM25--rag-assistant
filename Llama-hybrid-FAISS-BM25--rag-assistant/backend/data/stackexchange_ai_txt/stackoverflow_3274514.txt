The best place to start is the OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project). They have lots of resources, including the OWASP Top Ten, including the 10 most critical vulnerabilities/risks for web applications and their Secure Code Development Guide that can be read online (wiki) or downloaded in PDF. They also have the Web Goat, a vulnerable web application that people can download and play with to learn about vulnerabilities, how they work and the best approach to correct them. It's pretty interesting and it comes with tips and solutions. They also organize conferences (check the video session of the web site, they usually publish the videos and slides of the talks) and the chapters in different cities organize meetings where people talk about interesting aspects of web app security. You should consider joining one in your area. You can all the information in the OWASP web site: http://www.owasp.org
