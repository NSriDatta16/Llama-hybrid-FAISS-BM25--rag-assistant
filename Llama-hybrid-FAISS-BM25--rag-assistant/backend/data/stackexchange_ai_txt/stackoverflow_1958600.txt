Here is one example that I can think of. At my organization my division is responsible for both the intranet and internet site. Because we are using two different servers and in our case two different subdomains then I could see a case for having a single library that is used by both servers. This would allow both servers to use the same class. This wouldn't be a security problem because you have complete control over both servers and would be better than trying to maintain two versions of the same class. Since you have control over the servers, and because having an external facing server and internal server requires seperation (because of the firewall) then, this would be a better solution than trying to keep a copy of the same class in two locations.
