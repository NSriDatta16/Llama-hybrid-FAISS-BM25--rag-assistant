Survival Analysis when Independent Variable Proportions Shift Heavily Over Time

I am attempting to conduct survival analysis on hiring processes with Kaplan-Meier, where the event is termination from the organization: testing a few independent variables known at an employee’s hiring against how long they stay. However, unlike most clinic studies, the proportions of these independent variables seen in the data can be heavily related to time – for example, if Talent Pipeline were an independent variable under consideration, and the organization used to use Talent Pipeline A most of the time, shifted towards Pipeline B, and used Pipeline B nearly always by the end of the time period under consideration. I would expect this to result in secular trends that I need to account for. Many papers discuss various other considerations that can arise, but I am not seeing much on this issue. Any tips on how best to account for it, and/or links to more information on the subject? Thanks so much! (Note: These aren't time-varying covariates, just the proportions of the categories of the independent variables seen in the data shift heavily over time.)
