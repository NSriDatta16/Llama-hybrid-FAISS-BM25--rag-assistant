Logistic regression with interaction in R, what to test for final conclusion?

I think I have a pretty basic question, but I am not sure what the right thing to do is. Performing logistic regression confirms the obvious interaction seen in the raw data (see below). How should I follow up on this for a final report? Can you look at the data and decide to only do one test for gt on div14, and one test for gt on div35 because that is where the obvious change is? Or is "blindly" testing gt for each level of div the proper thing to do? Why not test for div, on each level of gt? Experimentally, that is also interesting but it would come down to pretty much the same conclusion...
