There is a same question and helpful answer here . I think there're different ways to do this, for example 1) concatenate the two embeddings and apply PCA after that 2) normalize each embedding and concatenate them together, so that each model will contribute equally to the final results 3) normalize each feature of each embedding to (0,1) say by Gaussian CDFs and concatenate them together, so that each feature contribute equally to the results.
