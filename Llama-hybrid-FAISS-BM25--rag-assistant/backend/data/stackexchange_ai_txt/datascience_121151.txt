The kernel or filter is just a matrix of values that you slide over the entire image and the values from sliding that kernel/filter are used to find an error rate and learn to detect features The output features in a CNN are calculated by different kernels with different weights. In a convolutional layer, the weights are represented as the multiplicative factors of the filters or kernels. Each kernel is a matrix of weights that is convolved with the input image or feature map to produce the output feature map. The number of kernels in a convolutional layer determines the number of output feature maps. During the training process, the weights of the kernels are adjusted using backpropagation to minimize the loss between the predicted output and the actual. This allows the CNN to learn more effective feature representations for the given task. The kernels' initial values are often sampled from a distribution, such as normal or uniform distribution, or they can be initialized from the weights of another network (transfer learning). As the input image or feature map passes through multiple convolutional layers, each layer's kernels capture different patterns and features, resulting in a hierarchy of feature representations. The final output features are calculated by applying different kernels with their learned weights to the input, effectively extracting meaningful features that can be used for the specific task the CNN is designed to perform. https://medium.com/codex/kernels-filters-in-convolutional-neural-network-cnn-lets-talk-about-them-ee4e94f3319
