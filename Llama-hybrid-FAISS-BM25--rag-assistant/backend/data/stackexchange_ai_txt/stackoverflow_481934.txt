Introduction to Computer Hardware and Organization: Resources?

I'm looking for a laymen's introduction to computer hardware and organization. Here are some of the topics I would like to cover. Brief intro to electronics. Gates and state machines, intro to register transfer and timing. Basic CPU design. Control. Microprogrammed CPU design. Cache systems. Memory hierarchy:registers, cache, RAM Virtual memory organization. Disk storage systems. Internal busses-front side, memory, PCI Internal busses for storage-IDE, SATA, SCSI External busses-USB and firewire Display systems and GPUs I would prefer free resources online, but if nothing is available a book is fine as well. I have no background with hardware so an introductory text would be wonderful. Also I'm sorry if this isn't directly programming but I don't know where else to ask.
