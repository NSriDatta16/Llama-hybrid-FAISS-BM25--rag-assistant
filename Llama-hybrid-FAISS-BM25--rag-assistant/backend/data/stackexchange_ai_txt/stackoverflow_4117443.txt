Can I optimize my database by splitting one big table into many small ones?

Assume that I have one big table with three columns: "user_name", "user_property", "value_of_property". Lat's also assume that I have a lot of user (let say 100 000) and a lot of properties (let say 10 000). Then the table is going to be huge (1 billion rows). When I extract information from the table I always need information about a particular user. So, I use, for example where user_name='Albert Gates' . So, every time the mysql server needs to analyze 1 billion lines to find those of them which contain "Albert Gates" as user_name. Would it not be wise to split the big table into many small ones corresponding to fixed users?
