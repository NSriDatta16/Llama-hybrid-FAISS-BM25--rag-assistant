Always store in UTC time - you'll save yourself a load of trouble later on. Store in UTC and convert to whatever local time you need, including daylight saving time, at the time you need it for your calculation. Also, if the time doesn't need to be human readable in storage, you could store it in Ticks to be least error-prone: string ticks = DateTimeOffset.UtcNow.Ticks.ToString(); DateTimeOffset stampUtc = new DateTimeOffset(long.Parse(ticks), TimeSpan.Zero); DateTimeOffset stampLocal = stampUtc.ToLocalTime();
