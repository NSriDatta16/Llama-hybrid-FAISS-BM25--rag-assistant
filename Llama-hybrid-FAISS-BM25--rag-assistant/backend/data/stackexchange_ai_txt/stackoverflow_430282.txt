A Captive Portal to Handle My Needs

I am looking into captive portals for my organization. I see a lot of them out there that will allow a user to pass once they a.)enter credentials or b.)pay money. What I'm looking for is a bit different. Let me go into some basics about my system, I am running a windows based network using active directory and an internal DNS. I have an intranet in which our employees use daily and it uses the person's Windows credentials to authenticate them on the system. The employees have to enter time daily, and if they don't then I would like to have a captive portal redirect them to their time entry page and not let them out into the vast internet world until their time is entered. I am a developer so I can write a script that returns a True or False to the system, but what I need is a system that can interact with AD logons and that can run this script once a user requests access outside out network. EDIT: I accepted an answer as the answer to my question, however, after looking into the coding for the sockets based method I do not have the time. as a workaround, I have found that my firewall has a customizable disclaimer page that allows javascript. I will query a webservice to see if time is entered then trigger the disclaimer page's "Allow" function, otherwise i will redirect to the time entry page. seems like a simple enough solution, the only issue is if the person keeps their browser session open overnight.
