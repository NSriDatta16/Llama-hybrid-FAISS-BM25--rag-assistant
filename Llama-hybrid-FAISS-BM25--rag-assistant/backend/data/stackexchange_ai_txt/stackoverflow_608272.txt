You likely want to do this. client certs are really intended for a second factor of authentication, but not the primary source. To say it differently, you still need to configure your app for basic or forms authentication. The technology behind public/private keys is rock solid. However, you need a very mature IT organization who is dealing with certificate lifecycle management. If you do not have this, you will get untold failure scenarios because the certificate was expired, wasn't copied to the new computer, etc. This is especially true in your scenario where your application is internet facing (in thee 'hosted' scenario) - you have little control about the issuance of the certificates to your users.
