Temporary Table Usage in SQL Server

This is a bit of an open question but I would really like to hear people opinions. I rarely make use of explicitly declared temporary tables (either table variables or regular #tmp tables) as I believe not doing so leads to more concise, readable and debuggable T-SQL. I also think that SQL can do a better job than I of making use of temporary storage when it's required (such as when you use a derived table in a query). The only exception is when the database is not a typical relational database but a star or snowflake schema. I understand that it's best to apply filters to the fact table first and then use the resultant temp table to get the values from your dimensions. Is this the common opinion or does anyone have an opposing view?
