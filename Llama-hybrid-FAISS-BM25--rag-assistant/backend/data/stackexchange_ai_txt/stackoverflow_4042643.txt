can i somehow split a larger byte[] into several momoryStreams and reassemble those to a single file? Yes. When I had to deal with a similar situation I built my own stream that internally used byte arrays of 4mb. This "paging" means it never has to allocate ONE LARGE BYTE ARRAY, which is what memory stream does. So, dump memory stream, build your own stream based on another internal storage mechanism.
