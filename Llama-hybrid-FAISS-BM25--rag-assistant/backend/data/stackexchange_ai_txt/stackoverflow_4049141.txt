There are two issues here: You are trying to use an instance property as though it were a static property. The syntax you are employing to invoke a property-setter is not correct. Make sure you have a reference to an instance of TestControl . For example, you can use the WPF designer to drag an icon representing the control from the toolbox onto the main-window, and then change the body of the handler to: testControl1.sampleText = "Sup"; In this case, testControl1 is a field, which references an instance of your control.
