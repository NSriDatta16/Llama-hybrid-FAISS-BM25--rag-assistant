SVM and Linear models disadvantage

I was reading about SVM and linear models, I found that one of the disadvantage is SVM and Linear models do not perform well when the number of rows (instance) less than the number of columns (features)? I was reading several days about the SVM to understand why but I could not. Kindly would anyone explain why they "number of rows less than the number of features" is disadvantages? Thanks in advance
