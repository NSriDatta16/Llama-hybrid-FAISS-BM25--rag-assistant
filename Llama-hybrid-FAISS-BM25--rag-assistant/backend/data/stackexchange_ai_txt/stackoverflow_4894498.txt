The coordinates returned by MouseEvent::getX() and MouseEvent::getY() represent the location of the event relative to the event's subject (i.e. relative to the label itself), which explains why your solution results in the label erratically jumping. By using MouseEvent::getComponent() to grab the label and then querying its position (possibly relative to the position when dragging commenced), you can devise a working solution.
