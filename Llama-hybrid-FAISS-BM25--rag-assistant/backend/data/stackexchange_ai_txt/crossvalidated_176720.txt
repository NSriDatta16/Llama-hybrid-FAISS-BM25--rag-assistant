Estimate the tuning parameter in Ridge logistic regression

I need to know how can we estimate the tuning parameter in penalized likelihood? I write my own code but there is a mistake I could not find it.!! Could you please help, I do my best to make the code clear.. Given the likelihood that $l(\beta)= \sum_i y_i log (\pi_i)+(1-y_i)log (1-\pi) -1/2 \lambda \sum_j {\beta_j}^2$ where $\pi_i= logit^{-1} (x\beta$) and $y_i$ belong to (0,1) I need to chose the lambda using cross validation ; my question is that I need to include the Code B inside Code A. then I can run the code. is the code correct or no. Is there any way to make it faster.\ Code A : The Cross Validation to choose $\lambda$ PE=c() lambda=c(0.005,0.001,0.1,0.5,0.2) for(j in 1:length(lambda)){ print(lambda[j]) tem.PE=c() for(i in 1:2014){ cv.y=y[-i] cv.x=x[-i,] tem.lambda=lambda[j] ## I need to put the function /WNRfit/ here to calculate the Coefficients -Betas- f.hat=fit$fitted # print(f.hat) tem.PE[i]=mean(cv.y-f.hat) rm(cv.y,cv.x,fit,f.hat,tem.lambda) } PE[j]=mean(tem.PE) rm(tem.PE) } Code B : The Newton raphson for estimate beta $\hat{\beta}$ WNRfit
