Multiple DISQUS on the same page?

I need to insert the DISQUS system on a webpage of my website. Thats easy. The problem here is that I need to insert multiple DISQUS boxes on the same page. I need something like this . Every article and every paragraph has your own comment block. Any suggestion? Maybe I need to load the comments using some kind of API via AJAX? I'll use this on a page in my WordPress powered site.
