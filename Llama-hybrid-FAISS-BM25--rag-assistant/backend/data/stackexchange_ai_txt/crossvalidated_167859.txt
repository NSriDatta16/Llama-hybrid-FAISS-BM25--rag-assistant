Fitted values from regression on first differences

I wish to predict variable $y$, and so I am tempted to estimate $$ y_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_t+ u_t $$ Looking at a plot of $y$, the series does not seem stationary. Instead I regress like so: $$ y_t - y_{t-1} = \gamma ( x_t - x_{t-1} ) + u_t $$ Now the purpose of this time series transformation is to make the series stationary - lets assume that the series is stationary in the changes. How do then back track, and calculate the actual level predictions? Bonus points for R code.
