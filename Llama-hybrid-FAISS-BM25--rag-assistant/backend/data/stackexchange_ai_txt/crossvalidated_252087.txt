My preferred strategy is to conduct a computer-based experiment where for each of the L time series in your study: Specify the # of periods in your forecast horizon , say NF Specify the # of recent origins that you wish to consider where forecasts get launched from , say K origins Specify M different modelling options , say M=10 for example e.g. simple one-step AIC/BIC ARIMA model & parameter selection ignoring deterministic structure iterative utilization of acf/pacf to form an ARIMA model that separates signal from noise as suggested by Box and Jenkins ignoring possible deterministic structure like level shifts, local time trends , seasonal pulses , pulses ARIMA model/parameter selection like step 2 plus including possible deterministic structure like level shifts, local time trends , seasonal pulses , pulses Model/parameter selection including possible deterministic structure like level shifts, local time trends , seasonal pulses , pulses excluding ARIMA structure Same as 3 but allow parameters and error variance to change over time Same as 4 but allow parameters and error variance to change over time Simple Holt-Winters additive model Same as 7 but allow pulses to be identified and included Holt-Winters multiplicative model Same as 9 but allow pulses to be identified and included Others as needed filling out the M possible modeling approaches Now for each of the K origins and each of the M modelling options/approaches compute an out-of-sample error statistic for the NF values that were withheld . Compute an overall error measure suggesting the best approach for any individual time series from the L time series that you are examining based upon KxM iterations. Compute a Weighted MAPE to identify the best approach of the M possible approaches. If you wish (incorrectly in my opinion) to limit your selection to ARIMA just use the second option from the list of M options.
