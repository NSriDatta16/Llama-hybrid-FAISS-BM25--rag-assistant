As Robert Harvey indicated, if all you're concerned about is capturing numeric values to use in your program, you can just strip out the commas and all will be well. However, assuming this is a formatting question (that is, you're checking keystrokes and only allowing valid input, or reformatting the input to be a valid numeric value), then you could try something like this: EDIT : ^[+-]?\d{1,3}(,\d{3})*(\.\d+)?$ What this does is allow any number of sets of a comma and 3 digits, followed by zero or one set of a dot followed by one or more digits.
