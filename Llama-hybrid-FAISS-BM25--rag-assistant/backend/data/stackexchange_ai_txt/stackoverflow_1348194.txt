How to interrupt/resume a list in LaTeX?

I want to produce output something like this: 1 . List item 2 . Another list item Paragraph of comments on list items 1 and 2. 3 . Further item 4 . Final item I'm sure I've seen a nice way to interrupt and resume lists in this way (without explicitly setting some counter), but I can't reproduce it.
