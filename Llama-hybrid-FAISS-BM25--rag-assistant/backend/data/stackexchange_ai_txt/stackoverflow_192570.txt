Firefox 'Error loading script' loading Google Analytics in FF2

The project I'm working on uses a window.onerror event handler to report user problems. I've noticed a single user that just cannot seem to load the Google Analytics script. Our site doesn't see a lot of traffic so I'm not sure how widespread this is, but so far it seems to just effect one user. His user agent is: "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.17) Gecko/20080829 Firefox/2.0.0.17". The error message Firefox gives is: "Error loading script". Additional note : The site references several other javascript files. However, the analytics reference is the only one to an external domain and the only script reference at the bottom of the page, just before the closing body tag. Has anybody else run across this, or have any idea what could be the issue? Thanks!
