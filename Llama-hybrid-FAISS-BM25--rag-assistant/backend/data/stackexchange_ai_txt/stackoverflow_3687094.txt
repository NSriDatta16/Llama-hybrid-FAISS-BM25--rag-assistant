For Binary files in Perforce you can set a FileType flag that only stores 1 (or a set number ) of revisions for the file in the repository. This way you will have history of the file but your other users will only have access to the binary for the latest version of the file and also your server will only store one copy which is much more storage efficient if you dont need to store multiple copies. To make the change. Add the files you are interested in to the repository. Check out the file. Right click in P4V and select Change Filetype On the dialog pops up select +S "Server limits the number of revisions stored" at the bottom of the screen, which will restrict the number of files stored. Hope this helps.
