Yes (object in the standard are simply a region of storage -- 1.8/1) An object is a region of storage. [Note: A function is not an object, regardless of whether or not it occupies storage in the way that objects do. ] An object is created by a definition , by a new-expression _ or by the implementation when needed. And for variable (3/4) A name is a use of an identifier that denotes an entity or label . A variable is introduced by the declaration of an object. The variable's name denotes the object. For the curious, the definition is inherited from C (with modifications needed for C++). The C 90 Standard states: object : A region of data storage in the execution environment, the contents of which can represent values.
