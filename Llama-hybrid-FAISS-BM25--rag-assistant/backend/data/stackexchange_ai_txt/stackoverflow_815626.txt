To Do or Not to Do: Store Images in a Database

In the context of a web application, my old boss always said put a reference to an image in the database, not the image itself. I tend to agree that storing an url vs. the image itself in the DB is a good idea, but where I work now, we store a lot of images in the database. The only reason I can think of is perhaps it's more secure? You don't want someone having a direct link to an url? But if that is the case, you can always have the web site/server handle images, like handlers in asp.net so that a user needs to authenticate to view the image. I'm also thinking performance would be hurt by pulling out the images from the database. Any other reasons why it might be a good/not so good idea to store images in a database?
