jquery draggable

i have a div i want to drag confined in a particular container. i tried using the containment: parent option but this results in the div getting snapped to upper or lower bounds without dragging. i have overflow:hidden set, i hope that is not a problem. (i read it somewhere) pls help me out. the code: imgCanvas.appendChild(img); overlay.appendChild(imgContainer); $(document).ready(function() { $("#draggable").draggable({ containment: '#imgContainer', scroll: false }); }); the #draggable is a div that contains the img, and #draggable is appended to imgContainer. i hope this helps somehow.
