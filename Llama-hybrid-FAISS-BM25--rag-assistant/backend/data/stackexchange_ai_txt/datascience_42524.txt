This is a great question and, like most great questions, the answer is: it depends. It all depends on what you mean by "data scientist". For my own data science practice, I aim to provide an end-to-end solution starting from raw data all the way through to a deployed software solution (or API to be consumed). That means that I blur the lines between being a data engineer, statistician, modeling expert, machine learning engineer and software developer. So for me, Python is the obvious choice because there's virtually nothing I can't do with that language. Plus, Python makes a great "glue" language where I can tie separate systems/objects in a meaningful way. Can you quickly write me a public REST API in SAS that isn't going to be slow and cost me a new $20,000 license to use? Yeah, good luck with that. If you, as a "data scientist" work in an academic environment and just aim to write whitepapers, then the above may not matter to you at all and you're perfectly fine to continue in R. Another consideration is your prediction cycles. So you have a model - now what? You have to use it somehow. I've been involved in a ton of algorithm deployments and by far the easiest language to do that in is Python. Have you ever tried deploying a completed R model in a high concurrency, multi-threaded environment??? Yeah, good luck with that. But again, if you don't deploy often (or at all) that may not matter to you. The last consideration I can think of at this time would be the kind of models you work with. If I was working exclusively with "traditional" models like decisions trees and lassos, then I would absolutely be working in R/R Studio. So much easier (and fun!) to do in that language. Now, ask me to write a neural network in R and you're going to see a grown man cry ;-) But I know the Keras API backwards and forwards and I can do a ton of modeling in Python in a very short amount of time. So, it's really all up to you. I work for one of the largest corporations in the world and I'm comfortable working in any of the tools you mentioned; Python, R and SAS are all available to me and I'm kinda-sort-of-alright at this data science thing ;) But I actively choose to be in Python because I want to be a "complete" data scientist that can take on any problem that is thrown my way. That may not matter to you at all, it's all up to you.
