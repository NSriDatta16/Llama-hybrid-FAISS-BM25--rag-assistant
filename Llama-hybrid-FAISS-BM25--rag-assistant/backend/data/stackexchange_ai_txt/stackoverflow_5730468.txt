You should have pay attention to the fact that the array is sorted in ascending order . Lets assume that there are only positive numbers, or the question was not about absolute distinct. The you could count the Number by iterating trough the list, and increment the counter by one, if the actual element is different from the last. (and +1 for the first element) If you understand that, you can add the absolute distinct constraint. For example by improving the algorithm by two pointers, one starting from the begin, one from the end. Then you have also to take care that both pointers works like in parallel, so that both pointers will end at 0 or the absoulte lowest number (positive/negative) - This will complicate the whole stuff a bit, but it is possible.
