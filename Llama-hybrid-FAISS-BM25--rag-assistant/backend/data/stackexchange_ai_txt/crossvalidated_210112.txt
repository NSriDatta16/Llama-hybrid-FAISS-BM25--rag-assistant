Resampling pre - post data by shuffling pre/post

Is the following approach a valid way to use resampling to determine if observed changes in pre/post test are significant: The null hypothesis is that there is no difference between the pre and post values. In one case I have a set of 16 observations with an average difference between pre and post values of 1.8. Data shown in the 'data set 1' tab in this workbook I used the observations to create 10,000 resamples in which I kept all 16 paired observations together but randomly shuffled flip some of the pre and post values. I then calculated the average difference between pre and post for each of these shuffled flipped or not flipped observations. This gave me 10,000 estimates of the average difference between pre and post assuming there is no difference between the two. The 10,000 averages are shown in the 'd1 random' tab in the same workbook . The average difference in these 10,000 resamples is close to 0 (-0.002). A histogram of these average values looks like this: Since the 1.8 value from the actual data is way off to the right of the histogram, I conclude that there is a significant difference between the pre and post values for that test. The other two tabs in the workbook ('data set 2' and 'd2 random) show another set of samples that the same approach suggests no difference between the pre and post values. Edited Changed word sample to observation and replaced the word shuffled with the word flipped to make it clear that I was keeping the paired samples together.
