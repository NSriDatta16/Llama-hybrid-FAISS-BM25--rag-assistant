Finding the average revenue per day for multiple projects

I want to measure the value of a client based on the average project fee and average length of the project in days. We combined the two to create a Revenue/Day metric - it's inelegant but works well enough for our purposes. I want to determine the Average Revenue/Day for all projects with a specific client, but I am unsure about the best way to calculate. Say we conducted 3 projects with a client Project 1: Fee = 100,000 | Length = 100 days | Revenue/Day = 1,000 Project 2: Fee = 120,000 | Length = 90 days | Revenue/Day = 1,333 Project 3: Fee = 135,000 | Length = 75 days | Revenue/Day = 1,800 If we handle each discretely, and take the average of the revenue/day totals, it equals $1,378. However, if you take the total fees and divide by total days, you get $1,340. This to me seems like the average of averages, so I think it's incorrect. I think $1,378$ is the correct number, with the equation being something like: $$ \left(\frac{\text{fee}}{\text{day}}+\frac{\text{fee}}{\text{day}}+\frac{\text{fee}}{\text{day}}\right) / n = x $$ with $x=\text{average revenue/day}$. Is that right?
