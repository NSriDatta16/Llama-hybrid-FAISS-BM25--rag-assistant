I think your understanding is basically sound here. If you conduct the study as you describe, with only one patient taking the drug, and measure $x = 12$ , that would constitute a significant result, so the conclusion would be that the drug does work. While this is formally correct, I suppose most of us would be suspicious about this result, in particular in view of the extremely small sample size. And indeed, the conclusion may still be wrong, not only because of the obvious fact that $\alpha = 0.05$ is still more than zero, but also because the entire statistical argument here rests on some very strong assumptions, e.g. The blood level measurements are normally distributed under the null hypothesis (with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$ ). Your friend is randomly sampled from the population of all people who might take the drug. You know the exact value of $\mu$ . You know the exact value of $\sigma$ . Especially assumptions 3 and 4 are so unrealistic that they are usually not made in practice. So you usually have to estimate $\mu$ and $\sigma$ too, and the simple Z-test is no longer applicable. Regarding your penultimate paragraph, if you have done a study with 100 people, then you should of course include all of them in the calculations (except for certain pre-specified exclusion criteria). Basing the test on only one (or several) person(s) with high $x$ would be statistical malpractice ("cherry-picking"), because assumption 2 would no longer hold.
