Simulating data for an ordered logit model

I am currently working on an project where my dependent variable is available in the form of a Likert scale from 1-5. But before I will run my model on real data I want to test it on artificial data, but I am struggling how to simulate data for this kind of data. I want to build a Bayesian ordered logit model (later I want to introduce random effects, but that doesn't matter at this point) in the spirit of Polson, Scott and Windle (2013) and their package "BayesLogit" in R. I hope anyone can help!
