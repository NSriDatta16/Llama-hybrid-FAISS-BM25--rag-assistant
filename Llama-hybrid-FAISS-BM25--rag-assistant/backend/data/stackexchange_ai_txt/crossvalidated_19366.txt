Your data can be modelled with an AR(1) which can flexibly approximate many different kinds of time series data. All models are wrong some are useful said Prof. Box.

The plot of the residuals from this model suggest a non-random error term leading to some augmentation as does the ACF of the errors . I would think that some slight augmentation might be needed to approximate what to me is a clearly determinstic series . Note that the forecast 'is similar" to the last value thus having approached an assymptotic value which is a characteristic of all non-differenced AR models. The forecasts are presented here . Here is the ACF of the model errors The simplicity of an auto-regressive model can be seen when it is expressed as a simple ols model.
