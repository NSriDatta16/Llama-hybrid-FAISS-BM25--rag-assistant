Ideally, all optimisation problems should be well-defined by being clear about the domain over which the optimisation occurs. So really, all optimisation problems should be constrained to a clear domain for the objective function. One would hope that this is either done explicitly, or if it is implicit, the domain of optimisation should be clear from the context. Certainly there is a distinction between explicit constraints stipulated in the optimisation problem and implicit constraints that are imposed by recognising context. There are certainly cases where a person stipulates an optimisation problem without being clear about the domain of the function they are working with. Sometimes users stipulate functions and take the domain to be obvious by consideration of the context. In the case you give, you are right that the use of the $\log x$ part implicitly suggests the intention to restrict attention to $x \geqslant 0$ (since negative values give complex outputs, which would then make it ambiguous as to what constitutes "optimisation" of the output). The distinction you are referring to would usually just be called "explicit" versus "implicit" --- not "natural" versus "designed". For the most part, literature on optimisation is pretty careful in specifying the domain of optimisation (i.e., likely to give explicit statements of the domain), so the distinction between explicit and implicit constraints is more likely to arise outside of this literature .
