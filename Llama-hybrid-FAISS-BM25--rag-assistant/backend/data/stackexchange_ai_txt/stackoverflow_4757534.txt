Unfortunately with that range of handsets and I assume territories you are looking for a unicorn that does not exist However you need to check which devices you wish to deploy to, as common as a Verisign, Thwate or UTi certificate is, the root certificate is not present on all phones! unfortunately this means if you sign the application you will be unable to install on those devices where the root certificate is not present. The phones you will need to pay particular attention are any that have been customised by carriers, in a great example most Sony K800s have the Verisign certificate unless they are VodafoneUK ones in which case they will not for certain firmwares Your best bet is to obtain a couple of signed midlets and place on a provisioning server and use http install notify to see if you have many failures, you can then attempt to redirect these phones that are having difficulties installing a particular signed application
