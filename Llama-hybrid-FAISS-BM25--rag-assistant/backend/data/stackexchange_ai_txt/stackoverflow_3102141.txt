Right - have sort of fixed this myself. Here's how, in case anyone else has the same problem. NUnit 2.5.5 is now out and this supports projects build using .Net Framework v4.0, but you have to use an additional parameter , namely /framework=4.0.30319 , which looks something like this when used in NAnt, through NCover: With only upgrading NUnit to 2.5.5 (as well with adding this flag) this now works with very little change to the build scripts, which is good. So, in summary: My NAnt script calls out to NCover 1.5.8 and that calls NUnit 2.5.5 which tests my unit test assembly .dll that was built using .Net 4.0. NUnit generates the first output file (bin/release/myProject.Test-dll-results.xml), which is then picked up by NCover and is processed into the second output results file (bin/release/myProject.Test-dll-coverage-results.xml), which can then be simply included into Cruise Control's ccnet.config file for it's automatic inclusion within the webdashboard after each build. Simple. Hope it helps someone else!
