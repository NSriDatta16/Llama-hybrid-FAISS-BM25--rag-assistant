Hmmm... if I understand what you're trying to do here, you want to drag an drop, but undo if the server returns an error? What I would do is to handle the dragEnd event and have that check the server status. If the server had returned an error, then just move the data back to the original list and don't add it to the new list, otherwise just do the default behavior. Feel free to comment about clarifications.
