ASP.NET MVC site having problems with MACs

We have a site at: http://www.racedayworld.com which was built using ASP.NET MVC There are currently a couple people who cannot use the login form when using a Safari on the MAC. The problem is a strange one as I (the developer) have a MAC and can login just fine with Safari. What happens is they put in their credentials and the site just reloads, but doesn't log them in... I'm including 2 examples of the support details we collected from them to see if there was any common problems..
