How to get tabs like zipcar app?

In the demo http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ2EZ_tWsGc at about :22, he clicks the bottom tabbar and a new view slides up. It has three tabs at the top. How do you get the three little tabs working in the "Find car by" view? Also, how did they create the little tab where the "Find car by" text sits? It is sticking out on its own from the view.
