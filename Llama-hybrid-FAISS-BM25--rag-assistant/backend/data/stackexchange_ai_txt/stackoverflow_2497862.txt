Silverlight 4 Trusted Application - Can I drag widgets outside the window?

I have a feeling this really isn't possible, but (for example) would it be possible to implement a trusted Silverlight 4 filesystem browser that allows me to drag files from within the Silverlight application to another application on my desktop?
