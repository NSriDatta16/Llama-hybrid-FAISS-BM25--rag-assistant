LDAP query issue

I am looking for a ldap query which return only Organizational Unit which are direct descendent of Domain For example: I have ADDOMAIN01 which contains OUSales which has a child OU OUAutoMobiles . The issue is that when I search (&(objectCategory=organizationalunit)) it returns all OUs including OUAutomobiles , and I want only top level OUs just OUSales . Also: if I want OUs of only OUSales not of entire Domain, what should be the query? Thanx
