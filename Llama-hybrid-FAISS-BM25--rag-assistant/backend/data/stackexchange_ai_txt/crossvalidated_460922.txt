Contrasts in a Completely Randomized Design (Unbalanced)

Four catalysts that may affect the concentration of one component in a three-component liquid mixture are being investigated. Consider a completely randomized experiment, where $n_1 = 5$ , $n_2 = 4$ , $n_3 = 3$ , and $n_4 = 4$ . Suppose that prior to running the experiment the investigator wanted to make the following comparisons: (a) Average of Catalyst 1 and 2 vs Average of Catalyst 3 and 4 (b) Catalyst 1 vs Catalyst 2 (c) Catalyst 3 vs Catalyst 4. Answer: In a balanced design I understand that in order to be a contrast the condition $\sum\limits_{i = 1}^a c_i = 0$ needs to be satisfied, where the $c_i$ are the coefficients of the $\mu_i$ in the contrasts. So for example, in a balanced design the contrast for Part (c) would be $\Gamma = \mu_3 - \mu_4$ . In an unbalanced design the condition changes to $\sum\limits_{i = 1}^a n_ic_i = 0$ . But I'm confused. $\Gamma = \mu_3 - \mu_4$ no longer works. So do we have to make up coefficients so that the condition is satisfied? For example, for Part (c), knowing that $n_3 = 3$ and $n_4 = 4$ , then $\Gamma = 4\mu_3 - 3\mu_4$ would be a contrast. Is this correct?
