Winform Caching

Is there a Winform caching library out there? I need to pass a few datasets aroung in a Winform Application, and probably persist to storage upon close. I've seen some samples around via Google, using System.Web. What's the recommendation and where can I get some details. I am using VS 2008 for 2.0. 3.0 Framework. Thanks
