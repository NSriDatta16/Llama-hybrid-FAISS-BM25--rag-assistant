Retrieving Azure diagnostics

I have an app running on Azure which logs (traces, really) to the Azure Diagnostics storage. I'm looking for a good tool which can be used to analyze these logs. I know it's possible to retrieve these trace logs using the Server Explorer in Visual Studio, but this tool is a bit cumbersome. For instance, I can't specify a time interval for log records. Also tried Azure Diagnostics Manager from Cerebrata, which is nice, but wonder if there any other good alternatives? (The logging itself works just fine, it's the retrieval and analysis of the logs which I'm interested in)
