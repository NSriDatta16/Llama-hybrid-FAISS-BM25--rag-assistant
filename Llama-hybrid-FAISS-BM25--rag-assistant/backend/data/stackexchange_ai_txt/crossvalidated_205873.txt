Basic question about central limit theorem and sampling distributions

The CLT states that "if you have a population with mean μ and standard deviation σ and take sufficiently large random samples from the population, then the distribution of the sample means will be approximately normally distributed." I have two questions: Assuming I want n=30 observations if I make a laboratory experiment, does it make a difference whether I do the same experiment with n=5 6 times each, or whether I conduct one experiment with n=30? I guess this question concerns the relation between number of repitions and n. Does the CLT mean that variables observed or measured in the experiment should, when averaged, more or less be equal to the unknown population mean?
