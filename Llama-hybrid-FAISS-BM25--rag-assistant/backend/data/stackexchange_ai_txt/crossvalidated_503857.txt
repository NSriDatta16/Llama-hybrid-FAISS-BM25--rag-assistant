Variable importance in random forest regression: scaled or unscaled

If I want to use the original random forest variable importance measure Mean Decrease in Accuracy [1] (which can be the Increase in MSE, for example) when applying random forest regression, should I use the scaled variable importance [2], where the the raw importance is divided by its standard error or rather the unscaled importance? Strobl et al. suggest not to use the scaled variable importance[3], because it "induces a dependence on the number of trees but at the same time inverts the dependence on the sample size" [4]. On the other hand in most standard implemenations of random forest variable importance it is scaled by default, as for example in [2]. Do you know any other than the cited references, which compare the scaled and unscaled random forest variable importance especially for regression? References: [1] Breiman, Leo. "Random forests."
