The code managing the free storage just assumes that you wouldn't hand it the wrong pointer. It takes whatever you give, doesn't check its plausibility, and interprets it the same way it would interpret the right pointer. It will act according to whatever values it reads from whatever memory locations it looks at assuming the pointer was rightfully obtained. If you handed it a stray pointer, it will find nonsensical values and thus act nonsensical. This is called undefined behavior and it's a mean thing. It might format your hard drive, toast your CPU, or make your program seemingly work the way it is expected to until you retire. You never know.
