Since you are using a custom table cell, you can implement code to set the label colors by implementing the setSelected and setHighlighted methods in your custom UITableViewCell. This will capture all state changes from selection, although there are some tricky cases, like when setHighlighting is called with NO when you select and drag outside the cell after it was already selected. Here is the approach I used, which I believe sets the color appropriately in all cases. - (void)updateCellDisplay { if (self.selected || self.highlighted) { self.nameLabel.textColor = [UIColor lightGrayColor]; self.colorLabel.textColor = [UIColor lightGrayColor]; } else { self.nameLabel.textColor = [UIColor blackColor]; self.colorLabel.textColor = [UIColor blackColor]; } } - (void)setHighlighted:(BOOL)highlighted animated:(BOOL)animated { [super setHighlighted:highlighted animated:animated]; [self updateCellDisplay]; } - (void) setSelected:(BOOL)selected animated:(BOOL)animated { [super setSelected:selected animated:animated]; [self updateCellDisplay]; }
