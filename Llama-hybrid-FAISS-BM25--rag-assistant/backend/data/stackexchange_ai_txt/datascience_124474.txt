Prediction of Quarterly Financial Numbers

The task is to predict the quarterly revenue numbers using machine learning. Only 28 quarterly data points for financial numbers are available as companies release the revenue data quarterly. I have few questions regarding this - Is it worth to apply machine learning models to these 28 points to predict the sales? I am skeptical that it would give good results because it seems the data points are too less for machine learning algorithms. How should I deal with the COVID years data as it completely distorts the trend of the series? This is the seasonal_decompose of the 28 data points. By looking at the plot, I am certain that there is a trend. But would it be advisable to apply time series on such small dataset? One idea is to take the revenue for entire quarter divide by 3 to get avg. monthly revenue and attach to each month. Example the revenue is 900 million; give each of the three month in quarter 300 million that would increase the data points from 28 to 84.
