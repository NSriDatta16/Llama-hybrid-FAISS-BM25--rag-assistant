You're trying to subclass NSMutableDictionary? There's a blog entry for that! http://cocoawithlove.com/2008/12/ordereddictionary-subclassing-cocoa.html First bit of advice? Best practice: don't subclass He's right. Trying to subclass a class not designed to be subclassed in Cocoa is usually harder than you think it'll be, and 99% of the time isn't necessary anyway. Looking at the code you posted, it doesn't look like you need to subclass anyway. Create a class that implements the title and begins methods and use a dictionary to handle the underlying storage. edit2: Clarified my last statement about subclassing. Some classes in Cocoa are designed to be subclassed (UIViewController, NSObject) and do so willingly, others are not designed to be subclassed and require a lot of careful coding (and in some cases, inside knowledge of how the objects work) to get them to work correctly. Bottom line: unless you're subclassing one of the classes designed for it, be careful and consider other alternatives ( decorator class , categories , delegation , notification , etc.)
