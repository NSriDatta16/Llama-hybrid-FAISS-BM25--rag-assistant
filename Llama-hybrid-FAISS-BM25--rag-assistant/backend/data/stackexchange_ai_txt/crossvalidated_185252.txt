You can try a Bayesian hypothesis test using the software JASP which is free. It also does classical analyses, which makes it easy to compare the results. I've attached a few screenshots of how you might do it. Load the data using a .csv file format. Then select "Frequencies" at the top, and then "Contingency tables". Then you see a menu like this. Move your variable to the appropriate slots. It renders the result in real time. So for this classical analysis we see the p-value is not significant, but from that we cannot conclude in favor of an equivalence. This is where the Bayesian test comes in. Go back to the frequencies tab and choose "Bayesian contingency tables". Then assign variables as before, and select "BF01" in the "statistics" menu below. Now you can see the result of the Bayesian analysis. The Bayes factor in favor of the null model against the alternative is about 7.4. This means that the null model that assumes equivalence is supported over the alternative that assumes a joint multinomial sampling process. Specific details about these Bayesian methods are available here . They also work through some examples and give guidance for interpreting the results in context.
