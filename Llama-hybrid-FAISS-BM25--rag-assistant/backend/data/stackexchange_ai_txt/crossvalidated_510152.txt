One specific benefit that these models have over SVMs is that their size is fixed: they are parametric models, while SVMs are non-parametric. That is, in an ANN you have a bunch of hidden layers with sizes h1 through hn depending on the number of features, plus bias parameters, and those make up your model. By contrast, an SVM (at least a kernelized one) consists of a set of support vectors, selected from the training set, with a weight for each. In the worst case, the number of support vectors is exactly the number of training samples (though that mainly occurs with small training sets or in degenerate cases) and in general its model size scales linearly. In natural language processing, SVM classifiers with tens of thousands of support vectors, each having hundreds of thousands of features, is not unheard of. Also, online training of FF nets is very simple compared to online SVM fitting, and predicting can be quite a bit faster.
