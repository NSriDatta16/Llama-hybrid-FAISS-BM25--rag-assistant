I had the same problem yesterday. I solved it like this: var obj = { foo:{}, bar:{}, baz:{} }, first = null, key = null; for (var key in obj) { first = obj[key]; if(typeof(first) !== 'function') { break; } } // first is the first enumerated property, and key it's corresponding key. Not the most elegant solution, and I am pretty sure that it may yield different results in different browsers (i.e. the specs says that enumeration is not required to enumerate the properties in the same order as they were defined). However, I only had a single property in my object so that was a non-issue. I just needed the first key.
