There is no fixed model of organisation, as you can create your own objects and/or relations between objects. OM is a module by itself, so informations given here will be just a really short introduction. The most simple org model is a O-O-S-P : the O-O relation (A/B 002) is a hierarchical one for strutural unit the O-S relation is either A/B 003 (belongs to), for standard position A/B 012 (manage) for the unit manager's position (who can also have a B003 to the unit or another unit) the S-P relation is (A/B 008) is the holder( s ) of the position These relations are the standard ones, and have been used by all clients I've worked for/with. However, depending on the needs, other objects (F : function, T : task) can be used, with other relations. As already said, it is event possible to create new object type or new relations. The only way i know to get a quick look at the relations used for an organisation is to check the tables : Objects are present in the HRP1000 table (basic informations on objects). The objects Id linked to a given person can easily be found in the infotype 0001 (transaction pa20) : id of object O is PA0001-ORGEH, S is PA0001-PLANS, F is PA0001-STELL. Of course P is PA0001-PERNR (employee Id). Relations between objects are in the HRP1001 table. To search for a given relations you need to give the (relation) source Id and type, as well as the destination type and id. for example, to get all position managing a unit (ie all manager position) you may do SELECT * from HRP1001 where OTYPE = 'S' AND RELAT = '012' and RSIGN = 'A' and begda = sy-datum and sclass = 'O'. ... fields OBJID and SOBID will then contains ther id of positions and units. transaction ooaw allows the management of evaluation-path, that is a set of relations to be followed recursively to get a set of objects. you can use them with the function 'RH_STRUC_GET' (field wegid is the evaluation-path). This may be easier than using a set of select. Thus if you want to get all the units and person under a given unit, you could use the "O_S_P" evaluation-path with a depth of 0 (ie, all the way down), or "ORGCHART" if you also wants the functionw (description) of the positions. Hope this help you. Regards
