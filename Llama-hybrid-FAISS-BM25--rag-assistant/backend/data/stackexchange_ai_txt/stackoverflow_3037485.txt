You can normally define custom comparison methods so the sort is performed within your restrictions. I've never coded a line of Python in my life, but it's similar enough to Ruby for me to notice that the following excerpt from this page might help you: alphabet = "zyxwvutsrqpomnlkjihgfedcba" inputWords = ["england", "france", "spain", "italy", "greece", "portugal", "canada", "usa", "mexico", "peru", "cuba", "chile", "argentina", "zimbabwe", "uganda", "congo", "zambia", "namibia", "ghana"] print sorted(inputWords, key=lambda word: [alphabet.index(c) for c in word]) You might also want to check out these articles .
