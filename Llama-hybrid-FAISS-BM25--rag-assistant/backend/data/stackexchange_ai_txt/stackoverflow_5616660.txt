Any device specific string can be spoofed and WP7 doesn't have a secure storage method today. A common scheme is to return an authentication token from an https login method that is then stored on the device as an encrypted stream. Realize that the decryption key and string are both on the device and could be decrypted if the device is compromised. You can also then expire the authentication tokens server-side whenever you need to and the tokens can expire after a certain time.
