What process actually takes place during audio feedback suppression machine learning

After training a neural network (NN) to tell the difference between a clean audio signal and a signal with a specific "noise", what is the mechanics that actually takes place where an unseen noise filled audio file gets "cleaned" up by the machine learning model? Its not filtering nor subtraction of the model on the input audio file, as the frequency component of the wanted audio file seems "undisturbed" although the noise frequency component overlaps with portions of the desired audio file. Thanks for your time and help in giving some guidance to an answer to this question.
