Difficulty of a side-scrolling game in C#

I was just wondering, if I began learning C#, how long it would take until I would be able to make a game utilizing the XNA Game Studio (4.0) and framework to make an XBOX 360 Live Arcade side-scrolling game. Realistically, I have other priorities too, so I'm just trying to feel out if the "project" is feasible. Obviously, if I wanted to make a full-blown live arcade game, I would need to find a friend(s) who's willing to do some art design, and probably someone(s) who's willing to help code. Any ideas? The game would be relatively simple, but I would want to make it unique and visually appealing (more on the artsy side here) to make it stand out.
