Does Azure Shared Access Signature mean anyone can access my blobs?

I am writing a backup service to backup a SQL database and save it in cloud storage. I have actually implemented this already with Amazon S3 but as the application will be distributed to customers, I cannot have the API keys stored with the application. I considered using a web service to provide the keys, but it's not my best option at this time (Because it still leaves the possibility of keys being stolen.) So I was looking into Windows Azure, the Blob Service and saw they have these Shared Access Signatures that can be used to provide access to resources in the cloud. You can also use the signature to put blobs in the cloud. But reading through the MSDN docs , I can't help but think this is an insecure system. Anyone who knows 1. the exact names of containers for my account and 2. how to form the signature will be able to access the objects. You do not need a secret key when using this signature. At least that is my impression reading the docs. So finally to my question. Am I correct in my assessment of the shared access signatures with Azure, if not, why? And can anyone suggest an alternative way of doing what I am trying to accomplish.
