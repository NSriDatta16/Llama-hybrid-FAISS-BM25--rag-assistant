PCA cannot perform "subsampling" or selecting "most representative observations". It is not selecting anything, it is constructing linear combinations with maximum variance. In your case, PCA will be constructing linear combinations of observations, which has unclear meaning and hardly predictable consequences for your algorithm. You should be better off with random subsampling.
