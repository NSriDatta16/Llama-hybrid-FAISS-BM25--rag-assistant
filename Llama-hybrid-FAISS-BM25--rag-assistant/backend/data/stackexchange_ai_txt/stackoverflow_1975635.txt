Silverlight Isolated Storage and Host Name Redirects

I have a site that serves up a pretty substantial Silverlight RIA and it makes use of IsolatedStorage. The SL app is served up from https://www.site.com/Application (MVC View that hosts the SL object tags, etc). It is also served up from https://site.com/Application . The problem inherent in this is that this will create two separate IsolatedStorage application because the two host names are seen as different. My first thought was to just serve the XAP file from an absolute link instead of a relative one: But this seemed to cause weird problems when the page was served from www.site.com and the xap was served from site.com. My next thought was to leave it a relative link, but always do a permanent redirect (301) from www.site.com/application -> site.com/application to ensure that it is always served from the same location. Any thoughts or suggestions? Has anyone seen this?
