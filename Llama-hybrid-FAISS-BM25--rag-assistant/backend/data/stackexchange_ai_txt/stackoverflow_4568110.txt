Java API - Cloud Service

I hope many people already know about the Dropbox Cloud Service for storing and syncing files across various clients. I am little hesitant using a third party service to store my personal files. I am trying to build a personal cloud storage using my 2TB Hard Drive. I guess I am looking for pointers on where to start, which APIs to use [preferably JAVA and J2EE], security, risks?
