Binomial Distribution:equivalency between the average and proportion?

Another user and I are having a debate regarding properties of a binomial distribution, most notably the relationship between the proportion and the mean. The central prompt is in quotations: “I want to find out if the coin-toss algorithm is working as intended. I play 100 games and check how many I go first. I set these as 1's and going 2nd as 0's. I take the sum of the 1's and divide by 100 (an average). Is this a good approximation of the probability of going first that was used in setting up the coin toss algorithm? Finally, of course you cannot take the average of categorical variables in general (like color of the car, your BMI classification, etc.). However, with regard to determining the probability of an event, taking the average (that is, summing up successes and dividing by total trials) is precisely what Borel's law of large numbers (LLN) is about.” First, isn’t the above approach calculating the proportion of successes, not the average? Second, in a binomial distribution, is taking the proportion mathematically equivalent to taking an "average" (when observations are represented as 1 or 0)? Third, it was to my understanding that binomial variables are inherently categorical, and thus averaging the 1’s and 0’s are treating an otherwise binomial variable as numerical values. I understand that you can coerce the successes and failures as 1 and 0 accordingly, treat them as numerical values, and perform descriptive statistics (average and variance), but isn’t this just a convoluted way of calculating the proportion of successes? I explained that taking an average is a measure of central tendency, and that without a known proportion, in a binomial distribution, it wouldn't make sense to perform descriptive statistics besides calculating the proportion of successes. The mean of a binomial distribution is calculated as $X=n p$ where $x$ is the mean, $n$ is the number of trials, and $p$ is the proportion. The proportion and the number of trials do not change, but the average does change leading me to believe that averaging the 1's and 0's does not report the true average of the binomial distribution. For that matter, is it statistically possible to calculate the average of a binomial data, across multiple independent trials, without a known proportion? Lastly, I am not sure if the law of large numbers (LLN) is being appropriately applied in the above prompt.
