I am afraid that your question has no good answer. There is no "best" or universal way of creating features for the machine learning model. It is usually done by combining your experience, domain knowledge, and results of exploratory data analysis on the available data (what you mentioned). For example, say that there is a disease that is known to progress with age differently for males and females. Knowing this, you could add an interaction age_gender = age * gender to your features. This is something you would know from your domain knowledge or interviewing domain experts. It may or may not be instantly visible from the exploratory data analysis, especially if there are other contributing factors. You mentioned binning the data as an example, but in fact, it is a quite poor choice for a feature as you can learn from the What is the benefit of breaking up a continuous predictor variable? thread. Finally, you may choose machine learning models that do feature engineering by themselves (like neural networks). Keep in mind still, that even for such models, creating good features may improve the performance or make things easier as you can learn from the Utility of feature-engineering : Why create new features based on existing features? thread. If you are looking for further resources on this subject, there is a nice introductory book Feature Engineering for Machine Learning by Alice Zheng and Amanda Casari.
