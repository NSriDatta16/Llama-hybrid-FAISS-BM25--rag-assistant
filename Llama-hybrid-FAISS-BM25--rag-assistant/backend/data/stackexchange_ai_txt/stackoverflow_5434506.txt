As an example, your code could probably look like this: public class ServiceContext : TableServiceContext { public ServiceContext(string baseAddress, StorageCredentials credentials) : base(baseAddress, credentials) { } public const string TableName = typeof(T).Name; public IQueryable Table { get { return this.CreateQuery (TableName); } } } And would be instantiated like any generic class: ServiceContext context = new ServiceContext (â€¦); Essentially, I have changed every occurrence of Capacity in your class into T and made the class generic by appending to the class name. Now the class is usable for other types as well.
