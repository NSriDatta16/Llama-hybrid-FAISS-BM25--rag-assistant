Gosh, this would be so easy if you were using Visual Studio 2010 -- they added in a "vertical select" option (hold Alt+click+drag... or Alt+shift+cursor movements), which you could use to select only the line numbers and remove them with a single DEL keystroke. But I think what you'll want to do in VS2008 is record a macro: Position your cursor before the beginning of a line number. Press Ctrl+Shift+R, delete the number using the DEL key, press arrow down to move to the beginning of the next line, then press Ctrl+Shift+R again. Now, every time you press Ctrl+Shift+P, you will play back the macro and delete another line. Repeat until you've removed all the line numbers.
