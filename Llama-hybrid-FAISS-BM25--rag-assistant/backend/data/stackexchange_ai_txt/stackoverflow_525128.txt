I think SOLID principles sometimes don't comply with natural/business logic that one usually applies when designing classes. Robert C. Martin brought up an example of Rectange and Square classes (Square shouldn't be a descendant of Rectangle). http://www.hanselminutes.com/default.aspx?showID=163 I'm not sure that it was regarding SRP but the idea is the same. SOLID principles may lead to counterintuitive decisions and it's hard to get though this barrier. To me 'guidelines' is more appropriate name than 'principles'.
