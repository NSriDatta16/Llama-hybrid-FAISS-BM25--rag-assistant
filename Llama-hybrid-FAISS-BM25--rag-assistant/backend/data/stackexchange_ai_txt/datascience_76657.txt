Data preprocessing for time series prediction

I have a dataset that has the following structure [ [ [ product 1 ,shelf number, position on the tray, time of stay on the shelf, was sold?], # Hour 1 [ product 1 ,shelf number, position on the tray, time of stay on the shelf, was sold?], # Hour 2 [ product 1 ,shelf number, position on the tray, time of stay on the shelf, was sold?], # Hour 3 : ], [ [ product 2 ,shelf number, position on the tray, time of stay on the shelf, was sold?], # Hour 1 [ product 2 ,shelf number, position on the tray, time of stay on the shelf, was sold?], # Hour 2 [ product 2 ,shelf number, position on the tray, time of stay on the shelf, was sold?], # Hour 3 : ], : ] My goal is to predict for a newer product say product_n predict if it will be sold (3 hours earlier). My question is how do I process it for a Recurrent Neural network since the vector of prediction was sold? is available for each hour. To say that in detail, since [ [ product 1 ,shelf number, position on the tray, time of stay on the shelf], # Hour 1 [ product 1 ,shelf number, position on the tray, time of stay on the shelf], # Hour 2 [ product 1 ,shelf number, position on the tray, time of stay on the shelf], # Hour 3 : ], is one observation for the RNN how do I assign was sold? to it? Since len(X) should be equal to len(y) was sold? is available for each observations, do I take max for 3 hours and asssign it to the obervation? Like X = [ [ product 1 ,shelf number, position on the tray, time of stay on the shelf], # Hour 1 [ product 1 ,shelf number, position on the tray, time of stay on the shelf], # Hour 2 [ product 1 ,shelf number, position on the tray, time of stay on the shelf], # Hour 3 : ], and y = [max(was sold?)]
