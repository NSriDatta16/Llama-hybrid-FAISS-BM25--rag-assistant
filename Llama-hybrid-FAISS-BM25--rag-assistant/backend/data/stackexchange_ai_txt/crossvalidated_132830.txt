Is it "okay" to plot a regression line for ranked data (Spearman correlation)?

I have data for which I calculated the Spearman correlation and want to visualize it for a publication. The dependent variable is ranked, the independet variable is not. What I want to visualize is more the general trend than the actual slope, so I ranked the independent and applied the Spearman correlation/regression. But just when I plotted my data and was about to insert it into my manuscript, I stumbled upon this statement (on this website ): You will almost never use a regression line for either description or prediction when you do Spearman rank correlation, so don't calculate the equivalent of a regression line . and later You can graph Spearman rank correlation data the same way you would for a linear regression or correlation. Don't put a regression line on the graph , however; it would be misleading to put a linear regression line on a graph when you've analyzed it with rank correlation. The thing is, the regression lines are not that different from when I do not rank the independent and calculate the Pearson correlation. The trend is the same, but due to the exorbitant fees for colored graphics in journals I went with monochrome representation and the actual data points are overlapping so much that it is not recognizable. I could work my way around this, of course, by making two different plots: One for the data points (ranked) and one for the regression line (unranked), but if it turns out that the source I quoted is wrong or the issue not that problematic in my case, it would make my life easier. (I also saw this question , but it didn't help me.) Edit for additional info: The independent variable on the x-axis represents the number of features and the dependent variable on the y-axis represents the rank if classification algorithms when compared in their performance. Now I have some algorithms that are comparable on average, but what I want to say with my plot is something like: "While classifier A gets better the more features are present, classifier B is better when less features are present" Edit 2 to include my plots: Ranks of algorithms plotted versus the number of features Ranks of algorithms plotted versus the ranked number of features So, to repeat the question from the title: Is it okay to plot a regression line for ranked data of a Spearman correlation/regression?
