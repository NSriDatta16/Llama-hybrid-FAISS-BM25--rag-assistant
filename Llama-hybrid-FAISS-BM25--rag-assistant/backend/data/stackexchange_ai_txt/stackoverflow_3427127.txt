I'll not answer your question and instead recommend a different approach, assuming it's not too late to change the relevant design. You should not store passwords in the same files as the rest. Have the application read a dedicated password file (or retrieve the password from a password storage service) in addition to the regular configuration file. This is not just about not storing passwords in svn, but also about not having passwords exposed to shoulder surfing, accidentally mailed or posted when someone asks for help with a non-working configuration, etc.
