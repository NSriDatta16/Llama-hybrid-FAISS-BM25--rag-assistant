Geotrust has come across very well. Usually quick SSL cert issuance (they brag 10 minutes but prepare for at least a little more) and no hassle after that. Most browswers have their root certificate now so give them a shot. http://www.geotrust.com . They are a part of Verisign but from my experience going through their website gives the best results (still different staff maybe?)
