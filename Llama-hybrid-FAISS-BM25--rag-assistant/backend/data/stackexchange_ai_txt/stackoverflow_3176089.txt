How well C# to interface with MFC DLL, with some of the DLL functions will invoke MFC GUI? Not well at all. You can't P/Invoke to a C++ library -- it works with C exports only. You would need to write a wrapper exposing a C library interface for you to P/Invoke from C#, or you'd need to recompile MFC using C++/CLI. There's little reason to do this though as Winforms is a comparable library to MFC for .NET code. Anything I need to pay attention on it? I don't understand that question. Will the interfacing with legacy C++ DLLs be easier, if we are using Managed C++? Considering you can't do it using C#, yes. You'd have to recompile those C++ DLLs to have them expose a C interface, or you'd have to recompile them from source using C++/CLI. Note: No matter what you do here, you're still going to have to worry about memory managment and object lifetime of anything going on inside native code. The CLI does not automatically manage native resources for you.
