Java: Quick/Elegant way to check for null

In the program I'm currently writing, I find myself doing the following a lot... Map > network = loadSerializedObj(file); // null if failed if(network != null) { anonNet = util.anonymize(newNet); } else { // Some sort of error handling. System.out.println("Some sort of error message. Exiting..."); System.exit(0); } Is there a more succinct way of handling the event that loading the serialized object from file doesn't work and the method returns null? Any tips at all are welcome. Anywhere I can make this more elegant?
