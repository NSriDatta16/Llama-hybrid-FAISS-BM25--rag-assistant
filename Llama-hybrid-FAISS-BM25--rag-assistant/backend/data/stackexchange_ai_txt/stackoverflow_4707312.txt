mySQL Left Join on multiple tables

I'm really struggling with this query. I have 4 tables (http://oberto.co.nz/db-sql.png): Invoice_Payement, Invoice, Client and Calendar. I'm trying to create a report by summing up the 'paid_amount' col, in Invoice_Payment, by month/year. The query needs to include all months, even those with no data There query needs the condition (Invoice table): registered_id = [id] I have tried with the below query, which works, but falls short when 'paid_date' does not have any records for a month. The outcome is that month does not show in the results I added a Calendar table to resolved this but not sure how to left join to it. SELECT MONTHNAME(Invoice_Payments.date_paid) as month, SUM(Invoice_Payments.paid_amount) AS total FROM Invoice, Client, Invoice_Payments WHERE Client.registered_id = 1 AND Client.id = Invoice.client_id And Invoice.id = Invoice_Payments.invoice_id AND date_paid IS NOT NULL GROUP BY YEAR(Invoice_Payments.date_paid), MONTH(Invoice_Payments.date_paid) Please see the above link for a basic ERD diagram of my scenario. Database: http://oberto.co.nz/ Expected output: my current query, below, will return something like: month total August 5 September 0 October 196 November 205 December 214 January 229 Thanks for reading. I've posted this Q before but I think I worded it badly.
