There is no point in searching for a cointegration relationship between two stationary variables, I(0). When the time series are integrated of order one (or higher), standard linear regression analysis may produce spurious results; in particular, we may erroneously find that one variable is statistically significant for explaining the other variable ( Granger and Newbold 1974 ) [1]. This is where cointegration comes into play. The focus of cointegration analysis is to search for a linear combination of the time series that has a lower order of integration than the original series. For example, in economic data, it is sometimes observed that the variables are I(1) (stochastic trends) but a linear combination of them is I(0) (stationary). The cointegration relationship reveals a stable relationship between the variables in the long-term and this becomes helpful to develop further economic analysis or to test economic theories. If the variables are stationary, I(0), then we can rely on standard linear regression analysis and test, for example, whether one variable is a significant predictor of the other variable. (Some kind of cointegration relationship between I(0) variables would not be informative, since any combination of stationary variables will, in principle, be stationary.) [1] Granger, C. W.
