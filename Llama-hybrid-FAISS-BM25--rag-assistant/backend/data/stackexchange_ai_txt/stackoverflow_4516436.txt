pcap_set_rfmon does not work?

I am trying to set my device to monitor mode, and i know its capable of being in monitor mode doing a "iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor" works, i run my code and i can capture packets from anywhere. The problem is that in libpcap it fails to set my device to monitor mode at all(without entering the above-mentioned command line).I can't capture any packets until i manually connect to a access point. pcap_t *handler = pcap_create("wlan0",errbuff); if(pcap_set_rfmon(handler,1)==0 ) { std::cout so is this a code problem, or the pcap library problem?Anybody successfully set their device to monitor mode without using command lines?I am using a Realtek2500 btw.
