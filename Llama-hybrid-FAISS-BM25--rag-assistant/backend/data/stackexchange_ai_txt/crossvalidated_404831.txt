Instead of estimating separate models per each student and then trying to make the parameters comparable, better use a single mixed-effects model for all students (see other questions tagged as mixed-model ). In such model you would use random slopes for students, where the slopes would follow common distribution. By doing this, the only thing that you'd need to test is if their common distribution is centred at zero. Moreover, if this is a test data and you want to study things like task difficulty, then this sounds like a problem for Item Response Theory model and such models can be treated as a special case of mixed-effects logistic regression models . If it is a single test taken by different students and you want to study the properties of the test that are common for all the students, then this is another argument for using a single model.
