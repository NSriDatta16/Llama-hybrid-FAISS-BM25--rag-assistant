UIScrollView tries to determine what kind of interaction the user has in mind. If you tap a view inside a scroll view, that view gets the touch began. If the user then drags, the scroll view decides that the user wants to scroll, so it sends touchesCancelled to the view which first got the event. It then handles the dragging itself. To enable your own dragging of subviews, you can subclass UIScrollView and override touchesShouldBegin:withEvent:inContentView: and touchesShouldCancelInContentView: .
