Conflict with squid and ajax

I have a user who gets an error from ajax calls on our site. The error is pasted below. They get the error in FF3 Windows, but not IE. Based on some searching it seems this issue is often caused by the client protocol squid (you'll notice at the end of the error, squid is mentioned). My ajax code is the same used here: http://www.w3schools.com/Ajax/ajax_browsers.asp Any ideas? ERROR The requested URL could not be retrieved While trying to process the request: POST /library/cart/cart_ajax.php?action=refreshCartWidget&qty=dontuse& HTTP/1.1 Host: mydomain.com User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.3) Gecko/2008092417 Firefox/3.0.3 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729) Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: identity,gzip,deflate Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7 Keep-Alive: 300 Connection: Close Referer: http://mydomain.com/library Pragma: no-cache Cache-Control: no-cache The following error was encountered: Invalid Request Some aspect of the HTTP Request is invalid.
