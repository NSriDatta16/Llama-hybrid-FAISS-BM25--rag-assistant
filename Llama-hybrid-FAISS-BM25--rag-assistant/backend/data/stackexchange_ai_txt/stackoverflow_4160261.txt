You are definitely not the only person having this problem. I know it's frustrating, but give it some time - I'm confident the Rails team will put together something simple and elegant. I'm in a similar position, only I need to know the incorrect url resource the user entered. A quick Google search and I found this article demonstrating a full solution to the Rails 3.0 rescue_from ActionController::RoutingError problem . The solution involves Route Globbing and solves my need to both handle incorrect urls and capture the url entered. Hope this helps!
