From a CPU standpoint, the emulator tends to be slower than actual hardware, presumably due to the overhead of converting ARM bytecodes to x86 ones on the fly. From a graphics standpoint, the emulator tends to be dramatically slower than actual hardware, because the emulator lacks hardware graphics acceleration (regardless of the quality of the host computer's video card). From a disk I/O standpoint, the emulator tends to be faster than actual hardware, particularly on write operations. Flash writes can be very slow, depending on a wide range of criteria (wear leveling, percentage of the flash storage that is in use, etc.). Brad Fitzpatrick covered this topic in his Writing zippy Android applications presentation at the 2010 Google I|O conference. From a network standpoint, the emulator can be faster than actual hardware, because WiFi or wired Ethernet hooked up to broadband will typically be faster than a mobile data connection.
