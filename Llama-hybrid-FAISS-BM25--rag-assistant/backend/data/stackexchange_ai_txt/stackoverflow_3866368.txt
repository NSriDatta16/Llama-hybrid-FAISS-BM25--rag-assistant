A queue is full when you have no more space to enqueue/insert new items whether do to storage constraints, or programmatic constraints. (assuming its bounded) Check here(wikipedia) and it shows a C# example with a "size" limit. Code snippet(from link above): #region Constructor public Queue(int Size) { this._Size = Size; } //Enqueue if (this.IsFull()) { throw new Exception("Queue is full !"); } ... do enqueue // check full public virtual bool IsFull() { return (this._Count == this._Size); }
