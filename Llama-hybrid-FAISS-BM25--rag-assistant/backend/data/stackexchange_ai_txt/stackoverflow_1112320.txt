Removing obsolete WebProxy.GetDefaultProxy() references

I have a bit of code which is annoying me because it is generating obsolete warnings, but I am wary of removing it because: a) It works b) I didn't write it c) I don't currently have a means of testing it. (ie I don't have access to a machine where it is required) The code is as follows System.Net.WebProxy proxyObject = System.Net.WebProxy.GetDefaultProxy(); proxyObject.Credentials = System.Net.CredentialCache.DefaultCredentials; proxyObject.BypassProxyOnLocal = true; System.Net.GlobalProxySelection.Select = proxyObject; The warning message is Warning 31 'System.Net.GlobalProxySelection' is obsolete: 'This class has been deprecated. Please use WebRequest.DefaultWebProxy instead to access and set the global default proxy. Use 'null' instead of GetEmptyWebProxy. http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=14202 ' But, if my understanding is correct, (and assuming that the web service the program is trying to access will never be local) what I really should do is just delete these four lines? Is this correct, or have a missed something? PS. I know there is probably a #pragma option to ignore the warning, but I don't really want to go down that route.
