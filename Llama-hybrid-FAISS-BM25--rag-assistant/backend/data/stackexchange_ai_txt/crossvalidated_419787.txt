Use the observed values as there may be lag structure needed for GDP (X) that may be different than the lag structure need for air traffic passenger data (Y) . You can always subsequently express the change in passenger forecast as a percentage of the previous value as it relates to the change in GDP as it relates to the previous value of GDP . Finally to get correct/honest prediction limits for passenger data (Y) you may/will need to account for the uncertainty in GDP (X) predictions and possible re-occurring anomalies. You might want to read https://autobox.com/pdfs/regvsbox-old.pdf which discusses some of the opportunities that are available when you have time series data and some of the pitfalls when you use simple OLS. I surmise you ran a simple OLS of Y versus X and obtained .97 as the Rsq AND then you created two new series Y1 and X1 where Y1=[Y(t)-Y(t-1)]/Y(t-1) and X1=[X(t)-X(t-1)]/X(t-1) and obtained .35 when you regressed Y1 and X1 . This specification is probably suspect for a ton of reasons whereas a SARMAX https://autobox.com/pdfs/SARMAX.pdf is much more general approach. Your specification of the model (two ratios) is a possible model but not probable because it is based upon presumption.
