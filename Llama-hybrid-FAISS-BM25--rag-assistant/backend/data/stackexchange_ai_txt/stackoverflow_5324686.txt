retainCount is not a reliable debugging tool. You should never pay attention to or rely on retainCount. Just because you released it does not mean that some part of the program does not still have a reference to it. retainCount has no value. Generally as a rule of thumb. If you use 'alloc' you must 'release' at some point. Unless ofcourse you have put it into an autorelease pool. Leaks should be able to point you to the objects that are leaking, using that, narrow down to where those objects are added, stored etc. Post examples of your code on how you instantiate objects and where you release them, you maybe doing something wrong early on. edit: apologies, i put 'init' not 'alloc' previously, thank you dreamlax, early morning mistake.
