One approach would be to use the Rattle package in R to export your Random Forest model as PMML. Then use Cascading to score with that PMML model at scale on Apache Hadoop. Examples for just this are shown at: http://www.cascading.org/pattern/ Code is already available in the pre-defined app. Just run that JAR shown in the example. A presentation about this is showing at slide 48-ff in http://www.slideshare.net/pacoid/the-workflow-abstration
