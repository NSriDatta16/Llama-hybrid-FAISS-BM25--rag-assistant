Sql Server Backup to UNC

I've create a maintenance plan on my SQL Server 2005 server. The backup should be written to another server. I'm using a UNC path for this. The user running the SQL Agent jobs has full access to the other server. It's admin on both servers. The problem is that this statement fails ( has the correct server name ofcourse): EXECUTE master.dbo.xp_create_subdir N'\\servername\c$\SqlServerBackup\Test' The error I get is: Msg 22048, Level 16, State 1, Line 0 xp_create_subdir() returned error 123, 'The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect.' Does anyone know what could be the problem?
