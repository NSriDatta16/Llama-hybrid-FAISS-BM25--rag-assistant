There are full books of data imputation so it is difficult to give an answer in this framework. The easiest thing to do in this case is to pick one of the columns ($y$) and collect the other in a matrix $x$. A model $y=f(x)$ is trained and the missing values are replaced with the values predicted by our model. Your data seems to be categorical so random forest can be a good choice. If your dataset is very large make sure to use a fast algorithm or a scalable one.
