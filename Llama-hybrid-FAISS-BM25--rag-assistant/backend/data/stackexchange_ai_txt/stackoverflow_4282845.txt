Is there documentation for Team Build 2010 Activites?

As most of you know TFS Team Build 2010 is Windows Workflow based. It comes with a handful of custom Activities out of the box. Is there any documentation available for these activities? For example Microsoft.TeamFoundation.Build.Workflow.Activities.GetBuildAgent is one of the activities that has basically only one property called Result which I'm assuming takes a variable name that receives the agent name. But how does it determine which agent to select? which variables/arguments does it use to receive input/output? I'm sure if I ask around I can figure out how this specific Activity works, but what about the other 50 activities? I have been unsuccessful in finding documentation on these Microsoft provided activities to date.
