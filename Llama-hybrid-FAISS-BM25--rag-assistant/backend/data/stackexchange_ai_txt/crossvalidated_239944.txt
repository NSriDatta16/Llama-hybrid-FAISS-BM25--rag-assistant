Is there a formula that will define if a variable is leading or not?

Is there a formula that can help me categorically define if a variable is leading or lagging other than knowing any background of the data aside from the data itself? In economy, there are well known lead and lag indicators which requires one's knowledge of the economy beforehand. There are known tests, granger causality being the basis of most of those tests , if not all. All i have encountered so far though are making use of stationary time series,in my case, i am using non stationary time series( not necessarily, stationary to be exact, as i want the stationary test).
