For the ball problem the probabilities are the same because every ball is equally likely to be picked. In the 3 ball bag there are 3 possible (equally likely) balls. Any ball gets picked on average 1/{number of balls} of the time. in other words, the probability of getting the green ball is 1/3. In the 30 ball bad there are 30 possible (equally likely) balls. Any ball gets picked on average 1/30 of the time. Suppose all the green balls were numbered 1,2,...,10. Green1 gets picked 1/30 of the time. Green2 gets picked 1/30 of the time. ... Green10 gets picked 1/30 of the time. So Green gets picked 1/30 + 1/30 + .. 1/30 = 10/30 = 1/3 of the time. But in the fight Not all the fighters are equal Even if the fighters were equal (e.g. they were robots) they could gang up. Even if the fights were separate i.e. just 10 lots of 1vs2, 1vs2 isn't a random draw. If all the fighters are equal then I would expect 2 ALWAYS to beat 1!
