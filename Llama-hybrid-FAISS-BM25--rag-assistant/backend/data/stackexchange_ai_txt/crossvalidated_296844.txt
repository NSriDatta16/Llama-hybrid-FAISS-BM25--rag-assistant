The first stop would be a basic linear regression. Here is a simple example in R: time |t|) (Intercept) -0.1388840 0.0639265 -2.173 0.03 * time 1.0001052 0.0001106 9039.197 The coefficient estimate associated with time is your estimate of $\partial x/\partial time$, on average. If you wish to compute a trend on a subset of the data, simply subset the data that you feed to the regression. Complexity increases from here, depending on more specific goals.
