Your tempdb is the size it needs to be... It will just grow again, just even more fragmented on disk and possibly blocking while it grows too. More seriously, I'd set the size of tempdb to soemthing sensible and slightly larger than now, shut down SQL, delete the old files to be 110% sure, start SQL Server up again...
