SVG has an interface to the unserialized form of the path elements. Its description is in the SVG spec . You should be able to extend the objects by adding your own properties to serve as markers. I've never used the interface, but you should be able to access a list of the path segments by using the pathSegList property (defined in SVGAnimatedPathData ) by doing something along the lines of $("path")[0].pathSegList (the [0] is there to get to the actual DOM element instead of the jQuery object)
