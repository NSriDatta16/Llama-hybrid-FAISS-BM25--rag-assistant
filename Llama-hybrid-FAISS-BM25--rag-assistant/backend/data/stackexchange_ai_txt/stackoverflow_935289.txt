You could reverse engineer the database (see this posting for a script that does this) if it has foreign keys physically present in the database. If this is not the case then you are up for some manual detective work. Visio professional has a tool for reverse engineering a database. 2003 doesn't play nicely with SQL Server 2005, so you will need either: Visio 2007 Modify the script linked to above so it doesn't generate schema references and load the script into a SQL Server 2000 database. Then, reverse engineer from the SQL 2000 DB. If you don't have foreign keys or have incomplete foreign key coverage, you can look for them manually (for example, look for fields with similar looking codes to reference data) and manually annotate the keys in the diagram. Don't try to do this with the diagramming tool that comes in SSMS as it can attempt to populate the FKs back into the database.
