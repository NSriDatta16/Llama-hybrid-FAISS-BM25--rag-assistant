"Dictionary" with key as part of stored elements?

Seems like I forgot a typename ... Something inside my head keeps telling me that I have stumbled across a Dictionary that basicly uses a user-defined Comparer for lookups. But I somehow can't find that class in the depths of .Net anymore. As I have no real idea how to describe what I am looking for without describing a possible implementation, I will also give an example of what I wan't to do. I am basicly looking for a way to achieve the following (pseudocode): class CustomId { // [...] } class Element { CustomId id; } Container myContainer = new Container(myCustomComparer) myContainer.Add(new Element()) // No key specified myElement = myContainer[new CustomId(...)]; // Retrieval with custom id Maybe this technically isn't quite a dictionary, but I hope the idea is clear. Basicly the key is part of the stored element.
