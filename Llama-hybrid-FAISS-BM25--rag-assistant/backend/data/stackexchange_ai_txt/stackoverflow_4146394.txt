Will Silverlight take too long to load my business app?

I'm thinking that Silverlight 4.0 would be a good choice to build our business application. However, the one part I'm afraid of is the loading. If I understand it correctly, Silverlight compiles ALL the pages into one binary, which is loaded on the client at load time. It's fine now with just a few pages, but if I reach hundreds of pages, will this load time get extremely long? When I look at examples on Infragistics and Telerik, they take a good 10-15 seconds to load just those few examples. I find this unacceptable. Are there ways around this?
