Simple question of how models deal with control variables

Apologies for the very simple question, it's something I've had trouble wrapping my head around: How does a model (e.g. logistic regression) deal with control variables - if the purpose is to keep a control variable constant, how does it choose which level (of that variable) to keep constant, or does it run the model for every level of that variable and somehow produce a single output? For example: Say I have an opportunistic dataset of locations where birds have put their nests. I've put an example sample below, but pretend there are many more data points. My dependent variable is the "Location" of the bird's nest, and the independent variable is the "Weather" and "Distance to water" - I want to see whether these factors influence the choice of location for their nest. I know that "Year" and "Species (of bird)" will also influence this, however as I am not studying those factors I want to control for them. Will the model, therefore, run on every possible combination of keeping both Year and Species constant (i.e. Species CB, the Year 2018. Species CB, the Year 2019 ... Species ETD, Year. 2018)? Species Location Weather Year Distance to water (m) CB A Rain 2019 12 CB B Rain 2019 2 ETD B Dry 2020 18 ER A Dry 2018 7 ETD B Rain 2020 16 CB A Rain 2018 23 ER A Rain 2018 9 ER B Dry 2020 10 Or does the model do fancy statistics to determine which combination of control variables will lead to significance for the non-control variables? Please explain this in terms of what RSTUDIO does.
