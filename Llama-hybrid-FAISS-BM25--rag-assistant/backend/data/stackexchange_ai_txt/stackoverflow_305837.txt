IIS SMTP: Exceeded storage allocation response

Hey all. We're sending quite a few emails (around 23k) using IIS6 SMTP service and receive about 7-8 error messages each time. The stack trace is: System.Net.Mail.SmtpException: Exceeded storage allocation. The server response was: 4.3.1 Session size exceeds fixed maximum session size at System.Net.Mail.DataStopCommand.CheckResponse(SmtpStatusCode statusCode, String serverResponse) at System.Net.Mail.DataStopCommand.Send(SmtpConnection conn) at System.Net.Mail.SmtpConnection.OnClose(Object sender, EventArgs args) at System.Net.ClosableStream.Close() at System.Net.Mail.MailWriter.Close() at System.Net.Mail.SmtpClient.Send(MailMessage message) Our SMTP configuration is: Limit message size: 2048k Limit session size: 20240k Limit # of messages per connection: 20 Limit # of recipients per message: 100 Is it as simple as adjusting the session size? If so, what is recommended? Should we just uncheck limit session size? I don't claim to be an expert with SMTP setups, but if I can eliminate these error messages, that would seem like a step forward. Thanks Jim
