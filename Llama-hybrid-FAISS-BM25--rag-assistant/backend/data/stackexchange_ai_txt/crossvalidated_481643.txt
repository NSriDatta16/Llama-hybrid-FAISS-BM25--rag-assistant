Correlation between principal components and external variables

Given an input dataframe with n features, and s samples, where we perform a PCA such that we then represent samples in a 1 Principal Component axis (a simplified case of this example ). I am then interested in seeing how correlated is each PC with a given external (sample-associated) variable, either categorical cat_var or numerical num_var . Empirically, it would seem to me that this would be a matter of computing the correlation (or regression) between the PC1 projected values of a sample and those of cat_var and num_var . import numpy as np pc1 = [-2.3, -1.5, -0.3, ... , 0.3, 1.5] num_var = [ 12, 15, 8, ... , 3, 4] cat_var = [ 3, 1, 2, ... , 1, 2] #encoded as integers my_corr=np.corrcoef(pc1, num_var) my_corr2=np.corrcoef(pc1, cat_var) Does this make sense? Am I missing anything in here?
