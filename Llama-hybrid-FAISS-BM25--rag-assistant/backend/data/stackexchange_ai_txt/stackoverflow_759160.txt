How to move a Grid Panel in WPF Window

HI, How do I move (drag) a Grid Panel inside a WPF Window? The Grid Panel does not have a Position or Location or X and Y coordinate porperty. All I am looking at is to move the Grid Panel from its current location to a new location using Mouse so that the controls that are "burried" underneath it will show up. Any pointers? Many Thanks.
