Can you use regression to predict values if you imputed data using MICE?

I used multiple imputation on a data set that had some missing values (I had to do this as the sample size was low so I couldn't just exclude the NAs). I know you can do *read in dataset* d But are you able to extract predicted values from this model? For example I want the probabilities of individuals being in the control or treatment condition. Normally this would be done like predict(fit, d, type = 'response') However I can't seem to make this work. Could I do a prediction for each dataset and average the predicted values? For example: d And do this for all datasets then take an average of the predicted values. Or would this logic be flawed and is there any other way to do it?
