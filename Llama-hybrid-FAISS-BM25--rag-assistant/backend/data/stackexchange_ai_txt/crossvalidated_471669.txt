I think your approach to the problem is not bad, but there are some ways you could get more information about the data, and maybe better results: 1. I wouldn't get average environmental and economic scores per county, it can be a very bad idea: 1.a. Average is a measurement of central tendency that gets the central point between the highest and lowest value you got on a certain distribution. Knowing that, given the most of cases you won't have symmetric distributions, average can be a very bad measurement of central tendency, and if you use it without a dispersion measurement (variance) you will be also sending a big part of the variability of your data to trash, so, doubly bad. 1.b. Variability of data (variance) is VERY IMPORTANT for modelling. If you use average scores per county, you will be "killing" that variability between farms, and with that, you will be losing a lot of richness of your data (...and the effort to gather that information too). Generally , more observations = more variance = better (more realistic/reliable) models. 1.c. Solution proposed: I would use scores PER FARM. Try to visualize your data with a scatterplot like the one you sent, but PER FARM (237 observations = 237 points), not by county (only 23 observations), and try to understand its morphology. 2. How to know if there is some clustering of variance by county: If you want (or need) to know the influence of counties, you could get that information performing a linear mixed effects model (LMM), using the variable "county" as a random effect variable. If your intraclass correlation (ICC) results different than zero, so a LMM it's the way. If you don't want or need that information or if the ICC is not different than zero, so you could go ahead with a classical linear model. If you finally determine to use a LMM, be careful with its interpretation as it can be a little tricky if you are not used to them. 3. Check if you are able to perform a linear model with your data : Have you checked if your data satisfy the statistical assumptions of a linear model (i.e: homoscedasticity, etc)? Having a look on your plot, I can advert that there is a high probability that you aren't accomplishing them. 4. Try to better model your data after understanding the morphology of your scatterplot : As you are comparing numeric variables, you can get a lot of visual information with the scatterplot for better modelling. Visually, a straight line doesn't fit well the variance of your dots, so probably there isn't a straight linear relationship between economic and environmental scores. Looking at your data, maybe there is an hyperbolic relationship (I'm just guessing here), so you could try with a quadratic term on your regression equation. Useful references: -de Rey, C. C. M.
