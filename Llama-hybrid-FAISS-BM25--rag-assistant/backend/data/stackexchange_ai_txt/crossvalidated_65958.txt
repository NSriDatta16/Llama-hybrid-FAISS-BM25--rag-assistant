I think you have this muddled up. (i) The Kolmogorov Smirnov test is designed to test continuous, not discrete distributions; indeed, your values consist only of 0's and 1's, yet it appears you're testing against continuous uniformity. (ii) as written, it looks like this is completely ignoring the time order. It's not testing what you need to pick up. You could perhaps use as your data the fraction (considered as a quantile) of the distance through the series that the 1's occur at (it's not continuous independent data though - it only occurs at discrete places, only one value per location -- so you'd still need to adjust your null distribution for that). It wouldn't be a KS test as such, but you could use a statistic like the KS as the basis for a test. For example, if there are $n$ observations, the $i$-th observation might be said to occur at the $\frac{i-\alpha}{n+1-2\alpha}$ quantile for some $0\leq\alpha\leq 1$ (I believe many of the 9 alternatives in R's own quantile function correspond to that definition with various values of $\alpha$). You can then test whether the quantiles of the 1's are uniformly distributed, but you'd need to simulate to get the distribution of the test statistic under the null. An easy alternative to simulation of the null distribution (presumably conditioning on the counts of 0s and 1's) would be to do a permutation test. (Which will involve either clever algorithms to do do the full distribution, or sampling of the permutation distribution. However, it seems as if you're really after a test for trend. Indeed, you might do better with something as simple as a logistic regression against position, or even a monotonic GAM-type model (again, probably via logistic-regression). Edit: Here's the previously suggested logistic regression performed in R: x Here's the output of the model (a few less interesting lines removed): Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 2.77412 1.01415 2.735 0.00623 t -0.15912 0.05225 -3.046 0.00232 # The p-value for the glm fit is $0.00232$. It shows that the probability of a 1 is not consistent with the 1's being randomly placed with respect to the ordering variable. Since the coefficient is negative, the probability of a 1 is overall decreasing as the position increases. Here's the plot:
