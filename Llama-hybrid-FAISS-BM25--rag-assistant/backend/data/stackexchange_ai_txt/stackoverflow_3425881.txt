The lead developer should listen to the DBA. "SELECT *" is bad. And from the bullet points about the lead developer it sounds like you've got a familiar uphill battle. Sometimes the path of least resistance in that situation is to implement something using an ORM (such as NHibernate) and schedule some kind of demonstration to the team. Encourage their input, specially from the lead developer and the DBA and any other nay-sayers. They might have legitimate gripes that can actually be solved with the tool as you learn more about it. On the other hand, they might just be dead-set against it for no good logical reason. If that's the case, it's best to find that out because it could very well mean that there is no winning this argument against them, because they're not really debating.
