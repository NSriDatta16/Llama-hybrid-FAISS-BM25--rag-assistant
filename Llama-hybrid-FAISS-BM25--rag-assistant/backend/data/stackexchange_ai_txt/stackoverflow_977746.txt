beforeSubmit: mcargando("#cargando2"), Should be: beforeSubmit: function() { mcargando("#cargando2") }, And success: ocargando("#cargando2") Should be: success: function() { ocargando("#cargando2") } As you have it right now, you are calling the functions. The only way you could use the code you have there without calling the function is if you did beforeSubmit: mcargando, but since you need to pass a variable to the function just wrap the call in a function to be able to do it and you should be fine.
