Yes, you could probably stuff a few million items in an array if you wanted to, and the Flash player wouldn't yell at you. But do you really want to? Is the application going to take longer to start if it has to download the entire database locally before being able to work? If the additional time needed to download that much data isn't significant, are a few database lookups really worth optimizing? If you have a good use case to do this, you're going to have to pay attention to the way you use those data structures. Looping over the array to find an item is going to be a bit slow, so you'll want to create indexes locally, most likely by using a few hash structures. The more flexible you allow the search queries to be, the more interesting the indexing issues will be.
