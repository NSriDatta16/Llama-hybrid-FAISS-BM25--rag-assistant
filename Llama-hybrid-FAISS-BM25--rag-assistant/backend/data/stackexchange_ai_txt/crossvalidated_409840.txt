student attendance prediction

Let's say I wanted to be able to predict, from game to game, what the total student attendance would be at an average college football game, where would I even begin? I would have access to historical attendance figures, would be able to recreate which games were day games and which were night games, would be able to tell you if it was sunny or rainy, which game was homecoming, etc. (all variables that might impact attendance). I'd be able to track percentage increase/decline from one game to the next from any past season. Where would you take this if you were me?
