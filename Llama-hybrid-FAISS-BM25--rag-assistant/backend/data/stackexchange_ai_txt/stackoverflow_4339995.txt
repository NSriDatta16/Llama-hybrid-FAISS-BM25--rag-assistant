Profile java parallel/sequential sorting

Does anyone know good way to profile a sorting algorithm in java(sequential and fork join) ? because the running time is too short (sorting list size 5000..), System.nanoTime() seems not work properly. I plan to run same test case many times (1000) and get rid of first 100 results (avoid HotSpot compiler problem) and do an average of running time using System.nanoTime(). Any suggestion on this ? Thanks a lot! Can I do this way ? double count = 0; double start, end; for(int r = 0; r
