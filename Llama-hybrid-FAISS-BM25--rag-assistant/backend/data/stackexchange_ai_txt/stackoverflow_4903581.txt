Tool or Package For Designing Site For a Small Non-Profit Accepting Donations

I deal primarily with custom .net WebForms and MVC based applications, but someone came to me and asked for help with creating a small website for their non-profit organization for which they will need to be able to accept donations. My preference would be to use a simple CMS, and I have heard of Shopify and the Shop Plugin for WordPress, but they really don't need that level of e-commerce. Basically what I am looking for is some advice for using a simple mini-CMS, be it WordPress, Squarespace, etc, and integrating some method for accepting and keeping track of donations. My initial thought was to use WordPress and then link to Paypal.
