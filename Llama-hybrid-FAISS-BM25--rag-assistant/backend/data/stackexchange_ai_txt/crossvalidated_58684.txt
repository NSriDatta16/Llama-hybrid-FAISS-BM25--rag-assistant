Regularized logistic regression and support vector machine

L2 regularized logistic regression differs with L2 regularized support vector machine with their loss function. Are there more deep differences for these two models? I tried several data sets, and found L2 regularized logistic regression are always better than L2 regulared support vector machine. Are there any references/researches for discussion their differences in terms of classification performance?
