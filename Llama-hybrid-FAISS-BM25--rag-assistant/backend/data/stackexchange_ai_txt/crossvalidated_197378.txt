Actually, the tuning parameter $C$ in SVM is defined as following, $$C\sum_i^{n}\xi_i $$ As Jesus Herranz Valera mentioned, this parameter can be determined by Cross Validation. In your model, you actually define the more general parameter C, $$\sum_i^n C_i \xi_i $$ It means that you assign different weights to the training data, if you define $C_i = C$ those two model wii be the same. SVM: Weighted samples provides the package to train the model. If you already know which data are important to your model or the weight for your training data, this this model will be pretty useful. Since you have n parameters, I don't think Cross-Validation can help you to determine those parameter (too many parameters). One reasonable solution is that you can define the specific weight for data and train following SVM model. $$\sum_i^n C_i \xi_i + \lambda J(f) $$ Then using Cross Validation to determine the $\lambda$ instead of $C$. And the definition of $C$ should depend on the pattern of your datasets.
