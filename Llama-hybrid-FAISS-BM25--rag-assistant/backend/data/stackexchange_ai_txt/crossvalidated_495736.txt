This problem can be simplified to the point of admitting an easy solution. Use this as a guide when working through the Markov Chain calculations to check your work. Let $p_s$ be the chance of ending up at $\alpha$ when starting at vertex $s.$ We need to find $p_0.$ Since inevitably the caterpillar will wind up glued (prove this!), $1-p_s$ is its chance of ending up at $\beta.$ From the symmetries of the cube notice that $$p_0 = 1-p_3;\quad p_1=p_5=1-p_2=1-p_4.$$ Since $p_\alpha=1$ and $p_\beta=0,$ that leaves us needing find just two quantities; say, $p_0$ and $p_1.$ Only three moves are possible from $0,$ each with equal probability to states $1,3,$ and $5.$ Therefore (state this rigorously in terms of conditional probability!) $$p_0 = \left(p_1+p_3+p_5\right)/3 = \left(p_1+1-p_0+p_1\right)/3 = (1-p_0+2p_1)/3,$$ permitting us to express $p_1$ in terms of $p_0,$ $$p_1 = (4p_0-1)/2.$$ From state $1$ there are three equiprobable moves to states $0, 2,$ and $\alpha,$ whence $$p_1 = (p_0+p_2+p_\alpha)/3 = (p_0 + 1-p_1 + 1)/3.$$ In conjunction with the antecedent equation this gives the unique solution $$p_0 = 4/7.$$ The full solution can now be directly computed from the foregoing as $$(p_0,p_1,p_2,p_3,p_4,p_5,p_\alpha,p_\beta) = (8, 9, 5, 6, 5, 9, 14, 0)/14.$$
