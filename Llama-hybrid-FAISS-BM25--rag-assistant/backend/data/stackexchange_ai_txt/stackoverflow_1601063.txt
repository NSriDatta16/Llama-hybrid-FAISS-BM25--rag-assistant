Wicket is designed to encourage the development of reusable Components. Consider the three different Classes as different components you'll want to use in different pages of your application with entirely different behaviour and content. Say Tab1 for contact information, Tab2 for a map and Tab3 for pictures. You really wouldn't want to create a Swiss-Army-Knife-Panel to manage all of those different purposes. So different panel-classes are used in the example. Admittedly the example doesn't use the best values - but it might be a better idea if you start with the general principles of wicket (take special care in learning how working with models works) rather than with these special components from the wicket-extension package.
