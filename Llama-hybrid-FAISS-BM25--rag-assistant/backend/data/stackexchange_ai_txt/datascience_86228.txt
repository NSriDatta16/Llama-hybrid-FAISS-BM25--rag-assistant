Model to detect specific semantic content without labeled data

I want to build a model that can detect sentences that discuss requests for communication - like 'email me', 'phone us', 'contact us', etc. However, I do not have any labeled data which I can use to simply train a neural network. How can I go about solving this problem? On way I was thinking was to create an initial labeled dataset by detecting above mentioned phrases. But I am not sure how to generalize and detect sentences expressing the similar sentiment using some other phrase not in my list. I am open to any other ideas as well. Thank you.
