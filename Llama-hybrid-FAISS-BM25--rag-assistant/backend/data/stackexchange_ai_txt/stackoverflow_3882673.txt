Assuming you don't want an associative array as your question doesn't mention it. This is the elegant syntax PHP makes available: Output: Array ( [0] => Array ( [0] => wine [1] => red ) [1] => Array ( [0] => cheese [1] => yellow ) [2] => Array ( [0] => apple [1] => green ) [3] => Array ( [0] => pear [1] => brown ) ) To loop over access all the 0's: for($x = 0; $x Alternatively for($colors as $couple){ echo $couple[0]; } EDIT: It seems like you actually could be better of with an associative though.. $colors = array("wine" => "red", "cheese" => "yellow", "apple" => "green", "pear" => "brown"); Cause you can still access the keys, as such: for($colors as $key => $value){ echo $key . " is " . $value; }
