Because we are dealing with circular GLM's, the interpretation is not exactly as you expect it to be coming from linear GLM's. The link function here is the arctangent function (specifically atan2 ), and each coefficient is about the slope at the midpoint of that link function, which is at the 0 value of the predictor. By the way, this means that the model changes if you change the mean of the predictor, so often, standardization is recommended (looking at the predictions, it seems likely that you did not standardize yet). Either way, the correct interpretation of the current model is: 'At dist zero, the slope of the counter-clockwise change of the direction of animal activity is -0.1113824' when starting at the intercept at -0.1099459. If you don't mind a frequentist interpretation of the Bayesian Confidence Interval, you could add that: 'zero is not in the confidence interval, so there is a significant effect of distance on direction of animal activity' . If I understand your context correctly, you can replace 'direction of animal activity' with 'time of the day that animal activity occurs' in the above interpretations. Second, the predicted values seem correct, as they are the same when the inputs are the same. Often, if the directions are somewhat close together, the resulting predictions will fall mostly on the same range of the circle, around the mean direction of the observations, which in your case seems to be around midday. Third, @whuber is correct that it's the residuals which should be von Mises-distributed, which is by the way what circGLM assumes as well. However, this matches with your approach, where you reject von Mises on the data without a predictor, but are still able to use the GLM. It's probably not a perfect fit on the residuals either, but the problems that generates are often not severe, while the complexity of relaxing that assumption is quite large. Hence, I think the GLM model could be a good fit for your problem. Lastly, make sure to have a look at the plots generated by this package, using plot(model) for example. See ?plot.circGLM for more, as this should help the interpretation, especially plot(model, type='predict') . Full disclosure: I wrote this package.
