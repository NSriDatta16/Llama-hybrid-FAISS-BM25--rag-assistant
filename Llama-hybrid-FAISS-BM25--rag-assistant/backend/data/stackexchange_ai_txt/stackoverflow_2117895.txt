Jquery ui, joomla and safari problem

I have a jquery ui slider in place which scrolls the content of a div when moved, here's the code: var paraHeight = $("#descPara").height(); var maxScroll = paraHeight - 250; var activeScroll; if (maxScroll This works fine in Firefox but not in Safari/Chrome. What happens in Safari and Chrome is, the handle of the slider when the page loads is non existent until you click on the slider rail and when it does appear it cannot be dragged, hower you can still scroll by clicking along the slider rail. This problem however is only apparent when used in the cms joomla, outside of this cms it works perfectly in all browsers. Weird. Has anyone had any similar problems? it would be really helpful, thanks.
