Implementing the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) Using PyKalman

I'm trying to use pykalman to do a Kalman filter on financial data and it seems to be generally working very well. However, when I attempt to extend the code using BIC $\mathrm{BIC} = {-2 \cdot \ln{\hat L} + k \cdot \ln(n)}$ I'm having trouble getting reasonable results. The KalmanFilter class has a method called loglikelihood which I thought would calculate $\ln{\hat L}$; however, I looked into the code a bit and it seems to running the filter agai,n which is a bit odd. I'm not sure if I'm passing the correct data which might be the issue. I'm passing the observations resulting from the Kalman smoother calculated parameters $(\alpha, \beta)$ $\alpha + \beta r_m$ Is that correct? Any insight/examples on implementing BIC using pykalman?
