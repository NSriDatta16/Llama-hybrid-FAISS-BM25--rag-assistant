sum product algorithm and Convolution Neural Network

I'm trying to understand the sum-product algorithm implemented using Convolution Neural Network by the paper [1,2] to solve the problem of human pose estimation. Human pose estimation is formulated using a graph G=(V, E) where V specify the body part position. E indicate spatial relationship between parts. The sum-product algorithm is expressed below $m_{ij}(x_i) \leftarrow \sum{_{x_i}}(u_i(x_i) + \psi(x_i,x_j))$ (1) $u_i(x_i) \leftarrow \phi(x_i) + \sum_{k \in N(i)}m_{ki}(x_i,x_j))$ (2) In above equations $u_i(x_i)$ is the belief of part i. $\phi(x_i)$ is the appearance term obtained from CNN $m_{ij}(x_i)$ is the message from part i to part j The $m_{ij}(x_i)$ in equation (1) is implemented by passing $u_i(x_i)$ to conv and relu layer as shown in the figure . I didn't understand how conv and relu can function like this. Reference [1] X. Chu, W. Ouyang, H. Li, and X.
