predicting x,y position using machine learning

I am trying to predict the position (x,y) of a robot on a 2D plane or even 3D(UAV). I have multiple sensors which might have noise (most probably they do), and i have 16 features, which are sensor values. I would like to infer the position x,y of the robot given these sensor values I also have a set of data which contains the x,y position for the robot with their corresponding sensor values, so i am treating this as a supervised learning approach. Can anyone suggest a machine learning technique to approach such a problem. I can already do "good" using a sequential monte carlo (particle filter), but am curious to see what machine learning approach could be applied here. Should it be tackled as a "time series" problem, if so then what kind of algorithms would preform well with this multi-label prediction (2 output values x and y) I also believe it can not be a classification problem because then i would just have too many classes (based on the space where that the robot is moving in) and would then have to reduce classes and reduce resolution of position Also, it would be really good if anyone has any expertise on this and could explain if it should be treated as a regression or classification problem explaining why I guess this type of problem could be called "multi-target regression"
