The two most likely cuplrits are caching and indexing problems (unless of course you are using a clustered database, in which case that is probably the culprit). If it's feasible on your site (or on a dev environment, which I am sure you had the foresight to create), disable Magento's caching temporarily and see if that alleviates the issue. Also try disabling the flat_catalog settings to see if that is having an effect. Also make sure that your browser cache is set to always refresh from the server. Hope that helps! Thanks, Joe
