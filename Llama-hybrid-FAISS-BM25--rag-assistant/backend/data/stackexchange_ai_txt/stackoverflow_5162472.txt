Have a look at wheaties answer which is good advice. Regarding your code, you are trying to use found_user to access the security level. found_user is a boolean not a level. You should use your security variable. When trying to print the level information, use the security variable and check against the level, not the list containing the levels of the different users: if security == 1: print("Security level 1: You have little privelages. Congratulations.") elif security == 2: print("Security level 2: You have more than little privelages. Congratulations.") elif security == 3: print("Security level 3: You have average privelages. Congratulations.") elif security == 4: print("Security level 4: You have more than average privelages. Congratulations.") elif security == 5: print("Security level 5: You have wizard privelages. Congratulations.") else: print("Apparently you don't exist.") Or even levels_info = [ "Security level 1: You have little privelages. Congratulations.", "Security level 2: You have more than little privelages. Congratulations.", "Security level 3: You have average privelages. Congratulations.", "Security level 4: You have more than average privelages. Congratulations.", "Security level 5: You have wizard privelages. Congratulations." ] if security in levels_info: print levels_info[security] else print "Apparently you don't exist."
