According to the wikipedia page of Design by Contract , popular tools for this methodology with Java are: iContract2, Contract4J, jContractor, Jcontract, C4J, CodePro Analytix, STclass, Jass preprocessor, OVal with AspectJ, Java Modeling Language (JML), SpringContracts for the Spring framework, or Modern Jass, Custos using AspectJ,JavaDbC using AspectJ, JavaTESK using extension of Java. Reading up on one of those is probably a good idea. I have no personal experience of any of them but Pragmatic Programmer says good things about the original iContract so that might be a good place to start. You could always try doing it on your own by using Javas built-in assertions: assert Expression1; or assert Expression1 : Expression2 ; Where Expression1 results in a boolean and Expression2 is the value your testing (optional). Try it out.
