Holdout sample for multinomial logistic regression in SPSS

I am having a multiple categorical dependent variable and continuous independent variables. Via a multinomial logistic regression in SPSS I want to test whether the training sample makes good estimations for my validation sample. However, I do not understand how this can be tested in SPSS. I split the data into two parts (70%-30%), but I do not understand how to test the data output of the 70% sample on the 30% sample. I also tried a Bootstrap in SPSS but I cannot find exactly how this should be done in SPSS.
