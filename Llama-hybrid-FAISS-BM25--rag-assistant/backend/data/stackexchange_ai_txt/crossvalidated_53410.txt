Clustering quality: normalized mean square error or absolute error?

I have divided my data (a matrix of proximities expressed by cosines between 94 objects) into clusters with Ward hierarchical method, and I am very happy with the results from a visual point of view. However, I'd like to check whether the quality of the clusters is good. I've been told that for Ward method, statistics that can be good to check how good are the clusters are: cophenetic correlation coefficient, normalized mean square error, normalized mean absolute error. However, I don't know how to read them. I have a very low correlation coeff. (0.56) which sounds bad, since good correlations are averagely above .80. Then I have a 351.14 NMSE and a 17.24 NMAE. Is that bad? Is that good? How do I tell?
