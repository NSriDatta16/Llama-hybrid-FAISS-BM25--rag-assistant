I'm assuming that when you say in all html tags, that you mean all single quotes that contain an attribute. You wouldn't want converted b/c it would break the code. Any regular expression is going to be fragile. If you know your input will be a particular set of simple cases, you might be ok with a regex . Otherwise, you'll want a DOM parser that understands complex html markup like onmouseover="(function () { document.getElementById(''); alert(\"...\")...})()" (for example). Add to that an attribute can span multiple lines. ;) I haven't had to tackle this particular problem recently, but maybe there's a good way to do it with HTML Tidy (more here: http://devzone.zend.com/article/761 ) or a parser like this one http://sourceforge.net/projects/simplehtmldom/
