How to view the GDTR's value?

In the book "Rootkit Arsenal" page 84 (Chapter 3) mentions: ..., we can view the contents of the target machine's descriptor registers using the command with the 0x100 mask: kd> rM 0x100 and a paragraph below: Note that the same task can be accomplished by specifying the GDTR components explicitly: kd> r gdtr .... I run Windbg on my Win XP (inside VMWare) and choose the Kernel Debug -> Local. My problem is in case of first command, windbg errors with: lkd> rM 0x100 ^ Operation not supported in current debug session 'rM 0x100' and in the second command: lkd> r gdtr ^ Bad register error in 'r gdtr' Can anyone guide me ?
