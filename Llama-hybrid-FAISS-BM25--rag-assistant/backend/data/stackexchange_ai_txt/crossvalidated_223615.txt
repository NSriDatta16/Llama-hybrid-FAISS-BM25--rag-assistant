Interpreting random survival forest mortality

I'm trying to follow random survival forests . The ensemble mortality for $x_i$ is estimated by $ M_{e,i}=\sum_{j=1}^nH_e(T_j|x_i)$ . Which means - sum over all death/censor times j , and for each such time get the averaged ensemble estimation for $x_i$ in time $j$ . I think that this means that for each tree in the ensemble, we detect the terminal node h in which $x_i$ sits, and sum its CHF $H_h$ over all possible points in time. Under the conservation of events , this simply means sum the number of deaths in the terminal node of each tree in the ensemble! Is this correct? Is this is how its implemented in the R package? (can't read R for the life of me). If this is indeed so simple, why isn't it stated in the paper?
