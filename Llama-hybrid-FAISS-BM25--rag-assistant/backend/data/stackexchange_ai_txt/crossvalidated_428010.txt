How to check that quantile regression forests provide valid predictions?

I am using quantile regression forests to predict the distribution of a measure of performance in a medical context. I am using the ranger R package for that purpose. I would like to have advices about how to check that predictions are valid. If the objective is to predict the mean, any measure of OOB error or visual comparisons between OOB predictions and true values (see e.g. this plot ) are possible approaches to investigate the fit. However, what should be done to investigate the validity of quantile regression? Without a proper check, it is possible that quantile regression corresponds to the distribution of the answer $Y$ values without accounting for the predictor variables $X$ (which could be meaningful if $X$ conveys no information). It is also possible that random forests return quantiles that are poor prediction of the true conditional quantiles but I would like to check that.
