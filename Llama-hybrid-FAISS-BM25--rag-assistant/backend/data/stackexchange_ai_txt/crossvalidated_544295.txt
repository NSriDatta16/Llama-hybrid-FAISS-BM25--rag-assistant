Time Series Forecasting Process With Regard to Training and Test Sets

I'm a bit confused about the process order in doing proper time series analysis/forecasting. Is it: Stationary/seasonality checks, do any transformations required Candidate model selection using ACF, PACF, and auto.arima... using all data Split data into training and test Choose best model based off accuracy measures (RMSE...) and Information Criteria (AICc, BIC..) etc or: Stationary/seasonality checks, do any transformations required Split data into training and test Candidate model selection using ACF, PACF, and auto.arima... using just training data Choose best model based off accuracy measures (RMSE...) and Information Criteria (AICc, BIC..) etc Or neither. I've looked around for examples and read through textbooks but can't find a straight answer. First post so sorry if this isn't the kind of thing that should be asked here/if it was not asked correctly. Thanks!
