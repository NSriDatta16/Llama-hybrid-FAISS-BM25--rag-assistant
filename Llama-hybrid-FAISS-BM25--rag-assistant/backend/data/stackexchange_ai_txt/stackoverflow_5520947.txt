If you're not worried about security (and if this is a personal project then that's a valid assumption), then Python has several functions ( compile , exec , eval ) that can help here. Note that there are differences between Python 2 and Python 3, but the following example works for both: >>> s = "print('hello world')" >>> code = compile(s, " ", "exec") >>> exec(code) hello world If you're going to let other people use this bot, you will want to pay very careful attention to the functions you let people call. For example, most things in the os module have potential to do undesirable things in an irc bot context.
