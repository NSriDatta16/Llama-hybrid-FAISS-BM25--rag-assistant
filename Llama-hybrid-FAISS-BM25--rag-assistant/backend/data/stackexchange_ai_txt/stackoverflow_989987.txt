In cases like this, sometimes I will pass lambdas to the constructor: public class AutoAverage { public AutoAverage(Func sum, Func divide) { ... And in usage: var autoAverage = new AutoAverage((x, y) => x + y, (x, y) => x / y); // ... use it ... It's a bit ugly when you're doing binary operations like this (I've more often used it for single-argument functions, e.g. unit conversions), but it has the advantage of simplicity. Whether that's a good solution in your case will depend, among other things, on how often you construct AutoAverage. If you only create it one or two places (for each T), then passing the lambdas wouldn't be that bad. If you construct it a whole bunch of places, the lambdas would be duplicated too much for comfort.
