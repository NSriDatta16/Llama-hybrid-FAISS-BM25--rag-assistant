This doesn't really answer the question but may still be of some interest. The standard assumption of a two sample $t$ -test is that the conditional normal distribution of $X$ given a binary variable $Y$ , $$ X|Y=i \sim N(\mu_i,\sigma^2). $$ This together with the assumption that $Y \sim \operatorname{bernoulli}(p)$ marginally, implies that the conditional distribution of the binary variable $Y$ given $X=x$ is \begin{align} P(Y=1|X=x) &=\frac{f_{X|Y=1}(x)P(Y=1)}{\sum_{i=0}^1 f_{X|Y=i}(x)P(Y=i)} \\&=\frac{pe^{-\frac1{2\sigma^2}(x-\mu_1)^2}}{pe^{-\frac1{2\sigma^2}(x-\mu_1)^2} + (1-p)e^{-\frac1{2\sigma^2}(x-\mu_0)^2}} \\&=\frac1{1+\frac{1-p}pe^{-\frac1{2\sigma^2}(x-\mu_0)^2+\frac1{2\sigma^2}(x-\mu_1)^2}} \\&=\operatorname{logit}^{-1}(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x) \end{align} that is, a logistic regression model with intercept and slope \begin{align}\beta_0 &= \ln\frac p{1-p} -\frac1{2\sigma^2}(\mu_1^2-\mu_0^2) \\ \beta_1&=\frac1{\sigma^2}(\mu_1-\mu_0). \end{align} So in this sense the two conditional models are compatible. Such compatibility is desirable for example in multiple imputation by chained equations (MICE) methods. Also see exercise 5.1 b and c in Agresti 2015 .
