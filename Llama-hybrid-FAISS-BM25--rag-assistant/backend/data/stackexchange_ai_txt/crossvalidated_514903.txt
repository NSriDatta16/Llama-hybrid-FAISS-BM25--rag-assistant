Can I use the na_kalman function in R (imputeTS) to replace missing data in a bivariate time series if the function is applied to only one series?

I am doing a bivariate time series analysis. There is missing data in one of the series (approximately 5% of the data ist missing). Is it appropriate to use the na_kalman function i R (package: imputeTS) for univariate time series imputation for the series with the missing values or do I have to apply a method for multivariate time series imputation?
