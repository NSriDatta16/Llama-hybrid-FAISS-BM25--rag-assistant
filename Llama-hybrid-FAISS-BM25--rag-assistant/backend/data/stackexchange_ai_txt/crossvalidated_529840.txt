The dimensionality is not a problem in itself (30 is not that high), but multimodality might very well pose a problem if you have significantly peaked and separate modes. When you propose new states from the same distribution every time it is typically called independence MCMC, as there is no past dependence on the trajectory of the chain. The problem is for this to work the proposal distribution has to have meaningful support across every region where $\pi$ has mass. It is very likely that unless you significantly increase your standard deviation for your proposal distribution you will only ever see a very small part of the space where $\pi$ is defined. This will clearly give you a very small standard deviation as every value will be close to the MAP. In general, your idea is not very useful as there is little benefit from localising yourself completely. I'd rather use gradients, or if your problem is significantly multimodal, a tempered SMC sampler (depending on the cost of evaluating your density, as you will need many particles.)
