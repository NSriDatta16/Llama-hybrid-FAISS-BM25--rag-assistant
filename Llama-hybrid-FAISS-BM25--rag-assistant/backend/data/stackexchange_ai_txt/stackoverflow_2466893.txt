Csharp component which generates fragments with highlights for diffs for 2 strings

I need C# implementation ( ideally open source ) which is similar to Delphi DLL. I am currently using the wrapper ( C# syntax is provided , but it is a call from a different language ) zdiff( string ref str1, string ref str2, int range , int trim ) it calls inside str1 = GetHiDiff(@str1,1,trim) str2 = GetHiDiff(@str1,2,trim) where function GetHiDiff(s:pchar; sIndex:integer; wtrim:integer): pchar; stdcall; What it does it returns a left fragment html of str1 and a right html fragment of str2 with diffs highlighted as strings are passed by reference. Range parameter determines the size of html fragment. Not sure what trim > 0 does.
