Yes, interval is acceptable if you are willing to assume the difference between every increment is the same. (Though nitpickers will say it should be "ratio" because the 0 is a true zero, representing none.) In some cases, this assumption may be useful, in some other not so. For instance, researchers who collaborate with each other may have a non-linear improvement in some outcome (e.g. time spent on lab meeting, or number of grants, etc.) According to this complexity there can be implication on how to model this particular variable. Particular attention should be put at the last option. Is it "3" or "3 or more?" The first one may prompt people to think what happens if you have 4 or more collaborations? And the second one will make your variable more of with ordinal nature than interval/ratio, because the difference between "2" and "3 or more" is not 1 anymore.
