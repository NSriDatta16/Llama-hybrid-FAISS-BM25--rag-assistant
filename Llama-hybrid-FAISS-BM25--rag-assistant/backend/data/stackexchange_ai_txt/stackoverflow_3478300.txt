UML Tool for JavaEE-applications, with good Annotation/EJB-support

I'm looking for a good UML tool (free or at least available as a Trial, availability as an Eclipse- or Netbeans-plugin would also be nice) to visualize the class hierarchy (doesn't have to be strict UML) inside an JavaEE-application. It should have a decent EJB/annotation support (most important feature). I googled around and found this screenshot: link which is what close to what i want, but i can't find out how the tool used for this screenshot is called. Anyone knows how the tool on this screenshot is called? What tools do experienced EJB-developers prefer to visualize their classes?
