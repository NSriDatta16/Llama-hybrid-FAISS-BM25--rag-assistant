What is the training score used for?

This is a pretty basic question. However, I read that the training score isn't useful in machine learning. From what I can tell, the training score only tells us if we have an overfit model. [E.g. if we have a training score of 100, something probably went wrong]. But are there any other reasons to need a training score?
