How to calculate change in Loss Function w.r.t Weights for a fully connected NN

I read the article Optimal Brain Damage by Yann LeCun, John S. Denker and Sara A. Solla where the authors discuss estimating the saliency of each weight of a neural network (which they define by the change in the loss function upon perturbing the weight). The larger the saliency, the more effect the weight has on the learning. Is there any code/API in Keras or Tensorflow to calculate such "weight saliency" for a simple fully connected neural network (with one or two hidden layers)?
