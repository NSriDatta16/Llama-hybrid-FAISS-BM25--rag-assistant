This is a classic problem of causal inference, where you are trying to estimate the effect of a treatment (in this case, the type of food) on an outcome (in this case, the amount of sleep), given that the treatment assignment was not random but based on a covariate (in this case, the amount of sleep prior to the test). One common approach to tackle this problem is using Propensity Score Matching (PSM). The idea is to estimate the probability of receiving the treatment given the covariates (this is the propensity score), and then match each treated individual with a control individual with a similar propensity score. The difference in outcomes between the matched pairs is then an estimate of the treatment effect. Here are the steps you could follow: Estimate the propensity score: You can use a logistic regression where the dependent variable is the treatment assignment (type of food) and the independent variables are the covariates (including the amount of sleep prior to the test). Match each treated individual with a control individual with a similar propensity score: There are different methods to do this matching (nearest neighbor, caliper matching, etc.). You can choose the one that best suits your data. Estimate the treatment effect: Calculate the difference in outcomes (amount of sleep after the test) between the matched pairs. This is your estimate of the treatment effect. Check the balance of your matched sample: You want to make sure that the distribution of the covariates is similar between the treated and control groups in your matched sample. If it's not, you may need to adjust your matching method or include more covariates in your propensity score model. Make your recommendation: Based on the estimated treatment effect, you can recommend the type of food that maximizes the amount of sleep (and also constrained so that the amount of energy does not decline). Remember that this method assumes that there are no unobserved confounders, i.e., there are no variables that affect both the treatment assignment and the outcome and that you have not included in your model. If this assumption is not met, your estimate of the treatment effect may be biased.
