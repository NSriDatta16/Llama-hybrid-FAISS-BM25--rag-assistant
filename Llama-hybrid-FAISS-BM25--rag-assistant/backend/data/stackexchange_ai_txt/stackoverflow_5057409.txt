libpcap on OSX - trying to use statistical mode

I'm trying to compile a C program that uses libpcap in statistical mode on OSX. The original code was written for Windows, using the winpcap library. The version of libpcap on my Mac has never heard of the pcap_setmode function that it uses - I've got a nasty feeling that it might be Windows-specific. Is there any way to capture in stats-mode on OSX? If not, is there something about the architecture/capabilities of the OS that prevents this, or is this an extra feature added to WinPcap which has never been a feature of the main library?
