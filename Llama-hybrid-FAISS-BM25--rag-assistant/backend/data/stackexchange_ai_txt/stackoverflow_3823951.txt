I assume you are using the emulator. You have to be patient; it takes a very long time to start up (several minutes.) You can start the emulator manually by going to the Window menu in Eclipse, selecting "the Android SDK and ADB manager," clicking on the emulator you created and then clicking on the Start button. Wait until you see the home screen. If necessary, unlock it by clicking and dragging the mouse down over the screen until it's unlocked. If you have access to a physical phone and USB cable, you will have a much better (faster) experience overall. Good luck!
