Here is a solution using the machinery of markov chains . The canonical form of a transition matrix with $r$ absorbing states and $t$ transient states is $$ \mathbb{P} = \pmatrix{\mathbf{Q} & \mathbf{R} \\ \mathbf{0} & \mathbf{I}} $$ where $\mathbf{I}$ is an $r\times r$ identity matrix, $\mathbf{0}$ is an $r\times t$ zero matrix, $\mathbf{R}$ is a nonzero $t\times r$ matrix and $\mathbf{Q}$ is a $t\times t$ matrix. Hence, the $4\times 4$ transition matrix of the four states "P1 turn", "P2 turn", "P1 wins", "P2 wins", in its canonical form is given by: $$\mathbb{P} = \pmatrix{0 & 3/10 & 7/10 & 0 \\ 7/10 & 0 & 0 & 3/10 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1}$$ The corresponding fundamental matrix is given by $\mathbf{N}=(\mathbf{I}_2 - \mathbf{Q})^{-1}$ . In our example: $$ \mathbf{N} = \pmatrix{100/79 & 30/79 \\ 70/79 & 100/79} $$ The expected number of steps to absorption when starting in transient state $i$ is the $i$ th entry of the vector $$ \mathbf{t} = \mathbf{N}\mathbf{1} $$ where $\mathbf{1}$ is a length- $t$ column vector with all $1$ s. Applied to our example: $$ \mathbf{t} = \pmatrix{100/79 & 30/79 \\ 70/79 & 100/79}\pmatrix{1 \\ 1} = \pmatrix{130/79 \\ 170/79} \approx \pmatrix{1.646 \\ 2.152} $$ Hence, if player 1 starts, the expected number of tosses until a win is roughly $1.65$ and if player 2 starts, the expected number of tosses is roughly $2.15$ . We can also get the variance on the number of tosses which is given by: $$ \left(2\mathbf{N} - \mathbf{I}_{2}\right)\mathbf{t} - \mathbf{t}\circ\mathbf{t} $$ where $\circ$ denotes the Hadamard product (element-wise product). For the example this evaluates to: $$ \pmatrix{9030/6241 \\ 9870/6241}\approx\pmatrix{1.447 \\ 1.581} $$
