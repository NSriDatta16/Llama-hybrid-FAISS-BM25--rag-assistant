How can I test the relevance between two interaction effects from two repeated measures ANOVAs?

To assess the impact of temperature and humidity on CPU performance, we conducted an experiment where we manipulated temperature and humidity levels. There were two within-subjects variables in the experiment: temperature (with high and low levels) and humidity (with high, medium, and low levels). We measured the performance of massive CPUs using two metrics: response speed and average speed of long-term calculations. Then we conducted two repeated measures ANOVAs (2x3) with response speed and average speed of long-term calculations as dependent variables. Both ANOVAs revealed significant interaction effects. I want to test to what extent these two indicators (response speed and average speed of long-term calculations) can be used interchangeably in detecting the interaction effects between temperature and humidity , in order to draw the conclusion that future research can use only one indicator to detect the interaction effect because it can predict the other indicator to a large extent. How can I do this? Any suggestions would be appreciated.
