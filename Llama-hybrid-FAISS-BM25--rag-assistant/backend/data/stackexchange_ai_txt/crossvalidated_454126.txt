Difference in joined or splitted random slopes in mixed model (lme4 notation)

I would like to understand better the consequences of formula syntax choices in lme4 package. Imagine I want to model outcome Y as a function of X1 and X2 = f(X1), with and without interaction, with a random slope at the Z level. f(X1) may be for example the log of X1. In my specific case X is Time and Z is Country. The intuition is that in some Country Z the effect of X1 is stronger while in other X2 is, so each country will have a mixture of two different functional forms of the effect of time. THe interaction allows for further changes in time since the effect is totally not stationary. I'm struggling to understand the statistical and interpretational differences of the subsequent models. Additive models: ~ X1 + X2 + (X1 + X2 | Z) ~ X1 + X2 + (X1 | Z) + (X2 | Z) ~ X1 + X2 + (1 | Z) + (0 + X1 | Z) + (0 + X2 | Z) The models 1 and 3 give similar results (but not identical) and fit well the observed data, while the 2 shows predictions that are above or below the data for some countries. I guess that this happens because it creates 2 random intercepts that shrink strongly the prediction average towards a global average? Interaction models: ~ X1 + X2 + (X1 * X2 | Z) ~ X1 * X2 + (X1 * X2 | Z) ~ X1 + X2 + (1 | Z) + (0 + X1 | Z) + (0 + X2 | Z) + (0 + X1:X2 | Z) ~ X1 * X2 + (1 | Z) + (0 + X1 | Z) + (0 + X2 | Z) + (0 + X1:X2 | Z) Model 3 has predictions that are very similar to the additive models while the others are all very influenced by changes in trends that happens later in time. But the similarity between the models between them and between the additive and the interaction models changes in every country and I cannot retrieve a robust pattern by intuition only without understanding the implication of the various notations. I can add that the models with the unsplitted random effects have a lower BIC score and that model 1 of the interaction model has the lowest BIC score.
