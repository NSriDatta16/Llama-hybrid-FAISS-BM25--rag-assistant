I have found this article helpful for analyzing split-plots in R: http://personal.psu.edu/mar36/stat_461/split_plot/ Based on comments from your question on stack overflow, "Seeds were collected from plants along three independent transects and within each transects from different sublocations." I would consider the "Location" variable as repeats or subsample from each Transect and not include it as a factor in the model. It ensure the error is calculated correctly, I would average each group of repeats/subsamples together and then perform the anova. #in Base R res.good Without running this on sample data, it is difficult to know if the degree of freedom works out correctly. I'll welcome any comments or corrections. Good luck
