To develop intuition for the Poisson distribution, it helps to consider the special case where there is an average of exactly 1 event per unit time. Use the Poisson distribution directly rather than thinking about exponential distributions of inter-arrival times. If you plug in to the formula, you will find that the probability of no event in 1 unit of time is $1/e\approx 0.37$. So the probability of at least 1 event in 1 unit of time is approximately 1-0.37, or 0.63. In this special case, the probability of having exactly 1 event in 1 unit of time is also $1/e$. The probability of having exactly 2 events in 1 unit of time is one half of the probability of having exactly 1 event, the probability of having exactly 3 events in 1 unit of time is one-third of the probability of having exactly 2 events, and so on. Some people find it useful to re-define time units so that there is exactly 1 event on average per re-defined time unit. So for part (a), you could define a "train-time unit" (TTU) as the 2.4 minutes that correspond to 25 trains per hour. Then the question about 6 minutes becomes one about 2.5 TTU. For part (a), the probability of no train in any 1 TTU is about 0.37. Events and time periods are independent, so the probability of no trains at all in 2 TTU is about $0.37^2$, and $0.37^3$ for no trains in 3 TTU, etc. You will see that this approach with 2.5 TTU gives an answer like the one you got for part (a) with the exponential distribution, except perhaps for some rounding difference. For part (b), check your calculations. It's easy to miss a minus sign, as I think you have done somewhere in your calculation. For a close estimate to check your work, note that a 40% chance of no train is very close to the $1/e$ chance of no event in 1 time unit if there is on average 1 event per time unit. (My guess is that this approximation was how your instructor expected you to approach this problem, although the exponential distribution of inter-arrival times also works.) For parts (c) and (d), you are now working with a situation where there is on average 1 event per hour. The hints in the first 2 paragraphs here should suffice. For looking forward to tests or other applications, note that instead of using events per unit time you can use the same approach for events per unit length on a line, per unit area (as famously represented in the novel Gravity's Rainbow ), or, as my laboratory is presently doing, events per unit volume, where dispensing cells from a liquid suspension into multiple wells, at an average of one cell per well, means about 37% empty wells, 37% wells with exactly 1 cell, and 26% of wells with more than one. Also, don't forget that all this is based on knowing that the distributions really are Poisson. In the real world, if trains are trying to meet a fixed schedule, for example, then they won't be.
