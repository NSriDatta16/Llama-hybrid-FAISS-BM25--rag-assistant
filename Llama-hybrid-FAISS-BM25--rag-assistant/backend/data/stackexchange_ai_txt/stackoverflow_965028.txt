Can someone describe the component-based paradigm in java web programming?

I am trying to learn java web programming. I come from a perl scripting background and know very little Java, much less JSF/Seam/EJB3.0. I've made a LOT of progress in this very steep learning curve, but there are some large conceptual issues that I think are hampering me a bit. Lately I've turned my attention to learning JSF. Usually discussions of JSF include a description of component-based web programming, but seem to assume one has experience with the other paradigms of web programming. I would be interested to see a fuller discussion of this component-based paradigm in the context of other paradigms. Can someone explain? Thanks in advance for your thoughts. TDR
