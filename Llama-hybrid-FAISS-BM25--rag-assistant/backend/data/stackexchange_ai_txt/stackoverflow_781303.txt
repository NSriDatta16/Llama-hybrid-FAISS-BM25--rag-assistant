I'm wondering why this isn't in XML, and then you could leverage off the available XML tooling. I'm thinking particularly of SAX, in which case you could easily parse/process this without holding it all in memory. So can you convert this to XML ? If you can't, and you need a parser, then take a look at JavaCC
