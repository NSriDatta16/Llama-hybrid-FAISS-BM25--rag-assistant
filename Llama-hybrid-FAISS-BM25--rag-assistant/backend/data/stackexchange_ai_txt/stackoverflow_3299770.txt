It seems you are looking for Computer Algebra System (CAS) in Haskell. Inspite of so many references to algebraic objects in the names of Haskell packages/modules, I've never heard of a general purpose and well-maintained CA system in Haskell (like SymPy or Sage in Python). However in the list of Computer Algebra Systems on Wikipedia I've found a reference to DoCon. The Algebraic Domain Constructor It uses a non-standard license , but I dare say it is still Open Source (though with rename and attribution requirements). As of July 2010 docon-2.11 still builds with GHC 6.12.1 and runs demos/tests (I only had to insert a LANGUAGE FlexibleContexts pragma in one file of the demo). DoCon is well documented (362 pages of the Manual). Its Manual is packed inside of the zip with sources, so I put it online separately for convenience: DoCon 2.11 Manual.ps Please look through to check if it suits your needs.
