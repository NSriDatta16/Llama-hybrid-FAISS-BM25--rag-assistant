How do I organise my libraries in sub-directories in a web application project

I am working on a huge web-application with hundreds of dependencies (jar files). I want to organise the jars in sensible way as each piece of software comes with its bunch of jar files and when I want to remove or upgrade version of that software it will be easier to do if kept in sub directories. Problem is that when using a web-server (I'm using tomcat), all libs need to be under WEB-INF/lib folder, you cannot create subdirectories otherwise it doesn't load the jars in subdirectories. Thanks.
