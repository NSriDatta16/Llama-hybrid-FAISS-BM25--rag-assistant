Alright, after marinating the answers and comments for a bit, I think I have come to a conclusion that the Signal class I borrowed from AS3, has very little reason for existence in Objective-C/Cocoa. There are several patterns in Cocoa that cover the ranges of use that I was thinking of covering with the Signal class. This might seem very trivial to more experienced Cocoa developers, but it for me it was hard to get the spectrum complete. I've tried to put it down fairly concisely, but please correct me if I have them wrong. Target-Action Used only for notifying your application of user interaction (touches, mostly). From what I've seen and read, there's no way to 'borrow' the target-action system for your own use KVO (key value observing) Very useful for receiving notifications when values change in accessible objects. Not so useful for notifying specific events that have no value attached to them, like timer events or interface followup events. NSNotification Very useful for receiving notifications when values change or other events happen in less-accessible objects. Due to the broadcast nature of the notification center, this is less suitable for cases where objects have a direct reference to another. Delegation Takes the most lines of code compared to the other three, but is also most suitable when the other three are not. Use this one when one object should be notified of specific events in the other. Delegates should not be abused for just accessing methods of the owner object. Stick to methods like 'should', 'will' and 'did'. Signal It was a fun experiment, but I mostly used this for classic delegation situations. I also used it to circumvent linked delegates (c delegate of b, b delegate of a, where a starts the event that should make it to c) without wanting to resort to NSNotification. I still think there should be a more elegant solution for this edge case, but for now I'll just stick to the existing frameworks. If anyone has a correction or another notification concept, please let me know. Thanks for your help!
