Use concrete (mutable) types and give DCS what it wants. It works well for me (I usually only specify concrete types in DataContractSerializable classes). The entire approach of generic serialization is a wash and comes with cavaets -- pick your battles. Alternatively, use another approach such as ISerializable (uhg).
