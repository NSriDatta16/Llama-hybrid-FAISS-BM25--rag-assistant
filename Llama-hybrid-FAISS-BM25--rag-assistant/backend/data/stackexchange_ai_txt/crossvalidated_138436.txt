Why is my average CTR different from my overall CTR?

Here's some sample data: Views Clicks CTR 13958 104 0.75% 215395 1091 0.51% 809432 2975 0.37% 1229979 3675 0.30% 1821167 4255 0.23% 2191041 5039 0.23% 2338723 4033 0.17% 2429408 4140 0.17% 2397012 4006 0.17% Total views is: 13,446,115 Total clicks is: 29,318 Therefore I have an overall clickthrough rate of 0.21% However, the average of all the clickthroughs in the table is: 0.32% Why are the two so different? Shouldn't they be the same?
