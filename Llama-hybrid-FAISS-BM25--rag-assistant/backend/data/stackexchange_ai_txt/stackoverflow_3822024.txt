Are new HTML5 elements like and pointless?

Don't kill me just yet, I'm asking out of pure curiosity. Elements like , , , etc all seem completely pointless. Sure they make everything have its own little place (and seo'd)... but it is possible to over-organize things. There are some cases where things don't fit in any of the categories too. It also increases time spent trying to code these things. I just don't see any real purpose for moving to add these new elements. What do we (developers and people who view the webpages alike) have to gain from adding them?
