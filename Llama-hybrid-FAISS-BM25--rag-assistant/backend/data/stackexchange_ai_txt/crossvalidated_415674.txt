Prediction Interval , Confidence Interval , Standard error

What is the relation between Confidence Interval and prediction interval and, standard error for a point estimate? Please explain with an example. As per my understanding, the standard error is a variation of point estimate (of a parameter) around the average estimation of the point estimate. This standard error is accounted in confidence intervals. And Prediction interval carries many such confidence intervals.
