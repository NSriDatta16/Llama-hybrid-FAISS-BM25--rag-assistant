No, you should not report $R^2$ for a logistic regression analysis. My thought is that this would be misleading because a "perfect fit" is anomalous in logistic regression and inference cannot be performed, plus a linear regression would still give you the "optimal" $R^2$ even when the distribution of the response is binary. While there are versions of $R^2$ statistics meant for analysis of categorical data, I disagree that these are somehow necessary or even useful for understanding the odds ratios themselves. The video specifically says; "The odds ratio - and the log odds ratio - are like the R^2 [in that] they indicate a relationship between two things ". Which... well, so does an OLS regression slope, a Pearson correlation, a Wilcoxon U-statistic, a covariance, a hazard ratio, a risk ratio, a risk difference, a harmonic mean difference, ... the list goes on. In fact, the comparison becomes more tenuous when you consider the problem of multivariate adjustment. In that case, the OR should be compared to a regression slope in a linear model because it summarizes a bivariate association in a multivariate projection whereas the $R^2$ is simply a bivariate association (note it relates the fitted values to the actual values irrespective of the individual components). The point of fitting a logistic regression is precisely to obtain odds ratios. To test a hypothesis of association between an exposure and a response, you can formulate a null hypothesis that the odds ratio is equal to 1. The inference that one performs on the odds ratio is powerful and robust. Just like with linear regression, the best way to understand an odds ratio is simply to present it and its 95% confidence interval. One can go further by simply tabulating the data is the analysis is largely categorical, or by plotting the continuous exposure versus the discrete response, and fitting a smoothed curve relating the mean response over time. This "S shaped" curve is precisely what logistic regression estimates. The odds ratio is the slope of that curve, with a value of 1 indicating a completely flat probability response and a value of $\infty$ indicating a step function.
