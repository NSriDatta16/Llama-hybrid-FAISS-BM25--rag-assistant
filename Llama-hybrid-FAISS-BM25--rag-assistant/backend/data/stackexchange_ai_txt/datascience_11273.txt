Is it ideally correct to benchmark neo4j as graph processing platform?

I would like to know if neo4j can be considered a graph processing platform, even though i know that: neo4j: is a graph database management system developed by Neo Technology, Inc. Described by its developers as an ACID-compliant transactional database with native graph storage and processing. graph processing platform: is a platform used for processing graphs, by applying global algorithms towards large graphs (used more in OLAP scenario). Based on this paper http://www.ds.ewi.tudelft.nl/~iosup/perf-eval-graph-proc14ipdps.pdf , neo4j is benchmarked as a processing platform. So my question is, if its correct to put neo4j in the group of processing platform like pregel and giraph.
