It depends. If You have the skill, knowledge and You are willing to learn new things ( lots of new things ) - You might give it a try. I was helping to develop django based web app, I created rather simple pylons project - but writing web apps and creating programs in languages such as C++ is two different things. Creating simple working example in Python takes little time - when I first switched to C++, it took hours, before my program would compile, run and do what it was meant to do. If You know languages is witch You want to develop on Windows - why not give it a try? Web apps are on the rage, as Ben Alpert written in one of the answers, but I think that feeling good and comfortable with what You are doing is also important. If You don't know languages used for Windows development, but as You had written, You have background with programming, I will give You an advice: register at topcoder.com or similar site and try to solve algorithm problems posted there. Knowing data structures and algorithms is better than knowing a little about every language - and besides, You will learn the language of choice with this rather fast.
