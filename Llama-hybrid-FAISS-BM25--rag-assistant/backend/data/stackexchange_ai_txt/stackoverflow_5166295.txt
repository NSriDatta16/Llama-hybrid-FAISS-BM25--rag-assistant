// get the last path fragment var lastFragment = $('img', this).attr('src').match(/\/([^\/]+)$/)[1]; // split dot fragments var lastFragmentSplit = lastFragment.split('.'); // name is first var imageName = lastFragmentSplit[0]; // extension is second var imageExtension = lastFragmentSplit[1]; Note: this simple solution won't work as you expect if you have filenames like names.with.dots.then.extension.jpg . The reason why it doesn't work as you expect in IE is because IE resolves the full, absolute URI when you ask for the src even if the original attribute you supply has only a file name. Firefox leaves it intact.
