Definitely the Barber pole progress bar. I think it's the standard on Mac Human Interface Guidelines (HIG). I am sure similar "undefined" progress bars exists for other platforms as well. I would also put a textual progress indicator (like the amount of bytes transferred, for example). "Guessing" a percent complete can be feasible, but you should definitely be very sure about the average time, and its standard deviation, otherwise you will get a lot of angry users pissed off and clicking cancel because your progress is stuck at 99% since one hour. That would be very annoying for them and for your software's reputation.
