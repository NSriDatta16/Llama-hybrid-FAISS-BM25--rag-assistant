some_number = 2; text_to_display = sprintf('There were %d elements found',some_number); disp(text_to_display); Also, if you wanted to count the number of elements greater than 98 in A , you should one of the following: numel(find(A>98)); Or sum(A>98); sprintf is a very elegant way to display such data and it's quite easy for a person with a C/C++ background to start using it. If you're not comfortable with the format-specifier syntax (check out the link) then you can use: text_to_display = ['There were ' num2str(some_number) ' elements found']; But I would recommend sprintf :)
