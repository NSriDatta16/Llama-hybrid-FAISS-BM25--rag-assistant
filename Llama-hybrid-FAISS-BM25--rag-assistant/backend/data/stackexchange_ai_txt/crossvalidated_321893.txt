Note sure if it could run on a small embedded computer, but this is otherwise a good use case for a recurrent neural network , provided that you have a lot of labeled data. You may also be able to use a time window aggregation approach (e.g., just transforming some section of the tracing into a vector and then using a non time-series model to classify it). If you don't have a lot of labeled data, unsupervised learning might help to get them. Some kind of dimensionality reduction (e.g., for PCA is looks like there might be a question of interest here ) might show that the different locations on the track are very far from one another. Hallac 2017 might help, too.
