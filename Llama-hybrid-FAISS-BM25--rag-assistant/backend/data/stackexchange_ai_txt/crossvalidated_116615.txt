Select the most confident variable that has two features

Suppose now I have a group of students, and for each student two measurements are given: one is the height of the student and the other is the weight of the student. Then my question is how I can select a student that have both decent height (the higher, the better) and decent weight (the heavier, the better)? One solution I can give is as follows: Step 1: Normalize the weight and the height for each student, and the normalization is performed in the following way: 1) Calculate the average m and standard derivation s of the height (or the weight) of all the students. 2) The up-threshold and down-threshold is defined as: upThreshold = m+3*s downThreshold = m-3*s So if the student's height is higher than upThreshold , then its normalization value will become 1. If the student's height is lower than downThrehold , then its normalization value will become 0. 3) For the height in between, I use the following formula to normalize the height: (height-m)/(3*s)*0.5+0.5 Step 2: calculate the sum of the normalized height and normalized weight for each student, and select the one with the maximum sum. I do not know whether there are some problems in my solution, and any comments will be appreciated.
