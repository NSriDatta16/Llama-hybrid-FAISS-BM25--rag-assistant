How do I serialize DOM into XML using PHP?

I am attempting to send html data in a question form from my php web application to mechanical turk so a user can see the entire html document from an email to work with. I have had difficulty thus far. In the thread linked below, I attempted to parse the html data using html5-lib.php, but I think I'm still missing a step in order to complete this. Here's the current error I'm receiving: Catchable fatal error: Object of class DOMNodeList could not be converted to string in urlgoeshere.php on line 35 Here's the current code I'm working with... $thequestion = ' click here '; $thequestion = HTML5_Parser::parseFragment($thequestion); var_dump($thequestion); echo $thequestion; //htmlspecialchars($thequestion); $QuestionXML = ' '.$thequestion.' // '; I'm not 100% sure if the parser is what I need to do in order to have this sent correctly - All I want to do is send html through this xml type document - I'm surprised it's been this difficult thus far. This is somewhat of a continuation of another thread - What PHP code will help me parse html data in an xml form?
