Devices have an "interrupt" -- which is how they signal that they want the processor's attention. Device drivers have an "interrupt service routine" -- which is the code that gets executed when an interrupt occurs on that device. Device drivers then read or write data in a low level form that maps to the device -- typically either characters or blocks of data. The higher levels of the device driver manage packing, unpacking, buffering and translating from the lower level data to higher level data, like lines of text characters, for example. Pretty simple in it's basics, but it gets complicated real fast when you add multiple devices, multiple users, keeping track of state for both, and lots of other abstractions, like a file system, on top of basic block oriented device I/O.
