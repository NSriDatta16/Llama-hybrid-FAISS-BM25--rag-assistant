Within a single dataset you can smooth the results, but this is not always a reduction in error (a consistent bias is appealing when viewing a trajectory or continuous time series from a single receiver). Yes, higher frequency samples can lead to better performance if the device actually observes at higher frequencies. At this level of comparison, chipsets, firmware, and low-level filtering can differentiate cheap GPS modules. Consider using professionally surveyed measurements for your ground-truth path calculations. Ortho-aerial imagery (like on google maps) must maintain close registration to reality than a GPS wristwatch. Use those tools to find the 2d distance rather than one or two experiments using a low-cost gps module on a wristwatch with a poor antenna. In the case the route is not predefined, please state such in the question, otherwise it is incomplete.
