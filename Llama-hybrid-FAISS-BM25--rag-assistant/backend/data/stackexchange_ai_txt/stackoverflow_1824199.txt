First rule out the initial ones: you are initializing correctly (new instead of automatic/local variables) you are accessing the elements correctly (not like in the typo you posted in the question - based on your comment) you are using the right size If you go through all the normal ones and everything is k, then make sure to pay special attention to your loops / size calculations / and anything else that could be causing you to write to unintended addresses. It is possible to write garbage at unintended locations & then get the error in unexpected places ... the worst I saw like that, was some file descriptors's variables being corrupted because of an array gone wrong right before those variables - it broke on file related functions, which seemed v. crazy.
