Can't disable Vardecimal Storage Format

I recently moved a database from a 'SQL Server 2005 SP1' instance to 'SQL Server 2008 SP1' (using detach - attach). I now need to move it back but it fails with the error: The database 'MyDB' cannot be opened because it is version 655. This server supports version 612 and earlier. A downgrade path is not supported. After a bit of research I believe this is related to the new database option 'Vardecimal Storage Format' which has somehow been set ON for all my databases. I did not set this on myself, but if I check the database options in Management Studio (2008) I can see it is set to 'True' for all my databases. Also, this particular option is disabled in the UI, so I cannot turn it off. I then tried the following to turn it off: exec sp_db_vardecimal_storage_format 'MyDB', 'OFF' go which reported success, but when I check the options it is still ON. I then read this very detailed article: " http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb508963.aspx " which states the following requirements to turn this option off: Ensure no tables use vardecimal storage. Confirmed. Set recovery mode to simple and do full backup. I did this. But none of this makes any difference either. The option is still on and I can't change it. Both instances of SQL Server are Express Edition (which isn't supposed to support Vardecimal Storage Format anyway). Any ideas on how to turn this option off?
