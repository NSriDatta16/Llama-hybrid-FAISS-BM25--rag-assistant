Is calculating a moving average a good way to approximate k-nearest neighbor regression?

Given i.i.d samples ( x 1 , y 1 ), ... ( x n , y n ) such that y i = f 0 ( x i ) + $\epsilon$ i , i = 1,... n for some f 0 Suppose I want an estimate $\hat{f}$ of f 0 using k -nearest-neighbors regression in the neighborhood of each x i in my dataset. So for each x i , I must search for the k nearest neighboring elements and take the average of the set of all y j such that j $\in$ $\mathcal{N}$ k ( x i ) where $\mathcal{N}$ k ( x ) contains the k nearest points of x : $$\hat{f}(x_i) = \frac{1}{k}\sum_{j\in\mathcal{N}_k(x_i)} y_j$$ Now if my x i are all evenly spaced, then I could simply sort them in ascending order and calculate a moving average over corresponding elements in y with window size k . My question is: Will this moving average be approximately equivalent to k -nearest neighbors regression even if ( x 1 , ... x n ) are not evenly spaced? Are there any tests I can do on the distribution P (x) to check the quality of approximation?
