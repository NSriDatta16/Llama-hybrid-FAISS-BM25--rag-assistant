Output layer of artificial neural networks when learning non-linear functions with limited value range

I want to approximate a non-linear function with a limited value range by an artificial neural network (feed forward, back propagation). Most tools and literature availabe suggest linear functions for the output neurons when doing regressions. However, I know a priori that my goal function is of limited range, therefore is it reasonable to use a function for the output neurons with limited value range, too? To be more explicit: My target function's values are in the range between 0 and 1, but the neural net does predict occasionally values that exceed this range (e.g. -1.3). Can i prevent the net from doing so, and is it reasonable?
