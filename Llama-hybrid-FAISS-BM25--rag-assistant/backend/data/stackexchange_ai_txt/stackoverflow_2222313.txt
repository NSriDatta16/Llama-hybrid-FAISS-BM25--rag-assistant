you should use the equals method, not checking with == . By the way to avoid strange things it would be better to get just the first character of the string and check it with normal comparisons: public static void main(String[] args) { char c = args[0].toLowerCase().charAt(0); if (c == 'a' || c == 'b' || c == 'c') .... } Then think about the fact that the main method supplies an array of strings, not a single one. A more elegant approach should consider the fact that letters are grouped by ABC DEF GHI JKL MNO PQRS TUV WXYZ so you can directly divide the input character: char c = args[0].toLowerCase().charAt(0); int which = (c - 'a') / 3; if (which EDIT : Mind that this approach returns a zero-based index of the keypad.
