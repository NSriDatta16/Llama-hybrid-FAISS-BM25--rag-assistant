Which effects to fix in SEM with two time points?

I am trying to fit a (to me relatively complex) SEM where I'm interested in two dependent variables measured at t2 and assume that this is explained through independent variables at t1. I have never worked properly with time series data so I am unsure on (1) which variables to fix and (2) how to do that in SEMs. I'm using lavaan in R. Here is my current code: my_reg The variables I am mainly interested in as outcomes are "t2_ls" and "t2_innosum". Dependent variable "ls" is a latent measurement of three other variables, but I would also have a direct measure if this is helpful for model specification (sociological theory suggests differently). As you can see I have only fixed the dependent variables at time point 1 when explaining the respective variables at time point 2, but I am almost certain that I am missing something. Is this approach half-way correct and how can I improve this to better reflect the lagged structure of the data? Any guidance is greatly appreciated.
