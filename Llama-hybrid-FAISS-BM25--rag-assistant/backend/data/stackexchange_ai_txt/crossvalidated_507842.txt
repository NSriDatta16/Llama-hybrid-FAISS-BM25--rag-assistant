Rob Hyndman says : Note that R reverses the signs of the moving average coefficients compared to the standard parameterization given above. He does not go into details. I suspect it was originally just an error in R's arima() , which Hyndman then just carried over to the forecast package, because correcting it would have led to a whole new lot of confusion. But I stress that this is just conjecture on my part.
