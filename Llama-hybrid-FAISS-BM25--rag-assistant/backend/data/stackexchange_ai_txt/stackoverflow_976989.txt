If you just want to display the images and upload them with ftp the image tag thing is fine If you want a web interface to upload them, saving the paths in the DB is very handy You dont have to attach the images to the article per se, you could have a table that saves image paths and then use a join model or simply point to the images through an image tag This allows you to use something as convenient as paperclip (plugin) to handle uploading and storage
