Method of evaluating the feature map of a polynomial kernel feature mapping

I'm attempting to implement an adaptive kernel Kalman filter following this paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.08300 , but I'm struggling to find a method of evaluating the feature mapping for a polynomial kernel $K(x,y)=(x^{T}y+c)^{d}$ with the input (state) dimension is larger than 2. For the scenarios I inted to use the filter for the state could be $\mathbf{x}\in\mathbb{R}^{10}$ which leads to some fairly high-dimensional feature mappings. The idea is to map the filter state to a kernel mean embedding to perform the filter update. The notes I've found have feature mappings $\phi{}(x)$ of different dimensions for the homogeneous quadratic kernel but want to see if there was a simpler method of finding the explicit feature mapping. My question is if there is a formula for generating the feature map for the polynomial kernel given a n-dimensional input and kernel of degree d? Probably a bit of a newbie question but cheers for any help in advance!
