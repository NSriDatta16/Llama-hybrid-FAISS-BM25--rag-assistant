JQuery UI: Pros and Cons?

I've recently been working on streamlining my website and leaning up my HTML and Javascript. I've already begun replacing the MS Ajax.Net JavaScript on my site with jQuery JavaScript, and now I'm looking at some of the html I'm using for things like popups, tab controls, and buttons. JQuery UI was brought to my attention a few weeks ago and I've been studying it for a while but I'm afraid to jump right into it. I like the theming and I like that it uses " sprite" like CSS magic for icons. But I've noticed the CSS rounded corners don't work in IE. So I'm wondering, have/do any of you currently use jQuery UI? If so, what parts are you using? Have you customized it any? What are some pros and cons you've run into? Thank you for your answers in advance.
