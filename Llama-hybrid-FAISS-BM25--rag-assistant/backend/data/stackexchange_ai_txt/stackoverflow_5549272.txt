HTTPS does data encryption. If you're planning to negotiate the encryption without any pre-shared keys then HTTPS is probably one of your best options. It's not trivial to get encryption done in a proper way, so it's usually best to leverage existing implementations. If you are planning on using a shared key that the client and server each know about, then you do likely want to use AES . For the Java side see an example here . You'll have to search around for the PHP side. Be sure to follow all of the best practices if you're aiming for security.
