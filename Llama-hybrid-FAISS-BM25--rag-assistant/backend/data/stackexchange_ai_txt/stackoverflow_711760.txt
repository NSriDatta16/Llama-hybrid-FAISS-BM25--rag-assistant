Do organizations ever use SharePoint on a port other than 80?

Has anyone encountered SharePoint installations that are set up to use other than port 80? I'm not really concerned with test servers or administration interface usage.. just what users would be exposed to. My application is currently set to leverage the WebDAV mini-redirector to assist with its SharePoint interface, and that software can't be used on SharePoint servers that use other than port 80. Trying to figure out how big a problem I might have when this application is deployed widely.
