sample size for physical dimensions measurement of batch of mostly uniform physical objects required for statistic relevance

I wasn't quite sure how to title the question to make it as generic to the situation but as specific as possible. Anyways, I work for a food factory and we are trying to compare different batches of raw materials from different suppliers. The raw material are de-shelled peanuts in this case. I have a 3 large bag of peanuts (25kg), each from a different supplier. I'm mostly concerned about the peanut average size and variance, so I am interested in measuring their length and width. Each bag probably has tens of thousands of beans. How many peanuts from each batch should I measure for a statistically relevant comparison?
