in fact ,in tensorflow ,i created an RNN cell and it sets automatically the activation function so i don t think about changing my activation function, i replaced the gradient descent optimize by the momentum optimizer and i set a momentum of 0.001 so that way it minimizes the chances that it get stuck in a local minimum
