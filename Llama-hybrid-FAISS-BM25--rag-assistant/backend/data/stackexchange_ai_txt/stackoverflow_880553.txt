Can I create a visual studio 2008 starter kit that is based on a solution file with multiple projects

I have successfully managed to create Visual Studio starter kits in the past, however as far as I am aware they can only be made at the project level. I have a solution that contains multiple projects that I want to distribute throughout an organisation for several software projects. The starter kit that I want to make is at the solution level, and contains multiple visual studio projects, that are clearly seperated, ( e.g. seperate code and test projects). Does Visual Studio 2008 support this, and if so how is it done ?
