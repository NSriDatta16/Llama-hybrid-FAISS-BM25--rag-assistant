jQuery selector object does not update on the fly

I'm trying to validate a form by checking the required fields with a jQuery selector. function validate() { if ($('input[required][value=""]').length != 0) { console.log("required value missing"); } return false; // to prevent firing default action } There are a couple input elements like so, with the value set in PHP (not shown): The problem is that this validate function will read the DOM correctly the first time (i.e will correctly recognize all required, empty inputs), but once I fill in/delete values the function will keep returning the same set as before, not recognizing the newly empty fields or the newly filled fields. Once I refresh the page, however, the selector will correctly grab the right inputs. I saw the .live() function, but that applies to events. Does the $(selector) cache (only checks the DOM once instantiated) or is there some other arcane/simple rule for jQuery selectors I'm not paying attention to?
