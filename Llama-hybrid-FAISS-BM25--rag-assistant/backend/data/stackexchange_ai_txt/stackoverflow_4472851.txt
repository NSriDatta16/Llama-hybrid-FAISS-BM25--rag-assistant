Date-time comparison in Ruby

I have one date, let's say '2010-12-20' of a flight departure, and two times, for instance, '23:30' and '02:15'. The problem: I need to get datetimes (yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss, for example, 2010-12-17 14:38:32) of both of these dates, but I don't know the day of the second time (it can be the same day as departure, or the next one). I am looking for the best solution in Ruby on Rails. In PHP would just use string splitting multiple times, but I believe, that Rails as usually, has a much more elegant way. So, here is my pseudo code, which I want to turn into Ruby: depart_time = '23:30' arrive_time = '02:15' depart_date = '2010-12-20' arrive_date = (arrive.hour I want to find the best way to implement this in Ruby on Rails, instead of just playing with strings.
