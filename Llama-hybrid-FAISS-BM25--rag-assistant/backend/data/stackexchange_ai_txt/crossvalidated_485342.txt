One way of understanding they are not independent is to take a large value of $X$ say $2$ and a small value of $Y$ say $.1$ this will result in the fatter tails than the original $X$ distribution. There will be quite a few values close to zero, so this situation will be fairly common. For the second part, you could consider negative and positive $t$ separately. Because of symmetry of each of the two constituent normal distributions there are equal chances of the result being positive or negative. Thus you can just consider whether one of the numerator or denominator is positive or negative, and in the text they have chosen $Y$ which looks slightly more elegant.
