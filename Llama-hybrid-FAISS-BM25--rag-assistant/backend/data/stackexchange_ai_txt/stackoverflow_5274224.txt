Maven will compare the local POM's timestamp (stored in a repository's maven-metadata file) to the remote. When maven does this depends on the updatePolicy that can be defined in your settings xml. Either set this to never (discouraged) or skip this check (only when a remote repository appears to be down) by using the -o option (offline); then maven will not check remote repositories.
