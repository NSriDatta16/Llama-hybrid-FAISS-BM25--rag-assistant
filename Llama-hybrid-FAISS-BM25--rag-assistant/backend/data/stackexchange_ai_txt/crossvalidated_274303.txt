Your original question does not seem to be about people who regularly watch TV, why would you change the question just because your model is having trouble? It seems more rational to change the model. Additionally, this is an outcome dependent subgroup definition, which is always problematic. What if these people just had a busy week at work and normally watch lots of TV during the week? Then they might well be "regular TV watchers" by most reasonable definitions and you just happened to get a outcome realization that had them not watching much. I am uncertain why you would have trouble fitting a random effects logistic regression (or some other model such as a zero inflated Poisson model or something similar to actually also model how much TV they watch) with perhaps covariates for weekday versus weekend day (which perhaps should be subject specific random effects, because people might not just differ in how much TV they watch, but also their probability of watching any during the week)? Then you can describe people as in terms of how likely they are to watch TV during the week versus on the weekend, how much they watch, if they do etc.
