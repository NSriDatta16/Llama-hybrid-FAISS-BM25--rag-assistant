What is the difference between Bayesian Optimizaiton for hyperparameters and using validation set when training?

While studying hyperparameter tuning in Machine Learning, I have come to read Bayesian Optimization for Hyperparameter Tuning and Using validation set when training the model but it is kind of ambiguous to me to tell the usage of Bayesian Optimization and validation set when training the model. Using validation data set, I can measure the performance of the model adjusting the hyperparameters but I don't know when to use Bayesian Optimization for hyperparameter tuning. Hope to hear some explanations about it.
