This looks like a problem that spectral clustering could be applied to. Since you have the pairwise distance matrix, you can define a fully connected graph where each node has N connections, corresponding to its distance from every other node in the graph. From this, you can compute the graph Laplacian (if this sounds scary, don't worry--it's an easy computation) and then take eigenvectors of the smallest eigenvalues (this is where it differs from PCA). If you take 3 eigenvectors, for example, you will then have an Nx3 matrix. In this space, the points should (hopefully) be well-separated because of some neat graph theory which suggests that this is an optimal cut for maximizing flow (or distance, in this case) between clusters. From there, you could use a k-means or similar algorithm to cluster in 3-space. I recommend checking out this awesome walkthrough for more insight: http://arxiv.org/abs/0711.0189
