How to check for linear constraints of coefficients in logistic regression in R?

I have a logistic regression model with several variables. I want to test the hypothesis of, say $a \beta_i = b \beta_j$ for constants $a,b$. I know that this can be theoretically done with an $F$-test; but how do I technically do it in R? What about in the case where I have a factor variables, to the different variables are in fact the dummy variables corresponding to the different levels?
