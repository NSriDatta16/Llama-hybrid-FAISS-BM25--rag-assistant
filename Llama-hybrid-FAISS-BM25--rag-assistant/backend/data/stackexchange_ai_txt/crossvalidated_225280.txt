You are doing predictive modeling. You know that you're doing predictive modeling when you don't care much (or at all) about how your model is arriving at its predictions as long as its predictions are as accurate as possible without overfitting. Easy examples of this include using any of the following models: gradient boosted trees, random forests, or neural networks. These models are so complex that even though you could look at their weights and splits if you really wanted to, the amount of information would be too overwhelming to make sense of. It's straight forward enough to make sense of one decision tree but not thousands. The same can be said of neural networks, particularly deep learning for object detection in images. A deep neural network can have millions of weights.
