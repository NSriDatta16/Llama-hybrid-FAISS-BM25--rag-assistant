Judging by your other question, you are going about this wrong. If you only need to read from the resource, use getClass().getResource() to locate the resource and use it from the URL. If OTOH the app. might also change the information in the resource, it is best to store a copy of the changed resource on the local file system. Don't store it in the 'user.dir' - which is fragile and unreliable, but a sub-directory (e.g. based on the reverse domain name) of 'user.home'.
