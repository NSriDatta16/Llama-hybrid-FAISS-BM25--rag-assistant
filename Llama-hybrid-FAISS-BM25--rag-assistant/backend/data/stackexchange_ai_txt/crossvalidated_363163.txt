There are many useful graduate level books on Bayesian statstics, some of which focus more on theory and philosophy, and others focussing more on practical implementation. In my opinion, the best and most comprehensive guide to the underlying theory is Bernardo and Smith (2000) . This book gives a solid philosophical and theoretical grounding that is unparalleled by any other book I have read. I consider it 'the Bible' of Bayesian statistics.
