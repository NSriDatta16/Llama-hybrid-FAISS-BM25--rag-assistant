Android Installation of APK via Browser Link

I want to create a web page that has two links. One that downloads the agent itself (which is pretty easy, just linking to the APK file with the appropriate MIME types set), and the other to start the install process for the APK downloaded in step one. I know they can just pull down the bar and click on it, but that can be confusing for users (especially in the overall process we are trying to create). Is there a special URI I can use to start the installation, sort of like the market link of "market://"? Also, is there a way to get meta-data surrounding where the APK was actually installed from? For example, if the link for the APK is "http://company.com/setting=123", that I can pull in the "setting=123" from the URL? I suspect not, but I figured it couldn't hurt to ask.
