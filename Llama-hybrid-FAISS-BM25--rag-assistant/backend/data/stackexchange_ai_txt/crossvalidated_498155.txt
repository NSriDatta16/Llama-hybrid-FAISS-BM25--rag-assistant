Here's part of the answer that I could find by myself. Embeddings learned during normal classification (using cross-entropy loss) are separable, but not discriminative. To make the embeddings discriminative, we can either learn the embeddings directly with a special loss function like contrastive / triplet / center loss, or add that loss function to cross-entropy during classification training. Here's a diagram from A Discriminative Feature Learning Approach for Deep Face Recognition , where the embeddings in (a) are from heavily weighting cross-entropy loss, and (d) heavily weighting center loss.
