Kanban/Scrum Boards

I'm curious as to what other people use for physical Kanban/Scrum boards in their companies. I appreciate that because of sensitive business information you may not be able to provide a photo of the board. I"m looking at to find out what does your board looks like , and how you organize user stories and tasks as they move through a typical sprint/iteration? Typically I've worked in a places that organize the board as follows with each User Story | Todo | In Progress | Ready for QA | Done | UC-001 | Domain Object, Service | DAO(Bob) | | | UC-002 | Payment UI Screen | | Payment Srv (Don)| | UC-003 | | | UC-003 | | | | | | UC-004 | | | | | UC-005 | So to summarise: A task for UC-001 is in progress by one member of the team (Bob). A list of tasks for other people to pick up are waiting in the Todo column, but this can be picked up by another member of the team who co-ordinate with Bob to get the work done. For UC-002 the payment service task was completed and an automated test harness was completed for QA allowing them to test the service without a UI. If the test fails a bug is raised and moved along with the Payment Service task back into the QA phase All the tasks for UC-003 was completed and moved to Ready for QA. All the tasks for Uc-004 and UC-005 were complete so the user story was moved to Done. This works as a tangible white board that involves people interacting with each of the tasks/user stories (represented as post it notes). An electronic version is created prior to the sprint/iteration and is only updated at the end of the sprint/iteration corresponding to the current situation. Comments and criticism are welcomed : )
