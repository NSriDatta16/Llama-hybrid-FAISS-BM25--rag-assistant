Image Stabilization optical flow

I'm working on a image stabilization by using optical flow. The algorithm that I've used is like this; first of all I have found good features to track in OpenCv "cvGoodFeaturesToTrack" and then I've estimated the optical flow by using this function for OpenCv as well "cvCalcOpticalFlowPyrLK". Now I want to stabilize the video sequence, which I think I need to take the average of the optical flow vectors. I'm working on a real time application so I can't use either SIFT or SURF. The problem that I don't know how take the average. Can anyone show me what to do? Regards
