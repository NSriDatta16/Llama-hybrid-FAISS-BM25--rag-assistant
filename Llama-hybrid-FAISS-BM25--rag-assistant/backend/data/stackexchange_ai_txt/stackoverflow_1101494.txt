Derive a new component from TTreeView and override the virtual CreateWnd() and DestroyWnd() methods to load/save your custom data from/to temporary storage when needed. Several of the VCL's native components (TTreeView included) do that internally. Changing the Parent property is not the only operation that can cause the TreeView's window handle to be recreated.
