How do I allow clients to upload to Amazon S3 without giving out my keys?

One of my clients has a site which displays media that has been uploaded from a client application. This application initially used FTP, but we're moving to S3 for various data storage and performance reasons. What I would like to be able to do is have this client upload a file directly to our central S3 store (ala dropbox/jungledisk etc etc), but I can't see a way of doing this without handing over our keys and embedding them in the application - not ideal! Is there any way to furnish a client application with a session key / temporary upload URL / something? This could be done via our website's api - which of course has full access to any required S3 secret keys. Suggestions?
