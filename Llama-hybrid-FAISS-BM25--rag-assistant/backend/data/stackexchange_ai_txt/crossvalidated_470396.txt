Bayesian optimization with offline stochastic function and sticky decisions

Is there a Bayesian optimization (BO) framework which allows: Warm start with offline data. The stochastic function $f(x)$ is noisy. Every iteration is $n$ samples controlled by agent and there are constrains on $\min n$ (or maybe penalty).
