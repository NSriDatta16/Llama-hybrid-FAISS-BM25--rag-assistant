The web container will probably have a thread pool, and the app server probably has its own background threads too, so your thread is contentending with those threads for resources (not least CPU) so at that level interference is possible. The actual thread scheduling will be done by the JVM and that may depend upon whatever priorities are set. Java EE app servers don't encourage you start your own worker threads, and some provide architected ways of doing so, I would favour doing that. Of course the Web App threads and your thread in using the same business objects may also contend, but there at least you should be an equal citizen.
