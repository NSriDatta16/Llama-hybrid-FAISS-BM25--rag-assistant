Sharepoint updating custom database

Is it at all possible to leverage Sharepoint UI (e.g. lists editor), to perform basic CRUD operations on external database (owned and used by separate backend application)? How would I go about this? There are quite a few tables in this db, and I'm just looking to minimize custom code we'd need to develop and maintain (since we're not really a development shop - and dont have spare programmers lying around...). (Preferably on WSS, and not MOSS... but willing to listen) I should add this application is used internally, and these tables can be seen as complex configuration for backend processes - that need to change often, and also include data to "feed" the processes. Moreover, I don't have interest in coding a custom WebPart for this, I might as well do a simple CRUD web app... I'm looking to leverage built-in functionality, and sufficing with configuration alone.
