Check if the element is being dragged before showing thickbox. or disable thickbox event handler when dragged. eg: $(".thickbox").mouseup(function(){ if (is_being_dragged()) return; // thickbox functions... }); is_being_dragged() would have to check a flag set by the drag function. The drag function should unset the drag flag after it has completed. You can also solve this independently of the drag function you're using by making the click function be a onmousedown, followed by onmouseup. $(".thickbox").mousedown(function(){ this.__down = new Date().getTime(); }); $(".thickbox").mouseup(function(){ var interval = new Date().getTime() - this.__down; // assume dragged if it was pressed 50 millisecs or more ago if (interval > 50) { return } }); It is assuming a drag takes more then 50 millisecs and a click is less. You can see what works best in your case.
