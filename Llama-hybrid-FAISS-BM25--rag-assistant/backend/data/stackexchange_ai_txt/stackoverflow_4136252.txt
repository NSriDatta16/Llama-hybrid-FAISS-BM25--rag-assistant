Subclassing DBI has to be done just right to work correctly. Read Subclassing the DBI carefully and properly set RootClass (or explicitly call connect on your root class with @ISA set to DBI). Make sure you have WebDB::st subclassing DBI::st and a WebDB::db class subclassing DBI::db (even if there are no methods being overridden). No need to rebless. Avoid using base ; it has some unfortunate behavior that has led to its deprecation, particularly when used with classes that are not in a file of their own. Either explicitly set @ISA or use the newer parent pragma: package WebDB; use parent 'DBI'; ... package WebDB::db; use parent -norequire => 'DBI::db'; ... package WebDB::st; use parent -norequire => 'DBI::st'; ...
