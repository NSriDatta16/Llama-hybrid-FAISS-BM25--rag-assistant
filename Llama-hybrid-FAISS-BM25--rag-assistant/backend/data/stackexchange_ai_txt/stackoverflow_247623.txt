C# language version history: These are the versions of C# known about at the time of this writing: C# 1.0 released with .NET 1.0 and VS2002 (January 2002) C# 1.2 (bizarrely enough); released with .NET 1.1 and VS2003 (April 2003). First version to call Dispose on IEnumerator s which implemented IDisposable . A few other small features. C# 2.0 released with .NET 2.0 and VS2005 (November 2005). Major new features: generics, anonymous methods, nullable types, and iterator blocks C# 3.0 released with .NET 3.5 and VS2008 (November 2007). Major new features: lambda expressions, extension methods, expression trees, anonymous types, implicit typing ( var ), and query expressions C# 4.0 released with .NET 4 and VS2010 (April 2010). Major new features: late binding ( dynamic ), delegate and interface generic variance, more COM support, named arguments, tuple data type and optional parameters C# 5.0 released with .NET 4.5 and VS2012 (August 2012). Major features : async programming, and caller info attributes. Breaking change: loop variable closure . C# 6.0 released with .NET 4.6 and VS2015 (July 2015). Implemented by Roslyn . Features : initializers for automatically implemented properties, using directives to import static members, exception filters, element initializers, await in catch and finally , extension Add methods in collection initializers. C# 7.0 released with .NET 4.7 and VS2017 (March 2017). Major new features : tuples , ref locals and ref return , pattern matching (including pattern-based switch statements), inline out parameter declarations , local functions , binary literals, digit separators , and arbitrary async returns . C# 7.1 released with VS2017 v15.3 (August 2017). New features: async main , tuple member name inference , default expression , and pattern matching with generics . C# 7.2 released with VS2017 v15.5 (November 2017). New features: private protected access modifier , Span , aka interior pointer, aka stackonly struct , and everything else . C# 7.3 released with VS2017 v15.7 (May 2018). New features: enum, delegate and unmanaged generic type constraints . ref reassignment. Unsafe improvements: stackalloc initialization, unpinned indexed fixed buffers, custom fixed statements. Improved overloading resolution. Expression variables in initializers and queries. == and != defined for tuples. Auto-properties' backing fields can now be targeted by attributes. C# 8.0 released with .NET Core 3.0 and VS2019 v16.3 (September 2019). Major new features : nullable reference-types , asynchronous streams , indices and ranges , readonly members , using declarations , default interface methods , static local functions , and enhancement of interpolated verbatim strings . C# 9 released with .NET 5.0 and VS2019 v16.8 (November 2020). Major new features : init-only properties , records , with-expressions , data classes, positional records, top-level programs , improved pattern matching (simple type patterns, relational patterns, logical patterns), improved target typing (target-type new expressions, target typed ?? and ? ), and covariant returns. Minor features: relax ordering of ref and partial modifiers, parameter null checking, lambda discard parameters, native int s, attributes on local functions, function pointers, static lambdas, extension GetEnumerator , module initializers, and extending partial. C# 10 released with .NET 6.0 (November 2021). Major new features : record structs, struct parameterless constructors, interpolated string handlers, global using directives, file-scoped namespace declarations, extended property patterns, const interpolated strings, mixed assignment and declaration in deconstruction, async method builders (via attributes) for individual methods, the CallerArgumentExpression attribute for parameters, enhanced #line pragmas. C# 11 released with .NET 7.0 (November 2022). Major new features : file-scoped types, generic math support, auto-default structs, pattern match Span on a constant string, extended nameof scope, numeric IntPtr , UTF-8 string literals, required members, ref fields and scoped ref , raw string literals, improved method group conversion to delegate, warning wave 7, generic attributes, newlines in string interpolation expressions, list patterns C# 12 released with .NET 8.0 (November 2023). Major new features : primary constructors, collection expressions, inline arrays, optional parameters in lambda expressions, ref readonly parameters, alias any type, Experimental attribute, interceptors In response to the OP's question: What are the correct version numbers for C#? What came out when? Why can't I find any answers about C# 3.5? There is no such thing as C# 3.5 - the cause of confusion here is that the C# 3.0 is present in .NET 3.5. The language and framework are versioned independently, however - as is the CLR, which is at version 2.0 for .NET 2.0 through 3.5, .NET 4 introducing CLR 4.0, service packs notwithstanding. The CLR in .NET 4.5 has various improvements, but the versioning is unclear: in some places it may be referred to as CLR 4.5 ( this MSDN page used to refer to it that way, for example), but the Environment.Version property still reports 4.0.xxx. As of May 3, 2017, the C# Language Team created a history of C# versions and features on their GitHub repository: Features Added in C# Language Versions . There is also a page that tracks upcoming and recently implemented language features .
