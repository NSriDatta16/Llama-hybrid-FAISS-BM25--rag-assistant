Common Database Normalization Scenarios

I'm interested in reading a resource (book, or perhaps a web site) that covers normalization of database tables for common scenarios. I'm looking to store contact data for organizations, which includes addresses, phone numbers, as well as location data for places that may be any where in the world, and others. I've read resources on database normalization theory, and have a decent understanding of 3NF, but I'm sure someone has already solved the problems I'm trying to solve, as they're extremely common. I'd like to review someone else's database design to see how (and maybe why) they chose to do it the way they did. Any recommendations?
