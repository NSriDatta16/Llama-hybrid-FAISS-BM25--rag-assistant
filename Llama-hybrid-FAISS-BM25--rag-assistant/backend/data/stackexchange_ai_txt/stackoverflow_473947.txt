My pet peeve is "architects" who don't understand relational concepts and try to make things work in an object fashion when databases perform better in a set-based fashion and should be designed to be used that way. (Databases should not be designed by object oriented programmers turned architects, they should be designed by database specialists) And architects who think it is more "Elegant" to put multiple things in one main base table (overgeneralization) and then end up with over 100 foreign keys to that table and every query referencing it and a major performance nightmare (as well as a ridiculous process to go through to delete a record).
