QMLE and Confidence Intervals

In the setting of Huber's paper, the true density is $y\sim f_0$ , and the density under consideration is $y\sim f(\cdot|\theta)$ . If we choose to maximize $y\sim f(\cdot|\theta)$ , we will find that $\hat{\theta}\rightarrow \theta_0$ , which is the parameter which will minimize the KL divergence between the postulated density to the target density $f_0$ . Asymptotic normality for $\hat{\theta}$ may be established with a sandwich variance-covariance. $$ \hat{\theta}-\theta_0\sim N(0,A^{-1}BA^{-1}) $$ From this I may form confidence intervals from $\hat{\theta}$ , but that confidence interval I am forming is actually concerned with capturing $\theta_0$ , and not $\theta$ which was originally of interest. If this is the correct interpretation, would it be hard to verify the coverage properties of the sandwich variance estimator in general, since I would need $\theta_0$ ?
