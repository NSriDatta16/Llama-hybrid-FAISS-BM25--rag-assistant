Can a huge existing application be ported to the web? How?

We have an integrated system (at least is that what we call it), which consists in a front-to-back-office huge C++/VB/MSSQL software that handle every single aspect of the organization. Several of our existing customers have been asking if its possible to port it to the web in a sexy web 2.0 fashion, of course it also has great value for us since we would have a nicer, fresh, modern product that would allow us to adopt a SaaS model which we believe is great commercially and would surely open many new doors, so we are not trying to convince the customer that this is not a good idea. But,is the web a place for such app? If it is should we go for Webtop (mimic desktop) UI or should we go for standard Web 2.0 37Signals like UI? Which way in your experience would be better for the presentation of such app, and what tools/languages/technologies would you recommend(if any) in your experience that we would benefit from when designing the chosen model. Keep in mind that the current desktop software is huge, more than 200 SQL tables, 250 forms and something around 400 different reports. Any insight, tip or advice will be greatly appreciated. I thank you all in advance for your time, and apologize for the many-part question squeezed on one very long post.
