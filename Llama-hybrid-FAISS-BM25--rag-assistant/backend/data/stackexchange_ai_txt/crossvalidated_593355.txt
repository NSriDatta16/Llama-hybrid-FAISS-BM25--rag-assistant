The way Galton proceeded to his regression estimate can be found in Stephen Stigler's book, The History of Statistics , as well as a 1997 paper of his, Regression towards the mean , published in Statistical Methods in Medical Research. The above table is reproduced from that paper. The table was used by Galton to decompose the variability of the second generation $d$ as $d^2=v^2+r^2c^2$ where $c$ is the variability of the first generation and $v$ the dispersion of the offspring, since the position of a second generation individual was the sum of its `reverted' averaged displacement from its parent (say $rz$ , where $z$ was the first generation position) and its random deviation from that position (p.110) and conclude from the stability over generations that $d=c$ . The core of Galton's derivation "with a slight assist from the Cambridge mathematician JH Dickson", is to express the data in the curve as a discretised observation of a bivariate Normal and derive the conditional expectation of the height of the adult children on the height of the mid-parent. (Which in itself was an amazing feat for the time.)
