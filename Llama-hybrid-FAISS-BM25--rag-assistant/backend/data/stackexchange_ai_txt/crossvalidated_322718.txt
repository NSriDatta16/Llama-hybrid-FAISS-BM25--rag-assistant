Using SVM at the end of Convolutional Neural Network

Presently the method used is, you train a CNN completely and final layer features maps are taken and an SVM is used to classify. Is it possible to train an end to end hybrid CNN-SVM network? Since both have a different loss function, it can be complicated, but is there any paper on the same?
