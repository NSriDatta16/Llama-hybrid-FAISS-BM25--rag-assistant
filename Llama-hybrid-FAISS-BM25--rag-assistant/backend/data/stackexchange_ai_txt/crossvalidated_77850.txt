Assign weights to variables in cluster analysis

I want to assign different weights to the variables in my cluster analysis, but my program (Stata) doesn't seem to have an option for this, so I need to do it manually. Imagine 4 variables A, B, C, D. The weights for those variables should be w(A)=50% w(B)=25% w(C)=10% w(D)=15% I am wondering whether one of the following two approaches would actually do the trick: First I standardize all variables (e.g. by their range). Then I multiply each standardized variable with their weight. Then do the cluster analysis. I multiply all variables with their weight and standardize them afterwards. Then do the cluster analysis. Or are both ideas complete nonsense? [EDIT] The clustering algorithms (I try 3 different) I wish to use are k-means, weighted-average linkage and average-linkage. I plan to use weighted-average linkage to determine a good number of clusters which I plug into k-means afterwards.
