GAMM with fragmented spatial data - presence/absence response

Quite stuck so hope someone could help me in the right direction. Some background for the data : For the last 15 years data have been collected on a specific species during the period from early summer to late autumn in three different geographical areas. This have cumulated to quite a large dataset. An overview of the number of individuals investigated per week in two of the areas: table(data$year, data$week, data$area) Area 1: 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 2002 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 931 1147 1142 1275 1238 1164 1295 1388 1270 707 138 2003 0 0 0 0 0 0 595 378 499 782 1283 1319 977 820 874 1167 793 762 271 2004 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 597 646 660 609 552 113 62 0 0 2007 0 0 58 57 95 261 170 202 249 266 155 252 173 178 94 76 47 92 55 2008 0 0 0 0 0 0 145 178 169 200 209 171 154 104 144 35 45 0 0 2009 0 0 0 0 0 0 43 53 44 69 34 56 44 30 62 59 0 0 0 2010 0 0 72 55 171 136 132 122 103 78 124 93 23 86 0 0 0 0 0 2012 67 0 78 41 93 87 51 216 278 328 177 235 274 300 306 282 318 125 99 2013 0 27 89 109 73 76 160 184 188 208 243 188 204 176 170 208 199 156 164 2014 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 52 78 108 109 132 142 125 110 129 84 65 2015 0 0 0 0 59 78 125 130 134 144 130 127 128 192 44 89 53 33 41 Area 2: 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 2002 0 0 0 0 0 216 417 480 549 668 758 811 625 827 603 104 0 0 0 2003 88 101 681 320 362 110 512 80 504 0 331 54 289 237 0 0 0 0 0 2004 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 320 352 435 420 392 0 0 0 0 2007 0 137 167 189 277 227 222 241 262 264 157 205 45 81 44 75 70 0 0 2008 0 0 45 50 81 97 88 82 113 75 79 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2009 0 0 131 144 221 168 189 190 184 222 153 204 150 56 0 0 0 0 0 2010 0 0 71 139 123 197 155 149 133 129 158 190 49 61 53 0 0 0 0 2012 0 0 0 0 0 59 109 202 140 122 157 107 197 192 45 0 0 0 0 2013 0 0 0 0 82 27 151 91 77 85 122 99 140 108 0 0 0 0 0 2014 0 0 0 104 90 95 91 113 53 155 154 125 176 68 65 60 56 56 82 2015 0 0 0 0 171 187 173 57 74 77 170 174 173 173 67 79 200 0 0 As you can see my data have quite a lot of missing values both in the temporal and spatial scale. And also varying number of individuals have been investigated different years and in different areas (due to annual variation in staff, funding, weather etc.). In the table I have dropped some years where sampling were only conducted in one or two of the areas. One of the parameters investigated for each (and every) individual is a presence/absence variable ( parasite ). I am hoping to fit a GAM with week as a smoothing term and area as a factor with the binary parasite as a response. I.e. I want to see if the timing of when there is a peak in parasites and if this varies between areas. (Experience tells us it is). A simple version of my model (without all the explanatory variables) is: model (I have included the parameter size just to emphasize that I also have explanatory variables which relate to the individual) So my main question How could I include year in my model? I am not really interested in the annual variation but mainly the overall trend of the response in one area and the difference between areas. This is why I have "pooled" the years. But I know should include year as some sort of random variable (factor), but not sure how.. I am also prepared to hear that my data is too fragmented in the temporal and/or spatial scale to use a GAM, but I am also very grateful for any input on the right statistical approach for my question.
