Seems as if "effective sample size" is a suitable concept for you to look at, in particular the formulae for $Var(\hat{\mu})$ and $n_{eff}$ . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_sample_size A remaining problem however is the fact that your (auto)correlations are not uniform but lag dependent. To solve it you may employ the magnitude of the sample correlation matrix (i.e. the summed entries of the inverse correlation matrix), which is obtained immediately from the results of the autocorrelation analysis. More concretely, if $\{y_q,...,y_n\}$ denotes the time series in question and $\it{R}$ the corresponding sample correlation matrix, then the optimal weight vector $\mathbf{w} = (w_1,...,w_n)$ yielding the largest effective sample size (and thus the lowest-variance (unbiased) linear estimator of the mean) is given by the solution of: \begin{align} \it{R}\mathbf{w}= \left( \begin{array}{c} 1\\ \vdots\\ 1\\ \end{array} \right) \end{align} giving $ \hat{\mu} := \frac{1}{|\it{R}|}\sum_{i=1}^n w_iy_i$ as the lowest variance estimator of the mean. $|\it{R}| = \sum_{i=1}^n w_i$ denotes the magnitude of $\it{R}$ . The overall approach is nicely explained in great detail here https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2014/12/effective_sample_size.html which is also a reference in the above wiki link.
