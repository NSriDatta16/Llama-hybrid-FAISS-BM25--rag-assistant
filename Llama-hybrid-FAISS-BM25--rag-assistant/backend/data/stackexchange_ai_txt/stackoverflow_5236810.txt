You can use the $ operator repeatedly, eg: mname And you can use the following to reference, lst$"u"$"ave" Call: hclust(d = dist(USArrests, x), method = y) Cluster method : average Distance : euclidean Number of objects: 50 Unfortunately, lst$rname[1]$cname[1] doesn't work, but you can use do.call : do.call(`$`,list(do.call(`$`,list(lst,rname[1])),cname[1])) Call: hclust(d = dist(USArrests, x), method = y) Cluster method : average Distance : euclidean Number of objects: 50 Edit There is actually a simpler version, but it will wear out your square bracket keys! lst[[rname[1]]][cname[1]] $ave Call: hclust(d = dist(USArrests, x), method = y) Cluster method : average Distance : euclidean Number of objects: 50 Edit 2 The above square bracket notation seems to wrap the object in a list which means it doesn't return the object properly, but hadley's suggestion in the comments is clearer and avoids this problem: lst[[c(rname[1],cname[1])]]
