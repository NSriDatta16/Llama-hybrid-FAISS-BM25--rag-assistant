Eclipse text-editor drag-and-drop mouse click key combination

In the Java source editor in Eclipse, you could select a block of code, pick it with a mouse click and drop the block of code into another area of the code. You can't do that for other text editors like XML, HTML, etc. I had to press a key combination before I could use the mouse to move and drop the selected text. I have a new Eclipse set-up now and I can't recall what the key combination is. I tried ctrl-shift, ctrl-alt, alt-shift, and ctrl-shift-alt. None of them work. I had drag-and-drop enabled. Is there something else on Eclipse that I had installed in my old Eclipse set-up that I forgot to install in my new Eclipse set-up? It shouldn't be because the text editor config has a check box for "enable drag and drop" which I enabled. Of course, if you are one of those guys who wrote the eclipse text editor, you should also answer this question: why did you not make the other text editors behave like the Java code editor? Why did you make us into having to do a key-combination to perform drag and drop for the other editors? What's wrong with having all the editors exhibit the same behaviour? I woogled and googled and could not find any eclipse manual that would tell me what the key combination is. I also could not find it in the local help files. If you required us to use key-combination, why did you not document that in a manual? My apologies, but I realise I sound a little frustrated now.
