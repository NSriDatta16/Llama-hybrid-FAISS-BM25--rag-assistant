Modelling the difference between two Hubbert curves

I have a large set of time series data, consisting of series from two different conditions, the averages of which are shown below. I would like to fit a model to this data, to test that a) the peak value is greater in the 'conflict' condition, and b) the peak occurs earlier in this condition. ggplot(data, aes(x=Time, y=Variable, colour=Condition)) + stat_summary(fun.data=mean_se, geom="pointrange") From my own research on this, I know that: Growth curve analysis is the usual way of modelling time series data like this, but I can't figure out how I would fit a polynomial for this shape of curve. I have some experience fitting GCA models using lme4 in R, mostly following Dan Mirman's tutorials , but I'm still learning. Curves of this kind are referred to as Hubbert curves, and typically used to model oil production, as a symmetric logistic curve up and down. R package grofit is maybe useful for analyses of this kind, although I would rather know I'm barking up the right tree before investing time in learning how to use this. Can anyone point me in the right direction here?
