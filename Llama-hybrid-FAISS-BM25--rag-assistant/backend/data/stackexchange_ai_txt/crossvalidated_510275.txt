Does Wilcoxon Signed Rank (paired test) in R automatically analyse data by row?

I have multiple rows of observation periods [OP] (of varying durations) showing the average food intake rate of the first quarter of the OP compared to the last quarter of the OP. See the table below. OP Intake.Q1 Intake.Q4 1 6 6 2 19.5 5 3 5.1 2.5 4 4.7 2.1 5 10.6 5.4 I want to find out if there is a significant difference between the first and the last quarter of each OP. If I run a Wilcoxon test in R: wilcox.test(IntakeQ1, IntakeQ4, alternative=("two.sided"), paired=TRUE) My question is : How will R analyse this data, because I need it to compare the time points in each OP then give me a final result of whether intake rate significantly changes during observation period. So will it compare 6 & 6, then 19.5 & 5, then 5.1 and 2.5, etc. then give me a final output, or will it aggregate everything in Intake.Q1 and compare to everything in Intake.Q4? Thank you.
