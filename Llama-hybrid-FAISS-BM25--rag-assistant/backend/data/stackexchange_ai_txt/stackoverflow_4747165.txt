CakePHP Concurrent AJAX Requests Blocking

I am working with CakePHP on an app which has to run a time-consuming task via a single AJAX call, with secondary periodical AJAX calls checking on the progress of the task. The Problem While the time-consuming task (which takes >30 seconds) is running via it's AJAX request to CakePHP, the secondary progress AJAX request seems unable to be "blocking". To clarify, the secondary progress AJAX request does not return any error, it simply does not return any response until the original time-consuming request finishes. Once this original AJAX request finishes, the secondary progress AJAX request returns as expected. It seems that execution of the progress request is being queued until the first AJAX call finishes, as the progress returned is 100%. What I've Tried I have tried multiple suggested solutions, including: Changing the session handler to 'cake' in core.php - no fix Setting the config security level to 'medium' in core.php - no fix Disabling user agent checks in core.php - no fix Testing multiple concurrent AJAX calls to a plain PHP script on the same server - works as expected Any Ideas? So it seems as though the issue is caused by CakePHP - has anyone experienced this in their own CakePHP app? Thanks!
