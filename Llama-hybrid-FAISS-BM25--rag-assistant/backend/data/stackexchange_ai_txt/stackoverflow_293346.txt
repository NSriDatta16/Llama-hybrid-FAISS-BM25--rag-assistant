You can open a connection in your scripts as such: ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection( :adapter => "mysql", :username => "root", :host => "localhost", :password => "******", :database => "******" ) I'm sure there is a more elegant way to do it, so that it grabs the info from your database.yml.
