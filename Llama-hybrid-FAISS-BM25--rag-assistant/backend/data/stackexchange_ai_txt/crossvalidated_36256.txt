Usually, each row is an "observation" (in your case image), and each column is a variable (in your case pixel value). Therefore, you should center and scale the columns before doing PCA. Also, lots of good PCA libraries already exist, such as sklearn.decomposition.PCA , which can save you a lot of effort re-inventing the wheel. But if you persist in implementing PCA yourself you should probably do so via svd rather than via the co-variance matrix.
