I believe you don't need SUM here at all: SELECT idx_common.mls_no AS mls_no, CONCAT_WS(" ", idx_common.street_no, idx_common.street_direction, idx_common.street_name) AS address, idx_common.city AS city, idx_common.state AS state, idx_common.total_sqft AS total_sqft, idx_common.asking_price AS price, idx1.bedrooms AS bedrooms, CAST(idx1.half_baths AS DECIMAL(2, 1)) * .5 + CAST(idx1.full_bath AS DECIMAL(2, 1)) AS bathrooms, idx1.residential_prop_type AS type, "Listing Agent" AS agent FROM idx_common JOIN idx1 ON idx_common.mls_no = idx1.mls_no WHERE `idx_common`.`mls_no` = 'query' OR idx_common.zip LIKE '%query%' OR idx_common.city LIKE '%query%' I also changed / 0.5 to * 0.5 since it seems to be more appropriate for this query. If an apartment has 3 half bathrooms and 2 full bathrooms, this query will output (3 / 2) + 2 = 3.5 bathrooms. Is it what you wanted?
