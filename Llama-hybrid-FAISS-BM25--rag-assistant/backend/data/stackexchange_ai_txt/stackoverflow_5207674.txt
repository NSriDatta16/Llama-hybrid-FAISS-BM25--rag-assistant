There is no counterpart to the concept of a tab in (La)TeX, except when you are aligning the columns in a table. If what you meant by a tab is indentation at the beginning of a paragraph, that is considered a matter of design. Namely, the \parindent parameter specifies the distance that each paragraph should be indented. There is no 'tab' character that occupies the initial position of each paragraph. However, you can forcefully insert a space in an arbitrary position. For example, use \hspace{distance}, where distance can be something like '3em' (3 times the width of m) or '1cm'.
