yeah, it sometimes work. I guess you want to use annual forecasting to be used as an input to the more precise month forecasting. It is a good idea, extracting information from low frequency data and use them in a higher frequency data. But pay attention to the data splitting, since if you use the next year's data to get the model's parameter and use it to predict the months in the next year, causing data leaking. So you may only use the years before to get and use it on the next year.
