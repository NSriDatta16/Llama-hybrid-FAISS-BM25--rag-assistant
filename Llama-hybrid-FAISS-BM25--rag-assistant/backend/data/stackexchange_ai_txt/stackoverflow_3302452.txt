Oraganize Pictures on the website

I am designing a website which will involve too many photos. There are two modules Restaurants and Dishes. which is the best way to create the directory strcuture ? images/Restaurants/ID images/Dishes/ID am using the following to create the filename function imgName($imgExtension) { return time() . substr(md5(microtime()), 0, 12) . ".".$imgExtension; } ii want two different sized thumbnails. which is the best way to name the thumbnails ? since the db will hold only the main pictures filename with extension.
