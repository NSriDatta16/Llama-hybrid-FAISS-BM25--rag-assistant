No, there won't be double accounting. There are several ways of combining exogenous regressors with ARIMA models. One is ARIMAX modeling, another is transfer function modeling (as in the confusingly-named arimax function in the TSA package), and a third is the approach used in auto.arima , which fits a regression with ARMA errors. Double accounting won't occur with any of these approaches. With the transfer function model, all the parameters are jointly estimated, so the trend will be captured by whatever mix of time series and exogenous variable parameters does the best job. With auto.arima , if the regression captures a trend, there won't be a trend left in the errors for the ARMA model to capture. For a nice very high level overview of time series models approaches with some references to R, albeit a little out of date, check out https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/arimax/ .
