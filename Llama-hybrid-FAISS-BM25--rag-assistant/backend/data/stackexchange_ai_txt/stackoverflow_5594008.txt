I think you don't need any shorthand. It's sort of some micro-optimization. You have already spent more time asking this question than can save you such a shorthand in a year of average coding. Just write it and move on. Don't you have more important problems to solve? Moreover, with such a shorthand you will obfuscate your own code. Your current statement is perfectly clear, reads "if date is empty" but all proposed snippets aren't that clear. Coming to this code months later, you will puzzle yourself with question, if such a code monster have any special meaning. What you actually wanted is readability . But you have it already. While all proposed shorthands don't.
