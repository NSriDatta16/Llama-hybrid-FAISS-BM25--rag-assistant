How to create a new Table using Table Storage in Azure

I have tried to use the samples that Roger Jennings recommeded in his book, "Cloud Computing with Windows Azure", but he is using version 1. I'm using v1.2 and there is a lot of differences. Firstly, I had to recompile the StorageClient DLL with the corrected namespace and other changes. Then, when I use his code to create a Table at the application start, I get an "out of range index". Has anyone managed to successfully create a Table at application startup? If so, how? Also, if there are any tutorials/samples that use version 1.2, I'd greatly appreciate them too.
