Viewing LCOV file in Windows

Background: I have used JsTestDriverCoverage and generated a test coverage report for my Javascript unit tests. However it is in LCOV format. As a Windows user running on Windows 2003, I can't just read the file since its perl/lunix friendly. Question: are there any ways to either convert the file to a more readable format (using command line), or using other applications to read the file? Thanks.
