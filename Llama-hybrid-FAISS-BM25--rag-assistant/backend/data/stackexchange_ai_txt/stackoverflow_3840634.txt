I've found that even with optimizations, raw strings are kept as is in the compiled executable file. So the way to go is : go to http://lipsum.org/ generate a lot of text add a cpp in your program add a static const string that will have the generated text as value compile check the size. If your compiler have a limit of raw string size (?) then just make a paragraph per static string. The added size should be easy to guess.
