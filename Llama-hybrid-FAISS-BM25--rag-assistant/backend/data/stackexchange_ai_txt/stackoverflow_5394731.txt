All four queues in the Distributor's config (DataInputQueue, ControlInputQueue, ErrorQueue, and StorageQueue) should NOT have an @ServerName at the end. Thus, they will all default to the "local" machine name, which because it is clustered and you checked the "Use Network Name for computer name" box, will become the name of the cluster. I wrote the article you mentioned - I will update it to be more clear on this and include a sample Distributor configuration snippet.
