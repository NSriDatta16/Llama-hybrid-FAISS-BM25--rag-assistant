I figured out the answer. First I attached a debugger by right-clicking on the wordpress project in netbeans and choosing "debug". This will open the blog in firefox with the "XDEBUG_SESSION_START=netbeans-xdebug" param included in the url (e.g. " http://localhost/wordpress/?XDEBUG_SESSION_START=netbeans-xdebug "). Then I invoked cURL from the command line, making sure to set a cookie with the name/value XDEBUG_SESSION/netbeans-xdebug: >curl "http://localhost/wordpress/wp-app.php/posts" -X POST -H "Content-type: application/atom+xml" -v -L -k -u admin:password --data @post_atom_entry_bad.xml -o post_bad_response.txt -b XDEBUG_SESSION=netbeans-xdebug * About to connect() to localhost port 80 (#0) * Trying 127.0.0.1... connected * Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 80 (#0) * Server auth using Basic with user 'admin' > POST /wordpress/wp-app.php/posts HTTP/1.1 > Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46d2Fuc3Vp > User-Agent: curl/7.19.1 (i586-pc-mingw32msvc) libcurl/7.19.1 OpenSSL/0.9.8i zlib/1.2.3 > Host: localhost > Accept: */* > Cookie: XDEBUG_SESSION=netbeans-xdebug > Content-type: application/atom+xml > Content-Length: 302 > } [data not shown] % Total % Received % Xferd Average Speed Time Time Time Current Dload Upload Total Spent Left Speed 100 302 0 0 0 302 0 74 --:--:-- 0:00:04 --:--:-- 0 At this point cURL halts at the breakpoint I have set at line 283 in wp-app.php, AtomParser->handle_request(), and I can step through the code. Once I click F5 (continue), the server sends the response back to cURL: % Total % Received % Xferd Average Speed Time Time Time Current Dload Upload Total Spent Left Speed 100 302 0 0 0 302 0 2 --:--:-- 0:02:17 --:--:-- 0 Done. Would be great to get examples from other interactive debugging clients like notepad++.
