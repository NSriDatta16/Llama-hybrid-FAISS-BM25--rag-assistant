First, I hope you get that atan() returns values in the range -π/2..+π/2, so you'll never get values in the other half of the circle. (If you deduce that the answer is on that side, you have to do your own flipping/mirroring.) In your touches-moved, NSLog() what you've calculated the new difference to be, and be sure that it's the value you're expecting. Of course, you keep the previous radians on touchesBegan, and save-off the current radians on init, touchesEnded and touchesCancelled, right? (In many cases, touchesCancelled can just fwd the arguments to touchesEnded.) If you do all of that, then the scheme you describe ought to work. If it does not, perhaps provide more information, like the NSLog() output for the various values when you think those values should be different.
