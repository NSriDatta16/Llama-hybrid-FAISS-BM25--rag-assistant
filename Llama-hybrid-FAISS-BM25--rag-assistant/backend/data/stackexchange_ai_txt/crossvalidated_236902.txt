There are several ways to tackle your problem. I'd use a Bayesian approach. Assume the data is binomially distributed i.e. the population parameter $\theta$ is the probability that a given student will pass the test. Your goal is to estimate the distribution of $\theta$. For binomial distributions, the conjugate prior for $\theta$ would be the $\text{Beta}$ distribution. When you have no data at all, it is reasonable to assume that $\theta \sim \text{Beta}(1,1)$. This is a non-informative prior (in other words, you make no assumptions on the parameter $\theta$ apart from the fact that it lies in the interval $[0,1]$). Suppose you have 100 schools, each school $i$ has $n_i$ students (you know the value of $n_i$ since you have the percentage of students who passed and the number of students who passed). Let $y_i$ be the number of students who passed in school $i$. Then the posterior distribution is $$(\theta \vert y,n) \sim \text{Beta}\left(1 + \sum_{j=1}^{100}y_i, 1 + \sum_{j=1}^{100}(n_i - y_i) \right)$$ Now if you have this posterior distribution, you can measure the credible interval of $\theta$ using properties of the $\text{Beta}$ distribution. Now consider school $i$, where the pass rate is $y_i/n_i$. Look at where this value lies on the posterior distribution of $\theta$. This will give you a good idea of how this school compares to the others. In addition, if you get more data, you can just update the posterior distribution using the formula given above.
