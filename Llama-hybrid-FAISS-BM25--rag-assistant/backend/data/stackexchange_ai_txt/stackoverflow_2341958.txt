how images/files are stored in hard disk and how orkut or any other sites links are organised..is it in differnt tables?

Today i was thinking about orkut structure... There are profile,images,videos,scraps.... I think at server side there must be differnt tables like profile table,image table,video tables,scrapbook table etc.. in which each user must have his data with unique username... Now when user login and clcik on profile link data is retrived from profile table(uinque username) and when user clcik on photos then photos are retrived for each user.. Now tell me is this going in orkut Now for photos,when user upload his photo it must be saved in hard-disk(in nay folder in htdocs) and when user want to see these must be retrived from there.. Now my question is this,should we store full address(after upload /htdocs/uploaded image) of image in database or there is some other trick for this.. If two same name files are uploaded by 2 differnt users how query will distinguish that this image belongs to that user i think for this we must save the uploaded file with extension of username Plz discuss these things so that we can get idea what is going behind
