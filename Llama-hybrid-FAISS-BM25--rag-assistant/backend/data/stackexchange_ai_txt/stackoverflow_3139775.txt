Trying to leverage the code you have already written I would propose the following first, as it is the simplest solution (but not the most efficient): private static void main(string[] args) { //This will determnine which numbers between 1 & 100 are in the fibonacci series //you can swop in code to read from console rather than 'i' being used from the for loop for (int i = 0; i num) { return false; } } } I would propose a more elegant solution in the generation of fibonacci numbers which leverages recursion like so: public static long fib(int n) { if (n For the extra credit read: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number#Recognizing_Fibonacci_numbers You will see the that there are a few more efficient ways to test if a number is in the Fibonacci series namely: (5z^2 + 4 or 5z^2 − 4) = a perfect square. //(5z^2 + 4 or 5z^2 − 4) = a perfect square //perfect square = an integer that is the square of an integer private static bool isFib(int num) { double first = 5 * Math.pow((num), 2) + 4; double second = 5 * Math.pow((num), 2) - 4; return isWholeNumber(Math.sqrt(first)) || isWholeNumber(Math.sqrt(second)); } private static bool isWholeNumber(double num) { return num - Math.round(num) == 0; }
