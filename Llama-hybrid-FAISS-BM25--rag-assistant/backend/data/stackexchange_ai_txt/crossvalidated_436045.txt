Why should it be different? You cannot determine whether a feature is in or out of your training domain unless you have an idea what that domain is . If do you know, or at least can reasonably make an assumption about that ahead of time, you can throw some model comparison/goodness-of-fit metric at it. A standard VAE is a nice case to examine, as it explicitly regularizes the latent space sizes to a Gauss(0, 1) . If your training encodings are well-behaved but your test encoding mean suddenly blows up to, say, [6.34, 1] , something's clearly amiss. The big problem here is that you'd need to model the distributions of activations within the model , which suggests something more along the lines of a Hierarchical Bayes.
