In a Multi-level Bayesian Hierarchical Model, would higher level parameters be affected by how they are jointly modeled in lower levels?

Suppose we have a Multi-level Hierarchical Model where: $$ \begin{equation} Y_{0i} \sim Bin(\theta_{0i}, n_{0i}) \\ Y_{1i} \sim Bin(\theta_{1i}, n_{1i}) \\ \theta_{0i} \sim Unif(0,1) \\ log\left(\dfrac{\theta_{1i}}{\theta_{0i}}\right) \sim N\left(\mu, \sigma^2\right) \\ \mu \sim N(0, 0.1) \\ \sigma^2 \sim Gamma(1,1) \end{equation} $$ and another Hierarchical Model that is almost the same except for how the $\theta$ 's are jointly modeled: $$ \begin{equation} Y_{0i} \sim Bin(\theta_{0i}, n_{0i}) \\ Y_{1i} \sim Bin(\theta_{1i}, n_{1i}) \\ \theta_{0i} \sim Unif(0,1) \\ \theta_{1i}-\theta_{0i}\sim N\left(\mu, \sigma^2\right) \\ \mu \sim N(0, 0.1) \\ \sigma^2 \sim Gamma(1,1) \end{equation} $$ I understand that inferences on the marginal posterior of $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ will be different in both models. However, will the marginal posterior of $\theta_{1i}$ and $\theta_{0i}$ be different or will they be the same? It seems that since for example, $P(\theta_{1i}|Y)$ can be obtained by marginalizing out $P(\theta_{1i}, \mu, \sigma^2|Y)$ , then it is the same. But is this the case?
