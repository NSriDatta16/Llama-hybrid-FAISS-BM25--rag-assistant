xml parsing in iPhone and getting other tags with same names

Let me try to explain as clear as possible what I mean exactly with this question. The xml looks instead like this Circumference Nicholas Nicastro Eratosthenes and the Ancient Quest to Measure the Globe. Copernicus Secret Jack Repcheck How the scientific revolution began It will look like this Circumference Nicholas Nicastro Eratosthenes and the Ancient Quest to Measure the Globe. Eratosthenes more info in another tag. Eratosthenes and again another tag. Eratosthenes and the final tag another one here Copernicus Secret Jack Repcheck How the scientific revolution began Eratosthenes more info in another tag. Eratosthenes and again another tag. Eratosthenes and the final tag another one here Now if I follow the instruction on the site listed above , it doesn't explain how to handle summary 2,3,4( the xml i need to parse looks like that) and how I can show their output. All I will get is the last line. Does anyone have an idea about how I can get the other ones as well( meaning 2,3 in this case it seems to show only the last one since that's probably the last in the currentElementValue ). I'm a bit confused would I have to address the attribute here as well or should I create a new search tag in my parser?
