Your best bet would be to make sure you set styles to: .overlapper { position: absolute; z-index: 9000; /* some very high value to ensure its always on top */ top: 50px; /* whatever positioning you need */ left: 50px; width: 500px; height: 100px; } Just set your values to whatever you need. The main thing to be aware of is the z-index, higher values mean its higher up in the layer order with 0 or 1 being the lowest. Some things to note; you can set your position to "position: relative;" too if the absolute positioning isn't conducive to the layout, in which case you may need to use negative top values to drag it back over top of the first iframe.
