want to filter out Windows admin shares from my arrangedObjects NSArrayController

I have everything set up in my NSArrayController to have my files owner representedObject be the data source for a tableview that I have. Within my bindings in interface builder I would like to use the filter predicate to filter out any items in the arraycontroller that have a $ in the name.... specifically ending in $ actually as this is how windows admin shares look like when I get the array of FTP shares I am collecting. I have set up the filter predicate as so: controller key: selection modelKeyPath : directorsAndFiles value Transformer: hmm I dont know? can you help wanted: eliminate any items that have $ characters in them thanks!
