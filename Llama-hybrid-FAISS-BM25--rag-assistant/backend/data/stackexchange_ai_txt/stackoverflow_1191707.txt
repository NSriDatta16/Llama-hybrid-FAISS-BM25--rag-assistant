We have build configurations for compile + unit tests + static analysis (findbugs in our case) + code coverage (triggered on commit) integration tests (triggered on a schedule as long as there is a commit) deployment to test (manually triggered) The deployment configuration allows a non-technical QA resource to deploy to the test environment whenever they're ready to test something, and avoids the confusion of whether a bug fix has hit the test environment yet.
