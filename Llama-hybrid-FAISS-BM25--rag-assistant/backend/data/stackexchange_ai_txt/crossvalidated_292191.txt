What is a 'State'?

I've been working with State-Space modelling in R using the KFAS package and I'm a bit confused as to what exactly a 'State' is.. I know that in state space modelling, we have an observation equation and a state equation, I have a general understanding of the observation equation but not exactly of the state equation. To put some context in what i'm trying to do using this modelling... I've got a time series of 2160 data points, and about 5 different predictors. Using the KFAS package, I wanted to build a state space model so that I could plot the change in the beta coefficients of the predictors over time. To do this I used a Kalman Smoother to get the 'filtered' estimates of the states and then plotted those. However, I'm not sure if what I've done is what I was trying to obtain.. Which brings me back to being confused about what exactly a 'state' is and what i'm really plotting here.. Any help would be appreciated.
