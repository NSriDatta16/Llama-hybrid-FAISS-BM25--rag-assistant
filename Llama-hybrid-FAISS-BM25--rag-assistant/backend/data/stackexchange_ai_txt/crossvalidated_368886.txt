How bootstrap sampling cause bias in Random Forest?

I am confused how bootstrap sampling causes bias in the feature selection process of Random Forest. In this article , it says "Obviously, the bootstrap sampling artificially induces an association between the variables.". Could you please further explain how bootstrap sampling causes bias and why?
