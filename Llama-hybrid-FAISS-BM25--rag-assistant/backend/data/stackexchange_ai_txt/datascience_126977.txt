RGCN using source and targets of edges for aggregation

I am checking an old TF v1 repository ( https://github.com/microsoft/tf-gnn-samples ) and trying to do the same thing in PyG. I see RGCN implementation has an option that says if it should get only neighborhoud for aggregation or it should pair the neighbour with the central node and pass them together. if use_both_source_and_target: edge_target_states = \ tf.nn.embedding_lookup(params=cur_node_states, ids=edge_targets) # Shape [E, H] edge_state_pairs = tf.concat([edge_source_states, edge_target_states], axis=-1) # Shape [E, 2H] messages = edge_type_to_message_transformation_layers[edge_type_idx](edge_state_pairs) # Shape [E, H] else: messages = edge_type_to_message_transformation_layers[edge_type_idx](edge_source_states) # Shape [E, H] I am trying to figure out how this is done in Pytorch Geometric.
