EDITED: Added additional information, and replied to question. An interesting way to make ListBoxItems be uniform with other items is to the Grid s shared scope feature in your DataTemplate Example: Now all the TextBlocks will be the same size in your layout. The child item should fill all available space if no specific width/height are set. Alternatively you can set the Width and Height of the control to stretched, however I think using the Grid.SharedScopeSize is a more elegant way to achieving the same effect.
