The standard for(int i = 0; i loop is the one that allows the JIT to safely remove array bounds checks (whether the index is within [0..length-1]) The foreach loop over arrays is equivalent to that standard for loop over arrays. EDIT: As Robert Jeppesen points out: This will be optimized if the array is local. If the array is accessible from other locations, bounds checking will still be performed. Reference: JIT, NGen, and other Managed Code Generation Stuff > Array Bounds Check Elimination in the CLR ">Array Bounds Check Elimination in the CLR Thanks! Didn't know that myself.
