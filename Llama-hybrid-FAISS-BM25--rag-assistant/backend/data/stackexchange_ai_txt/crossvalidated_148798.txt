What differentiates one feature map from another in CNN

I understand in a convolution neural net that you may have several feature maps in the same layer, for instance one map detects curly loops for some letter and another detects straight lines. Here my main question... Since we do not know features ahead of time, hence the training, what makes a feature map pick out a particular feature instead of doing some stochastic random walk? Since we are testing against the entire grid, it seems like letter features in one area of the grid will get washed out from noise in another area.
