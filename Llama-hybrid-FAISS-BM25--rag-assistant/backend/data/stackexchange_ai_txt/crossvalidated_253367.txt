PCA on integers or floating numbers: is there any difference?

I want to use PCA to reduce SIFT ( 128 dims) and VLAD vectors ( 128*k dims, let's say k={64, 128, 256} ) dimensions as described in this paper. SIFT descriptors can have integer values (by default in VLFeat) or float numbers (by default in OpenCV). In both cases, SIFT vecotrs have always positive values, while VLAD vectors could have negative values too. Is there any performance reason (in terms accuracy or computation time) why I should prefer integer over floating numbers (or viceversa)?
