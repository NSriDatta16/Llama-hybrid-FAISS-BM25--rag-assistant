ODBC Storage Size

I'm pulling a lot of text from a MS SQL Server database. I'm not getting all the text (which includes some html. The text is stored perfectly on the database. However, when I run the query to get the data It will only pull part of the text. I pull the data using odbc_exec and store using $variable = odbc_result($runquery,"body"). if i display the content with odbc_result_all($runquery) i get part of the content. if I use echo $body; i get part of the content then some garbage and part of the text from the begining. very strange response. Is there a size limit? Any ideas what I'm missing here?
