One thing that has worked for us in a similar situation is doing a bit of reinforcement learning (explore and exploit). On top of the rule based model, we ran a explorer which would with a small likelihood change the response of the model, so in occasional cases where the model would not recommend a card to a 17-year old, the explorer would overturn the model's decision and issue a card. From these occasional cases you would generate learning data for a future learning model where it can be used to decide to recommend cards for 17 year olds based on if the ones that were issued to 17 year olds by the explorer did not default and so you can build systems that can work outside the biases of your existing model.
