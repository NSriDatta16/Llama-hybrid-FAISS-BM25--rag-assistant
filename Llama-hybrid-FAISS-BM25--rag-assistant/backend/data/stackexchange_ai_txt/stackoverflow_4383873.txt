The stacktrace is the same as in Bug ID 6533653 and Bug ID 6850598 . The root cause seems to be an empty JAR in JNLP. They said to have fixed it in Java 1.6 update 2 and Java 1.6 update 18 respectively. However, there is a comment in the last bug which complains that the fix still doesn't work in 1.6 update 18, along with a description which look much like your situation: In vm 6u18 this bug is NOT closed. You can launch your application once but after you have the following exception : java.lang.NullPointerException at com.sun.javaws.security.SigningInfo.overlapSigners(Unknown Source) at com.sun.javaws.security.SigningInfo.getCertificates(Unknown Source) at com.sun.javaws.LaunchDownload.checkSignedResourcesHelper(Unknown Source) at com.sun.javaws.LaunchDownload.checkSignedResources(Unknown Source) at com.sun.javaws.Launcher.prepareResources(Unknown Source) at com.sun.javaws.Launcher.prepareAllResources(Unknown Source) at com.sun.javaws.Launcher.prepareToLaunch(Unknown Source) at com.sun.javaws.Launcher.prepareToLaunch(Unknown Source) at com.sun.javaws.Launcher.launch(Unknown Source) at com.sun.javaws.Main.launchApp(Unknown Source) at com.sun.javaws.Main.continueInSecureThread(Unknown Source) at com.sun.javaws.Main$1.run(Unknown Source) at java.lang.Thread.run(Unknown Source) If I remove the empty jar from jnlp, all is ok. Please verify your correction before publication So, try removing the empty JAR from the JNLP and report it to the JNLP authors as well.
