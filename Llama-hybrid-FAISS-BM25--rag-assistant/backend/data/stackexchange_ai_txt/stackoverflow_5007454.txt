Please try it with this syntax: os.execute [["dir /B C:\Users\Fernando\workspace\Organizator2\s1 > C:\Users\Fernando\workspace\Organizator2\temp.txt"]] Please note that the backslash ( \ ) is not a special character in this case. (Lua uses cstrings internally, sometimes it leads to some weird and amazing results :P)
