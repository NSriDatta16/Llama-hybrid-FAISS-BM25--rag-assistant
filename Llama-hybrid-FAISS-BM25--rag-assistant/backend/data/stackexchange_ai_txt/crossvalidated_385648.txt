What is the difference between Rand Index (RI) and Simple Matching Coeffiecient (SMC) in clustering?

I don't understand the difference between Rand Index (RI) and Simple matching Coefficient (SMC). From the calculation provided in the following page, the calculation looks so similar. RI: https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/evaluation-of-clustering-1.html SMC: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_matching_coefficient Are they kind of the same thing? Thanks!
