When you write a Java program, it runs on all platforms that have JVM written for them - Windows, Linux, MacOS, etc. If you write a C++ program, you'll have to compile it specifically for each platform. Now, it is said that the motto of Java "write once, run everywhere" is a myth. It's not quite true for desktop apps, which need interaction with many native resources, but each JavaEE application can be run on any platform. Currently I'm working on windows, and other colleagues are working on Linux - without any problem whatsoever. (Another thing related to portability is JavaEE (enterprise edition). It is said that applications written with JavaEE technologies run in any JavaEE-certified application server. This, however, is not true at least until JavaEE6. ( see here ))
