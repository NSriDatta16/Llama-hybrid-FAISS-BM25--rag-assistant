Word embeddings through SVD - Why are the singular values thrown away?

Word embeddings are created from matrix factorization of the word- word co-occurrences matrix X through SVD. So if we factorize X = USV and if we are taking only k significant singular values into consideration then the word embeddings that we take is U' = [u1 u2 ... uk]. If we take the matrix of first k singular values to be S' shouldn't the word embeddings matrix be given by U'*(S'^0.5). When we are taking only U' as the word embedding matrix we are ignoring the weight along each independent direction and treating them equal . Any thoughts ?
