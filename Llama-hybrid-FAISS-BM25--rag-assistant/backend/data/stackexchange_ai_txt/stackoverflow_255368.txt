The recomended way of ding this seems to be with Plug-in fragments: http://rcpquickstart.com/2007/06/20/unit-testing-plug-ins-with-fragments/ The fragment gets a high-degree of access to your plugin's code and separates the testing logic / dependencies from the plugin itsself. Now if only I could find a way to test them in an automated system... (see: Automating unit tests (junit) for Eclipse Plugin development )
