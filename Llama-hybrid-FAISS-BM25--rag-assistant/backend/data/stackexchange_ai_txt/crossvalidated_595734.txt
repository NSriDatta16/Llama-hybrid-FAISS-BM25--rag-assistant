4 years past. hope I can still contribute to your question. I have actual experience in DOE applied into real world of semiconductor manufacturing, more than 30x conducted DOE RSM. And am also a big data computational enthusiast. My direct answer: yes DOE is a supervised ML. DOE is part of ML. I cant say ML is part of DOE. Because ML is a wide topic and method of application. Probably you already knew that DOE RSM is more informative than the other method of DOE such as Taguchi. so stick with DOE RSM (Response surface methodology). a traditional DOE, but very effective. Method of calculation applied to DOE RSM in fractional & full factorial is Matrix Multiplication.(linear algebra). there are other ways to connect and calculate the missing link/values in order to come out, a model. usually Polynomials in 3D. you can apply other models forcibly, such as exponential, weibul, hyperbol, and many more models. How do you judge if you selected the correct model? no worries, use the regression analysis result such as R Sq and RsqAdj and also use Chi sq test, to see if your model fits into your actual data. if model to actual is too far, use other models. if still too far, then review again. Your last question, What is the difference between DOE and supervised machine learning in terms of the accuracy or other performance measure of the transfer function? in terms of accuracy... well this depends on application. if your experiments behaves with the models identified by dead mathematicians, then basically no difference. as long as the DOE and Machine learning calculation applied the same model. otherwise, there will be difference of accuracy in predicting the behaviour. either, might result far from the model. I assumed you knew this next statement, because you know how to use DOE. more levels in DOE, the more accurate you predict the physical behaviour of what you do. hard core experimenters love using minimum level 4 of DOE, multiple factors. Interpolation is more accurate than extrapolation.
