union versus or

let's say I've got two queries: select top 20 idField, field1, field2 from table1 where idField in ( select idField from table1 where field3 like '...' union select idField from table2 where field4 like '...' ) order by sortfield1 select top 20 idField, field1, field2 from table1 where field3 like '...' or idfield in (select idField from table2 where field4 like '...') order by sortfield1 let's say that both tables are rather large (table2 larger than table1), average range of results number is 0-400, but I always want max 20 results. Is it possible to say with big probability which statement would be more performant and/or what would the choice of statement depend on? Thank you
