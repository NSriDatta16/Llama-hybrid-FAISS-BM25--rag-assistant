Advantages that often get touted in circles I frequent are: Your html can be fully xhtml compliant - there is a VERY nice separation of presentation and logic in that the only thing your presentation/html layer needs to know about wicket are wicketid attributes in standard html tags. This is wonderful for the html/css/javascript client side guy on your team who does little to no actual java work. No other java based web framework can claim this, afaik. No xml config for anything wicket specific - everything can be done in source and very little needs to be done to the standard web.xml for your .war component based development is pretty easy to grok - especially if you have a non web background (e.g. a swing programmer). it encourages reuse quite a bit more than mvc does, imo.
