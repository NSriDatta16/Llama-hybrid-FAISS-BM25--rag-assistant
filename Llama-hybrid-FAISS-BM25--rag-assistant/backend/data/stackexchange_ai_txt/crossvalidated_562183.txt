which training mode is more convenient for small datasets?

I have a regression problem to be solved using one of neural networks models, but I have a small dataset which contains 30 samples. Which training mode is more suitable for such dataset: stochastic or batch? Of course I need to split data into training/test sets, I think that 2 or 3 folds cross-validation will not work well in this case, Am I right?
