I couldn't perfectly make sense of the question, but here is an answer: when you do PCA on a dataset, you learn a new basis (say $t$ dimensional, $t Euclidean norm, or Frobenius norm for matrices are invariant to basis changes with orthonormal bases. This means, the basis change will actually not change your landscape for the k-means clustering. Hence there is no difference in doing the clustering in either of the domains.
