# Answer to question 1 - just use the built-in functionality of lists. # # There is no need to use variables when lists let you do so much more # in a quick and organised fashion. lines = [] for line in open_file: lines.append(line) Since Li0liQ already answered questions 2 and 3 , I'd just like to add a recommendation regarding question 3. You really don't need to make a copy of the list via i[:] since you're just testing a value in the list.
