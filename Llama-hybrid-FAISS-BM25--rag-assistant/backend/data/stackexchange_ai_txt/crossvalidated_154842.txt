Mean of Empirical Auto-Covariance

Chris Chatfield's "The Analysis of Time Series: An Introduction" 6th ed, gives the mean of the empirical auto-covariance as: E(r_k)=-1/N where E is the expectation r_k is the empirical auto-covariance N is the number of observations 1.) Can someone point me to a reference (ideally online) that derives this result? 2.) Even on an intuitive level where does the -1 come from. Thanks Baz
