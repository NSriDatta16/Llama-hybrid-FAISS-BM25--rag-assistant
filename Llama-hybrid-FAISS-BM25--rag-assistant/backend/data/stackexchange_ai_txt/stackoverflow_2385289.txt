Email on the internet operates on the SMTP protocol . Standard MTAs (mail transport agents) will deliver messages to static mailboxes. All the above solution requires is a custom MTA that instead of delivering to static mailboxes it interprets the username part of the address as a phone number and then pipes the request to an SMS gateway. Certain mail software might be configurable enough such that this won't even require custom software and can be done with straight configuration.
