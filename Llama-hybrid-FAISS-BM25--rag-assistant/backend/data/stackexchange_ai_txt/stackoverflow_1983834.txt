What practical problem will i face if i use same #id more than one time on a page , other than validation error "ID is already defined"?

First of all I alwyas use one #ID. just asking this question to know deep reason behind it. Is it only a matter of W3C validation? or more than that. Will i face any practical problem or it's just a logic for validation? see this example http://jsbin.com/aniqi it's working on all browsers. just validation giving error update : I think all browser supports more than one #ID so it's just a recommendation but supported by browsers. only validation give error : ID is already defined. and if we use javascript to select #ID, other wise it's not a problem Update 2: What should be the answer if some web design students of mine asking to me about " Why css #ID should be used once in a page . student doesn't know about javascript yet . What reasons i can give to not to use #ID more than one, while it's supported by all browsers? Update 3: I found some useful info on W3C site This is a uniquely named paragraph. This is also a uniquely named paragraph. The id attribute has several roles in HTML: The id attribute assigns a unique identifier to an element (which may be verified by an SGML parser). For example, the following paragraphs are distinguished by their id values: * As a style sheet selector. * As a target anchor for hypertext links. * As a means to reference a particular element from a script. * As the name of a declared OBJECT element. * For general purpose processing by user agents (e.g. for identifying fields when extracting data from HTML pages into a database, translating HTML documents into other formats, etc.).
