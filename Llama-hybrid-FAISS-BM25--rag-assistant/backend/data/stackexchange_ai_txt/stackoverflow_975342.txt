Edit: I noticed that some people are cutting and pasting the invocation here. The answer I originally gave was relevant for the OP only. Here's a more modern invocation style (including using the more conventional port of 8000): java -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,address=8000,suspend=n Note: With address=8000 (as used above), the debug server will only listen on localhost (see What are Java command line options to set to allow JVM to be remotely debugged? ). If you want the server to listen on all interfaces, to be able to debug across the network, use address=*:8000 . Obviously only do this on a restricted, trusted network... Original answer follows. Try this: java -Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:server=y,transport=dt_socket,address=4000,suspend=n myapp Two points here: No spaces in the runjdwp option. Options come before the class name. Any arguments you have after the class name are arguments to your program!
