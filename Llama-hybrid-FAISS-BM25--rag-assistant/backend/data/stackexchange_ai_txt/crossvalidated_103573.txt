Analyzing behavioural data

Background and experiment details We have just completed data collection for an experiment. The experiment was a long term study which involved assessing the effect of a drug on behavioural attributes. Behavioural data involved collection of over 22 attributes/characteristics measured every 10 minutes, for 50 minutes a day for 5 days per sample ( so in short we have 25 readouts per sample over the 5 day period ). As this data was collected before the experiment was started, and after 10 weeks of treatment (so basically collect initial data + 1 week + 10 weeks treatment + 1 week + collect final data ), so in short We have behavioural data from 2 time points . Number of samples The experiment involved 6 groups with variable samples per group. It has been summarized below. Each group had a treated and placebo sub-groups. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | group | treatment | no of samples | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- A | Treated | 5 | A | Placebo | 3 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- B | Treated | 3 | B | Placebo | 5 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- C | Treated | 6 | C | Placebo | 5 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Data type The data is quantitative and a function of time (eg. How long did the subject stay still), distance or counts of activities (eg. How many jumps) etc. EDIT: Note that the function of time is not time itself, but a number which denotes that. For example a less active subject will have a readout of 2000, whereas a more active subject a readout of 4000 etc. In the end these data points are numbers which can be directly compared to each other. My aim is to see if these numbers are statistically different from each other between the treatment and control groups if tests are performed. Th raw data for in sample looks like this.. (you may have to delimit by space, but you get the idea) Subject Total Activity Fast Activity Slow Activity Total Static Counts Fast Static Counts Slow Static Counts Total Mobile Counts Fast Mobile Counts Slow Mobile Counts Total Rearing Counts Fast Rearing Counts Slow Rearing Counts Total Center Rearing Fast Center Rearing Slow Center Rearing Active Time Static Time Mobile Time Rearing Time Front To Back Innactive Time Distance Travelled Meters 2 801 212 589 587 75 512 214 137 77 131 91 40 1 1 0 316 247 69 196 17 284 19.43 I picked a few random samples, averaged the repeated readings and pooled them togther and found out if they were normal. Here are the results Tests of Normality for random samples ( all 25 readings per sample from 6 samples pooled) Kolmogorov-Smirnova | Shapiro-Wilk Statistic df Sig. | Statistic df Sig. .077 123 .068 | .976 123 .026 a Lilliefors Significance Correction So they are not normal... Also, The same samples done individually (the 25 readings per sample plottedindividually) Tests of Normality Kolmogorov-Smirnova Shapiro-Wilk ID Statistic df Sig. | Statistic df Sig. 2.00 .125 20 .200*| .981 20 .951 8.00 .255 21 .001 | .871 21 .010 17.00 .181 22 .060 | .900 22 .030 26.00 .091 20 .200*| .955 20 .443 31.00 .148 20 .200*| .928 20 .140 35.00 .110 20 .200*| .926 20 .128 * This is a lower bound of the true significance. a Lilliefors Significance Correction As we can clearly see, some samples are normally distributed and some are not... Questions we'd like to ask Null hypothesis is that the treatment produced no change in any of the 22 attributes of activity measured. We would like to know (assuming the experimental conditions were the same) whether the treatment had any statistically significant effect on any of the 22 behavioural attributes in the following combinations primarily. Considering only the data collected at final timepoint Within the treatment and placebo (in each group) Comparing treatment of Group A with placebo of Group B and C Comparing placebo of Group A with placebo of Group B and C Considering data collected at initial and final time points comparing degree of change between treatment and placebo (in each group) So, how do we do it? Our original approach was to average the 25 datapoints collected over 5 days (hence avg the datapoints per sample), and do a t-test between the groups... is that sufficient? I really do hope I am clear and I am willing to upload more data as and when required
