Wouldn't multiple filters in a convolutional layer learn the same parameter during training?

Based from what I have learned, we use multiple filters in a Conv Layer of a CNN to learn different feature detectors. But since these filters are applied similarly (i.e. slided and multiplied to regions of the input), wouldn't they just learn the same parameters during training? Hence the use of multiple filters would be redundant?
