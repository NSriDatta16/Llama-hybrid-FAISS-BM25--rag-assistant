IMO the best way is, Panel should bind to control's wx.EVT_LEFT_DOWN and drag only when special key combination e.g. cntrl-alt-d are pressed Panel can do it recursively or have a function in Panel, addControl and only such control will be hooked. Your point that "individual controls may already be using that event for other purposes" is not valid because either you can use that event for dragging or not, you can't have both way. If you want drag on control to be used as drag of whole group, then you MUST override such event, but with doing dragging only inspecial key combination or modes you can let child control have their behaviour too.
