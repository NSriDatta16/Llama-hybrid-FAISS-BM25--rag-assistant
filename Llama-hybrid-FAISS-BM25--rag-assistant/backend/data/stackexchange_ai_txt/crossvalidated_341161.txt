I don't think it's a well established term. In the context of the paper, "recognition" seems to be the task of determining a probability distribution over the latent variables in the model. For example, in VAE, the encoder of the network is trained to model $p(z|X)$ by directly estimating the parameters $\mu$ and $\sigma$. The encoder is what the paper calls the recognition network. We learn recognition networks that output conjugate graphical model potentials instead of outputting the complete variational distributionâ€™s parameters directly. These potentials are then used in graphical model inference algorithms in place of the non-conjugate observation likelihoods. The authors seem to propose recognition networks which model $p(z|X)$ in a more indirect manner rather than simply predicting the parameters directly.
