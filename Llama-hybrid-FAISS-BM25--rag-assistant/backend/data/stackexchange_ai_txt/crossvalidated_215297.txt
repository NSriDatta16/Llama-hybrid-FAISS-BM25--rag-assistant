I am not claiming that this is a case for your data (as this requires analysis of the data), but here is a general, relatively important, issue with depending on correlation: Correlation of the variable with the dependent one has the same assumption as Naive Bayes - independence of the variables. Thus, the only thing you are able to test this way is "in the absence of all other features, how well would I describe my dependent variable, if I fit a monotonic model to this one, selected feature". These are two, extremely strong, assumptions. Consequently you completely omit any, even a bit complex, relation. For example if you have a numeric variable, such that every time it is odd, your true label is 1, and every time it is even it is 0 - your correlation test will say "there is nothing interesting in this variable", while you have full knowledge about dependent variable, as it is y = x % 2 . Furthermore, even if the relation is monotonic and simple, but involves multiple factors - you will miss it too! Random Forest, on the other hand, does not make this kind of assumptions, it builds a complex, nonlinear model, and assess variables importance according to degree to which it is used in its internal decision process. Consequently - it is incomparably better method of assessing the importance, than the correlation test.
