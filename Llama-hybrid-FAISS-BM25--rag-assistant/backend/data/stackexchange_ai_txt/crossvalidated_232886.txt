In Granger causality test, what does very low p-value means when you know there is little correlation

I am testing a comparison between two time series to see if/how a variable Xs interacts/affects variable Ys. I have come across some cases where I use cross-correlation where I verify there is little correlation and anti-correlation but the p-values of these cases are like 0.00001. According to what I understood the lower the p-value is the higher the chance of the Null hypothesis being false. However since the cross-correlation algorithm says there is little correlation between them, I find odd the p-value being so low. So what I want to know is, in what situations this can happen or if low p-value can mean something else, or even if all my approach/logic is rubbish since I am self-learning and doing this for the first time so there a decent chance that might happen.
