In McElreath's Statistical Rethinking (2020) he gives an example almost exactly like what you are describing, where in chemical analyses there is a threshold below which something (e.g. the concentration of a specific compound) cannot be measured. In this case he discusses the use of a hurdle model . From what I'm reading on them, they could be applicable to your analysis, and they can also be fit relatively easily using Stan. https://mc-stan.org/docs/2_20/stan-users-guide/zero-inflated-section.html McElreath, R.
