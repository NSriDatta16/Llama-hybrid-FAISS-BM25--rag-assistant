Calling View Controller Method in ApplicationDelegate - warning me ... but also works

I need to set my root UIViewController as the delegate for one of its modal child UIViewControllers (runwayAnalysisViewController). I implemented a delegate protocol which my root UIViewController adopts. [runwayAnalysisViewController setSettingsDelegate: self]; (self being the parent UIViewController) Unfortunately, I am receiving the classic error, "runwayAnalysisViewController may not respond to "-setSettingsDelegate: method." the delegate is declared as such in the RunwayAnalysisViewController class: id settingsDelegate; -thence: @property(nonatomic, assign) id settingsDelegate; it is synthesized in the .m file as well. I have tried synthesizing the accessor & mutator methods for the delegate as well as manually writing the same but to no avail. (other attempt, methods declared in interface and implemented as shown:) -(void)setSettingsDelegate:(id)aDelegate { settingsDelegate = aDelegate; } -(id)settingsDelegate { return settingsDelegate; } Strangely enough, while this warning persists, I implemented the single method of this delegate as follows: #pragma mark - SettingsRequestDelegate Methods -(void)userDidRequestSettingsAccess:(id)sender { NSLog(@"User did request settings access"); } I am able to get a successful message sent from the delegate to the parent UIViewController! Any help would be appreciated.
