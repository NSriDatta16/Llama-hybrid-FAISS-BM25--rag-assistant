loading gMaps data into Fancybox

I have an address and a little map icon and when the user clicks on the icon it loads up Fancybox with the gMaps data in it. Now, at first I tried to see how I could have my load into the Fancybox modal. After trying like for ever to figure this out with ever API option available to me from Fancybox.net I gave up and went the hard coded way. $('#details a#map-home').live('click', function(){ var name = $('#details').find('#dFname').text(); var address = $('#details').find('.address').text(); var city = $('#details').find('.city').text(); var state = $('#details').find('.state').text(); var zip = $('#details').find('.zip').text(); var hmap = address + ', ' + city + state + zip; var tmap = hmap.replace(' ', '+'); $('#details').append(' '); $('a#map-home').fancybox({ 'titlePosition' : 'outside', 'title' : 'This is where ' + name + ' lives', //'transitionIn' : 'none', //'transitionOut' : 'none', 'modal' : false, 'autoScale' : true, 'autoDimensions' : true, 'centerOnScroll' : true, 'hideOnOverlayClick' : false, //'overlayOpacity' : 0.15 'onStart' : hMap //'content' : hMap, //'href' : 'http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=' + tmap + '&t=h&z=18&iwloc=A&output=embed' }); function hMap(){ $('#hmap').gMap({ markers: [{ address: "\"" + hmap + "\"", html: "_address" }], address: "\"" + hmap + "\"", zoom: 18 }); } return false; }); This way, when the user clicks on the map icon the js creates the div that is then loaded with the gMaps data which is then loaded into Fancybox... (thats a mouth full) 2 things, 1 when I click on the icon nothing happens. I need to double click or perform two click to get the Fancybox to load. 2nd fancybox does load the map but it loads like 75% of the map and the rest looks grey. I then figured out that for some reason the map is being loaded but with an offset of left: -200px top: -75px or something like that. Is there a more efficient way of doing this? you can see my example at www.helixagent.com login is test/password go to contacts for Test Contact
