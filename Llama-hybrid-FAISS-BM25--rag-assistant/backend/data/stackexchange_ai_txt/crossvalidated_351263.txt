Notes: if you have two NN who train on the same features, you can make a single one with a two row vector prediction. Also instead of having a loss function converging to sum_ret_theoretical , maybe you could tweak it to have a score to maximize. Case 1: If you do stochastic gradient descent (batch size = 1), the loss function is either undefined or 0. Case 2: If your batch size > 1, your loss function can be undefined if neural_output_1 = 1 after neural_output_2 = 1 . Therefore I believe you cannot achieve it. To deal with temporal data, check out recurrent neural networks. To maximize gain, check out (deep) reinforcement learning. Here, it looks like you're trying to train with data from the future, which bidirectional RNN could handle. But if you're planning to trade, you can't use data from the future.
