Probably the difference between logical focus and keyboardfocus is biting you. You can read about it here . Pay particular attention to the part about focus scope. You have implemented code to set the logical focus to your user control when the HasFocus property is set to true, but you do nothing when it is set to false. In that case the logical focus will stay where it is. On the other hand, you have not hooked up an event handler for the user control's lostfocus event. That means that your HasFocus property will once more be unaffected when the control loses focus.
