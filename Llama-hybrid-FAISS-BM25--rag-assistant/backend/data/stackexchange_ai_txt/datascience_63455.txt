How could I improve my FB Prophet forecast?

I've got 1325 days of revenue data and when plotting the components it makes 100% sense from a domain expert point of view, so the model is capturing the variations quite well (or it seems it does...). I've added the country holidays using m.add_country_holidays(country_name='GB') However, when it comes to accuracy I'm getting the following averages: MAPE: 0.3 MAE: 721,415 721,415 is not an acceptable error. Around 100K would be. These are the MAE and MAPE plots: Time-series plot: Performance metrics (first 20): What else can I do to improve the accuracy of this model? Thank you
