How Can I Check if a string represents an positive, non-zero int?

I don't need to know WHAT the int is, I just need to know if it is a positive, non-zero integer representation in Decimal representation, with no leading 0's. It's going to be called for a large number of records, so I'd like it to be as inexpensive a check as possible. The expected behaviour is that the system should never be passed something that doesn't validate (because it's normally passed ints which it converts to strings for storage) so this is just a final safety check to make sure nothing weird's happened.
