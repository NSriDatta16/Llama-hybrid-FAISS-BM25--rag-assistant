ReLu layer in CNN (RGB Image)

I am able to get convoluted values from RGB Image lets say for each channel. So I have red channel with values: -100,8,96,1056,-632,2,3.... Now what I do is that I normalize this values in range 0-255 because that is range of rgb values basically with code Math.Max(minValue, Math.Min(maxValue, currentValue)) . But I don't understand how relu works in CNN. From my point of view I am alredy doing it in my normalization right? Because ReLu layer is from 0 to x where max value of x is 255. So my question is where should be applied ReLu in RGB image after convolution? (After convolution and normalization values are alredy in range 0-255)
