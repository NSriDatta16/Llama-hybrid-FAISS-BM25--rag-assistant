A recommended ORM tool for asp.net or help with SubSonic3 simple repository

I'm wanting to use an ORM tool for an asp.net web app I'm working on. I've put together all my classes and just want to have the data persisted. I downloaded SubSonic 3.0 and began using the simple Repository...which was brilliant. I'm new to ORM tools as my first experience commercially was the DataSets/Stored Procs world for a few years which I'm trying to move on from (even just academically)...anyway, the simple repository was so easy to use...except I'm stuck when it comes to data relationships. I was hoping to have a list property that would be persisted as two tables with a foreign key relationship etc... I've seen that I could manually add the extra foreign key Id's to objects but am now wondering whether I should go for a different ORM tool, as there seems to be a lot...any help much appreciated! Note: I've heard that nhibernate will do pretty much anything, but looking at some "start guides" it seemed a world of extra learning and time compared to the SubSonic 3.0 Simple Repository...But if that simplicity isn't available for what I'm after, I'll learn! edit Thanks for all your responses and suggestions...I tried out most of the suggestions hoping to avoid nhibernate but wasn't able to...I've bought NHibernate in Action and am taking the time to learn it which I can already see as being the right decision.
