A review of Structural Equation Modeling (SEM)

I'm interested in community thoughts on Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). My application is primarily consumer psychology. From the introductory material I've read, SEM offers an researcher a mechanism to define relationships between observed and latent variables. I've read that it's biggest drawback is that if you don't have extensive domain expertise to back up your hypothesized structure, you're likely to get terrible results. I've also read that different software packages can arrive at different conclusions given the same model specification. I'd like to elicit some opinions by experts on the utility, reliability, pros and cons on SEM. Edits: I primarily come from a Bayesian background and prefer PyMC3. I saw a Medium article that outlined an SEM where various psychological tests and job performance metrics were aggregated incorporated into one cohesive model. It seems that defining a joint likelihood could become tedious, hence why various specialty tools like LAVAAN exist. The Medium article noted that unless the model specification closely reflects reality, which is a tall order, SEM aren't great for predictive accuracy; they're best suited for giving a sanity check to your beliefs on how a system is structured (ie job performance being work ethic, intelligence, social aptitude, etc.)
