Changing an Image on TouchesBegan

Hey, I am trying to change the image when the user touches the ImageView. At the moment the ImageView has the image "heart1.png" so when i touch the ImageViewer on screen it will change to "heart2.png" this is my code, help is much appreciated: -(void) touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch = [[event allTouches] anyObject]; CGPoint location = [touch locationInView:self.view]; if (location.x >= imageView.frame.origin.x && location.x = imageView.frame.origin.y && location.y
