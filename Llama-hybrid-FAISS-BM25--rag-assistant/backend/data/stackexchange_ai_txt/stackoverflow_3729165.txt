I agree with Felixyz. OAuth whilst better than Basic Auth, still has a long way to go to be a good solution for mobile apps. I've been playing with using OAuth to authenticate a mobile phone app to a Google App Engine app. The fact that you can't reliably manage the consumer secret on the mobile device means that the default is to use the 'anonymous' access. The Google App Engine OAuth implementation's browser authorization step takes you to a page where it contains text like: "The site is requesting access to your Google Account for the product(s) listed below" YourApp(yourapp.appspot.com) - not affiliated with Google etc It takes from the domain/host name used in the callback url that you supply which can be anything on the Android if you use a custom scheme to intercept the callback. So if you use 'anonymous' access or your consumer secret is compromised, then anyone could write a consumer that fools the user into giving access to your gae app. The Google OAuth authorization page also does contain lots of warnings which have 3 levels of severity depending on whether you're using 'anonymous', consumer secret, or public keys. Pretty scary stuff for the average user who isn't technically savvy. I don't expect to have a high signup completion percentage with that kind of stuff in the way. This blog post clarifies how consumer secret's don't really work with installed apps. http://hueniverse.com/2009/02/should-twitter-discontinue-their-basic-auth-api/
