First, how do you sample from any probability distribution? The only way I can think of is if you have a random number generator from the target distribution. Then just generate these numbers and you have a sample. There are several methods to do this, but let's stick with the inverse method just as an example. As the wikipedia article notes, for continuous variables (distributions), we need to integrate the pdf, and this may be intractable for most distributions (integrals are hard to solve). So, we can't sample from distributions that we don't have a random number generator (rng) from those distributions. And in most Bayesian applications, posterior distributions are not from standard distributions, i.e., distributions that we have a rng. So, we can't sample directly from it.
