how to lay out a custom content type

I'm pretty new to drupal , and I'm amazed by the power of it . for my first practice I decided to build one of my favorite blogs , rogerebert.com . I decided to add a new content type for movie reviews called "review" and I gave it five fields . title, image,rating(using a star rating module) , writer , and body . it worked fine and as I expected , but I wanna know if I can manage the layout of my content type . I mean by default all of my fields are left aligned , but I want them to be center aligned with each other . and I also wanna know if there's a way to hide the "read more " and "post comment" on the teaser view of every "review " . thanks
