The maximum size that a FAT32 volume can be is 8TB. The 32GB limit that ognian mention was a limitation of Windows XP PRE SP3. The maximum size you will be able to make for the emulator would be 4GB, if you are creating the file on a FAT32 file system. The sdcard volume for the emulator is just a file, and the file size limit on FAT32 is 4GB. If you are using NTFS then you can create it as big as you want. Now there might be a limitation by the emulator to the 4.5GB that ognian mentioned, but I don't know and I don't have any need to try to create an sdcard volume that large for the emulator. If you need that much space, maybe your app shouldn't be developed for a mobile device. I can tell you that there is no way I would install an app that said I must have 4.5+ GB of free space on my SD card. Just so you are clear too, the size of the SD card does not increase the memory available to the device, it only increases the storage space available. Its like comparing RAM and a Hard Drive .
