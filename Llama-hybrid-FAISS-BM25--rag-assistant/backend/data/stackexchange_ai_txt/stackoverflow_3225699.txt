I can understand why this might seem inconvenient for small projects. However, if you ever have to work on a project with hundreds (or thousands) of source files, having intuitive sub-packages are an absolute necessity to keep everything organized. As far as loading external dependencies based on the relative path from where the source file is located, it all depends on how the compiled application is organized. It is not typical to reference resources with "..\img" like you describe.
