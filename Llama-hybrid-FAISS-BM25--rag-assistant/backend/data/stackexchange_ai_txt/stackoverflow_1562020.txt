Restricting the use of back button without JavaScript

I'm currently involved in an ASP.NET project where I need to restrict the users ability to go back in the page structure using the back button. It is essentially a wizard style navigation and I don't want to give the user the ability to go back from the last step and re-submit the data. JavaScript is not an option unfortunately, so I "solved" it by setting the HttpCacheability in every pages Load event to NoCache. This gives the user the "Page expired" page when he or she clicks the back button. It isn't very elegant at all, and I'm wondering what other options I have to achive the desired results.
