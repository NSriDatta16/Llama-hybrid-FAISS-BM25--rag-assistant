C# WPF DragMove without Window_LocationChanged()

I implemented something in Windows Forms similar to DragMove but with boundaries set to 10 units of the margins of the primary screen. When switching over to WPF I found this thread to be useful in achieving the same result. However, since this is a post-move event, what happens is that if my window is dragged beyond the boundaries I set, it "jumps" back. I would like to avoid this effect as it looks terrible. Is there a simple way to avoid the window to be moved outside a given area without using the LocationChanged event? I basically want to restrict the movement of the window before it happens.
