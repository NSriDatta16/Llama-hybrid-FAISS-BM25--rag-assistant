While possible (just install into a different location) and without known problems on the Mac side, it is strongly discouraged. That is, some apps show sloppy behaviour on iOS 4 - which is simply fixed by recompiling with new new SDK. Just set the SDK base to whatever the newest (stable) version is. You can set your deployment target as low as you want, i.e. we use 4.0 base sdk and 3.0 as minimum deployment target at the moment.
