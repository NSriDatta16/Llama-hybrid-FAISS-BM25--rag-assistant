For those that come after, this is the information that we discovered about deploying Jambi via webstart to Mac OS X. qtjambi-macosx-gcc-4.5.2_01 can not be found when installing/launching from webstart. If this library is on your path, webstart is able to find it and use it, and will launch correctly. Further, there are some JNLP properties that need to be set. The property com.trolltech.launcher.webstart is required to inform the Jambi libraries that we are starting via webstart, and to configure itself in such a way that allows webstart to work. Unfortunately, it's broken for mac os x at this point in time. The QTJambi Community Port to 4.6 solves the above problem, but introduces a new problem. http://qt.gitorious.org/qt-jambi/community-port-to-4_6 http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/qtjambi/ticket/37 I've investigated this bug as well, and it requires changing one line of code to get working, namely, changing the class loader to play nice with webstart (more secure class loader). I haven't attempted yet, due to the build system being quite off putting and not having the time to investigate properly. So, if you're having troubles deploying QT Jambi applications with webstart on Mac OSX, you now know why. If anyone gets around to changing 4.6, please post here and update this information. Alternatively, if I get around to changing it, I'll post here also. Useful references: http://doc.qt.nokia.com/qtjambi-4.3.5_01/com/trolltech/qt/qtjambi-systemproperties.html
