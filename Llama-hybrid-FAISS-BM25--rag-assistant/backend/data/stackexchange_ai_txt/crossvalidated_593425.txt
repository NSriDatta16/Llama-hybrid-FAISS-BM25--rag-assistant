Random forest assumptions; non-independence of observations

I have been having a difficult time finding out if my random forest classifier is actually properly designed. I have built a random forest model, however the observations I have used are not independent i.e., they come from a repeat measures study. For example, I have 20 observations but those 20 observations actually arise from only 3 animals: 1 animal had 10 tests, another had 7, and the third had 3. I have seen mention that correlation between variables isn't a huge concern especially if the variables are selected randomly at each node but I still can't find a solid answer as to if having dependence between some observations will be an issue. My rational has been that yes they are from the same animal, but they represent a different stage during the animals life. Thanks in advance!
