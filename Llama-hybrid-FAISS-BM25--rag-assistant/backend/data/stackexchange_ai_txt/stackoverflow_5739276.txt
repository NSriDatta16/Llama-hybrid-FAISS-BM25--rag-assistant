Users much prefer it if the number of characters in textarea is validated on submit. If it's less than 100, cancel the submit and give the user an error message saying why. Presumably there's a hint on the page so the user should know of the 100 character criterion and how many characters they've entered. If you really want the button disabled, then disable it using script when the page loads. Use a key-up listener to count the characters in the textarea and enable the submit button if there's more than 100. You may need to listed to other events too so if the user changes the text by dragging or paste, then the submit button's disabled property is updated appropriately.
