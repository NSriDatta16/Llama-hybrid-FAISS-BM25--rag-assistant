Are there any mathematical drawbacks with this idea? Yes, you will lose statistical power as well as running into multiple testing problems. Don't split the dataset. How do I compare the resulting n models to my other model? I am unsure on how to interpret the n resulting metrics (i.e., a cross-validated r squared score) to those of my other model. You won't have to if you don't split the dataset Is there a python/sklearn implementation of my idea? Right now I manually split the input depending on the value of c when training and evaluating the models. Probably. It's the type of mistaken thing people do in data science, and Python is used a lot in data science. However, here we try to guide people into a better way of doing things. Fit a single model on the entire dataset. Include the variable c as a fixed effect and also fit interactions with this variable and your other variables.
