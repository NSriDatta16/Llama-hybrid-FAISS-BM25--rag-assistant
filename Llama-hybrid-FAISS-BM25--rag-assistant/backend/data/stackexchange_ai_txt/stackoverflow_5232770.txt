Mechanize not logging in to site properly

After spending the best part of 3 hours getting nowhere, i thought i would ask a question myself. i am using python and mechanize 's Browser . I am trying to login to my home router. i can get to the login page, fill the password field (eg br.form['password'] = 'mypassword' etc), but now i am stuck because no matter what i try, i always get sent to a page saying i am forbidden/session has timed out i am handling cookies with a cookie jar, i have handled robots, but it still doesnt love me enough to let me login.... help? if you have any suggestions as to why i can not login successfully, please, please, please share xxx EDIT: it does have javascript, but i am simulating it **EDIT2:** i just realized that the javascript i am simulating is for pressing the disconnect button on the previous page...... probably fix my problem if i emulate the javascript for this page ...... i am faking the user agent i will have a look w/ wireshark xxx ps thanks for replying so fast xx UPDATE: sigh. i think it may just be one of those things where you just have to say f it and move on because i am emulating the javascript it needed exactly as it is done (just checking, MD5 == hashlib.md5("...").hexdigest()?).... thanks anyway people xxx
