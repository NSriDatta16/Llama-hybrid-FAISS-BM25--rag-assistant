Regular expressions will likely be faster, but they are also likely the worse choice. Unless you have benchmarked and profiled your application and found nothing else to optimize, you should look into a proper existing parser. While Regular Expressions can be used to match HTML, it takes a thorough effort to come up with a reliable parser . PHP offers a bunch of native extensions to work with XML (and HTML) reliably. There is also a number of third party libraries. See my answer to Best Methods to parse HTML As for sending a custom user agent, this is possible with DOM too. You have to create a custom stream context and attach it with the underlying libxml functions . You can supply any of the available HTTP Stream context options this way . See my answer to DOMDocument::validate() problem for an example how to supply a custom UserAgent.
