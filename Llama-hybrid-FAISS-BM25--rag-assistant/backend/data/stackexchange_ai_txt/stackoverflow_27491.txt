Be aware that most MTAs (Mail Transfer Agent) will have the VRFY command turned off for spam protection reasons, they'll probably even block you if you try several RCPT TO in a row (see http://www.spamresource.com/2007/01/whatever-happened-to-vrfy.html ). So even if you find a library to do that verification, it won't be worth a lot. Ishmaeel is right, the only way to really find out, is sending an email and see if it bounces or not. @Hrvoje: Yes, I'm suggesting you monitor rejected emails. BUT: not all the bounced mails should automatically end up on your "does not exist"-list, you also have to differentiate between temporary (e.g. mailbox full) and permanent errors.
