Using Logistic regression or Linear regression depend on the dependent variable(DV). Based on your question, I believe that your DV will be infertitlity(Yes/No) so you should use logistic regression because linear regression is for the continuous variables(e.g:exam score) and logistic regression is for categorical variables(e.g.L Yes/NO)
