Yes In information retrieval, precision and recall are used to evaluate search algorithms. For example, if I were to have a fixed test database of 1000 books. Of those 1000 only 10 are from the the author Steven King. A high precision search algorithm would only return books written by Steven King but it would probably not return all of them, maybe seven of them. A high recall algorithm would return all 10 of the Steven King books but it would also return books by other authors that have name King or Steven. Balancing both precision and recall is a key concept in Information retrieval. Typically the weighted harmonic mean of precision over recall is used. It is called the F-Measure .
