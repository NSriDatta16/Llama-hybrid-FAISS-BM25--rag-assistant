This isn't sufficiently well motivated. Feature selection should not be done blindly, and your thinking should not be passed off onto the computer. You need to consider what you are trying to do and why, and what your features mean and how they may relate to the analysis. Consider the classic clustering example: entity type_of location whale mammal water monkey mammal land banana fruit land How should these data be clustered? It depends on the kind of potential clusters you are interested in. Selecting type_of will yield taxonomic clusters; selecting location will yield geographic clusters. Both / either would be 'right' in some sense. You need to decide what sense you are interested in. This is done prior to looking at the data, and is ultimately similar to feature selection in supervised modeling. Similar concerns can be raised with the unsupervised analysis of feature correlations (e.g., PCA or factor analysis). Having figured out what variables are relevant for what you want to do, and having conducted a clustering, it isn't difficult to see which variables play the strongest roles in determining the the clustering result by examining the separability on each variable, or in groups of variables (see, Mirkin, 1999).
