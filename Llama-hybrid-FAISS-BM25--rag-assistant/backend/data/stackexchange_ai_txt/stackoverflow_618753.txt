When you use Linq to SQL, you'd be pretty much stuck with SQL Server, as far as I know. If you use Linq to DataSet, you'll lose a bit of ease of programming: With Linq, you can use the Linq entities directly while with DataSets, you have to keep using the DataSet name (MyDataSet.Entity = new MyDataSet.Entity()), which gets old after a while. I think that that's the only sacrifice. However, you can use it with e.g. Oracle (did that on a project). It's also pretty much drag-and-drop with a bit more control on the DataAdapter (as far as I know - I've never had to tweak Linq-to-SQL that much), you can specify (e.g.) which queries to use, etc. Since you can still define relationships between tables in DataSets, you can still use Linq well enough, so you won't really see problems there. I assume that reliability is as good with Linq-to-DataSet as with Linq-to-SQL (never had problems), performance seemed to be good enough, never could really profile it, though.
