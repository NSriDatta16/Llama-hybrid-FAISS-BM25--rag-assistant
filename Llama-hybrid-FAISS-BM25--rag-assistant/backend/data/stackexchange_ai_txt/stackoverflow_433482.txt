I have found that if you need to have CODE deciding what to do based on the exception returned, create a well named exception subclassing a common base type. The message passed should be considered "human eyes only" and too fragile to make decisions upon. Let the compiler do the work! If you need to pass this up to a higher layer through a mechanism not aware of checked exceptions, you can wrap it in a suitable named subclass of RuntimeException (MailDomainException) which can be caught up high, and the original cause acted upon.
