The average number of success with success rate p is p for binomial distribution . So the difference between p and 0.9 * p is proportional to p . In your examples, 10% of 0.44 is much greater than 10% of 0.0044 . The figure below shows the probability density of the success number from 1000 draws. The success rates are 0.05, 0.5, 0.95 for the solid lines from left to right. The success rates of the dashed lines are 10% smaller than the solid lines. Observe that the variance is wider in the middle and thinner on both sides, but its effect on power is not as strong as the distance between peaks. (Note that the variance of average success is p(1-p)/n ) The R code for the plot. N = 1000 x_ = 0:N plot(x_/N, dbinom(x_, size=N, prob=0.05) * N, type='l', xlab='Mean success number', ylab='Density') lines(x_/N, dbinom(x_, size=N, prob=0.05*0.9) * N, lty=2) lines(x_/N, dbinom(x_, size=N, prob=0.5) * N, col='red') lines(x_/N, dbinom(x_, size=N, prob=0.5*0.9) * N, lty=2, col='red') lines(x_/N, dbinom(x_, size=N, prob=0.95) * N, col='blue') lines(x_/N, dbinom(x_, size=N, prob=0.95*0.9) * N, lty=2, col='blue')
