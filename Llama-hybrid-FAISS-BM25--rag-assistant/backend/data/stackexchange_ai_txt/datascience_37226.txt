Sound to me as a perfect candidate for a Holt-Winters model with a 24 hours seasonality. The trend should not be really sensitive on the time scale you use. An other way to go would be to compute the seasonality by averaging a great number of 24-hours cycle. Then study the de-seasonlized data. Once you understand what is happening, you have a chance to teach it to your LSTM.
