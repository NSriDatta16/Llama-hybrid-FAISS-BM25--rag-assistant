It is usually best to use a model with all the data, and then include interactions. I discussed this at Separate Models vs Flags in the same model , see also How to test a curvilinear relationship in a logistic regression . For your data I would try a generalized additive model (see tag gam ), a very good and flexible implementations is mgcv R (there might be something in SPSS, but I do not know about that). In reality, gam's as implemented in mgcv can be seen as a modern, flexible implementation of glm's (generalized linear models), and what I show here could be done, more or less, with glm plus some spline packages. But the modern, flexible way is shown below. So, something like library(mgcv) yourdf Here I assume that grave_goods, sex, ses are factors, and that ses has few levels (probably 2?). The above is then a base model, with smooth effects, but without interactions. Interactions can be modeled using terms such as s(age_at_death, by=sex) or s(age_at_death, by=ses) or even s(age_at_death, by=interaction(sex,ses)) (same with year_of_death ). For interactions between the two numerical variables we have to be careful, since they will have very different ranges ... but something like the following: s(age_at_death) + s(year_of_death) + ti(age_at_death, year_of_death) Here is some useful material on mgcv made available by ith author Simon Wood.
