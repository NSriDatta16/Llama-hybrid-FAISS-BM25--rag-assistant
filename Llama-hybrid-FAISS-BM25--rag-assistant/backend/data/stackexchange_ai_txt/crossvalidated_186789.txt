What are the values of output $g_i$ in Bengio's paper "Taking on the Curse of Dimensionality in Joint Distributions Using Neural Networks"

Figure 2 of Bengio's paper "Taking on the Curse of Dimensionality in Joint Distributions Using Neural Networks" describes a neural network structure for estimating a joint probability distribution. Question : What are the values $g_i$ used during the training of the model?
