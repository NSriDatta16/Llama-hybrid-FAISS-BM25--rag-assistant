Fitting a curve knowing points uncertainty

I have a set of points X and Y that represent a curve. It is not a linear curve but a model I cannot estimate analitically. I know the uncertainy on Y (1 sigma) and there is no uncertainty on X. Due to these uncertainties, the points are not always elegantly aligned as you can see in the image below. . My question is the following : Does exist a method that, taking into account the uncertainties on the Y coordinate, will allow me to modify the curve in order to have a better estimated model, with correctly aligned points. In this case, is there a library, for example in R, that I could use? This method could allow me to add points as well in some locations (interpolate some missing points, for example around X = 0.1). For the interpolation, I know that I could perform linear or log interpolation, but I really want to consider the Y uncertainties. I would like, as a result, a set of new points (X,Y). The objective is to smooth the curve without damaging the accuracy. The uncertainty on each point is 0.9% and I would like to construct a smoothed curves based on this one, keeping an uncertainty close to 1%. For instance it could be done by generating many curves by samling the points in their uncertainty, and then computing the mean of all curves. This would probably give me a smoothed curve without any points having such discrepancies as the ones represented in red. Many thanks for your help/suggestions.
