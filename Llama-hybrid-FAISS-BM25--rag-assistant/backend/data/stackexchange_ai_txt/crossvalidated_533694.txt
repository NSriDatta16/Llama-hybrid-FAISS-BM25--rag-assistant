I don't think it's wise to compare standard Cox models with coxphw -weighted models via AIC. With AIC comparisons among models you need to watch out for possible offsets of reported AIC values by a constant. See the Wikipedia entry . Although I haven't thought this through carefully, I fear that the estimated likelihood implied in the work-around proposed by Smith et al might not be comparable to the partial likelihood from a standard Cox model, particularly with respect to that constant offset. You could examine that issue with models of simulated data, I suppose. For comparing models with different predictors on the same data set, it's probably best to stick with the same model-fitting approach: all standard Cox or all coxphw . If proportional hazards hold for one Cox model then the coxphw weighting shouldn't matter, as the event-average (standard Cox) and weighted-average ( coxphw ) models should be pretty much the same. If PH doesn't hold for a Cox model it won't for the coxphw -weighted model either. You just get what might be considered a better "average HR" estimate--of something that, absent PH, isn't really an HR.
