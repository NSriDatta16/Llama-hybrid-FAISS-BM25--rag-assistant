As Patrick mentioned, you are receiving an event object as parameter to your onContentMenu callback function, where you can find the element triggered the event. I am using this code for cross-browser compatibility. var oE = event.srcElement || event.originalTarget; Note: originalTarget is Mozilla specific. You might want to pay attention to event.target https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/event.target
