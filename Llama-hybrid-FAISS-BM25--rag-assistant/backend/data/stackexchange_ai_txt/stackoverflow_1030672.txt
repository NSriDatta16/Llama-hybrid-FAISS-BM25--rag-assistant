John was the first and I think his solution should be preferred, because it's way more elegant, however here is another one: $site = implode("/", array_filter(explode("/", $site))); Update Thx. I updated it and now even handles things like this $site = "///test///test//"; /* to => test/test */ Which probably makes it even cooler than the accepted answer ;)
