First of all of course the programming task (NLP etc. as mentioned) is interesting. But as mentioned it's overkill aiming to perfect that. But the other view is as mentioned ("social"), who enters the data, who views it, how long and how correct should it be? So it's a naming convention issue and reminds me to the great project musicbrainz.org - should your site "just work" or do you prefer to go along standards, in latter case i would orient myself along the mb project - in case you haven't done that and not heard of it. ie. see here for Above & Beyond : they have on alias defined, they use it to match user searches. http://musicbrainz.org/show/artist/aliases.html?artistid=58438 check out also the Artist_Alias page in the wiki. The data model is worth a look and there are even several API bindings to sync data, also in python.
