Are all of the default scripts loaded by Magento really needed?

Here's a listing of all the scripts loaded by Magento by default: ../js/prototype/prototype.js //prototype library ../js/prototype/validation.js //don't know what this does ../js/scriptaculous/builder.js //don't know what this does ../js/scriptaculous/effects.js //base scriptaculous effects library? ../js/scriptaculous/dragdrop.js //component of scriptaculous effects ../js/scriptaculous/controls.js //not sure? ../js/scriptaculous/slider.js //more scriptaculous effects ../js/varien/js.js //don't know what this is ../js/varien/form.js //form validation scripts? ../js/varien/menu.js //menu/drop down menu scripts ../js/mage/translate.js //don't know what this does ../js/mage/cookies.js //don't know what this does these scripts total 316.8K of javascript... all in various states of being minified (for example, prototype.js isn't minified). So my first question: 1) Aside from prototype.js, are all of the others really that needed? and 2) What is the "correct" way to remove these scripts? Layout updates? Or hardcoded in templates? I want to make the loading of my magento site as light weight as possible. thanks!
