You can't prevent that from happen. However, you can override the CSS rules. Give your main element a unique id (which really should be unique by obfustation, like "yourapplicationname_mainelement_name" or something), then override all possible styles that might give strange effects on your html. Your plugin: My paragraph that must not be styled Your css: #yourapplicationname_mainelement_name p { display: block; color: black; background: white; position: relative; ... and so on ... } As your css style rules are the most specific, given your id, they will override any settings present on the page where your html is injected. Further... It might be hard to see what rules are the most important. You can use firebug or similar to understand which is overriding another. You'll have a hard time without it when developing your application.
