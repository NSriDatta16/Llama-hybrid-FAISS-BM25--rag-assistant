COM : Can IBindCtx* parameter of IMoniker::BindToObject be NULL?

I am using IMoniker::BindToObject function, and I have read the article on MSDN. The article doen't say the first parameter can be NULL, but the example code on the following page uses NULL as the argument : http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd407292%28VS.85%29.aspx (hr = pMoniker->BindToStorage(0, 0, IID_IPropertyBag, (void **)&pPropBag);) (hr = pMoniker->BindToObject(NULL, NULL, IID_IBaseFilter, (void**)&pFilter);) since I don't quite understand the use of this parameter and I don't need the extra binding information returned by the function, I would like to ask "can the argument be NULL?". thanks in advance.
