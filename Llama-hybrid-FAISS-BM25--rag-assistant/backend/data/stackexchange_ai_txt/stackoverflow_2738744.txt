You could take the resulting data and put it into a data: URI (more info here ) but that won't work in IE, is likely to be slow, is not cachable in any way and uses 33% more memory than necessary due to the base64 encoding. The most elegant way would be for your script to write the image data to a file, and to return the URL of that new image. Your Ajax callback could then do a simple $("#myimage").src = data;
