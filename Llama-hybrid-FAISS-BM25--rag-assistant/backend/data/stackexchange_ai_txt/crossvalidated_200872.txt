I am trying to reply despite this being an old question. The risk of regression to the mean is always present when conducting an aggregate level meta-analysis. However, the risk is substantial in my opinion only when trying to correlate different features at an aggregate level. As far as I am aware, there is no specific test to evaluate it, but you can find some suggestions here: http://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1012&context=articles https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/correlation-and-regression/book17559 In any case, my pragmatic approach would be for you to proceed any way. In the worst case scenario you will inform readers of the meta-epidemiologic features of the evidence base. Whether your findings will be impactful will depend on the need for information and the competing sources of evidence.
