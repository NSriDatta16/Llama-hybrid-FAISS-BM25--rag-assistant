Detecting synchronization cascades in time series

I am researching delayed synchronisation in a system of coupled oscillators. There is a one-way causal connection between the oscillators, which leads to the synchronisation events occurring in a rough sequence. When I plot this data a very clear pattern emerges: I am looking for a way of identifying and fitting a line to the highlighted areas of the graph. Do you have any ideas on how to find these patterns?
