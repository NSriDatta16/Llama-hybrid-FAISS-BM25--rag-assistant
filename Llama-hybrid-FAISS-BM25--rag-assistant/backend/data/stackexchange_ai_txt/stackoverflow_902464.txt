Map Navigation Control Approach - .NET

I'd like to know what could be the best approach to develop a Windows desktop application that has a map navigability control - very similar to those in Google Maps and Live Maps, with drag and drop support and so on. Initially, due to time restrictions, I was thinking about a WinForms solution - I think one future solution using WPF would be better, but I'd have to learn all that WPF stuff first. With that in mind, what approach should I take to develop that? It could be a third part tool, or some simple implementation/algorithm that I could take some ideas from. To be honest, I'm kinda lost, so any idea would be helpful. Thanks, have a great day
