Data Science in the Cloud with Microsoft Azure Machine Learning and R is a free textbook which works through an example in great detail. Don't be put off by the particular tools used as you don't need them to get some benefit out of the book. Another one which I enjoyed is Programming Collective Intelligence which also goes through a number of projects in detail, including the web scraping part which most books gloss over.
