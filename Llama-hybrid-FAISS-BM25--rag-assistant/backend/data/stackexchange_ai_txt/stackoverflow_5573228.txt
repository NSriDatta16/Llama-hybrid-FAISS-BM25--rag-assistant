I would start with: throwing exception at certain points to see a stacktrace where the call originated. grep for Class Common for example create a directory listing to get a feeling for the organization of the software use get_included_files(); to see what is actually used for a certain call Start documenting what I find out Start working with an IDE, like NetBeans, Eclipse or Zend Studio Figuring out class hierarchies with maybe this "php: determining class hierarchy of an object at runtime" approach
