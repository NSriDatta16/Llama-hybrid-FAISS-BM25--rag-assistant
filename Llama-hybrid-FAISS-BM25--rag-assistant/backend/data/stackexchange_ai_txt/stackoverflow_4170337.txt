There's no need for plugins here, since you can access it very quickly: localStorage.setItem("key", "value"); var value = localStorage.getItem("key"); That's not to say someone won't make plugins in the future (but how would you do cross-browser support? either there's local storage or there isn't). But you don't need to wait on a plugin for anything here, you can start using it (provided the browser supports it) today.
