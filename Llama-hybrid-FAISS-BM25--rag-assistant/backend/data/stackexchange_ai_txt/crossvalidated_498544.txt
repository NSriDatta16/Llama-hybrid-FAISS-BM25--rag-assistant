Non-informative prior for Exponential

I am working with a Bayesian model: $T \sim exp(\theta)$ for survival data, I have chosen a gamma distribution as a prior since its conjugate by an exponential distribution. I'd like to choose a $\gamma(\alpha, \beta)$ non informative prior, since the exponential distribution has much of its probability around 0 I think it won't be convenient to choose $\gamma(0.001,0.001)$ as non informative for the exponential. Would it be convenient to choose an improper non informative gamma prior of the form $\gamma(1/3,0)$ taking into account I want to estimate later some parameters $\phi = h(\theta)$ using simulations of $\theta^{(1)}, \theta^{(2)}, \dots, \theta^{(M)}$ : $\phi^{(j)} = h(\theta^{(j)})$ . I know flat priors aren't invariant under re-parametrization.
