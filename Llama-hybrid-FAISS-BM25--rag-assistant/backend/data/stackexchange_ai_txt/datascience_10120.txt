PCA on acceleration time series data

Has anyone attempted Principal component analysis on time series and acceleration data(ie. data from accelerometer and sensors) and tried compressing it as well as regenerating back the data with minimum error? I wanted to know if this is possible using PCA. Kindly suggest alternate methods available to compress and regenrate my data.
