Good formula for turning star reviews into upvotes

I want to turn reviews of up to 5 stars and the number of reviews into upvotes. What's a good algorithm for doing this? A venue with 10 reviews total with a 5-star average rating should obviously get more upvotes than a venue with 10 reviews total with a 3-star average rating. Also, a venue with 60 ratings and a 4-star rating should probably get more upvotes than the one with 10 reviews and a 5-star rating. I need this rating to be based off of the total number of reviews and the average star rating, but I would also like the number to stay below a variable number (for example, say upvotes stay below 100, but I can also plug in 200 and it would stay below 200).
