Get size of file on disk

var length = new System.IO.FileInfo(path).Length; This gives the logical size of the file, not the size on the disk. I wish to get the size of a file on the disk in C# (preferably without interop ) as would be reported by Windows Explorer. It should give the correct size, including for: A compressed file A sparse file A fragmented file
