My simple regression is homoscedastic - should I use robust standard errors or both?

I've been asked to estimate the following simple regression with the 'appropriate' standard errors at 5% sig level and report the results in a table: logGDPcapita=β0+β1 AvExprRisk+u Dependent variable: ---------------------------- logpgp95 (1) (2) avexpr 0.522*** 0.522*** (0.061) (0.050) Constant 4.660*** 4.660*** (0.409) (0.320) Observations 64 64 R2 0.540 0.540 Adjusted R2 0.533 0.533 Residual Std. Error (df = 62) 0.713 0.713 F Statistic (df = 1; 62) 72.816*** 72.816*** ========================================================== Note: *p I used the Breusch-Pagan test and found p was much greater than 0.05 (0.39) which suggests homoscedasticity. However, most of the research I've done says I should almost always include robust standard errors, and there are omitted variables in this regression so I am skeptical that it is homoskedastic, is it appropriate to include both? Also, what does it mean if my robust standard errors are smaller?
