Confidence interval about a multivariate normal probability

From a given sample $x_i \underset{\mathrm{iid}}{\sim} {\cal N}(\mu, \sigma^2)$ it is possible to get a confidence interval about the probability $\Pr(x_i \geq a)$ for any number $a$, by "inverting" some tolerance intervals. If ${\boldsymbol x}_i \underset{\mathrm{iid}}{\sim}{\cal N}_p({\boldsymbol \mu}, \Sigma)$ is a sample from a $p$-variate normal distribution, how to get a confidence interval about the probability $\Pr(x_{i1} \geq a_1, \ldots, x_{ip} \geq a_p)$? It is easy to get a credible interval in the Bayesian framework, but what about frequentist methods? Is the bootstrap asymptotically valid? Does there exist another known approach? EDIT 15/09/2012: The Delta method should be possible. If someone is comfortable with the calculations I would be glad if he posts the solution here ;)
