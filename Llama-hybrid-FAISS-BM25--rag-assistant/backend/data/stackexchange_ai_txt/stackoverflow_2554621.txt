Actually, since you already know an imperative language, learning C won't take you much time at all. The basics are all the same -- if statements, while loops, for loops etc. Even the way the namespaces are organized are similar (although the guts of course are different.) You might want to gloss over some of the pointer handling, as C++ does references a little differently, but you would not be doing yourself any harm by picking up and reading through a copy of K&R (the official C reference) at least once. (Every decent programmer should have a copy on his bookshelf as a reference, anyway.) After that, pick up a recent edition of Stroustrup and have at it, ensuring that you work through the exercises. Some of the concepts may be a little foreign to a Perl-oriented mind, but it won't be too strange. If you encounter a particular concept you find tricky, post again on SO and there will be lots of people happy to go through it with you! (source: wikimedia.org ) (source: att.com )
