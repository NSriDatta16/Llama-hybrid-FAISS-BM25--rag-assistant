It depends on the use you have of the data received from the external machine. If you must have the data for the calculations of the morning after or do not have confidence in your network, you would prefer to loose-couple the two systems and enable some message-queuing between them so that if something fails during the night like the DBs, the networks links, anything that would be a pain for you to recover, you can start every morning with some data. If the data retrieval is not subject to a high degree of criticality, any solution is good :) Regarding SSIS, it's just a great ETL framework (yes, there's a subtlety :)). But I don't see it as a part of the data transfer, rather in the ETL part when your data has been received or is still waiting in the message-queing system.
