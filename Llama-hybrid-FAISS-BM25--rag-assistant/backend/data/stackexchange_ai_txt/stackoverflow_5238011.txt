Several of your options would work just fine, but I would vote for #4. My company also creates and releases embedded SW packages, and we require storage of the actual binaries we deliver (along with build documentation, various output file formats, etc...) in addition to tagging the SW revision in the repository. I agree with Greg Hewgill's response regarding placing them on a file server in a distinct directory. If, on the other hand, you are looking for a more complete SCM tool, Redmine is a great open-source option. Redmine provides SVN (or Hg, Git, etc...) bindings, issue tracking, file management, and so on. It's not just a file repository, but a more complete SCM tool. Additionally, wikipedia has a comprehensive list of SCM tools , many of which can be configured easily to act as a deliverable storage tool.
