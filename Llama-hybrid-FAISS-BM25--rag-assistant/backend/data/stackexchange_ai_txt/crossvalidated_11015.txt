New development in variable selection in clustering using MCMC?

The latest general framework I know in MCMC-based wrapper method (doing variable selection and clustering simultaneously) are the paper " Bayesian variable selection in clustering high-dimensional data " of Tadesse et al (2005) and the paper " Variable selection in clustering via Dirichlet process mixture models " of Kim et al (2006). I wonder if there are any new developments in this area? In particular, has anyone tried to extend the model of Tadesse?
