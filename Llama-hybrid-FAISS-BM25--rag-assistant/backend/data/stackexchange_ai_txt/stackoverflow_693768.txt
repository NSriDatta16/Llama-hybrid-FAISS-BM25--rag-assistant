The standard way of doing this is with a session-based store of a message you wish to display. It's common enough that there is a view-based helper, FlashMessenger . The FlashMessenger helper allows you to pass messages that the user may need to see on the next request. To accomplish this, FlashMessenger uses Zend_Session_Namespace to store messages for future or next request retrieval. It is generally a good idea that if you plan on using Zend_Session or Zend_Session_Namespace, that you initialize with Zend_Session::start() in your bootstrap file. (See the Zend_Session documentation for more details on its usage.)
