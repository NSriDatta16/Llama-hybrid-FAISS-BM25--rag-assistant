How to secure private admin forms in Heroku

How would i go about securing private use Admin forms in Heroku? These are forms to administer the site - edit master (or static) data, settings etc. Normally I would never expose these to the internet in general and would just apply basic account security on the app to manage internal privileges. i.e. the sort of things i'm wondering about? Is https a must to secure a site when using authlogic? Is it possible (how) to configure your webserver to require SSL on certain routes only? Is Authlogic + SSL secure enough to secure a page which if compromised could destroy your entire business? Is there a way of leveraging heroku's admin account security to lock down a part of a site to it's owner only? I guess managing the site using the PG Console would give me the security i require but not the usability.
