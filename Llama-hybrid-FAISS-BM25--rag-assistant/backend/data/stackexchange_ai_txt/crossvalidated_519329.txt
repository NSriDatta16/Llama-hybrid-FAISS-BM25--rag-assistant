What does a straight line of residuals of a time series mean?

I used Python's statsmodels' seasonal_decompose & received the following plots: I understand that the residuals here are what is leftover after trend & seasonality are removed, but is there anything I can interpret from a straight line of residuals between 0.95 & 1.00? Also, my data started on 03/01/2019 & ended on 03/01/2020. Why don't my trend & residuals plots start & end at those same dates?
