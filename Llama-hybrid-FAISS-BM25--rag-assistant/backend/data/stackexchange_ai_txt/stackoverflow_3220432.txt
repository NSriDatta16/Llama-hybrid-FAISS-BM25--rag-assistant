Try this: /(? Or, as a PHP single-quoted string literal: '/(? That regex yields the desired result, but I think you're going about this wrong. Usually, if a quoted string needs to contain a literal quote character, the quote is escaped, either with a backslash or with another quote. You aren't doing that, so I had to use a fragile hack based on lookarounds. Are you sure the data isn't supposed to look like this? $string = 'VAR_SELECTED, \'Hello m\\'lady\', "null"'; $string = 'VAR_SELECTED, \'Hello "Father"\', "Hello \\'Luke\\'"'; Come to think of it, doesn't PHP have built-in support for CSV data?
