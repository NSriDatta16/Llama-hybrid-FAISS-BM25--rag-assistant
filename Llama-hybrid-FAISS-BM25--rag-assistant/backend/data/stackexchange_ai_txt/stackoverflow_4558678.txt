Well, here's the deal. The mercurial command line program contains overhead, that's about it. This command: hg --quiet version Which doesn't look at any repository at all, takes 195ms on average on my machine to execute. You're not going to be able to minimize this a lot closer to zero when you start involving repositories and changesets. Why do you have 26 repositories? Why do you need to know which branch they're on? Are you using named branches and multiple repositores at the same time?
