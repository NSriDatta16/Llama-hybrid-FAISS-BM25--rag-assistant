While you can do this for classes defined in python code (it will not work for builtin ones) by reassigning their attributes please do not actually do so. Just subclass and use the subclass, or write functions that take an instance of the class as argument instead of adding your own methods. Doing what you have to mind leads to awkward, fragile code, especially if you end up using multiple libraries simultaneously that try to do this to the same classes. Is there an actual problem you're trying to solve this way?
