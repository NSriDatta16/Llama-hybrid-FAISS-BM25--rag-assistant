blackberry simulator "fileconn.dir.photos" location?

I am facing a weird problem on BlackBerry JDE 4.2.0 and the 8100 simulator it comes with: String path = System.getProperty("fileconn.dir.photos"); This returns null! This works for all J2ME phones and emulators I've worked with so far. Is there anything special that I need to do to get it work on the Blackberry simulator? Note, that I don't want the SD card images path but the phone's internal storage.
