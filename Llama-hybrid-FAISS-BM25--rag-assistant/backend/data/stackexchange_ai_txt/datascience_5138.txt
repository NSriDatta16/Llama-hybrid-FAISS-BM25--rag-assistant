Definition of likelihood function

I am confused by the definition of the likelihood function in different contexts. In the case of linear and logistic regression, it is defined as y given x In the case naive bayes and LDA, it is defined over x and y In the case of the EM algorithm (with observed variable x and unobserved variable z), it is defined over x How do we know over what it should be defined?
