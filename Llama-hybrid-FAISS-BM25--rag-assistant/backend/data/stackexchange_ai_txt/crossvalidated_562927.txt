Survival analysis - univariable and multivariable regression

I am running an analysis of various factors that determine whether an individual is likely to have an event. My outcome is binary (0 vs 1), and my explicative variables can be both quantitative or categorical. I also have a list of covariates known to be related to the dependent variable. I'm unsure whether I should: Perform a univariable logistic regression analysis for each explicative variable (without covariates), then use the significant ones (0.05 or Bonferroni-adjusted p-value?) in my final cox regression model; Perform a univariable logistic regression analysis for each explicative variable adjusted for covariates (ex. age and sex), then use the significant ones (0.05 or Bonferroni-adjusted p-values?) in my final cox regression model; or Use a backward stepwise regression model, then use the significant predictors (0.05 or Bonferroni-adjusted p-value?) in my final cox regression model? By Bonferroni-adjusted , I mean adjusted for the total number of predictors. I would be very grateful if you could help me with the process, and give me some explanations or references to better understand.
