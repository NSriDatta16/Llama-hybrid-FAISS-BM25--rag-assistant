Q1) How is the value of $m = 40$ and $c = 4.2$ derived? As a follow up of the above question: Shouldn't the value of $m$ be $(100+1)/2 = 50.5$ and the value of $C$ be $(4.5+5)/2 = 4.75$? Neither $m$ nor $c$ were "derived", those are some known values. This is actually said in the blog post you refer to: Letâ€™s first assume that the average of user ratings for all restaurants (C) is 4.2 and the average number of reviews for all restaurants (m) is 40. As about your second question Q2) Are the final weighted scores on a scale of 1-5 ? Yes. $R$ in on 1-5 scale, $C$ is on 1-5 scale, $w$ is in $[0,1]$, so $w + (1-w)=1$ and the weighted mean cannot be outside the 1-5 range. As about your edits, I don't see what is the question you want to ask. Actually the blog post you refer to tells everything about this formula and gives detailed example. There is nothing more that could be said. Also there is no deeper math or statistical rationale behind it, it is simply a weighted average of all scores and the particular rating.
