I notice several things here. First, when you enter your data via matrix , all the data have to be the same type. Thus, they are coerced to be the most inclusive type, strings, which in turn are coerced to be factors by default. Note: testdata Try using read.table(text='...', sep=",") instead: testdata (That was small potatoes.) The next trap to worry about is that SAS and R code logistic regression for binomial data differently. SAS uses "events over trials", but R uses the odds, successes/failures. Thus, your model formula should be: form Finally, you specified family=quasibinomial (i.e., the quasibinomial) in your R code, but \DIST=BIN (i.e., the binomial) in your SAS code. To match the SAS output, use the binomial instead. Thus, your final model is: fitreduced |z|) # (Intercept) -9.4020028 1.6219570 -5.796703 6.763131e-09 # dose 3.9207805 0.6460193 6.069138 1.285986e-09 # sexf 0.5574087 0.5184112 1.075225 2.822741e-01 # vacnum -1.3221011 0.5482645 -2.411430 1.589012e-02 This seems to match the SAS estimates and standard errors.
