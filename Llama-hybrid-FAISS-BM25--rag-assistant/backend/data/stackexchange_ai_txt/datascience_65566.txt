Very basic question: what is an accepted term for "linear order distance"

In data science we have "Manhattan Distance" as a slang term for Level 1 Distance and "Euclidean Distance" as a slang term for Level 2 Distance . Is there an accepted term for linear distance in memory of cells in different rows in a matrix? That is, given an 8x8 matrix, the "linear distance" from [3,2] to [4,5] is: (4-3) * 8 + (5-2) This is the distance in memory addressing. "Level 0 Distance" doesn't really work as a technical term, because computer memory layout is not a native concept in mathematics. Is there a standard term for this? It reminds me of the old flyback transformers in cathode ray tubes, so "flyback distance" makes sense as a slang term.
