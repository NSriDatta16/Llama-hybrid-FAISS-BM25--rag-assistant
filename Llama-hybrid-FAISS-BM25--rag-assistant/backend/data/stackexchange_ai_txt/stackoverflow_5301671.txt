Its nothing official but I would crack open the source code to the contacts app for 2.0+ They emulate the popover UI using an Activity in a pretty creative way. It might be a little over kill as it was designed to be usable by any application not just itself. But it should help give you a nudge in the right direction. Also depending on what the behavior you are looking for exactly a combination of fragments and action bar could be the way to go, but its not going to be as easy as iOS.
