This is because scala script running exits hard as soon as they are finished in the main thread. That works very bad in a setting with multiple threads (see Can Actors in Scala fail to process messages? (example in O'Reilly's Programming Scala) ). If instead you start scala and load the scripts like this: # scala scala> :load testactors.scala Loading testactors.scala... import scala.actors.Actor defined class Redford robert: Redford = Redford@29e07d3e res0: scala.actors.Actor = Redford@29e07d3e scala> A lot of what acting is, is paying attention.
