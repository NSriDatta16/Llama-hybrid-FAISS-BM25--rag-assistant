You are right alan, the RFC is not clear enough on this issue. On one hand, on the link to the RFC that you provide it says on the second paragraph of the introduction: JSON can represent four primitive types (strings, numbers, booleans, and null) and two structured types (objects and arrays). But on the other hand when you continue to the paragraph That talks about the actual JSON grammar it says: A JSON text is a serialized object or array. JSON-text = object / array So based on the grammar you can say that 'a string' does not qualify as valid JSON-text. Personally I would prefer to see the grammar "fixed" to say JSON-text = value thus making any of false / null / true / object / array / number / string become valid JSON-text. If you want to be strict for now, I would go with the semantics of the grammar. I will send Douglas Crockford a link to this question maybe he can add some useful info.
