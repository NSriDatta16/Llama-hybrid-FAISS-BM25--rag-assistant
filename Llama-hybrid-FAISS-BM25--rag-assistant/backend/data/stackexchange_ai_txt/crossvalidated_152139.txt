Markov chains with a stationary distribution but no limiting distribution

I am trying to intuitively reconcile the following statement, read from "Probability, Markov Chains, and Queues": A Markov Chain may possess a stationary distribution but not a limiting distribution. This is unintuitive to me. I have written down 4 defenitions/facts that I know that I am trying to use: 1) $\pi$ is a limiting distribution of a Markov Chain with transition matrix $P$ if, for some initial distribution $P(0)$, $\pi = P(0)lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}P^{(n)}$. The elements of $\pi$ need not sum to 1 . 2) If, for all valid starting distributions $P(0)$, $P(0)lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}P^{(n)} = \pi$, where $\pi$ is a vector of positive reals summing to 1, then $\pi$ is a steady-state distribution . 3) If a Markov Chain has a steady-state distribution , then it is also the unique stationary distribution . 4) A stationary distribution is a vector $\pi$ of positive reals summing to 1 satisfying $\pi = \pi P$. So the original statement in question is that there is some vector $\pi$ satisfying (4) for some Markov Chains, but not 1. But fact 2 means that steady state distributions are a subset of limiting distributions, and fact 3 means that steady state distributions are stationary distributions, so how can you have a stationary distribution but not a limiting distribution? Where is my logic wrong? EDIT: after thinking more, if the statement is correct, the chain has some $\pi = \pi P$ (4) but it is NOT true that the same $\pi$ satisfies $\pi = \pi lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}P^{(n)}$, or else $\pi$ would also be a limiting distribution. I guess this means this chain has some kind of fluctuating P matrix when raised to powers. Maybe related to periodicity.
