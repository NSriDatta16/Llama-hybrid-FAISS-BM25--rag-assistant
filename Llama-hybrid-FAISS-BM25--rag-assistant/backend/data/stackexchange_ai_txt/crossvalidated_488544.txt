My recommendation would be survival analysis. I say survival analysis as opposed to linear or logistic regression (as mention in the comments) because you can make use of tires which have NOT failed via censoring. "Early detection" is a nebulous term. What you could possibly due is collect data on failing tires and compute a Kaplan Meir estimator for the survival curve stratified my tire model (assuming you have sufficient data to do this). To control for variables, you could perform a cox regression. As for statistical "proof", you will never "prove" anything with statistics but you can make very convincing arguments with appropriate models, adequate and quality data, and precise estimates. For more on survival analysis I recommend Frank Harrell's treatment of the material in his "Regression Modelling Strategies" book.
