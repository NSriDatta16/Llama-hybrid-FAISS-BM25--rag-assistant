catching YUI events between sandboxes

I have two different sandboxes of YUI: YUI().use(){ var drag = new Y.DD.Delegate({ nodes: '#userlist li', dragConfig: { dragMode: 'point', groups: ['participants'] } }); } and YUI().use(){ //i can't get the drag:hit event in this sandbx } in one i create a drag object and on the other i create a drop object. If the code is executed on the same YUI sandbox then everything works, but if i take the code of the drop object and place it in the second YUI sandbox i don't get the drop:hit event. how can i make this event global?
