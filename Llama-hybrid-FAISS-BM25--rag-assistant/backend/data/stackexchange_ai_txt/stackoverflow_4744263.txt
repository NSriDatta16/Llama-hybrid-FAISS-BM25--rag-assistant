how to run wordpress and zendframework from the same docroot

I have a site running in wordpress in shared hosting terria.net I have developed another project in zend framework and have deployed under a tools directory, I would like to access it www.abc.com/tools . I have copied the content of . htaccess mentioned by Lorenzo Albertons in tools/.htaccess . RewriteEngine On RewriteRule ^\.htaccess$ - [F] RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ="" RewriteRule ^.*$ /public/index.php [NC,L] RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/public/.*$ RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /public/$1 RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -f RewriteRule ^.*$ - [NC,L] RewriteRule ^public/.*$ /public/index.php [NC,L] But the url is not properly redirected to the tools project rather it is treating it as a wordpress page.
