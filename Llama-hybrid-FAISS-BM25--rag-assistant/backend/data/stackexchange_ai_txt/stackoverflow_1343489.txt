Very hackish, but does capturing the desktop (without hiding your window) like in this tutorial and cropping everything but your window work? More generally, I'm not even sure that the OpenGL spec demands that output has to be placed in the front buffer: an implementation could just use video overlays (or Voodoo2-esque VGA pass-through shenanigans) for output.
