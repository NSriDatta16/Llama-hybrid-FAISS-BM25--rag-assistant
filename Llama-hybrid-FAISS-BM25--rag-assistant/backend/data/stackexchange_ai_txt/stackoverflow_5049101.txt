There is no property as VolumeSize . When you call DefragAnalysis() it returns the status of the function and outs parameters boolean DefragRecommended and object DefragAnalysis . DefragAnalysis Class contains property VolumeSize . Console.WriteLine("DefragRecommended: {0}", outParams("DefragRecommended")) Console.WriteLine("VolumeSize: {0}", outParams("DefragAnalysis")("VolumeSize")) Console.WriteLine("ReturnValue: {0}", outParams("ReturnValue")) You should always read the documentation instead of making a guess. I would like to suggest a nice tool called WMI Code Creator v1.0 . This tool tool allows you to generate VBScript, C#, and VB .NET code that uses WMI to complete a management task such as querying for management data, executing a method from a WMI class, or receiving event notifications using WMI. I hope this helps. : )
