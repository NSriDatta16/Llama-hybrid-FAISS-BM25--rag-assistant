Just from a purely theoretical perspective this cannot be possible. Any given training dataset represents a certain amount of information about the structure of a certain space. If you train a GAN on this dataset, it will only ever learn from the information represented by that dataset. The data synthesized by the GAN can never be from a larger space than the original data, for the simple reason: Where would this information be supposed to come from? If it wasn't in the original dataset, then it also cannot be in the synthesized data from the GAN. If you train a neural network to convergence on a dataset, that neural network will learn whatever structure the dataset contains. Any artificial training data synthesized by a GAN will add no new information. That idea should be straight forward.
