How powerful can graphing be in IE6?

I'm interested in developing a web-based application with rich time series charting functionality, where the charts can be constructed and manipulated on the client side. I would like the chart surface to be highly interactive, with the ability to pan and zoom with the mouse, click on lines, axes, etc. Importantly, I would prefer not to use Flash, AND I need to support Internet Explorer 6. My question is, is there anything out there that is going to allow me to do this, or must I use Flash? I have seen good charts that use the HTML5 canvas element, but I am not sure to what extent these would be supported in IE6 using excanvas.js, and if they are supported, what type of performance I can expect. I have not actually found a working example that ran in IE6. Thanks.
