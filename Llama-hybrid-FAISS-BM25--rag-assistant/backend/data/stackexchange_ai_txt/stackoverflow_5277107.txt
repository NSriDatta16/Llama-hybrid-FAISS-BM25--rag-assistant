apache reverse proxy changes url

i tried to configure apache's reverse proxy on a server to redirect the requests from /hotm to http://gateway.messenger.hotmail.com typing the addres xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/hotm in a browser, the request is redirected correctly, but the url in the address bar changes to "http://gateway.messenger.hotmail.com". it's possible to configure the proxy on apache so that the address does not change? [edit] this is the httpd.conf fragment ProxyRequests Off ProxyPass /hotm http://gateway.messenger.hotmail.com ProxyPassReverse /hotm http://gateway.messenger.hotmail.com Order Allow,deny Allow from all Redirect Permanent /hotm http://gateway.messenger.hotmail.com
