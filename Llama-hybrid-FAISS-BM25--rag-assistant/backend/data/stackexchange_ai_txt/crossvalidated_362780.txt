auto.arima() and manual search gives different p & q values

Hello, I have a non-stationary time series (population data) with 66 observations. Attached png file contains the acf and pacf plot for differenced (d=2) series. (1) From that I assumed p=1 & q=1 (ignoring the higher lag significance, is it ok to ignore significant higher (>4 or >5) lags?). (2) auto.arima() produced p=1 & q=0. But none of them met the assumptions of White noise & normality. So I manually searched for p and q, and found p=4, q=2 follows all the assumptions. the output is as follows. Though AR(2) & AR(3) coefficients are not significant So I am little confused. I can't accept the models that don't follow the underlying assumptions in anyway. On other hand, Accepting a model which meets the assumption increases the order p greatly (having a higher order p is kind of unusual). NB. No log/power transformation worked well (i.e. to meet assumptions at a reduced p & q value). Any suggestions?
