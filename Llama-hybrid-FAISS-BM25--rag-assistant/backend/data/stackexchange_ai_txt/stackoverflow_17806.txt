Warning: Found conflicts between different versions of the same dependent assembly

I am currently developing a .NET application, which consists of 20 projects. Some of those projects are compiled using .NET 3.5, some others are still .NET 2.0 projects (so far no problem). The problem is that if I include an external component I always get the following warning: Found conflicts between different versions of the same dependent assembly. What exactly does this warning mean and is there maybe a possibility to exclude this warning (like using #pragma disable in the source code files)?
