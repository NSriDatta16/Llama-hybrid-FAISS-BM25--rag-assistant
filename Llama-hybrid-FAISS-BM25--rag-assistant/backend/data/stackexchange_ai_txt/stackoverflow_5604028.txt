Generating dynamic playlists using user preference

I'm trying to build a web app using ruby on rails. In this project users can search through the songs on our website and can create they're own playlists . The App also has to generate dynamic playlists based on the users likes and dislikes . This is my problem , i can't find a simple and efficient solution that doesn't overwhelm my database . So if anyone can tell me some basic principles to this issue , about designing the models or a very elegant solution ( any little info will help me a lot ) Thank you
