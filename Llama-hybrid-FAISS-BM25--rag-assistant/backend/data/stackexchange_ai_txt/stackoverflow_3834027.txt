How to break rails models into modules?

Possible Duplicate: Model Using Modules in Rails Application I have a User model that is getting really fat and I want to break it up into submodules that correspond to the different interactions such as a user's interaction with friendships, interaction with events, interaction with weapons, etc. etc. What's the best way to go about it? The goal is to do something like: u = User.find(1) friend = User.find(2) u.friends_with? friend This is my attempt thus far: create app/models/user_helper/friendship.rb which has the code as module UserHelper module Friendship def friends_with? friend ::Friendship.are_friends(self, friend) #this should point to the top-level Friendship class end ....code code code code.... end end then in the User model, include ::UserHelper::Friendship Doesn't work though and I get undefined method when I do "User.first.friends_with?" What I know WILL work is if I have a random file in the models directory like "UserFriendshipHelper.rb" defining module UserFriendshipHelper and include that, but I kinda would like to do it in a more encapsulated, organized way. Any tips or resources much appreciated. Thanks!
