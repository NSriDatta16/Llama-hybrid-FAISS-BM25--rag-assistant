How do I get button up even when out of focus with actionscript 3.0?

I've been working on creating a button using a MovieClip. I'm using the following events: this.addEventListener(MouseEvent.CLICK,OnClick); this.addEventListener(MouseEvent.ROLL_OVER,OnButtonRollOver); this.addEventListener(MouseEvent.ROLL_OUT,OnButtonRollOut); this.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_DOWN,OnMouseDown); this.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_UP,OnMouseUp); Everything works fine with the exception of when I click the button and [without releasing the mouse button] I drag the mouse out of the button's focus and then I release the mouse button the OnMouseUp event is not called. How can I fix this? Thanks, Y_Y.
