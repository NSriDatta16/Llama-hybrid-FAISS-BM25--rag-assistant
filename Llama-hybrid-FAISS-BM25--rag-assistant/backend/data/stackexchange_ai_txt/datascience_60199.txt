Maybe I should have a look on the feature selection I did by hand and rather do a PCA ? That's an option, and it might work. Alternatively, you can try: Train a Neural Network with mini-batch gradient descent , and artificially build each batch of data in a way to make all the classes evenly distributed. If you can, break the problem into subproblems. Classifiers' performance goes down as the number of classes increases. If some classes represent a separate problem, you can train models on subsets of your data, so that each model can learn to classify on fewer classes. This very often leads to better predictions.
