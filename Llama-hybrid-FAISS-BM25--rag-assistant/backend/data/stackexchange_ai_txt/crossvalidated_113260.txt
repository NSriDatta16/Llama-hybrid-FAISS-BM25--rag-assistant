Using a "common sense" approach the trasformation from 4 level variables into dicotomic variables have clearly reduced the richness of information expressed in each variable, so I would expect more difficulty in extracting conclusions from statistical analyses on such dataset than if you would have analyzed original data. Considering the topic you have addressed, PCA/Factor analysis and Cluster analysis for binary data, I would give a look to: * Homogeneity analysis: (see http://www.r-bloggers.com/finding-patterns-amongst-binary-variables-with-the-homals-package/ ), a sort of factor analysis that can be used to analyze binary data. * The mona function in R cluster package: a cluster analysis tailored for binary data (see Cluster analysis of boolean vectors in R )
