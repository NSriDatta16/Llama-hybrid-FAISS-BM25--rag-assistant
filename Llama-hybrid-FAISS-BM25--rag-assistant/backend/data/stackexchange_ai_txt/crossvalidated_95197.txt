In short, the authors, like almost all scientists, are (presumably) using the Null Hypothesis Significance Testing approach, with all it's associated pitfalls. These methods can tell us the probability of this data being observed given that the null hypothesis is true (the null hypothesis here being 'no bias at all'), and we're allowed to conclude that the null hypothesis is incorrect if the probability of the data given the null hypothesis is less than 5%. Bayesian approaches , on the other hand, could answer the question you ask - but rather than providing a proper answer and explaining the distinction, I'm going to point you towards one of John Kruschke's papers on the subject .
