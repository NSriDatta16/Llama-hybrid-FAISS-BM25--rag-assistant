I would write my own cache manager. If the user can only load pictures to the left and right in the list, I'd keep those three in memory if possible and shift every time the user navigates to a new picture. I'm not sure if that's how your app works, but that's one way of doing it. If you can't predict your user's next choice, maybe have a revolving cache and experiment with how many you can hold in memory at once (not knowing the best, worst and average case of your file sizes, I can't really speak much on that). You may know this already, but it's always worth mentioning. When you're working with Bitmaps, any time you're done with one...really done with it (such as flushing it from your cache), call it's recycle method. That seems to be the quickest and most widely accepted way of reclaiming that memory for the system.
