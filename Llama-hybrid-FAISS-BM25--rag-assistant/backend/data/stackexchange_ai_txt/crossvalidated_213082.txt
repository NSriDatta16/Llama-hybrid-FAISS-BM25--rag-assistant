Link between marginal effects of probit estimation and proportions in sample

Suppose you are estimating a model with a binary dependent variable $Y_i$ and where the explanatory variables are a randomly assigned binary treatment $D_i$ and a vector of covariates. My understanding is that the marginal effect of $D_i$ is interpreted as the probability of $Y_i$ being 1 if $D_i=1$, holding other covariates constant (correct me if I'm mistaken). So my question is whether you can interpret this change of probability for the treated unit as an impact on the proportions (or distribution) of $Y_i$ in the sample . The variable of interest is a systemic -not individual- characteristic, so it is interesting to draw a conclusion for the effect of the treatment on a group of observations. For example, suppose $Y_i$ is a dummy indicating whether merchant $i$ sells illegal products in his store. Merchants are grouped in small fairs. Suppose also that $D_i$ is a treatment intended to curb this behavior, randomly assigned at the fair level. If you find that the marginal effect of $D$ is $-0.1$, that means that the probability that a treated merchant sells illegal merchandise is, on average, 10 percentage points less than non-treated ones. But can you say that the proportion of merchants that sell illegal products in treated fairs is 10 p.p. less than in non-treated fairs?
