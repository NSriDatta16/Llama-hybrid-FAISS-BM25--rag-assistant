If you have the following aspx Add $(function () { $(".treeNode").draggable(); $("# ").droppable({ drop: function (event, ui) { alert(event.originalTarget.text); } }); }); To display the text of the dropped node. You will need the jquery.ui libraries though. If you plan to drag and drop a treenode with its child nodes you might be in for some fun as apparently a tree node is rendered as a table (for the parent) and a div with the children in. There's no div wrapping both. Maybe you could override the RenderContents in a TreeView derived class and recursivly handle the rendering of the treenodes yourself but sounds like a lot of work just to wrap two elements. Maybe a better choice would be using a JQuery plugin to render your treelist.
