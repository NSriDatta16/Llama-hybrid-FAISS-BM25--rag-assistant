Moving from Magento Community to Professional

A client of mine would like to build their ecommerce website using the community (free) edition of Magento. But in the future they "may want to use customer store credits and upgrade to the professional (paid) version then". Is this even possible? Can you just upgrade and bolt on the professional version to the community version? OR would this mean starting the website from scratch again from within the professional package? Magento Versions
