Rules of thumb for a proportion of outliers depending on the dimension

I am implementing and benchmarking different "robust" PCA (principal component analysis, see for instance Robust Principal Component Analysis? ) for data that should align (I have no prior on the underlying distribution, except a linear aspect). I would like to isolate potential outliers based on their distance to the first principal vector. In one dimension ($n=1$), I could choose $p=10\%$ of points furthest from the median. Are there rules of thumbs to propagate nicely such a proportion in higher dimensions $n$, like $p^{\frac{1}{n}}$?
