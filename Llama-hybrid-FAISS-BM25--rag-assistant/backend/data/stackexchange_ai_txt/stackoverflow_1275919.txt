Creating a batch file to do drag and drop files onto an exe

I have an exe that I can drag and drop another file onto to produce a third file. Unfortunately it seems to accept only 1 file at a time, if I select multiple and drop it doesn't seem to work. How do I create a batch file to automate the process of dragging a thousand files of .drag extension onto drop.exe? Thanks!
