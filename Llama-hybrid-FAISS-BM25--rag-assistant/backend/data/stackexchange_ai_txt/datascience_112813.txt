Is it okay to use Least Squares Regression when comparing neural network accuracy?

I am comparing graphs of neural network accuracy for a study I am doing. I know you could use 5x2 cv and McNemars t-test however I already did the training without folding and this is not a binary prediction. I want to know if using least squares regression would be an acceptable replacement
