You can: Embed Mono in your (presumably C++) Qt 4 app using the Mono embedding API . Invert (1) by exposing a C API from your GUI so you can control it from the Mono code using P/Invoke. Use a mixture of (1) and (2) - embed Mono, invoke it using embedding API, have it call back using P/Invoke. Use other IPC mechanisms such as Unix sockets or shared memory, which might be faster, and would avoid blocking an IP port. I'd recommend (3).
