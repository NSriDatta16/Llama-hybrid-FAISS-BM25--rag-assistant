There's no halting problem involved here. All you need is to compute if the intersection of ^xy1\d and [^\d]\d2$ in non-empty. I can't give you an algorithm here, but here are two discussions of a method to generate the intersection without resorting the construction of a DFA: http://sulzmann.blogspot.com/2008/11/playing-with-regular-expressions.html And then there's RAGEL http://www.complang.org/ragel/ which can compute the intersection of regular expressions too. UPDATE: I just tried out Ragel with OP's regexp. Ragel can generate a "dot" file for graphviz from the resulting state machine, which is terrific. The intersection of the OP's regexp looks like this in Ragel syntax: ('xy1' digit any*) & (any* ^digit digit '2') and has the following state machine: While the empty intersection: ('xy1' digit any*) & ('q' any* ^digit digit '2') looks like this: So if all else fails , then you can still have Ragel compute the intersection and check if it outputs the empty state machine, by comparing the generated "dot" file.
