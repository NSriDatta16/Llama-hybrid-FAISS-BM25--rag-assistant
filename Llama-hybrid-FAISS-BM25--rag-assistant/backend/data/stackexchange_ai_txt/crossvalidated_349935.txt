Orthogonality as found by the Gram-Schmidt process vs. uncorrelated basis vectors

I have a data matrix $Y$ of size $n \times p$, a basis vector in $\mathbb{R}^p$ $v_1$, and a potential basis vector in $\mathbb{R}^p$ $v_2'$. Then, if I use the Gram-Schmidt process on $[v_1, v_2']$ to produce $v_2$ orthogonal to $v_1$, it is not necessarily true that for $B = [v_1, v_2]$, the transformed data matrix $YB$ of size $n \times 2$ consists of two uncorrelated variables. Can the Gram-Schmidt process be modified to produce uncorrelated basis vectors, analogous to PCA? Mathematically, I'm having trouble visualizing the difference between orthogonal according to the Euclidean dot product and uncorrelated statistically. PCA obviously finds both, but that's unique as it corresponds to the eigendecomposition which is mathematically "special" as well, but in what way?
