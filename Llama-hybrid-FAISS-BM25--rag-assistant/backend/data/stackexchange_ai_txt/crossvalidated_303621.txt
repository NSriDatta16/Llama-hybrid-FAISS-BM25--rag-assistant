what is the memory usage of the VGG-net or any other neural networks?

Bellow in this link http://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/#case it's written that the memory usage is just 24M but don't we store the values of the parameters and activations in the forward pass? So... now i think that the memory usage is the total number of parameters+ activations the number is 24M +138M (without considering the number of biases) Am i right?
