Popping an element from an association list in lisp (elisp)

I'm searching for a way to "pop" an element from an association list, in other words a "destructive" assoc: (setq alist '((a . 1) (b . 2)) (assoc-pop 'a alist) ;; -> (a . 1) ;; alist -> ((b . 2)) Are there any function in the elisp harness? What's the most elegant way to obtain a symilar functionality? (not sure about that this sort of "side effect" is a good practice, even if it is possible!)
