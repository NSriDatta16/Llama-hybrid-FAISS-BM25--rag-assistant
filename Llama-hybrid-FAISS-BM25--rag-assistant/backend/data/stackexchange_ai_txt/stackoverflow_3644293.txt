Are there tools that help organizing #includes?

Are there any tools that help organizing the #include s that belong at the top of a .c or .h file? I was just wondering because I am reorganizing my code, moving various small function definitions/declarations from one long file into different smaller files. Now each of the smaller files needs a subset of the #include s that were at the top of the long file. It's just annoying and error-prone to figure out all #includes by hand. Often the code compiles even though not all #include s are there. Example: File A uses std::vector extensively but doesn't include vector ; but it currently includes some obscure other header which happens to include vector (maybe through some recursive includes).
