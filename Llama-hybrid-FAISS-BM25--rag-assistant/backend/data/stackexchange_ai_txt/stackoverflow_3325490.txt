The package statement in Java is used to group several related classes. If you have classes that deal exclusively with Database interaction, it would be logical to put them all under com.example.myapp.persistence This also provides the benefice of name spacing, remember that at runtime part of a java class identity is its fully qualified name, that is, the class name preceded by its package name like in com.example.myapp.persistence.UserDAO When you're application grows to accommodate more than a couple of classes, it is both practical and a good practice to organize them in packages
