There is not a ton of movement to make a bunch of less fragmented ui libraries for jquery. I think many people are beginning to follow a pretty regimented style as far as authoring style goes, and most of the time, good plugins play together very nicely. Specifically - Mike Alsup's pattern, described here: http://www.learningjquery.com/2007/10/a-plugin-development-pattern is one that is very uniform across most popular plugins. If you notice a plugin follows this pattern, you can have more confidence that it works the way you think you'd want it to. However, there might be one more alternative for you - ExtJS ( http://www.extjs.com/ ) can be used as a UI library on top of jQuery. Just include jQuery, then the ext-jquery apapter file, and then the extjs ui library. This will give you the entire extjs UI library (which is very uniform and tested), and still give you all the core jQuery access that you want, as well as other plugin possibilities. Hope that helps.
