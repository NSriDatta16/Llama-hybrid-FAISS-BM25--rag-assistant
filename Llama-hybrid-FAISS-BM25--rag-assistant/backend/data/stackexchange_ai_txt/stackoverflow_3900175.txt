Do not store the username in a cookie if you use it for identification. Because cookies are a client side storage and can be manipulated. Store it in the session instead that is a server side storage. Normally, when authentication was successful, you store the user identification information in the session and only pass the session ID to the client. With that the user information stays protected on the server side.
