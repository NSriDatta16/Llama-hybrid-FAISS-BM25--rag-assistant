This is the classical example from Hibernate documentation: from Cat as cat left join cat.kittens as kitten with kitten.bodyWeight > 10.0 In your case, this would be: select distinct u from SystemUser u join u.userGroups g join u.organisations o where 3 in elements(g.permissions) and o.id not in (?) I'm assuming the Organisation entity has an id field and you can pass in the list of ids.
