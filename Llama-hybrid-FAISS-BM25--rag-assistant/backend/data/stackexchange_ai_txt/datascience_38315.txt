Assume that you have a time variable and you observe at each time and at a certain bus stop if there is a bus arriving or not. Let the probability that a bus arrives at a bus stop at time $t$ be denoted as $p(t)$. This essence of success/failure is a binomial distribution and Logistic regression computes/predicts $p(t)$ by shifting and stretching the logistic curve.
