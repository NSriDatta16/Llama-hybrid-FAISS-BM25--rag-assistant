If you have a particular image or set of images that you want included as part of the application, you can simply drag them into the project -- I prefer the Resources section for this -- and reference them by name using UIImage "imageNamed" for initialization. If you are trying to load images that are local to an individual iPhone, that uses different techniques, but that doesn't seem to be what you are after. I'm new to iPhone programming too, so I hope this helps.
