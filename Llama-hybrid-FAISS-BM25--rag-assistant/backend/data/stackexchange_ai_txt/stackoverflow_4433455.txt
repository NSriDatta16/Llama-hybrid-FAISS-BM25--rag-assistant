Best is at the mySQL query. a) It is easy to do b) If you use an index the sort happens when the index is created or when new rows are inserted automatically (sometimes an index needs a reorganization but this is a db admins daily business. This applies if the table is very huge.). e) If the index includes the columns used in the where clause the access in general is faster d) You do not need to read the whole table each time to do the sort for yourself e) Even if you have no index I believe the DB can do the sorting best Hope it helps
