There was a thread on the user list about this: http://hadoop.markmail.org/search/list:org%2Eapache%2Ehadoop%2Ecore-user+pcap+order:date-forward Basically, the format is not splittable as you can't find a start of a record starting at an arbitrary offset in the file. So you have to do some preprocessing, inserting syncpoints or something similar. Maybe covert smaller files into sequencefiles, and then merge the small sequencefiles? If you wind up writing something reusable, please consider contributing back to the project.
