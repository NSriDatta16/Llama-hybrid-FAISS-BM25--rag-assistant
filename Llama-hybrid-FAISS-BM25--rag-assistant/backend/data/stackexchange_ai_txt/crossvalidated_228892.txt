PyMC modeling drug testing with truthiness

I’m new to Bayesian modeling in general and PyMC in particular. I’m trying to model in a situation in which we ask patients whether they’ve taken drugs and we further drug test a subset of these samples. I’d like to combine this data taking into account the observation that patients can (often?) lie about whether they’ve taken drugs. I’m having trouble modeling the truthiness of the patients. I don’t quite understand how I could make their admitted use be a function of both their actual use and their tendency to lie. I’ve got some example code below. Any suggestions? import pymc import numpy as np admited_use = [True, True, False, False, True, False] test_use = [False, True, True, True, False, False] true_use_fraction = pymc.Uniform('true_use_fraction', 0, 1) lying_use_fraction = pymc.Uniform('lying_use_fraction', 0, 1) positive_test = pymc.Bernoulli('positive_test', true_use_fraction, observed=True, value=np.array(test_use)) EDIT: I want to use the admit-use data for instances in which we don't have drug testing and we'd like to stratify patients based on how often they lie about their drug use history.
