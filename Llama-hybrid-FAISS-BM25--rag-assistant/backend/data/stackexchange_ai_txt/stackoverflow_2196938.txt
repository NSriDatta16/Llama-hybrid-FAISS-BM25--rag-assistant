From a user comment in Infragistics forum archive install as the Sysadmin for "All Users" and then the user will develop and compile their app. Here is a workaround but unfortunately, this does not explain the root cause. Here is a blog post from Infragistics to deal with automated builds but I don't think it is your case. And a further reference to that same post adding more info here . I guess you had already looked at those links but they might be helpful to somebody else with a similar problem.
