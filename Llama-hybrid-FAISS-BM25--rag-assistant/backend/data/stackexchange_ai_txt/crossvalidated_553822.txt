When bootstrapping, we are assuming that the sample is representative of the population. The whole purpose of bootstrapping is to estimate a sampling distribution and infer the likely standard errors and confidence intervals for the population as a whole. However, the issue with small sample sizes is that bias is more likely to exist relative to large samples - and (contrary to popular belief) bootstrapping does not fix this bias or remedy the issue of small sample sizes. For instance, suppose one were to roll a dice five times. The numbers 4, 5, 6, 6, 6 are obtained, for an average of 5.4 . If one were to roll a dice a hundred times, an average closer to 3.5 could be expected - which is the theoretical mean. However, small samples have a higher chance of deviating significantly from the population mean and so bootstrap sampling will not remedy this by virtue of simply generating more observations.
