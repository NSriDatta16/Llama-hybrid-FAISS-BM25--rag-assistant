UIImage view questions

I have a UIImageview in my application and I was wondering how I can show an image in it pragmatically and change it whenever I want to! I think my major problem is exactly WHERE to put it! If you could show me what code and where that would be very usefull! thanks! EDIT: Also if you can pragmatically change the background into an image or even a color! thanks! either or will work! EDIT2: here is my code, i dont know where to put those because they always give me an error! MainView.h #import #import @interface MainView : UIView { //static int r; int r; IBOutlet UIButton *myButton; IBOutlet UILabel *myTextLabel; IBOutlet UILabel *myTextLabel2; IBOutlet UIImageView *myImage; } @property (nonatomic, retain) UIButton *myButton; @property (nonatomic, retain) UILabel *myTextLabel; @property (nonatomic, retain) UILabel *myTextLabel2; @property (nonatomic, retain) UIImageView *myImage; - (IBAction)buttonclick; //+(void) initialize; @end and the MainView.m #import "MainView.h" #include #include @implementation MainView @synthesize myButton, myTextLabel, myTextLabel2, myImage; - (IBAction)buttonclick { r++; if(r == 1) { self.myTextLabel.text = @"word"; self.myTextLabel2.text = @"def."; }else if(r == 2) { self.myTextLabel.text = @"word2"; self.myTextLabel2.text = @"def2 "; } } @end
