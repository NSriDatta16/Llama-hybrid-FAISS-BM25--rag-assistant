Look at /proc/vmstat there is a lot of information about the system wide memory. The /proc//maps will give you a lot of information about your process memory layout. Note that if you check the memory before running a long job, another process may eat all the available memory and your program may crash anyway ! I do not know anything about your cached classes but if these objects are quite small you probably have overridden the new/delete operators. By this it is quite easy to keep track of the memory consumption (at least by counting objects) Why not change your cache policy ? And flush old unused object. Another ugly way is to try to allocate several chunk of memory and see the program can allocate it, and release it after that. On 32 bits it may fail because the heap may be fragmented, but if it works you sure that you have enough memory at this time.
