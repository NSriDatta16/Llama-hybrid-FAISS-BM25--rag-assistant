Visual Studio 2010 Beta2 new language features are documented here . You can see the language reference sections for C and C++ as well. There are equivalent nodes in msdn for VS2008, but I'm more familiar with VS2010. For reference the new C++0x language features in VS2010 are: auto keyowrd lambda expressions rvalue references static_assert declaration decltype operator nullptr and __nullptr keywords There are multiple new library additions in VS 2010 as well, but you'll need to check the documentation for specifics, but examples are: algorithm has been updated for all_of, any_of, none_of exception_ptr and rethrow_exception are both included now. updates to the stl for rvalue references Parallel Pattern Library and Asynchronous Agents Library and Concurrency Runtime -Rick
