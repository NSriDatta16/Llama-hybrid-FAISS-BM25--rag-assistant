Text categorization/classification for small scale text

I'm looking into a way to classify/categorize sentences into pre-defined categories (around 10-15). Yes, indeed sentences, not articles or paragraphs. Given the average length of articles are not too long (2-10 normal pages) and number of articles (tens-hundreds) are relatively small, it is quite a small scale problem. However, accuracy is much more important. Because I am quite new in this field, I started by looking into some introductory papers and few generic open source projects (e.g. WEKA , GATE and LingPipe ). However, what I found so far are pieces too hard to put together to fit my purpose. What specific algorithm/software/resource do you recommend on this problem? Thanks in advance. I did find a tool called TagHelper which is quite suitable for few aspects of my purpose and am still exploring it. But I still expect more insights and suggestions. Thanks!
