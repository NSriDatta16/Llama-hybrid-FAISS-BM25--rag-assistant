What is the right method for parsing a blog post?

Need a guide line .... I am trying to write a personal blog. What is the standard structure for for input for the post. I am trying the format like: This is the simple text And I am [b] bold text[/b]. This is the code part: [code lang=java] public static void main (String args[]) { System.out.println("Hello World!"); } [/code] Is this the right way to store post in the database? And What is the right method to parse this kind of post? Shall I use regular expression to parse this or there is another standard for this. If the above mentioned format is not the right way for storage, then what it could be? Thanks
