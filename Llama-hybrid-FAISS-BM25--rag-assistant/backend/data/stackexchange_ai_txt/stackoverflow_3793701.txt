By trying to hide the REST layer behind a repository you are attempting to implement distributed objects . REST was never intended as an approach to implement this type of architecture. If you really want to do REST, you are going about it the wrong way. However, you are far from alone in this pursuit. Update: The only place I see a repository for domain objects is on the server, behind the REST interface. All you have on the client is media type handlers and user agent scripts.
