As per the literature, Schmidhuber, J. (2015). "Deep Learning in Neural Networks: An Overview". Neural Networks. 61: 85â€“117. arXiv:1404.7828free to read. doi:10.1016/j.neunet.2014.09.003. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning It is said that There is no universally agreed upon threshold of depth dividing shallow learning from deep learning, but most researchers in the field agree that deep learning has multiple nonlinear layers (CAP > 2) and Schmidhuber considers CAP > 10 to be very deep learning A chain of transformations from input to output is a Credit Assignment Path or CAP. For a feedforward neural network, the depth of the CAPs, and thus the depth of the network, is the number of hidden layers plus one.
