I would wager that this has a lot to do with the fact that many Bayesian models do not have tractable posterior distributions so that the van Trees inquality is likely to be of little use. Additionally, a major thrust of Bayesian research over the last 30 years or so has been on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. MCMC methods are a collection of methods to draw samples from the posterior distribution. With enough of these samples you can calculate the numeric value of any variances you want and do not need to worry about using the van Trees inequality.
