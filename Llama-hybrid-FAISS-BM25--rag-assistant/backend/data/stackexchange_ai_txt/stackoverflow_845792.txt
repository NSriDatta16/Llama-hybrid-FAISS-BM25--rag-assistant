Capturing Keyboard strokes in C#

HI, I have the following problem- the following text is in a rich text box . The world is [[wonderful]] today . If the user provides two brackets before and afer a word, as in the case of wonderful , the word in brackets, in this case, wonderful shall change to a link, ( with a green colour ) . I am having problems in getting the sequence of the keystrokes, ie. how do I know that the user has entered [[ , so I can start parsing the rest of the text which follows it . I can get it by handlng KeyDown, event, and a list , but it does not look to be elegant at all. Please let me know what should be a proper way. Thanks, Sujay
