Introduction Sadscript is a variant of VB6 used for scripting. It isn't natively part of VB6. I've seen it used as part of VB6, rumors of it's use with python, and heard that it can be used for VB.NET. Acceptance It's been used in MMORPG engines like Elysium Diamond, PlayerWorlds, and more. It's most prominent livliness is through the MMORPG engine known as Eclipse. It's said to be an easy scripting language and there are rumors that some colleges teach this scripting language. Because of how VB6 is, scripting alternatives for VB6 are few and far between (Also see VB6 & Lua ). Obtain The "SadScript Engine" (for lack of better words) itself is quite difficult to find. There appears to be no central repository, and only remants of links to it's engine. I managed to find a link to the SadScript 3 Engine & tutorial for MirageSource MMORPG engine .
