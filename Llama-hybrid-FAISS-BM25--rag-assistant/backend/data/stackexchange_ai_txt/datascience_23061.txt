What are the differences between multivariate data visualizations and multidimensional visualizations?

I believe this should be the correct place for this topic since it did not seem to fit naturally on the math Stack Exchange. I am writing an essay about data visualization, but am having trouble nailing down some terminology. I used data from the OECD to investigate trends in the data about OECD member countries. I created a graph in Tableau using data from the OECD that depicts the GDP per capita, average # of years spent in education system, satisfaction score as reported by the member country citizens, and a "Feel Safe" score as reported by the member country citizens (a percentage of the surveyed population who said they would feel safe walking home alone at night). Click the following link to download the full OECD data set I used. I am confused about whether to label my graph as a multivariate visualization or a multidimensional visualization. The core of my confusion comes from someone claiming that my graph is only two-dimensional since it can be displayed on a page. However, "dimensions" usually refers to the number of independent variables in a data set and the data displayed in my graph contains four independent variables. Could someone please tell me what my graphic should be categorized as, and possibly explain some of the differences between multivariate and multidimensional data/visualizations (if any)?
