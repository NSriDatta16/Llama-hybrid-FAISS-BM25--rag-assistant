You made two errors: one in the schema file and another in the syntax of the value of the xsi:schemaLocation attribute of the XML file. The main error is that your employee.xsd file is only a fragment of the XML Schema. You should complete the contain of the employee.xsd. For example, and employee.xml: John Smith Because you define default namespace in the XML file, the schema location attribule xsi:schemaLocation must consist from the the namespace and the path to the schema devided with the blank. I changed the namespace name so that it will be a little more unique: "http://www.w3schools.com/RedsDevils" instead of "http://www.w3schools.com" . At the end I can add that the XML file employee.xml not corresponds to the schema employee.xsd because the element John has the value other as red , but probably exactly this you wanted to test.
