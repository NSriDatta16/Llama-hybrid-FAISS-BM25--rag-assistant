LRE's solution is a good one. But from a design POV, do not use @UserName or @Now or @today in view selection formula's it causes serious performance problems for your database and the server. Everytime you open the view the server will be rebuilding the index. If you do need to use user specific info, create a scheduled agent that will set the value in a field and then reference the field as part of the view formula. Just don't use any dynamic "@" functions in the view formula that would change the criteria.
