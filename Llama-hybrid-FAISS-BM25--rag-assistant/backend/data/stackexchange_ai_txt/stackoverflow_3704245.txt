You can find the last whitespace using the strrpos() function: $variable = 'put returns between paragraphs'; $lastSpace = strrpos($variable, ' '); // 19 Then, take the two substrings (before and after the last whitespace) and wrap around the 'and': $before = substr($variable, 0, $lastSpace); // 'put returns between' $after = substr($variable, $lastSpace); // ' paragraphs' (note the leading whitespace) $result = $before . ' and' . $after; EDIT Although nobody wants to mess with substring indexes this is a very basic task for which PHP ships with useful functions (specificly strrpos() and substr() ). Hence, there's no need to juggle arrays, reversed strings or regexes - but you can , of course :)
