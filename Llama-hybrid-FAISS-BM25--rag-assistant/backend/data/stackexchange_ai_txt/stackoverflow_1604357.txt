How can I tell what events are bound to an object?

I am using jqGrid ( http://www.trirand.com/blog/ ) to display some read-only data. The resizeable columns are interfering with other draggable elements on the page (they get stuck when dragged over the region where the columns can be resized). I want to unbind() whatever is allowing the columns to be resized, presumably on mouseover, but I can't figure out how to determine what callbacks the objects currently have.
