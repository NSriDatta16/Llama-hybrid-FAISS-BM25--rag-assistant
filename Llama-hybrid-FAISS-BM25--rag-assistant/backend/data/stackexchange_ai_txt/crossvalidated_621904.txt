Note that an "integral is not Lebesgue measurable" does not have a meaning, unless it involves a random variable, which is not the case here. The problem as stated is not clearly defined since the connection between the sequence $(S_t)_t$ and the sequence $(X_t)_t$ is not spelled out. If we assume a joint (hidden) Markov process $(X_t,S_t)_t$ such that $$X_t|X_{t-1},S_{t-1},S_t\sim f(x_t|S_t)\quad\forall\, t$$ wrt the Lebesgue measure, then $$\mathbb P(S_t=s_t|S_{t-1}=s_{t-1})=\int \mathbb P[S_t=s_t\mid S_{t-1}=s_{t-1},x_{t-1}]f(x_{t-1}\mid s_{t-1})\,\text dx_{t-1}$$ is correct. Considering the pair $(S_{t-1},X_{t-1})$ , there is no reason its marginal joint distribution is stationary, i.e. the same for all $t$ 's. One should thus write $$(S_{t-1},X_{t-1})\sim \mathbb P^{t-1}(S_{t-1}=s_{t-1})f(x_{t-1}|S_{t-1}=s_{t-1})$$ to stress a possible time dependence of the Markov chain $(S_t)_t$ . But it still can be decomposed as $$\mathbb P^{t-1}(S_{t-1}=s_{t-1})f(x_{t-1}|S_{t-1}=s_{t-1})=\dfrac{\mathbb P^{t-1}(S_{t-1}=s_{t-1}|X_{t-1}=x_{t-1})f_{t-1}(x_{t-1})}{\mathbb P^{t-1}(S_{t-1}=s_{t-1})}$$ and $X_{t-1}$ remains marginally absolutely continuous wrt the Lebesgue measure.
