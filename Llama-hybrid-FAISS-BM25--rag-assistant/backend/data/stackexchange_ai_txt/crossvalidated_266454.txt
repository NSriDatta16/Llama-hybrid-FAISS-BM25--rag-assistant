The difference in these statements is that the "95% chance" refers to different things. That is in statement 1 we treat data $D$ as random, and thus also the interval as it is a function of $D$, and $\theta$ stays fixed $$Conf_{\alpha}(\theta) = (l, u):\ P(l(\bar{D}) \le \theta \le u(\bar{D})|\bar{D} \sim P_{\theta}) = 1 - \alpha$$ So if we sample some new, future data $\bar{D}$ from true distribution $P_{\theta}$, then $(l(\bar{D}), u(\bar{D}))$ is a confidence interval if it contains $\theta$ roughly $1 - \alpha$ percent of time. Whereas a bayesian credible interval is true for the second statement as $$Cred_{\alpha}(D) = (l, u):\ P(l \le \theta \le u|D) = 1 - \alpha$$ We treat data $D$ as fixed and $\theta$ as a random variable. Thus we can say that there is some percent chance for $\theta$ to be between $(l, u)$.
