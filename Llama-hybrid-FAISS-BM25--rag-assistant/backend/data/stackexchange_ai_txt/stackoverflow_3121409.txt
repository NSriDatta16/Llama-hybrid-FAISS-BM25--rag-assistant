The short answer is that the ant task is part of the TestNG distribution, so it's part of our tests and I always make sure that it remains up to date with TestNG. Surefire is developed as part of the Maven project, and as such, it sometimes lags behind (and just like you, I have sometimes encountered bugs when running my tests with Surefire that didn't happen when running from the command line/ant/Eclipse). I'll bring this question to the Maven team's attention, maybe they'll have more to say.
