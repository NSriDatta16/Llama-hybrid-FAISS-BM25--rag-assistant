It should handle the load just fine. 40-50 users is nothing. Where I'd be most worried is just how much data those users can generate. Express Edition does have a relatively small size restriction, and so if your application is using the database to handle something like document storage you could be in trouble, and might want to consider moving those documents to the file system (or even a separate instance). Additionally, one if the nice things about express edition is that it is the same underlying engine as the for-pay editions. If you find you grow beyond what express can handle, the upgrade is relatively painless (considering that if you grow that much you've hopefully grown revenue to match and can now afford the for-pay edition).
