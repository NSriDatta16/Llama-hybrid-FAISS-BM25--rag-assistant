Oh, now this is a nifty question. Here are some, code snips in python or something cloe: for loops can be replaced with iterators stripped_list = [line.strip() for line in line_list] for loops can be replaced with apply or map or filter map(upper, ['sentence', 'fragment']) ['SENTENCE', 'FRAGMENT'] nested for loops with composition of functions tail recursion in place of loops generator expressions in place of for loops sum(x*x for x in range(10))
