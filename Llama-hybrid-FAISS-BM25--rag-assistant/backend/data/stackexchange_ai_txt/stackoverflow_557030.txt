XSLT: sum of tree fragment will always return 0 !

I am stuck with a problem which seems stupid but I cannot find out the solution... With XLST, I need to sum a list of values calculated by a template. So I stored these values in a tree structure (a list of "Number" elements contained in a root element "Numbers"). But whatever I try to do with this self-made list, it will return either nothing, 0 or an error... Does someone know what I am doing wrong ?
