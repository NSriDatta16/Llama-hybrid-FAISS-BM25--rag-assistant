Time series classification with difference in time

I'm trying to classify some time series data and my goal is to convert it to a wavelet image and just use novel image classification techniques. However, my problem is the fact that my data doesn't have the same time scale (meaning some of them are about 20 seconds and some of them about 200, etc). My first solution is that I could probably use some methods to cut the main part of the each data to a fixed size time, but I'm wondering if there's a better solution to this problem. Can anyone point me in the right direction?
