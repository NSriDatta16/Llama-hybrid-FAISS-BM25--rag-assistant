Django: Specifying HASH instead of BTREE for indexed column

Is there a good way within Django models to specify a specific index storage type? For example, the default storage type for MySQL is BTREE, when for my particular column it may be more efficient to have HASH(hash table) as the storage type. I can't find a good way without creating a custom field, or modifying django core, that will do this for me. I can also accomplish this by modifying the index after the table is created. This situation probably doesn't matter for most things, but there are situations where a hash table is a more efficient lookup mechanism, and of course where sorting on the column is either not necessary or it doesn't make sense. For example a column with randomly generated data usually doesn't make a sensible ordering of information(unless you're looking for a repeatable random sort-- but that's beside the point).
