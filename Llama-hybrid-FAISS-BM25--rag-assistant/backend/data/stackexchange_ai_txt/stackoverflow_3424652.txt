How to properly i18n a string

This more or less complex phrase to translate in my Django template is: This site is owned by " The Company Name " and is maintained by partner organizations. Is it as simple as: {% trans "This site is owned by " The Company Name " and is maintained by partner organizations." %} Thank you.
