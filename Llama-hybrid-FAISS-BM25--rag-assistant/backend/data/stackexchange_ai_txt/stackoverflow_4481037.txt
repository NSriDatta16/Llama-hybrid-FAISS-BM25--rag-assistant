Client-server web app with both client AND server running on iPhone - is this possible?

I'd like to build a simple native iPhone app with tools traditionally used for web apps. I would prefer to use something like jQTouch and Rails, but I want it to work offline (not require an internet connection or a server). Is there a framework that enables simple creation of native iOS aps by encapsulating a lightweight web server and a server-side app framework (Rails or something simpler and more lightweight that can run on a phone), thus allowing you to write the client side code in HTML+JavaScript ? If there is not such a thing, is there a way to create an app (with HTML+JS) that basically only has a client-side component with persistent data storage? Thanks.
