Object detection will suit you better. Image classification is a machine learning based form of computer vision in which a model is trained to categorize images based on the primary subject matter they contain. Object detection goes further than this to classify individual objects within the image, and to return the coordinates of a bounding box that indicates the object's location. So you can return 1 if no of triangles (this no is given by the object detection model in the form of bounding box) in the image equals 3 and 0 otherwise.
