Should I include VB macros in source control with my project?

For a C# project, I make use of several Visual Basic macros in Visual Studio. I was just considering that these would be of use to other developers that work on the C# project. The macros so far include removing trailing whitespace on save , organizing using directives and removing unnecessary ones, and an override for Ctrl-M Ctrl-O that expands regions. Would it be reasonable for me to include this macro code with my C# project in Subversion ? I don't know if it's even possible for macros to be made available/work in Visual Studio just because you open a particular Solution file, and that might be too invasive since some of the macros override existing Visual Studio behavior.
