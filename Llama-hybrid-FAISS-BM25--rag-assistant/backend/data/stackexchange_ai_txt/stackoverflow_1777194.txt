If you really do have something that you want to be processed one item at a time, my recommendation is to use NSOperations and an NSOperationQueue where you've set the maxConcurrentOperationCount to 1. If you make sure that the only way that this shared block of code is accessed is through operations in this queue, you'll do away with the need for expensive locks. This may require a little reorganization of your application, but I've found that applying this within my own applications has led to better performance and cleaner code.
