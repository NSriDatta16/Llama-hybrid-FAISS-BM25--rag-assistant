I build everything by hand. Like Christian, I've had bad experiences with GUI builders; they always either refused to configure a couple of components quite right, or they generated huge amounts of unnecessary code which made later maintenance impractical, or both. I used to do build a lot of UIs using GridBagLayout, but for years, I've never seen an office-environment UI that couldn't be built with nested BorderLayouts, GridLayouts, and the occasional BoxLayout or FlowLayout. About 98% of the stuff I've seen is doable with nested BorderLayouts. In your case, the layout organization will be as bmeck says. Speaking from memory, using CENTER for the JTable (remember to put it in a JScrollPane!) and NORTH for everything else ensures that if you resize your JFrame, the JTable will get all of the extra space, and that should be exactly what you want. For the top labels and fields, the nested GridLayouts should ensure that each "column" of labels and fields will take up equal horizontal space. (They'll get only enough vertical space to be completely visible, and no more, since the JTable is taking up everything else.) Everything else is just a matter of adding borders and setting the GridLayout padding reasonably.
