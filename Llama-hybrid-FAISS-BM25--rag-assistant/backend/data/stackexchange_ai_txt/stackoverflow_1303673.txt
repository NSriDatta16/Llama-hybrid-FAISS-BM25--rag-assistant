If you're getting at "data driven tests", then you should take a look at the RowTest approach and equivalents. NUnit borrowed this from MBUnit. xUnit seems to have a even more extensible solution to this via the Theory and PropertyData , where you don't have to specify the inputs in code ; you could generate the inputs from an arbitrary function, spreadsheet or SQL Server database. I've never had the need for anything over the Rowtest method (which is also rare).. so can't warn you of any dragons. Alternatively you could even use Fit/Fitnesse to do this if you can't do the above approaches ; although not technically an acceptance test. As for the 'testing framework', maybe YAGNI maybe you do. Get started, start small, keep it simple, grow the test design with time.
