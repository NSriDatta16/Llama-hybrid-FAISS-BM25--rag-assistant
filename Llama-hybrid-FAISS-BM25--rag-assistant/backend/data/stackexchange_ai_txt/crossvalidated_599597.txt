Bias is a general term and can have different meanings. In statistics the term is used to describe a systematic error in an estimation method. It relates to splitting up error in accuracy and precision , and bias is the lack of precision. Bias is also used in relation to activation functions in neural networks. In that case it is the intercept as in your question. It is a term that changes how easily a particular node will 'activate' in response to the input values. Why is it called bias? You could say that the intercept is a term that makes the node biased to give a low/high value as response to certain input. And how is this different from the 'bias-variance' trade-off? Bias is a word used in different places. In the list of uses of 'bias' above, the second use of bias has nothing to do with the bias in the bias-variance tradeoff which relates to the first use of bias.
