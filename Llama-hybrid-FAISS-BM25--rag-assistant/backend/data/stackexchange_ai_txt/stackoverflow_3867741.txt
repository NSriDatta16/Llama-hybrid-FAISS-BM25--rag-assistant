I've seen two typical approaches to measuring the difference between two colors. The most common way is probably to just find the Euclidian distance between them through the color cube: float r = i.r - j.r; float g = i.g - j.g; float b = i.b - j.b; float diff = sqrtf( r * r + g + g + b * b ); The other is just to average the absolute differences, possibly weighting for luminance: float diff = 0.30f * fabs( i.r - j.r ) + 0.59f * fabs( i.g - j.g ) + 0.11f * fabs( i.b - j.b ); As to your second question, yes. Accumulate the error separately in each channel. Edit : Misread at first and missed that this was for a bi-level display. In that case, I'd suggest just using luminance: float luminance = 0.30f * p.r + 0.59f * p.g + 0.11f * p.b; if ( luminance > 0.5f * channelMax ) { // white } else { // black }
