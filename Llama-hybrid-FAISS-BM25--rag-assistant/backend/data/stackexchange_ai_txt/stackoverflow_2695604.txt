The compiler may have found that copying the symbol is more efficient than referencing it. This is due to the const modifier. In many instances, loading a register with an "immediate" value (one stored in the executable) is more efficient than loading from a location in ROM (Read Only Memory), which uses indirect addressing. I would not worry about duplications of a constant integer in many object files, unless it makes the files too large to fit on the hard drive. Also, object files are a interim storage for data until the executable or libraries are generated. I suggest concentrating more on the quality and robustness of your application than the internals of object files.
