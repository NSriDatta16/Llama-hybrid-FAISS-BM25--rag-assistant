I'm not really very versed in the factors which effect server load, however I think the best thing to do would be to find a balance between having one big chunk and having your scripts organized into meaningful separate files. I don't think that having five or so different files should influence performance too much. A more influential factor to look at would the compression of the scripts, there are various online utilities which get rid of white space and use more efficient variable names, I think these will result in much more dramatic improvements than putting the files together.
