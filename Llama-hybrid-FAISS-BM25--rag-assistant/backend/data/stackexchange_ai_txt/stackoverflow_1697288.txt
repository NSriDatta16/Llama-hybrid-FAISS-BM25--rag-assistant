Off the top of my head, you could subclass NSArray and override objectAtIndex: to post a notification of the index whenever the the method was called. Then provide that array subclass to the animation. As the animation requests each image in sequence, the subclass would send a notification (or call a method in somewhere etc). Not an elegant solution but it would work.
