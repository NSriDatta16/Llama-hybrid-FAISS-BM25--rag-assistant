Reinforcement learning in C#

I intend to use Reinforcement learning in my project but I do not know much how to implement it.. So I am looking for a library with different RL algorithms that I can use in my C# project.. Thanks Please Note: I found NeuronDotNet library for neural networks, I am now looking for RL library.. EDIT: Or a Dot NET library
