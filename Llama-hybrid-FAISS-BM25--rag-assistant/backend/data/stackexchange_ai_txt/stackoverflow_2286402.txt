URL Fragment and 302 redirects

It's well known that the URL fragment (the part after the # ) is not sent to the server. I do wonder though how fragments work when a server redirect (via HTTP status 302 and Location: header) is involved. My question is really two-fold: If the original URL had a fragment ( /original.php#foo ), and a redirect is made to /new.php , does the fragment part of the original URL simply get lost? Or does it sometimes get applied to the new URL? Will the new URL ever be /new.php#foo in this case? Regardless of the original URL, if the server redirects to a new URL with a fragment ( /new.php#foo ), will the fragment get "honored"? Or does the server really have no business interfering with the fragment at all -- and will the browser therefore ignore it by simply going to /new.php ??
