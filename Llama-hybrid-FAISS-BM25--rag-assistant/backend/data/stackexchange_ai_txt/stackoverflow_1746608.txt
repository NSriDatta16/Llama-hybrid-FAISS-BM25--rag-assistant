Google Maps not rendering completely on page?

I have a google maps on my page with a search pane I built myself which can be displayed and hidden at will. It covers like lets say 200 pixels of the map on a side. The thing is that when I resize my map or so the area where the pane overlaps is unrendered i.e the map doesn't render there for some reason. Check out this link In the Box type in lets say OMDB which is an icao code for an airport and press enter. The results are shown and you see the pane. Now click on the full screen link and then click on the airports tab to make the panel go away - you see now that part of the map hasn't rendered at all...I have to drag the map around and that only partially renders that area. How can I fix it? FYI I've run it on Google Chrome, Firefox and IE8 on Windows XP. Is there a way to like force complete rendering of a map or so? This is quite an erratic problem and could it be concerne with my code or is it a host issue? Or does Google just don't like me? :( EDIT: See the big ugly patch on the side. Its unrendered area where the map should have been rendered as well. No amount of zooming in and panning is helping clear this :(
