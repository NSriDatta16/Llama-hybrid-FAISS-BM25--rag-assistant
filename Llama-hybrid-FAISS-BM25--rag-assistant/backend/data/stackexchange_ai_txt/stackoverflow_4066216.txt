Does Windows Phone 7 permit asynchronous programming?

I'm building a newsreader app for wp7. I'd like to have some background activity occur, like writing downloaded content to isolated storage. Is there any way to do this without blocking the UI thread? The DownloadStringCompleted event of WebClient is asynchronous, right? Could I just do it there?
