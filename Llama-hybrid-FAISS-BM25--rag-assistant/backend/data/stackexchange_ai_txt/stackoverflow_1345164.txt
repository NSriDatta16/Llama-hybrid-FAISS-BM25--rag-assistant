echo 'select some_column from some_table' | mysql -uusername -ppassword some_db | tail -n+2 Several important things to pay attention to here: There cannot be a space between -p and the password. If there is, it assumes you didn't give a password, and prompts you for it interactively. Beware: some OSes let other users see the full command line for commands other users are running, so -ppassword is a security risk. Only do this on machines where users that can log in are all trusted, or on OSes that prevent this sort of snooping, like FreeBSD. The "tail" call ignores the first output line, which is the column name. Results begin on the second line, thus +2. The "count rows" bit is similar, except that you say "select count(*) from some_table" instead.
