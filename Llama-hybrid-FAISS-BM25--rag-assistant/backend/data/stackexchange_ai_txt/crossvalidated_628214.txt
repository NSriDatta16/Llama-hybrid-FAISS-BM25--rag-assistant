Anomaly detection via hypothesis test in Poisson distribution

The number of daily users ordering from an e-commerce can be modeled using a Poisson distribution. I want to detect anomalies using some kind of hypothesis test or probabilistic reasoning. That is, I use the data of the last months to calculate the mean of my Poisson distribution. If a given day I observe a number of orders way lower than the mean of my distribution, then I reject the null hypothesis of the number of orders of that day being generated by the Poisson fitted with the data of the last months. Can you help me formalize this? What exact test would you run for this purpose? How would you find the mean of the Poisson using data of the last months? Do you think some kind of bayesian alternative could make more sense?
