Show trailing whitespace on emacs only on non-empty lines

Right now I'm using: (setq show-trailing-whitespace t) In my .emacs to show trailing whitespace for my CC mode. I can't seem to figure out how to have it not show the whitespace font for whitespace only lines. Empty lines separating indenting code are sometimes indented at the code level and sometimes not indented at all, and I don't want to draw my attention to a line I don't care to change. I'd like to stick to built-in emacs modules, but I'm willing to use whitespace.el but it's not clear how to configure it to do this.
