jQuery UI draggable() and resizable()

I want to write the draggable() and resizable() code in such a way that all future elements with a particular class will inherit those plugins without calling them again. $('div.resizeMe').resizable({ containment: 'parent', minWidth: 400, minHeight: 200 }) When the above code is executed, all divs with resizeMe class inherits the resizable() function. But if I appended BODY with a new div with the same class, I needed to execute that code again. So my goal here is how to rewrite that code such that it will work for all and including future elements.
