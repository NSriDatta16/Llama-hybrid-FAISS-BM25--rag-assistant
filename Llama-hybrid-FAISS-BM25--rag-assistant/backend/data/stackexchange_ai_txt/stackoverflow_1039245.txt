I finally figured a out a relatively simple (although not at all elegant) way to do this. While debugging on the iPhone, I set up a breakpoint for objc_msgSend. I then typed in this simple GDB script: while 1 printf "[%s %s]", (char *)object_getClassName($r0), (char *) $r1 c end This prints out each method call. It's not perfect, because it prints out the class name of the object the message is being sent to, and not the object itself, but it works for what I needed. Note this will only work on the iPhone itself.
