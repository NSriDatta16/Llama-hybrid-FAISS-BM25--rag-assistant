If you want to write code for Plone, it's best to avoid the ZMI. The concept of doing things through the ZMI is very limited and discouraged - more and more things are not available in there and it will go away at some point. The actual Plone control panels offer you most of the configuration options you can use. For anything else the file system is the best place to look.
