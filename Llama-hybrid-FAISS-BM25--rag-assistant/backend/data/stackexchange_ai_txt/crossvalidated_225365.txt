My understanding is: p-value is to tell us what to believe (verifying a theory with sufficient data) while Neyman-Pearson approach is to tell us what to do (making best possible decisions even with limited data). So it looks to me that (small) p-value is more stringent while Neyman-Pearson approach is more pragmatic; That's probably why p-value is used more in answering scientific questions while Neyman and Pearson is used more in making statistical/practical decisions.
