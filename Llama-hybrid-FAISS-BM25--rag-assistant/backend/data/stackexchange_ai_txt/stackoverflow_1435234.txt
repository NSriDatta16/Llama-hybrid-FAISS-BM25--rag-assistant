jQuery data is made for this sort of thing. $("#source div").draggable({ helper:"clone", revert:"invalid", start: function(evt,ui) { $(this).data('injected', contextualObject) } }); Then, in your droppable: var obj = $(ui.draggable).data('injected'); console.log(obj.property); A couple of notes: You should use ui.draggable in your drop to get the item that is drag and dropped. this is the item getting dropped on Element id's should start with a letter , not a number. I have a working demo here .
