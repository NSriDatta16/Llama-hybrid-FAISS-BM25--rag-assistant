Ranking Sample (n dimension) Data Points

I have a dataset which has a bunch of columns(features). There are around 10 features for each row (data point). Think of each data point as a person and features, some attributes defining that person. Now I want to rank these data points. Basically create a ranking method which looks at their features and comes up with a ranking score and says a particular data point (person) is higher than others and so on. Is there any statistics method I can use that can help here? Using some naive methods as taking average of all feature values for a datapoint and then comparing those averages against each datapoint doesn't sound very good. Looking if there is a way this problem can be solved statistically or some ML method.
