Django want to use a variable from another view

I have a list of items in a view called client_items. I want to be able to use the variable items_list`which is another view called edit_order in client_items. So is there a way to call the variable from a different view? (Import a variable from another view and be able to use this variable in the other) I cannot just write it in client_items view because it needs an order_no augment. Edit: here is my latest views. I have tried creating another views called items_in_edit_order. At this point I get `order_no not defined. def items_in_edit_order(order_no): order = models.Order.objects.get(pk = order_no) return order def client_items(request, client_id = 0): client = models.Client.objects.get(pk = client_id) items = client.storageitem_set.all() order = items_in_edit_order(order_no) return render_to_response('items.html', {'items':items, 'client':client, 'order':order}, context_instance = RequestContext(request))
