Scaling sensor output before training a machine learning model

I'm working with the Emotiv EEG headset. My goal is to collect the signal from its 14 sensors while a subject who is wearing it performs a certain task, and use a machine learning model (a neural network in the present case) to identify certain patterns of interest in the signal from the device. I would like to scale the sensor data before providing it as input to the model. I'm collecting this data in separate sessions for each individual subject. I observed that initially, the sensor data varies between 7,500 and 8,500. I'm considering scaling the data across all the subjects to zero-mean and unit-variance, followed by PCA or an equivalent decorrelation step. Then I'll train the model. My questions: (1) Would my steps for scaling the data be ok, or are there any additional precautions I need to take while dealing with the sensor data? (2) When I'm using the trained model in real setting with a new subject, and I want it to make predictions while I collect the sensor information about the subject, how should I scale the data then? Should I scale it by the same factor with which I scaled the data used to train/test the model? (3) And what if I would like to update my model as I'm collecting new data from other subjects in an online manner? How should I scale the sensor data then? I will be trying different possibilities next and I was hoping to get some advice here. Thanks!
