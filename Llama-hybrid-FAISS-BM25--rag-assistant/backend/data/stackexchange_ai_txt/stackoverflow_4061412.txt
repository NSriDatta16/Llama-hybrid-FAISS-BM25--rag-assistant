Ignore caching of a specific file with APC

Is there a way to prevent a specific file from being opcode cached with APC ? The use case is as follows: An application that sits on the cloud, which dynamically resizes itself (spinning up and down servers as required). The config.php script must know of the new IPs as they become available or unavailable. Since these changes happen frequently enough, and the config.php file is fairly basic, it would be ideal to not have to worry about clearing APC just for the one file. Clearing the one file out of APC is definitely a possibility, but since you can't access APC via the command line, the solution ends up being rather inelegant.
