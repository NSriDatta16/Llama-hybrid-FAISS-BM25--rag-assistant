The expected value corresponds to the value you should expect to obtain, on average, if you repeat the action MANY times. In your example of the fair dice, if you assume that all sides are equally likely (probability 1/6 each) and if you were to do try many times, on average you would get the value: 1 * 1/6 + 2 * 1/6 + 3 * 1/6 4 * 1/6 + 5* 1/6 + 6 * 1/6 = 3.5 But, if the dice was not fair (assume for example that it never gives you a 1, but the 6 is twice as likely as usual), then the expected value would be: 1 * 0 + 2 * 1/6 + 3 * 1/6 4 * 1/6 + 5* 1/6 + 6 * 2/6 = 4.3 Note that the expected value does not need to correspond with any actual (integer) value you can obtain in one particular realization.
