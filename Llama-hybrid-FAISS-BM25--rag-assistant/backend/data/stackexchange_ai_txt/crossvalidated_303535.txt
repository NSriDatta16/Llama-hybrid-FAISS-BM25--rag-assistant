Disclaimer There are people here with more experience. While a hierarchical model is definitely the superior approach, you can also leave out this additional difficulty, given that any Bayesian approach is "regularized" by the inclusion of priors. To say, from literally interpreting the question asked to you, I don't think you necessarily need to use multilevel analysis, and take a bit more time to understand hierarchical modelling. In that case, you can try copying the formulas used between lm and rstanarm and expect similar, but regularized estimates for the coefficients. How much regularization is applied, depends on your choice of priors. While there are defaults in rstanarm , it is important to think about this, and that requires considering the scaling of the data and also the meaning of the coefficients in the model. To create a hierarchical model, it is not necessarily clear which variables you want to group together, or shrink. I am not sure which grouping you want to use in your model. I don't really understand grouping by outcome . In your case, what kind of variable is the outcome? Is it an ordinal variable (Low, Medium, High)? In that case, I would suggest reading page 13 in https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/brms/vignettes/brms_overview.pdf for a very quick example.
