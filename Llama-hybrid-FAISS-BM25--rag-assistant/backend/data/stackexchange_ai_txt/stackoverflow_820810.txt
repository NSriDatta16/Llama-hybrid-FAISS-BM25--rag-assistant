C# regex match only parts of complete words in string

Before asking this question I have Googled for this problem and I have looked through all StackOverflow related questions. The problem is pretty simple I have a string "North Atlantic Treaty Organization" I have a pattern "a.*z", at moment it would match north ATLATIC TREATY ORGANIZation But I need it to match complete words only (orgANIZation for example) I have tried "\ba z\b" and "\Ba z\B" as pattern, but I think I don't quite get it How should I change my pattern in order to match complete words that string contains (without matching multiple words) The patterns are generated on the fly, user enteres a*z and my application translates it into pattern that matches parts of complete words in string. My problem is that I don't know what user is going to search for. Ideally I would preppend some regexp to user's expression. Thank You!
