To my understanding, you want to apply Random Forest to forecast simulated data. I don't know what the reason behind this is, but I struggle to see a valid reason to do so other than testing the algorithm. However, since the data is simulated, RF can only recognize patterns that you create when generating it. Therefore if you generate some features completely independently from your target variable, these will only be noise to the Random Forest. In short, yes, if you ignore some correlations when creating the data, these cannot be picked up by the algorithm, which will therefore have a worse performance.
