I manage to solve it bit more specific for my problem. Not so good but it works, i used the underlining div to detect drop like this: $("#target").droppable({ accept: '#drag img', drop: function() {//change src of image in this div } }); I don't think this will help anyone but se @tvanfosson reply for a other solution
