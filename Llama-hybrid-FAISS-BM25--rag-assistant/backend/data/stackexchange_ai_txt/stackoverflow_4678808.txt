My site doesn't get indexed for some reason

I use http://www.auditmypc.com/xml-sitemap.asp to check if it gets crawled or not. http://www.domain.com/ does NOT get crawled http://www.domain.com/bg/ does NOT get crawled http://www.domain.com/bg/medical/ does unleash the huge crawling activity also, it matters for some reason whether /bg/medical/ has www . If it doesn't, crawling doesn't work again. .htaccess file: RewriteEngine on RewriteBase / RewriteCond %{http_host} ^domain.com [NC] RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://www.domain.com/$1 [R=301,L] RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d RewriteRule ^.*$ site/lib/router.php router.php file relevant parts: @list($uri,$queryString) = explode('?',$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'],2); $uri = trim($uri,'/'); $_GET = array(); parse_str($queryString,$_GET); if (empty($uri)) { header('Location: /bg/home'); die(); } @list($first,$second,$third,$fourth) = explode('/', $uri, 4); ///////////// VARIETY OF SWITCHES HERE with stuff like that: if(empty($second)) switch($first){ case 'bg': redirect('/'.$first.'/home/'); case 'en': redirect('/'.$first.'/home/'); } I think it's somewhere in the redirects that things get lost. But I can't figure out why. Any help would be appreciated. robots.txt: User-agent: * Allow: / and the definition of redirect function: function redirect($url) { header("Location: $url"); die(); } EDIT: if that helps also: Header fields HTTP/1.1 302 Moved Temporarily Date Thu, 13 Jan 2011 11:02:13 GMT Content-Length 0 Location /bg/home Keep-Alive timeout=5, max=100 Connection Keep-Alive Content-Type text/html Server Apache/2.2.14 (Unix) mod_ssl/2.2.14 OpenSSL/0.9.8e-fips- rhel5 mod_auth_passthrough/2.1 mod_bwlimited/1.4 FrontPage/5.0.2.2635 X-Powered-By PHP/5.2.11
