Here's one way to do it (I'm assuming here that you are wanting to show the number of guesses and the value they entered as the guess): $('#game span:eq(0)').text(guessCount); $('#game span:eq(1)').text($guess); But personally, I would just put an id on the two spans and use that, unless there's a good reason not to. Wouldn't be as fragile in case you end up sticking another span tag in there above those two at some point.
