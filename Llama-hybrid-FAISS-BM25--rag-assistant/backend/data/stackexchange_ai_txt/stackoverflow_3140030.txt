There's a good book called "Pragmatic Unit Testing with NUnit" by Thompson and Hunt. That's how I started and it provides a good introduction. For more information on how and what to test in general I'd recomment "The Art of Unit Testing" by Osherove and "Test Driven Development" by Beck. Also take a look at this helpful summary card also from Thompson and Hunt http://media.pragprog.com/titles/utj/StandaloneSummary.pdf . The concepts are further explained in their book. Update: Not sure I can recommend any books that describe the mechanics of setting up your project but I can offer some basic advice. Create a separate test project for each source project you want to test. Make sure you don't mix integration/system testing with your unit tests. One way to ensure this is to differentiate between test projects. e.g. I might have something like CustomLibraryCode.proj //source project CustomlibraryCodeTests.Unit.proj //unit test project CustomLibraryCodeTests.Integration.proj //integration test project This means that your unit tests which should be quick and easy to run can be executed in isolation from the integration tests, which typically might have dependencies on database, filesystem, etc., and tend to be slower and more brittle.
