If you're using Windows you could try using COM . It requires a lot of attention to detail, and is kind of painful to use from C, but it would allow you to build extension points with well-defined interfaces and an object-oriented structure. In this usage case, extensions label themselves with a 'Component Category' defined by your app, hwich allows the Core to find and load them withough havng to know where their DLLs are. The extensions also implement interfaces that are specified using IDL and are consumed by the core. This is old tech now, but it does work.
