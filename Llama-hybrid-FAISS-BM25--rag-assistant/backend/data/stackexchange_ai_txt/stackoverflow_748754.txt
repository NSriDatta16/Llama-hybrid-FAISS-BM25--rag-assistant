You could delete an re-insert all the rows - that would do the whole operation in just two queries (or three if you need to select all the data). I wouldn't count on it being faster, and you'd have to do it inside a transaction or you'll be heading for your backups before too long. It could also lead to table fragmentation. A better option might be to record each change as a history then do something like this: Example, position 10 is moved down two to 12th UPDATE table SET display_order = display_order -1 WHERE display_order BETWEEN 10 AND 12 UPDATE table SET display_order = 12 WHERE row_id = [id of what was row 10]
