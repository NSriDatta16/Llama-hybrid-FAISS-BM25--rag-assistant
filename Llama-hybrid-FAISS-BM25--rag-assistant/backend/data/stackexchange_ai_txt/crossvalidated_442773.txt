Sample size for the evaluation of Deep Learning Models

I'm evaluating the performance and accuracy in detecting objects for my data set using three deep learning algorithms. In total there are 24,085 images. I measure the performance in terms of time taken to detect the objects. To measure the accuracy, I manually count the number of objects in each image and then calculate recall and precision values for three algorithms. However, since I'm manually counting to get actual object count, I selected only 30 images. Will that sample be enough to make a conclusion that algorithm 1 is better than others in terms performance and accuracy?
