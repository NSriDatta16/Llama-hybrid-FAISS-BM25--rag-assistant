Fitting a plane to a set of points leaves one degree of freedom unconstrained. The plane is free to spin around its normal and the fit is equal. I don't know anything about CGAL, but I wouldn't be surprised to discover that they just find a convenient plane when finding the fit (probably a nearest projection from the original axes of the space). If you did real PCA on the point cloud, I don't think you'd have that problem. Alternatively, perhaps you could rescale (stretch) your data along the normal discovered by the fitting algorithm and then find another fit. If you stretch the data out sufficiently, then the first plane found shouldn't be as good a fit as some orthogonal plane.
