Feature importance for ANN

I have a multi-class classifier ANN with ~11000 input features, two hidden layers and a softmax output. I would like to know which features are most important to drive the network towards predicting one class vs another. I have seen saliency maps used to define per-class pixel importance in convolutional networks that classify images; however, I seem to struggle to find something similar for a 1D/non-CNN case. Can someone suggest methods to solve this problem (references and examples would be greatly appreciated!)?
