I think Pearson Correlation coefficient is more fit for two continous variables. If you want to test the hypothesis that whether or not someone watches a popular TV show is associated with hours of watching Tv, you may try logistic regression analysis. You treat the binary (0,1) varible as an outcome variable and your groups (or hours) as a predictor variable. If you can give me some data I can show you how to do it use SAS, R, stata or SPSS. I try to use data you provided to conduct the analysis in SAS and R. The codes are following: R: library(foreign) data SAS: data a; input group $ binary; datalines; 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 0 2 1 ; run; proc logistic data=a; class group(ref="0" param=ref); model binary(enent="1")=group; run; Results shows that there are no association between goup and watch popular TV. Anyway, real data may be different. R results and SAS results are the same.
