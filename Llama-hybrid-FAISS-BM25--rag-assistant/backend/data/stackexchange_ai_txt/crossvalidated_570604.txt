I googled and found this paper: DeepGCNs: Can GCNs Go as Deep as CNNs? . but they found that it only works with residual connections: Without such connections, performance can actually degrade with dilated graph convolutions. The reason for this is probably that these varying neighbors result in ‘worse’ gradients, which further hinder convergence when residual graph connections are not used.
