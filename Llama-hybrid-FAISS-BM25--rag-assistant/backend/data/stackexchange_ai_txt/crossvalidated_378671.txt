In the above proof it is written that for a transient state there exists such sequence [Thus, there exists a sequence $\{ X_0=j_0=i, X_1=j_1, \dots, X_n =j_n, \dots \}$ such that $$ j_n \not = i, \, \forall\, n \geq 1$$ and $$ \Pr\left(X_n = j_n, \ \forall n \geq 1| X_0=j_0\right) = \prod_{n=1}^{+\infty} p_{j_{n-1}j_n}>0$$ ] with positive probability. But in the example of asymmetric (I. E. the forward probability $p or $p>0.5$ )random walk on $\mathbb Z$ , every state is transient where as no such sequence with positive probability exist for any state. Rather there are many examples of discrete Markov chain with finite state space where a state is transient but no such sequence exist. I think the above consideration for transient state is not always true.
