Your question reminds me of the following. An L1 predictor X can be split into two components, a between component $X_B$ and a within component $X_W$ . The between component is constructed by taking the average of all X values for a given person. In R: XBetween XBetween is a new variable with as many values as X has; if a person has 10 values over time for X, then XBetween contains 10 values, all equal to the average of X for that person. Next, the within component $X_W$ is created by: XWithin If there exists a correlation between some L2 variable, say Age, and X, this can only be because there is a correlation between $X_B$ and Age. If you would use as model: $Y = b_{0j} + b_BX_B + b_WX_W + b_3Age + b_4Gender + ...$ then $b_W$ gives you the so called within-effect of X: what happens with Y if X increases 1 unit within a given person! On the other hand, $b_B$ shows what happens with Y if the average of X increases 1 unit, being a between-person interpretation. The $b_W$ effect cannot be confounded by your L2 variables, but $b_B$ can, if there exists a correlation of the L2 variable and $X_B$ ! So you may want to check for such correlation. The within effect $b_W$ is often considered to be more interesting than the between effect is. Suppose you would use dummies for you persons (instead of the random $b_{0j}$ ). Then you would not be able to include Age en Gender of course, but only X, and the effect of X would then be equal $b_W$ , as it is the effect controlling for person. These kind of multilevel models for longitudinal data are called "hybrid models" or "within-between models". See Paul Allison's blog on hybrid models
