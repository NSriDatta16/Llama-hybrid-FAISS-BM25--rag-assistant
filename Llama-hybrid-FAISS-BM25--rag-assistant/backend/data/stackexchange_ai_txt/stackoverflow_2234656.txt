I've never seen any tool to do that ; but the way that's generally used when one wants to use some C library from PHP is to write a PHP extension, that acts as some kind of "bridge" between the PHP userland-code, and the C library. That's how you are able to use the curl library from PHP, for example. A couple of interesting reads on that matter : Extension Writing Part I: Introduction to PHP and Zend Extension Writing Part II: Parameters, Arrays, and ZVALs Extension Writing Part II: Parameters, Arrays, and ZVALs [continued] Extension Writing Part III: Resources Wrapping C++ Classes in a PHP Extension And, if you are really interested by the subject, and ready to spend some money on it, you could also buy the book Extending and Embedding PHP ( some pages are available as preview on Google Books too) ; I've seen a couple of times that it was the book to read when interested on this subject (In fact, I've bought it some time ago, and it's an interesting read, even if you don't plan on writing an extension right now) BTW, the author of that book is also the author of the first four articles I linked to ;-)
