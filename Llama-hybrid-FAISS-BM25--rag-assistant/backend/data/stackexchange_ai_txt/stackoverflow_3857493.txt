WPF 'Please Wait' animation using background workers - is this possible

Recently our WPF/Entity Framework 4.0 application has become unstable after we began using backgroundworkers in order to load data from the entity. We were doing so in order to have a 'Please Wait'-spinner graphic running while the BG worker retrieved data from the database, but we began experiencing numerous EF-related connection issues and other inexplicable errors at random times. A post from a Microsoft EF team member seemed to suggest that EF is not 'thread safe' and once we removed the BG workers the problems did indeed go away. This leaves us with a UI-experience issue - we no longer have a nice user-friendly 'Please-Wait' spinner running while the data is loading. Does anyone out there have any suggestions as to other ways in which this can be done without placing the data-load into a BG worker? Thanks
