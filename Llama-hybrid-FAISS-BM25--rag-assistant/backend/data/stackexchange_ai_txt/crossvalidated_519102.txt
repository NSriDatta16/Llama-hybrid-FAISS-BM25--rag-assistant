Random Forest Error: Type of Predictors in new Data do not match training set

I am new learner with random forest and I am trying to run a code for predicting new variables. I did a test with Iris data ( https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris ) using this code: iris.rf So doing a test run on the Iris data was fine but I did another test run on another dataset for Seoul Bikes ( https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Seoul+Bike+Sharing+Demand ) This the dataframe I made before running the code for new observations: str(bikes) 'data.frame': 365 obs. of 15 variables: $ Day : num 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ... $ Month : num 12 12 12 12 12 12 12 12 12 12 ... $ Year : num 2017 2017 2017 2017 2017 ... $ RentedBikeCount: num 447 611 563 338 334 416 390 350 486 235 ... $ Temperature : num 3 7.3 7.6 0.1 -1.1 5.5 4.4 -1.3 4.7 4.2 ... $ Humidity : num 26 35 76 27 28 34 36 27 32 85 ... $ WindSpeed : num 2 1.3 1.2 4.5 0 1 2.7 3.1 2.2 0.7 ... $ Visibility : num 2000 1955 422 2000 2000 ... $ DewPointTemp : num -14.6 -7.1 3.6 -16.7 -17.3 -9.1 -9.4 -17.9 -10.6 1.8 ... $ SolarRadiation : num 1.01 0.99 0.69 1.09 0 0.96 1.04 1.12 1.06 0.65 ... $ Rainfall : num 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ... $ Snowfall : num 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1.4 ... $ Seasons : Factor w/ 4 levels "Autumn","Spring",..: 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 ... $ Holiday : Factor w/ 2 levels "Holiday","No Holiday": 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 ... $ Functioning_Day: Factor w/ 2 levels "No","Yes": 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 ... My new observations are like so for this dataset: x.new then I run the same code as I did with the Iris data that I explained earlier in this message. When I run the next line of code predict(iris.rf,x.new,type="response") I run into this error: Error in predict.randomForest(iris.rf, x.new, type = "response") : Type of predictors in new data do not match that of the training data. I check the dataframe of my original data everything matches so I don't know where I am going wrong. I want to use these new values to predict the ##Rented Bike Count Can someone please help me or direct to right post that explains a solution clearly. (I did try to look through other posts but was not finding the exact solution I want) Thanks! Rose
