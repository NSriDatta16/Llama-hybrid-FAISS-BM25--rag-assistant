When NOT to use the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI)?

Recently I have been working on a scientific paper about clustering, in which I use two extrinsic evaluation metrics to evaluate the clusterings: $B^3 F$ score and $ARI$ . The former score is much more informative than the latter and delivers remarkably higher values. On the other hand, $ARI$ seems to fit my dataset in which $k \approx N$ where $k$ is the number of clusters (six on average) and $N$ the data points (20 on average). However, my supervisory professor suggests omitting $ARI$ because it is insensitive and thus uninformative; for instance, even if I supply the true $k$ to the algorithms it won't change much. Overall $ARI$ produces mediocre results of around $0.1$ , which is pretty low. Upon reading about the limitations of $ARI$ and adjusted measures in general, it was brought to my attention that: The analytical formula of $ARI$ was derived based on the assumption of hyper-geometric model of randomness , which poses some tight constraints that are almost never satisfied by the outputs of a clustering algorithm [1]; Moreover, Meila [2] explained that all adjusted indices, including ARI, are non-local, which means a variation in one of the clusters would be considered differently depending on how the remaining clusters are formed. So could you please further elaborate on the situations in which the usage of $ARI$ isn't advocated?
