Migrating from clear password storage to authlogic

I'm currently working on a Rails app which stores plain clear passwords (...). So I'm migrating to Authlogic authentication with a 'standard' SHA512 encryption. I did that which works fine : #file /models/user.rb class User It's nice -- and works just fine -- but I wonder if there is a sexier way to do that, perhaps with an Authlogic core option ? Thanks !
