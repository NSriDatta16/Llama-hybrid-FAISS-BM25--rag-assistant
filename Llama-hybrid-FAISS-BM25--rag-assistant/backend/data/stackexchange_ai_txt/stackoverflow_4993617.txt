After some research and experimenting, I have discovered the solution to this problem is by using the containment option in the jQuery UI draggable plugin. To stop the behavior described in the question, follow these steps: Search for the function called draggableSlotEvent . Under it, find eventElement.draggable({ . Place the following line as another option: containment: ".fc-agenda-body table", You will now be unable to drag events past the hour boundaries.
