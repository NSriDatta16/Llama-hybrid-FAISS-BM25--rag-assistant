rendering multiple Calendars bloats html, bogs down page

note: I am using the Infragistics control because this is inherited legacy code, but I am not above rewritting with an ASP.NET control if that is a better solution. I have a Repeater control that uses an Infragistics WebDateChooser to select a date for a record. Let's say each item in the Repeater represents a customer, and I am selecting an activation date or something of that nature. It could be any time past, present, or future. When you render this control 20 times, it writes all of the heavy html for showing all of the dates (month names, weekdays, etc etc) 20 times and bloats the html dramatically. This causes the browser to really struggle with rendering the page in any reasonable amount of time, even for 20 records (paging implemented on the repeater just to prevent the browser from crashing on massive page). This is also true to a lesser (but still significant) degree with the standard ASP.NET calendar control. What I'm looking for is a way to possibly make all 20 date choosers share the resources of 1 calendar so they don't each need to render their own strings and crap for displaying verbose dates. EDIT: I understand many users have not used Infragistics, but it's still just as true with the standard, built in ASP:Calendar control. Put one in a repeater and display n > 20 times. It bogs down the browser when rendering. Also, just to clarify incase this matters to anyone's potential solution, this codebase is on .NET 2.0 and has to support IE6.
