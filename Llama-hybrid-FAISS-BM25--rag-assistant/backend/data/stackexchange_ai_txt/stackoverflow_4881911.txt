Injecting class fields in Java

Hello all I have a piece of software that I would like to run many different times, each for a particular value of a class field that is set in the class's constructor. E.g, somewhere in the code is something along the lines of public class Stuff { private double importantVal; public Stuff(double val) { this.importantval = val; } public double doStuff() { return 4 * importantVal; } } This class and method is very far down in the program/call-stack, so I can't merely call doStuff several times by itself. I would like to test the program for various values of importantVal, perhaps by placing them in a file and iterating over them. I worked out the easy bit of running the program many times , but I have no good idea of how to substitute different values of importantVal. If all else fails I can always write a script that modifies the source code, but that feels ugly and ad-hoc. Is there a more elegant solution involving injection, or something along those lines?
