Just one caveat to keep an eye on - if the fold sizes are not equal then the average of fold results is not the same as the average over whole dataset. You should weight fold results by fold size to get the correct average. Suppose you have a dataset $X=\{1,2,3,4,5\}$ and use 2-fold cross-validation. The first fold is $\{1,2\}$ and the second fold is $\{3,4,5\}$. Let's say your predictions for the first fold are $\{2,2\}$ and for the second fold $\{4,4,4\}$. Then MSE for the first fold is $(1 + 0)/2 = 1/2$ and for the second fold $(1 + 0 + 1)/3 = 2/3$. Naive cross-validation result would be $(1/2 + 2/3)/2 = 7/12$. But if you calculate the same thing over entire dataset you get $(1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1)/5 = 3/5$. The correct way to calculate cross-validation results would have been $1/2*2/5 + 2/3*3/5 = 3/5$,
