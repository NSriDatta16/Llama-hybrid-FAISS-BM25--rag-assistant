How does ASP.Net MVC differ from Classic ASP (not ASP.Net--the original ASP)

I'm trying to get a high-level understanding of ASP.Net MVC, and it has started to occur to me that it looks a lot like the original ASP script. Back in the day, we were organizing our "model"/business logic code into VBScript classes, or into VB COM components. Of course, now we have the additional power of c# and the .net framework classes. Besides the high-level oo and other capabilities in c# and .Net, what are the other major differences between the original ASP and ASP.Net MVC?
