Success of a logistic regression model

Say I have a model $y=f_n(x_1,x_2,x_3)$. Here say $y$ is categorical and binomial response. i.e. $y$ can be only 0 or 1. Data shows 87% 1 and 13% 0 values. I fit a multinomial logit on a test dataset to try to predict $y$. Validation against a validation dataset showed 70% success. (Success meaning Model prediction matches $y$ in the validation set). Normally I'd be happy with the 70% success rate. But I'm a bit confused because: Say, I had a blackbox model that always answered "$y=1$" no matter what $x_1$, $x_2$ and $x_3$ are. Wouldn't this model anyways achieve 87% success? What's the point behind my multinomial logit unless I can beat 87%? What gives? Am I making a blunder?
