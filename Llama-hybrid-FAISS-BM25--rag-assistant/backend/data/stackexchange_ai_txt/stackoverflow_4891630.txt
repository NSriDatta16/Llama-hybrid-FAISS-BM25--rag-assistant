Static HTML templates for client UI?

I'm looking to implement a fully functional HTML5 application with most of the client code pre-packaged in a bunch of html files. To this end, I'd like to have a templating engine that operates on the html to reuse headers, footers, nav bars &c. What is the best static html templating engine? And by that, I mean that it has to start with input files and generate a set of html files. This is to provide things that Javascript templates couldn't, like including html fragments. I am currently looking at ttree . Is there a better one out there?
