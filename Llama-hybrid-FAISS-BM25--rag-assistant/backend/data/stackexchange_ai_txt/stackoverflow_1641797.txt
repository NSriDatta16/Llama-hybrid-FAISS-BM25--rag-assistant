Yeah, the main reason I'd consider actually embedding PowerShell in that scenario is if your UI could generate PowerShell scripts for the actions the users take in the UI, so they could see what was happening, and easily learn how to automate it. That would require designing the UI based on PowerShell from the beginning ... so it sounds to me like you're better off just providing the cmdlets and samples ;)
