As you stated in your post, 30% of the devices actually crash. Of the iPads that crash, they crash, on average, 9.3 times each day ((11+7+10)/3 = 9.3). Aside from that, there aren't any fancy statistical tests that can be used as you only have data on 10 iPads. This is simply an exploratory study that may warrant further investigation. I hope that helps!
