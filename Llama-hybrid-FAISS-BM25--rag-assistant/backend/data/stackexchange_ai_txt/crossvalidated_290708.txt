growth curve analysis - problems with model fit

I'm very new to GCA so sorry in advance if the question is very basic. I have run an eye-tracking experiment in which participants look either at one of the elements or the other (so I have a binomial distribution). I have two fixed factors in my model: Type of relative clause (RC.type, with two levels) Animacy of the elements, whether they are alive or not (Condition, with three levels). Following Mirman's book "Growth Curve Analysis and Visualisation using R" and Fergusson's "R Workshop on Using Linear Models, Logistic Regression, and Growth Curve Analyses to Analyze Eye-tracking Data" (which can be found online) I fit a quasi-logistic regression model, with weight correction for the end-points. The code was the following (note, the data is called "jp"): #preparation for logistic regression, creation of 3-level polinomy t I also played with a quartic level polynomial and with more complex random slopes. When I checked the fit of my model, I see the following: ggplot(jp, aes(x=Ms, y=elog, color=Condition))+facet_wrap(~RC.type)+ stat_summary(fun.y=mean, geom="point") + stat_summary(aes(y=predict(m.full,jp,re.form=NA)), fun.y=mean, geom="line") And this is the plot I obtain: As you can see, the fit is not really good. There are several problems: There are no differences in the predicted model for Condition , although the data is different, but more importantly, There are no differences as well in the predicted line depending on RC.type , when the data itself is the opposite. The t-value of RC.type shows significant differences at the three levels. However, I'm guessing those significant differences don't mean anything, because the model is clearly not good. What am I missing? What is wrong with the model? Do I need to recode my fixed factors to number coding and center them, perhaps? Is there anything else? Thank you very much in advance for your help!!
