How do I train Xgboost classifier for ECG Signal data?

I am testing https://www.physionet.org/challenge/2017/sources/ submission. I like one of the submission code, which use Xgboost to train the classifier. Training data is in .mat file which can be converted to csv format. In below code, I have pretrained model xgb.bin , using which I can test any input signal. But I Want to train the model using different data and create my own training model. Here is the code which predicts class name for given input ecg file def predict(data): #data = io.loadmat(path)['val'][0] from numpy import genfromtxt data = genfromtxt('testdata/val.csv', delimiter=',') features_noise = np.zeros((5, )) snr, rr_num, var, fr, fr2 = find_noise_features(data) features_noise[0] = snr features_noise[1] = rr_num features_noise[2] = var features_noise[3] = fr features_noise[4] = fr2 features = extract_basic_features(data, 30000) features = np.hstack((features, features_noise.reshape(1, -1))) mean_ = np.array([15.96300284066109753667, 0.00412371298595770857, 38811.34497233365254942328, 0.48050717744965593115, 0.14397582347542958736]) scale_ = np.array([4.22917401559752281770, 0.00093664880988427878, 62350.76443798459513345733, 0.15396567666240373873, 0.07085474966801086349]) features_noise -= mean_ features_noise /= scale_ prediction = 0 if features_noise[0] 6.0: prediction = 3 if features_noise[3] > 3.0: prediction = 3 if features_noise[4] I want to train this classifer using my own dataset. Above model is trained on https://www.physionet.org/challenge/2017/training2017.zip dataset. Looking at above code, do you have any clue how can I train the model using Xgboost. Here is my thought steps Calculate features for all training signal in zip file Calculate feature_noise as it is in above code for all signals Calculate dfeatures features for each signals (Should I calculate it for each signals or for all signal together) Train dfeatures for all signals using Xgboost (How?) Store the xgboost model Is this correct steps to do?
