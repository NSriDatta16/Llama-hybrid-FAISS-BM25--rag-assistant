TFS, testing and placement of test files (where)

I am currently experimenting with TFS, and I really like it. One small question, regarding test files: I have a directory with some demo TXT, images, dirs... These are used during tests, so up until now, the path was hardcoded to a folder on my computer. Now I need to change this, of course, the TFS need access to the files too. My idea was to place them inside the folder of my solution, I currently have roughly this structure: Solution Folder mysol.sln SomeProjectDir OtherProjectDir _LIB for external .dll _DEMO_FILES for test files The whole solution folder is under source control. Would you do it the same way? How is the best and elegant way to get the "real" path of the folder for usage in unit tests? Using the execution path an cutting away the rest? Do test files belong under source control? Thanks for any input, Chris EDIT: Beside the tip given in the answer, please be aware that with testing there are some pitfalls with this. The test is executed in a different folder (often named after some timecode), the testfiles do not get copied there automatically. Even if they are set to copy always. The solution is to either add the files manually by using a attribute called DeploymentItem in the unit-test, or, in my opinion much better, adjust the Local.testsettings and add the folder there. Keep in mind, the folder itself will not be added, so you need to do it one level higher.. You will understand what I mean if you try it. Or search for DeploymentItem on google
