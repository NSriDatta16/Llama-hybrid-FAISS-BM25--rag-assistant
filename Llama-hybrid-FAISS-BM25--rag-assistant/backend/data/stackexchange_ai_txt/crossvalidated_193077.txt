I agree with user Hidden Markov Model , when the underlying phenomena, which is generating the time series, is constant. On the other hand, if the dynamics of wins and losses transform as new football tactics appear, then very old time series are less representative of tomorrow than recent observations. As S. Kolassa points out, time series cannot be plugged directly into RF or any other supervised regression method. Typically for RF, a time series is treated with a rolling window generating learning examples how some past events ($X_{t-1}$ to $X_{t-k}$) coincided with some future outcome $X_t$. The model is free to up weigh any $k$ recent periods in the windows. But the regression model does not up weigh those learning examples/windows where $t$ is closest to present day by default. One can help RF up weigh recent examples by stratification. E.g. for each tree is bootstrapped(with replacement) 200 learning examples within last 200 periods of $t$ + 200 learning examples from the last 1000 periods of $t$. Thus, when the underlying system could be transient it would make good sense to down sample distant-in-past learning examples/windows. If your system of interest is both transient and noisy you're in trouble.
