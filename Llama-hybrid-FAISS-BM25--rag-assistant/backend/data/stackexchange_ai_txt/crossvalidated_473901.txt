Error terms and Residual in Time Series

I started learning Time Series Forecasting and the below questions keep my head confused a lot. Many papers mention that the forecast errors have to be normally distributed and what about the white noise error term, guess white noise wouldn't be fitting into the normal distribution of errors. Most importantly the idea for any time series forecast model is to have the error term that should be completely white noise? so that we covered all factors/relationship in predicting a variable and the only error left is white noise? Forecast function= signal + white noise Signal contains residuals (reducible errors) and white noise are irreducible errors? So the normality of errors is only for the residual errors(reducible errors) and does not include White noise? So for every Time Series forecast we calculate the Residual errors( like RSME) separately and check for White noise separately?
