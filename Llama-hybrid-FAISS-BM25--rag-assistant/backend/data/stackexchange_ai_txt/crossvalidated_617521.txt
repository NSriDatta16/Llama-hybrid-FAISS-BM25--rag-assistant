Types of measurement error and their implications in SEM

An often cited advantage of Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) is that it is able to account for measurement error in the observed indicator variables, therefore allowing for consistent estimates in the presence of error-in-variables (in contrast to standard linear regression). It is not clear to me, however, what types of measurement error are accounted for (i.e., what the specific assumptions concerning this measurement error are). What if we are not dealing with random measurement error (pure noise, unrelated to both Y and X), but some kind of systematic measurement error (e.g., self-report measures of dietary intake are systematically lower than the actual intake for those at the higher end of the spectrum)? Do these two types of measurement error correspond to classical and non-classical measurement error? What are the implications for parameter retrieval? I understood that measurement error usually leads to attenuation bias (coefficient biased towards zero), but in other books I read that the effect can also be overestimated. Under what circumstances would it possibly be overestimated instead of underestimated? Multiple predictors, relaxing assumptions,...? Any explanations or referrals to clarifying textbook chapters would be greatly appreciated.
