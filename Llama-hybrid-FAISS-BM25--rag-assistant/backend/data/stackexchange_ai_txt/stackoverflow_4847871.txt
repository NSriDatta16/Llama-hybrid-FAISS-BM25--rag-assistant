I'm going to answer with a semi technical anser instead of posting the subjective way I organize projects. IMHO there is a severe case of "Projectitus" in the .NET world where everybody makes a new project for logical organization reasons. Use namespaces for that. Do not make a project unless there is a physical reason for you to do so. A perfect reason to create a new project is that many solutions need access to a single assembly and need to debug against it. Projects slow down build times. Slow build times = less time spend coding and more context shifting = loss of productivity. There are also implications for performance, although minor: http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/chad_myers/archive/2008/07/15/project-anti-pattern-many-projects-in-a-visual-studio-solution-file.aspx - markup wouldn't let me format this NDepend has a "flag" for too many projects in a solution. This may by subjective but also do not make any new projects for deployment reasons. Single .dll hotfixes are indicative of issues with your development and deployment cycle. Like Scott Hanselman said "If you are deploying with XCopy ( or Explorer I think ) you're doing it wrong. ;)
