The specification of the sort of data that you want to generate is very broad, and there are many ways to simulate sort of random walks with paths that have a tendency to 'return to the mean'. For instance, you can change your code like: set.seed(420) a = 0.9 b = 0.7 n = 10^4 x=rnorm(n) y=rep(NA,n) y[1]=x[1] for (i in 2:n) { y[i]=a*y[i-1]+b*x[i] } Which is a damped random walk. related question (and possibly duplicate): Creating auto-correlated random values in R more similar types of random walks: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive-moving-average_model
