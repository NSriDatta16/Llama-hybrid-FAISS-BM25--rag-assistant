Update Syntax for Oracle 10g using ASP.NET

I have a GridView with an Update button. I want to update a field in the database but I think the '@' in the code below is causing the problem in my ASP .NET page. What can be done within the grid or in the update (UpdateCommand) statement? Note, I get an Ora 00936 error. " ConnectionString=" " SelectCommand="SELECT OBJECTID, TRACT, GIS_ACRES, COMMENTS, PDF_STORAGE FROM CampusDev.CU_POLY ORDER BY OBJECTID" UpdateCommand="UPDATE CampusDev.CU_POLY SET COMMENTS='just atest' WHERE OBJECTID=@OBJECTID"
