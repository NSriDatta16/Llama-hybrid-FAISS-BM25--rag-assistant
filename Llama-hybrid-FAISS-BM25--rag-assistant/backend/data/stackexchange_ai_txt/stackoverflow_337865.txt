In some versions of .NET you can actually put a catcher around the Application.Run() (you'll find this in program.cs) and this should catch all the Main Thread's exceptions however in most cases this maybe poor design and wont give you much of an opportunity to "resume". Additionally you will always have to manually handle any exceptions on background threads. You can design an app to "catch all" and display a common error message and debug info, this is fine as long as you exit afterwards. What is highly discouraged is making a "resume" available to the user as this will probably give you more problems in the long-run.
