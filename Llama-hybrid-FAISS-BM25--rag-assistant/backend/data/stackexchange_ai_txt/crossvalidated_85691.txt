It's nothing to do with Bayesian credible intervals vs frequentist confidence intervals. A 95% (say) confidence interval is defined as giving at least 95% coverage whatever the true value of the parameter $\pi$. So when the nominal coverage is 95%, the actual coverage may be 97% when $\pi=\pi_1$, 96.5% when $\pi=\pi_2$, but for no value of $\pi$ is it less than 95%. The issue (i.e. a discrepancy between nominal & actual coverage) arises with discrete distributions like the binomial. As an illustration, consider observing $x$ successes from $n$ binomial trials with unknown success probability $\pi$: $$ \begin{array}{c,c,c} x & \pi_\mathrm{U} & \Pr(X= x | \pi=0.7) & I(\pi_\mathrm{U}\leq 0.7)\\ 0 & 0.3930378 & 0.000729 & 0\\ 1 & 0.5818034 & 0.010206 & 0\\ 2 & 0.7286616 & 0.059535 & 1\\ 3 & 0.8468389 & 0.185220 & 1\\ 4 & 0.9371501 & 0.324135 & 1\\ 5 & 0.9914876 & 0.302526 & 1\\ 6 & 1.0000000 & 0.117649 & 1\\ \end{array} $$ The first column shows the possible observed values of $x$. The second shows the exact † $95\%$ upper ‡ confidence bound $\pi_\mathrm{U} =\pi: [\Pr(X>x | \pi)=0.95]$ that you would calculate in each case. Now suppose $\pi=0.7$: the third column shows the probability of each observed value of $x$ under this supposition; the fourth shows for which cases the calculated confidence interval covers the true parameter value, flagging them with a $1$. If you add up the probabilities for the cases in which the confidence interval does cover the true value you get the actual coverage, $0.989065$. For different true values of $\pi$, the actual coverage will be different: The nominal coverage is only achieved when the true parameter values coincide with the obtainable upper bounds. [I just re-read your question & noticed that the author says the actual may be less than the nominal coverage probability. So I reckon they're talking about an approximate method for calculating the confidence interval, though what I said above still goes. The graph might suggest reporting an average confidence level of about $98\%$ but—averaging over values of an unknown parameter?] † Exact in the sense that the actual coverage is never less than the nominal coverage for any value of $\pi$, & equal to it for some values of $\pi$— @Unwisdom's sense, not @Stephane's. ‡ Intervals with upper & lower bounds are more commonly used of course; but a little more complicated to explain, & there's only one exact interval to consider with just an upper bound.
