What's the reason for large beta coefficient standard error and estimate in binary logistic regression?

I'm using SPSS for binary logistic regression. The result showed that one of the variables has a large beta coefficient and standard error. Here are some results: Can some explain to me what is the reason for that? additional info: the variable that have large beta coefficient and standard error are actually part of the categorical of age (i.e. age were being divided into 4 categories (e.g. 20-25, 26-30 etc). So in this regression binary is being used for 3 of the categories and 1 become the reference.
