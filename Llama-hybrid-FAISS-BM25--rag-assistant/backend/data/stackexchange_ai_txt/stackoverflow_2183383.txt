SpTBXFormPopupMenu from the spTBXLib does the job. Go to http://www.silverpointdevelopment.com/sptbxlib/index.htm and look for "Form Popup" The key seems to be that the container 'popuped' must inherit TPopupMenu. But the handling is very complex, you can see it by yourself in the code. My recommendation is to use it as is from the package because Robert Lee has done a wonderful job.
