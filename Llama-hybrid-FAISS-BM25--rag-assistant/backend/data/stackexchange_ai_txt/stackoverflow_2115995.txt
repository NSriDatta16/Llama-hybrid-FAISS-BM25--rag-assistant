external CSS issue

Okay, time for my dumb question of the day. I have an external css file that basically assign a background image to a button. Css Code: input.keypad { cursor: pointer; display: block; min-width: 64px; width: 64px; height: 64px; margin: 0; border: 0; background: url(images/btn1.jpg) no-repeat center top; } Html code: My dilema is that the first time I load the page it works 100%, but when I refresh it, it seems to ignore the width and height set in the css file. The image is is in the background, but cut off because of this. I thought it might be some sort of caching so I included pragma tags which did not help at all. Any ideas?
