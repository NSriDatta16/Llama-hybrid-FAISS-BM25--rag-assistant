Well, I finally went past the error today. Hope the info below helps the rest of you. Not sure what I was doing wrong before but I simply made sure: I left it alone for a few days ;) The app is run with VisualStudio 2010 in ADMIN mode. The Azure project (the one with the blue globe) is set as startup object. Hence hit F5 to run the whole app. Your Compute Emulator and Storage Emulator are started (check the sys tray on the bottom right of your screen). I am quite sure I had all this covered when I got the error before but I can't always trust myself. Hope this helps. And thanks to Steve Marx for the nice demo code and pdc video . Has really helped me learn stuff.
