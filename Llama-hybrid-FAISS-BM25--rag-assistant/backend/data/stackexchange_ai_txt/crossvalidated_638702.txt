Can I use Breusch-Pagan test to a data that need correlation test later? or should I transform the data?

I did a homogeneity test using Levene test and the result said : "warning : in anova. lm(lm(resp~group)) ANOVA F-test on an essential perfect fit are unreliable" I want to test my data with the model (using Breusch-Pagan). I know the BP test is for regression, but I have no clue ( I'm a newbie). But I need to do a correlation test later. Can I use the BP test? Or should I transform my data? Cause I really need to know if my data is homogen/not... Data is the accession number of the plant. I use accession number as a factor and block (repetitive) as a factor. With nine variables like the plant's diameter, etc.
