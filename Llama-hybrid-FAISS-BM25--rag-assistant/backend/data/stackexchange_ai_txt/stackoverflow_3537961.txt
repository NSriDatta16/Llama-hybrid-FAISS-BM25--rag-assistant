You can set the following options to your MapView to define which mode to display. mapView.setSatellite(true); mapView.setStreetView(true); But there are no buttons by default as part of the MapView that you can display to the user. This you could implement with embedding the MapView and the buttons into a FrameLayout , so that the buttons are floating on top of the map.
