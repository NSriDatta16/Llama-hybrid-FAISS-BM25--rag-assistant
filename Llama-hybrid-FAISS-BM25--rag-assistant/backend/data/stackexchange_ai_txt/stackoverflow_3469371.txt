xslt: value of text associated with element

If I have an XML file that includes foo is a way of making pasta sauce bar is controlling the beer taps and I want to use XSLT to process this into an HTML file, with the name and value attributes and the text as a description, how can I get the XML node text? The above XSLT fragment does successfully get the name and value attributes, but it fails to get the text, and I think I'm missing something obvious but I don't know what.
