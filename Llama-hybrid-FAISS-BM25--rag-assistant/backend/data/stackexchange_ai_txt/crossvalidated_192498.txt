Just taking a stab at this, I think that you need to understand the answer to this question first Between subjects, what individual songs are related with the steepest arousal trajectories (in either direction) To answer this, I would split every time series up into the songs that were in each segment and label them. I would then find the beginning y and ending y of the signal for each song which would give some indicator of positive or negative change. Once you calculate this change for ever instance of the song. Then just sort them by the positive or negative change. This might not give you a perfect answer but it would probably point you in a good direction. For pairwise questions you would probably want to write some code that takes in the two song segments and compares them. You could then create a probability out of the pairwise comparisons. For example, when A and B are together 50% of the time there is an increase.
