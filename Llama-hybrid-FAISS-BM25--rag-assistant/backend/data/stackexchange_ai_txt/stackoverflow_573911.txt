I had some more thoughts on this: 1) Remember that maps represent a physical organization. Store the latitude/longitude of every intersection. You don't need to check much beyond the points that lie in the direction of your target. Only if you find yourself blocked do you need to go beyond this. If you store an overlay of superior connections you can limit it even more--you will normally never go across one of those in a way that goes away from your final destination. 2) Divide up the world into a whole bunch of zones defined by limited connectivity, define all connectivity points between the zones. Find what zones your source and target are in, for the start and end zone route from your location to each connection point, for the zones between simply map between connection points. (I suspect a lot of the latter is already pre-calculated.) Note that zones can be smaller than a metropolitan area. Any city with terrain features that divide it up (say, a river) would be multiple zones.
