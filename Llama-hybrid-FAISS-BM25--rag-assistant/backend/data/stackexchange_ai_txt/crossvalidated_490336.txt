If your data are a random sample from a population (as opposed to the population itself), then it seems a one-sample Wilcoxon test would show that the center of the population sampled differs from the center of your simulation (average value line). In particular actual settlements seem to prefer 0-200 m, whereas your simulation shows many locations around 400 m. Speculation: Maybe there is an advantage to being near sea level, and topography or soil around 400 m makes building difficult. Building at somewhat higher elevations may be considered worth the trouble because of spectacular views (or good soil for growing grapes or good landscape for sheep or dairy farms). If data include essentially the entire population of settlements, then a test would not be appropriate, and your graph would suffice to tell the story.
