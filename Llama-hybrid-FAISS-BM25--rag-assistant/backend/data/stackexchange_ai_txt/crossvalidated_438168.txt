Cropping input images Neural Networks

I'm creating a simple neural network for image classification,I had some doubts about the input images. Let's suppose i'm trying to classify (for example) a bear and i have an input image like this: or this: should i crop the envirorment in order to obtain an image which contains only the bear? Does this improve the performance of my learning process? Is it a good practice to do?
