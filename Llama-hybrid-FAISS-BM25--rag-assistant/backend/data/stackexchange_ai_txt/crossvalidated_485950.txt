autoencoders for radiographs - do watermarks affect the performance considerably

I have to implement an autoencoder to reconstruct the input radiographs and do unsupervised feature learning in the process. However, the radiographs that I have contain some watermarks like X-ray machine signatures, other letters like R (for right) and L (for left) etc. To what extent are these watermarks/texts going to affect the performance of the autoencoder in terms of its reconstruction error and its feature learning capabilities? Actually, there are hundreds of images available, and removing these watermarks is infeasible. Also, I tried removing the watermarks using image inpainting but it did not give satisfactory results. So I am wondering if the original images can be used as such for doing unsupervised feature learning using autoencoders. For reference, I am attaching one/two radiographs.
