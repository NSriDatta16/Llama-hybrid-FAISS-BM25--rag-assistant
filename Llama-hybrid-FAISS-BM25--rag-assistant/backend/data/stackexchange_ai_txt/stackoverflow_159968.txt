Well, this is a "normal" one-to-many relationship and the method you suggest is the classical one for solving it. Note that two tables are denormalized (I can't point out exactly where the superkey-is-not-well-should-be-subset-of-other-key-fsck-I-forgot part is, but I'm pretty sure it's there somewhere); the intuitive reason is that a tuple in the first one matches at most a tuple in the second one, so unless you have lots of animals with null sire and dame IDs, it's not a good solution in any prospect (it worsens performance -- need a join -- and does not reduce storage requirements).
