Why use logistic regression instead of a neural network?

I have an AI course in the which we studied and worked on logistic regression. After having read and studied a bit about neural networks I'm starting to ask myself why on earth would we use logistic regression instead of neural networks. Is it just an academic standard way of introducing the topic of loss-function minimization based ML techniques ?
