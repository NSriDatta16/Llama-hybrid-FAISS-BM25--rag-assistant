I am developing a recommendation engine for stack overflow (personal project). Check it on http://recommender.im . It is still a working in progress, but I have a quite functional website working. I am putting there most of the code I used through python notebooks. Basically I used: - Frontend: angularJS - Website backend: flask + scikit-learn - machine learning and data preparation: python, pandas, scikit-learn I really like python for data science as the community and libraries are really good.
