See sys.maxsize : http://docs.python.org/library/sys.html The largest positive integer supported by the platformâ€™s Py_ssize_t type, and thus the maximum size lists, strings, dicts, and many other containers can have. On my MacBook Pro with a 64-bit build of CPython, it's quite sensibly 2 63 -1 bytes: >>> import sys >>> sys.maxsize 9223372036854775807 >>> While on my 32-bit Linux box, it's 2^ 31 -1: >>> import sys >>> sys.maxsize 2147483647 >>> In practice, of course, you're unlikely to be able to actually make use of objects this large, but you can expect to run into serious practical problems (like, say, being out of memory or taking forever to load/save objects from storage) before you hit the theoretical limits.
