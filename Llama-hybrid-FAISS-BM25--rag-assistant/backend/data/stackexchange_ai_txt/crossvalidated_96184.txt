1) In general, standardizing the quantitative variables is not necessary, though there are situations where it may be useful. When conducting multiple regression, when should you center your predictor variables & when should you standardize them? estimates. 2) In regards to checking the linearity of your predictors, it doesn't make sense to me to check the linearity of each predictor prior to including them with other predictors in the full model. The reason is that it is possible for an apparent non-linear relationship in a univariate logistic regression to disappear after including other variables in the model, especially when the predictors are correlated. After including all desired terms in the model, you could use partial residual plots to check the functional form of each predictor. For other options or recommendations, you might want to check out Diagnostics for logistic regression? . In regards to whether or not to use a GAM, the decision should not be predicated on whether or not the relationships appear to be linear, but what you hope to get out of the model. A multivariate logistic regression would provide interpretable parameter estimates allowing you to provide an interesting summary regarding how the variables are related to flight delays. A GAM may be able to provide a better fit to the data (overfit?), but the potential gain in predictive accuracy is at the cost of interpretability of the model.
