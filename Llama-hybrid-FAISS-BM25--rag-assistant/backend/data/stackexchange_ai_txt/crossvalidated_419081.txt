Is there such thing as a 'Time Series Analysis', where it can be determined how statistically different two populations are over time?

I have two sets of data; male resident deer and male foreign deer. This data contains the daily average distance of each population to the nearest road, 100m on day 1, 450m on day 2, ..., day 365. What I want to perform is a statistical test, to determine if these two populations are statistically different over the year. I have been researching Time Series Analysis, and I am having troubles finding out whether this is possible. I want to know if the deer, resident vs. foreign (within a degree of certainty), behave similarly with respect to their distance to roads. Does this time series test exist? Is there any good papers I should read to learn more about this? Anything would help at this point. Thank you, H.
