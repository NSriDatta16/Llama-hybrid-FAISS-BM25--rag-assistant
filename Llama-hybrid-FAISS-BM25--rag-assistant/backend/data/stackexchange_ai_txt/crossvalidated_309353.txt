Why use two stage least squares for the instrumental variable estimator?

Following the rationale from Econometric Methods with Applications in Business and Economics by Heij et al., the instrumental variables estimator $b_{IV}$ for the linear regression model $y = X\beta + \varepsilon$ with instrumental variables $Z$ (with more variables than $\#\beta$) is given by $b_{IV} = (X'Z(Z'Z)^{-1}Z'X)^{-1}X'Z(Z'Z)^{-1}Z'y$. The book proposes calculating this $b_{IV}$ using two stage least squares: Regress each column of $X$ on $Z$, resulting in $\hat{X} = Z(Z'Z)^{-1}Z'X$ Regress $y$ on $\hat{X}$, with parameter estimates $b_{IV} = (\hat{X}'\hat{X})^{-1}\hat{X}'y$ Am I wrong by thinking that calculating $b_{IV} = (X'Z(Z'Z)^{-1}Z'X)^{-1}X'Z(Z'Z)^{-1}Z'y$ directly wil yield the same results as two stage least squares, since $b_{IV} = (X'Z(Z'Z)^{-1}Z'X)^{-1}X'Z(Z'Z)^{-1}Z'y = (\hat{X}'\hat{X})^{-1}\hat{X}'y$? And if it will yield the same results, why does the book give any attention to two stage least squares, and doesn't just leave it at something like "you can calculate the instrumental variables estimator using the equation $b_{IV} = (X'Z(Z'Z)^{-1}Z'X)^{-1}X'Z(Z'Z)^{-1}Z'y$." ?
