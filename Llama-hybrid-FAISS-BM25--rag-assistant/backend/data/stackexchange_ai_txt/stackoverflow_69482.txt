If you've never written a parser before, start with something simple. Parsers are surprisingly subtle, and you can get into all sorts of trouble writing them if you've never studied the structure of programming languages. Reading Aho, Sethi, and Ullman (it's known as "The Dragon Book") is a good plan. Contrary to other contributors, I say you should play with simpler parser generators like Yacc and Bison first, and only when you get burned because you can't do something with that tool should you go on to try to build something with an LL(*) parser like Antlr.
