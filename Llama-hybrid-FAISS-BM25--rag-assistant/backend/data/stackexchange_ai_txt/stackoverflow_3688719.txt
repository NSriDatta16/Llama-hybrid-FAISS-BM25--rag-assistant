Ok, this probably isn't optimal but it works pretty well. I ended up adding another attachment to my Sound class for the mp3, and added a before_validation filter to hook into it. In addition, since I had some existing wav attachments, I created a reconvert_to_mp3 method to handle the migrating of the existing records. has_attached_file :mp3, :storage => :s3, :s3_credentials => "#{RAILS_ROOT}/config/s3.yml", :path => "sounds/:id/:style.:extension" before_validation :convert_to_mp3 def reconvert_to_mp3 wavfile = Tempfile.new(".wav") wavfile.binmode open(wav.url) do |f| wavfile
