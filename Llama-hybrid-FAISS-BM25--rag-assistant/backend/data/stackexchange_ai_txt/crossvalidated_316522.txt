Making a measure of ranking accuracy

Say I wanted to make a measure of how well a formula ranks a set of contestants in a running race. The inputs to the formula would be factors factors such as height, bodyweight, diet etc. I had thought that the following would be reasonable. At the end of each race we take the absolute value of the difference between its rank (as the person finished in the race) and their predicted rank (as dictated by the formula). This would be summed for every person in the race. Finally this number would be divided by the number of people in the race - this last step is so that we can directly compare the ranking accuracy of large races to small ones. Call this number the "rank-accuracy". I then decided to double check the last step - the "divide by the number of entrants" part. To do this I simulated random race results and random predictions and measured the average rank accuracy for a variety of race sizes. The results are as follows: sz = 2 0.4992 sz = 3 0.8879 sz = 4 1.2500 sz = 5 1.6003 sz = 6 1.9424 sz = 7 2.2885 sz = 8 2.6230 sz = 9 2.9623 sz = 10 3.2983 sz = 11 3.6319 sz = 12 3.9764 As you can see my desire to make the rank-accuracy similar for all race sizes appears to have failed. It is clearly easier to get a low rank accuracy if the race size is small. So my question is - what measure of rank accuracy could I use to make large and small races more directly comparable?
