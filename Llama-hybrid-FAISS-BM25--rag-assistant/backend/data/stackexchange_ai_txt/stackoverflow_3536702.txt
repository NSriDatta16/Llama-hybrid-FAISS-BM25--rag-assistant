Hi I've managed to create drag&drop of a row in a UITableView onto another row of the same table. I created a uiImageView representing the moving item (which was not removed from the table) and attached it to the frontmost UIView to made it draggable on the whole screen. Here are some post about the pains I faced: UITableView: Drag a row onto another one UITableView: scrolling programmatically the content view UITableView: custom gestures make it scrolling no more Hope this can help ^^
