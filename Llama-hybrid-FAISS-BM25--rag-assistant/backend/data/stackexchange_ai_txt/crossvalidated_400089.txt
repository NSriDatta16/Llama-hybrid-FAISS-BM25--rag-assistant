AIC for latent variable models

I'm trying to use BIC/AIC for model comparison and want to know what the number of parameters is. The models I'm unsure about are linear Gaussian state space models with nonlinear observations. Specifically I have latent variables $\beta_t$ that evolve over time as a linear dynamical system: $p(\beta_t|\beta_{t-1}) \sim \mathcal{N}(A\cdot \beta,Q)$ where A is the dynamics matrix and Q is the covariance matrix of the innovation process. The latent variables are then parameters of a Poisson observation model with rate $z = \beta_t \cdot x_t$ where $x_t$ are covariates: $p(y_t|\beta_t;x_t) \sim \mathcal{Poiss}(z)$ . Im using an EM algorithm for inference (MCMC is not an option as datasets are too large), inferring $\beta$ in the E step and $A$ and $Q$ in the M-step. Basically I'm entirely unsure what number of model parameters to use. Is it $ dim(A)^2 + dim(Q)^2$ , do I factor in the latent variables? Any advice or places to read about this would be greatly appreciated! :)
