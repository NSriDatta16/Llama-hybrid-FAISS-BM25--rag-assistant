XAML ToolTip + IsHitTestVisible="False"

We need to have mouse clicks and drags "ignored" by our View1 but the ToolTip must still function in that view. The reason is View1 is above View2 in Z-Order, so View1 can tint View2 a red color and show a warning via ToolTip; however the ToolTip accompanying View1 will not work if IsHitTestVisible="False". Anyone know a work around so the ToolTip will display on mouse move/over and the rest of mouse events are ignored by View1 and go to View2? Thanks, Sean
