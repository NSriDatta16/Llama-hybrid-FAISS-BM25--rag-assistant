how works applications which blocks web sites?

I know only one low-level way of blocking websites - hosts file. However, it is obvious that main stream programs has some other way of achieving this. I have an idea for new model of this kind of program, but without possibility of blocking sites it is useless :( Blocking is one problem, another is filtering and replacing content in the webbrowser. Any clues? Edit: I discovered, that many filtering programs uses open Source library WinPcap. It seems be great for checking which sites user try to open. But of course I need to have some possibility of blocking sites, by for example replacing requested sites for sites with information about blocking. Is this possible to achieve with WinPcap?
