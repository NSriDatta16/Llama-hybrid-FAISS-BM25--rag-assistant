How to programmatically import a CRM Organization?

Is there any way via powershell or some api that I can't seem to find in the CRM 4.0 SDK, that would allow us to automate the refresh from our production CRM 4.0 environment to a Staging CRM server? Obviously the db backup / restore we can script but I cannot find a way to kick off a CRM Import Organization without using the MMC snap-in.
