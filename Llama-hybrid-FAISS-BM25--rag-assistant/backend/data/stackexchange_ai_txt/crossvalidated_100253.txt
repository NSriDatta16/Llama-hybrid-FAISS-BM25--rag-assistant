If many of your features are redundant I would propose performing PCA. This will eliminate the redundancies while retaining the variance in the data. You can find numerous example/explanations of this with a google search. Also, consider reading this post ( Basic question on PCA: can it be used to divide original features into groups? ) Here is an excellent text that covers the area of feature selection (and many others): http://www.stanford.edu/~hastie/local.ftp/Springer/OLD/ESLII_print4.pdf A quick google search also shows numerous papers, for example http://www.ijitee.org/attachments/File/v2i2/B0352012213.pdf
