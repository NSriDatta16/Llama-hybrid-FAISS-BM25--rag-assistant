Detect time pattern in sequence of events

I have a time series with a timestamp and an associated event: Time Event 1 A 2 B 3 C T A I was wondering if there is a technique/method to figure out which events most often precede others in a given time window. I.e. 10 seconds before A happens B and C occur with 90% chance. Ideally the output should be the sequences that occur most often. So far I have thought of using some sort of clustering, though a cluster would not suffice as I need to get the time direction right. Does anyone have an idea? Thanks
