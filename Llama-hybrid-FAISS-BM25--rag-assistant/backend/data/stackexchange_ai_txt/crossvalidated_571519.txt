Learning the samples can be predicted most accurately

The goal of making machine learning algorithms is mostly to try to make accurate predictions for all unseen samples. What if the goal is to determine a subset of the unseen samples so that the prediction will be most accurate for this subset and ignore the rest that is hard to make accurate predictions. Is there a field of study for this type of problem?
