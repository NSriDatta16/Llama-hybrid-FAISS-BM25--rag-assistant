Macro and micro average for imbalanced binary classes

Micro and macro averaging are metrics for multi-class classification. However, for binary classification when data are imbalanced, it seems that micro and macro precision have different results. My question is that: does it make sense to use micro and macro precision in binary classification problems when classes are imbalanced?
