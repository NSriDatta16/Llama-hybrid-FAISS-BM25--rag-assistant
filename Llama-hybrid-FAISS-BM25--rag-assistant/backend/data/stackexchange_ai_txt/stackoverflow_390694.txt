If the resource is the service, independent of parameters, it should be http://myservice.example.com/service?x=val&y=val&z=val This is a GET query. One of the principles behind REST is that you GET to read (but not modify!) the resource; you can POST to modify a resource & get a response; you can PUT to write to a resource; and you can DELETE to remove a resource. If the resource specific with those parameters is a persistent resource, it needs a name. You could (if you organized your webservice this way) POST to http://myservice.example.com/service?x=val&y=val&z=val to create a particular instance of the service and have it return an ID to name this instance, e.g. http://myservice.example.com/service/12312549 then use GET/POST/PUT/DELETE to interact with that instance.
