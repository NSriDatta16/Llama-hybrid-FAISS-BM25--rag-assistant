Predict a Time Series With a Multi-Level Categorical Independent Variable

I need to perform and evaluate predictions on a time series with some 3,000 categories as independent variable. Specifically, I have 3 fields: "Value", which is my independent variable (the one that I'd like to predict) "category": it has some 3,000 different levels, in the form of Integers:example, in the snapshot here below, 2237 and 1497 are two levels of the 3,000 levels of the "category" variable. "Date": self explained (see below) For each date, I have around 3,000 records, one for every level of the "category" variable. It's actually my only independent variable to explain the time series (if I don't use the "Date" field). Which method should I use? Date Value category 2017-10-01 9748.0 485 2017-10-01 0.0 1242 2017-10-01 1706.0 14 2017-10-01 50.0 1001 2017-10-01 0.0 2235 2017-10-01 0.0 1497 A first thought would have been to fit an ARIMA model for each category... but I am wondering if there is a more synthetic approach. Thanks in Advance for your precious advices!
