Sorry, but there's no such thing as a "best practice" for eliminating headers in C++: it's a bad idea, period. If you hate them that much, you have three choices: Become intimately familiar with C++ internals and any compilers you're using; you're going to run into different problems than the average C++ developer, and you'll probably need to solve them without a lot of help. Pick a language you can use "right" without getting depressed Get a tool to generate them for you; you'll still have headers, but you save some typing effort
