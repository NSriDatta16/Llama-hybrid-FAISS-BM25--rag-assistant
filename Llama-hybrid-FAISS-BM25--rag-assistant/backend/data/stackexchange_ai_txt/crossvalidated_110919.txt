Including covariates increases spatial patterning rather than reducing it

I am fitting a series of Bayesian spatial models with an intrinsic conditional autoregressive (iCAR) structure. In these models, I begin by fitting an empty model (null) and then add successive sets of covariates based on a conceptual foundation. I then map quantiles of the mean posterior spatial random effects, highlighting those with 95% credible intervals that do not contain zero. Results show that including additional covariates increases the number of areal units with 95% credible intervals that do not contain zero. I have not seen this before in spatial models â€“ rather I typically see the number of areal units with significant exceedance probabilities decrease when controlling for more variables. I am having difficulty explaining why controlling for more variables causes the spatial pattern to become more pronouced and am wondering if others have come across this in their own work.
