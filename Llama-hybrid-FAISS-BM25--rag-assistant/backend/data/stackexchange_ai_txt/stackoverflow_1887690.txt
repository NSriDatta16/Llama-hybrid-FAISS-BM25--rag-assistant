Simplifying small code example

Lets pretend I have the following code. num1 = 33 num2 = 45 num3 = 76 lst = ['one', 'two', 'three'] for item in lst: if item == 'one': print num1 elif item == 'two': print num2 elif item == 'three': print num3 Is there a way to make this more elegant when there is no correlation between the list and the print sentence? Meaning, is there a way to get rid of the ifs and elifs?
