IE6 Doesn't like my CSS :(

Web site: srstage.d19.us (sorry would only allow one link) How it looks in IE6: http://img94.imageshack.us/img94/4489/6c1bafd63a9d33b1231bd3d.png The 4 bugs are marked. no dotted border (on navigation and date badge) (from memory that isn't supported by IE6) sidebar mostly gone comment-meta is blank date badge is moved (positioning bug?) I hate IE6, however some organisations stupidly use it... :(
