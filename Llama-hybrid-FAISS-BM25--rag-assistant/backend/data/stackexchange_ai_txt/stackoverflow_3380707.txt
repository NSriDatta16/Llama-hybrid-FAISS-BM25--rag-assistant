You can stick your form in paragraphs, tables, lists, definition lists, or a complicated series of spans and divs, but in the end the only things that matter are whether your form works correctly and people can use it. Spend your time on tabindex and usability rather than worrying about the "semantically correct way to write HTML" as defined by a W3C working group or someone's blog.
