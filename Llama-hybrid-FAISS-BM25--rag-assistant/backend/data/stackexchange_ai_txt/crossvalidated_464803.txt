Variable importance logistic and random forest

I have created variable importance plots using varImp in R for both a logistic and random forest model. I want to compare how the logistic and random forest differ in the variables they find important. Of course, they do this in a different way: logistic takes the absolute value of the t-statistic and the random forest the mean decrease in Gini. Now, when I plot the variable importance plots for the logistic and the random forest, I find that the logistic and the random forest model handle factorial variables in a different way, whilst the random forest model takes the total group, the logistic regression takes one of the possible factor outcomes. For example, I have a group US states with 50 factors, the logistic regression would take New York as an important factor, whilst the random forest model takes the group US states as the important factor. How can I solve this for the logistic regression? Could I just add all the values for the variable importance to get the total group importance?
