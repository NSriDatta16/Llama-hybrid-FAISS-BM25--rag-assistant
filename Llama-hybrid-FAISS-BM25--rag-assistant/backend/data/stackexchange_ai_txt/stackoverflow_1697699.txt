As Heinzi said, the following need attention: \ { } $ ^ _ % ~ # & Most can be escaped with a backslash, but \ becomes \textbackslash and ~ becomes \textasciitilde . I think you might want to leave line breaks alone. LaTeX handles these in exactly the same way as many content management systems; many people have come to expect that "double line break" = "paragraph break". Heck, even stackoverflow itself works that way. (You cannot write malicious LaTeX code; everything that happens inside LaTeX stays inside LaTeX. Unless you explicitly enable write18 when running latex , but it's disabled by default.)
