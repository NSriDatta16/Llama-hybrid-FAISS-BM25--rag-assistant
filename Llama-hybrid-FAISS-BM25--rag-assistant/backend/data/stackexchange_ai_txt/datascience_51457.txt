How to find combined feature contributions in a random forest algorithm

I am currently working on a pancreatic cancer dataset which has numerous features including smoking, family history, age, etc. I have used the feature_importances_ method in sklearn to find and plot the individual feature importances, but wanted to know how to find the importance of combined variables (e.g. are those who smoke and have a family history of pancreatic cancer much more likely than others?). I know it is not as simple as adding the individual feature contributions for the combined features, and wanted to know if there is a specific method/function that can be used to do that. I have also used treeinterpreter to find the feature contributions.
