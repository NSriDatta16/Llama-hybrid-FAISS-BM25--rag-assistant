Learning probability and statistics together

I posted a question earlier where I mentioned that I am interested in learning Machine Learning but that my background in statistics and probability is pretty weak. Recently I previewed pages of 2 books which seem to quite suit my requirements. I was just wanting to know what the community thinks about my possible choices, given my background and goals. (1) All of Statistics: A Concise Course in Statistical Inference by Larry Wasserman. Looks nice to me but the author does not provide the answers to exercise problems (let alone a solution manual). (2) A seemingly less well known but again a concise book: Probability and Statistics for Computer Scientists by Michael Baron Any thoughts on these books or any good alternatives? Just to emphasize, I am a CS student looking to get to speed with probability and statistics for Machine Learning. I am at this point only looking for books suggestions not websites or videos.
