Sharepoint 'People and groups' - Active Directory Groups Synchronization

Our environment is as follows - -Windows Active Directory 2003 -Windows Server 2003 R2 Standard -MOSS 2007 Our problem is simple - I cannot seem to figure out how to import AD groups into the profiles DB. The user profiles have a timer job setup to do full and incremental imports and they are both working fine. We have ~15 active directory groups currently listed under "People and Groups" in SharePoint and as far as I recall nothing special was done to import these. It was brought to my attention recently that one of the groups email addresses changed and had not updated in MOSS. I am unable to figure out what controls the group synchronization/import. Any advice would be appreciated, whether I'm missing something obvious or if its some obscure STSADM command I've overlooked. Thanks SO.
