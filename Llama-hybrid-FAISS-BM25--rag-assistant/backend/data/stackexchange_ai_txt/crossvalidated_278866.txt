Derive logistic loss gradient in matrix form

User Antoni Parellada had a long derivation here on logistic loss gradient in scalar form. Using the matrix notation, the derivation will be much concise. Can I have a matrix form derivation on logistic loss? Where how to show the gradient of the logistic loss is $$ A^\top\left( \text{sigmoid}~(Ax)-b\right) $$ For comparison, for linear regression $\text{minimize}~\|Ax-b\|^2$, the gradient is $2A^\top\left(Ax-b\right)$, I have a derivation here .
