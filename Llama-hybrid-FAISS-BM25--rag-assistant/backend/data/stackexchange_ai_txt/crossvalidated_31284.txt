What is the role of MDS in modern statistics?

I recently came across multidimensional scaling. I am trying to understand this tool better and its role in modern statistics. So here are a few guiding questions: Which questions does it answer? Which researchers are often interested in using it? Are there other statistical techniques which perform similar functions? What theory is developed around it? How does "MDS" relate to "SSA"? I apologize in advance for asking such a mixed/unorganized question, but so is the nature of my current stage in this field.
