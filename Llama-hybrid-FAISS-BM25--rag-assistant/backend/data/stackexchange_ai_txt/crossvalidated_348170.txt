I think you could try both to do some feature engineering and to use other classifiers. Also a good tuning of the parameters may help, but based on my experience this has a lower impact than a good features selection and the choice of the classifier. Scikit-learn.org offers wide spectrum of classifiers. Also, always do cross-validation.
