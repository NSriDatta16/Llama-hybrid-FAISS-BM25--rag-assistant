There's a LaTeX package called tokenizer which may help you to do what you want. Here's a hack (but pure LaTeX, no internals) which gets close to what I think you want, but with some extraneous spaces I haven't quite been able to fix. Perhaps Will Robertson can advise further? Unlike his slightly more polished answer, I haven't parameterised the bits and pieces, Here goes: \usepackage{forloop} \usepackage[trim]{tokenizer} ... \newcounter{rrCount} \newcommand{\replace}[1]{% \GetTokens{rrFirst}{rrRest}{#1,}% \textbf{\rrFirst}% \forloop{rrCount}{0}{\value{rrCount}
