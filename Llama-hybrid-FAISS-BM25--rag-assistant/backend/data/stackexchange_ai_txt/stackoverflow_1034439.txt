Your variations don't look that large. It's simply the nature of the beast that there are other things running outside of your direct control, both in the OS and the JVM, and you're not likely to get exact results. Things that could affect runtime: if your test runs are creating objects (may be invisible to you, within library calls, etc) then your repeats may trigger a GC Different GC algorithms, specifications will react differently, different thresholds for incremental gc. You could try to run a System.gc() before every run, although the JVM is not guaranteed to GC when you call that (although it always has when I've played with it).T Depending on the size of your test, and how many iterations you're running, this may be an unpleasantly (and nearly uselessly) slow thing to wait for. Are you doing any sort of randomization within your tests? e.g. if you're testing integers, values Ultimately I don't think it's possible to get an exact figure, probably the best you can do is an average figure around the cluster of results.
