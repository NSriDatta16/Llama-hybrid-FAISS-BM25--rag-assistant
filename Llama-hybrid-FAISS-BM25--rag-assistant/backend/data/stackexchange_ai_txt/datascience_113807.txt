What method/algorithm to use to extract information from project documents about objectives, activities, and other variables?

I'm more-or-less new to NLP so assume little existing knowledge! But I have strong coding skills in R and to a lesser extent Python. We're interested in extracting key information about objectives, activities, and risks from the project documents of a few thousand education projects carried out by the World Bank. The documents are fairly structured with headings and then tables for all of the variables which we're interested in, but they go back to the 1990s and the actual format and appearance of the documents has changed a lot over time. We need the output for each variable to be fairly general (so objectives would only have a few possible categories, like "access", "learning", and so on). Roughly what methods should we be using? Our original plan was to handlabel a subset of them, and use a supervised learning approach (perhaps text classification?) to automatically label the rest. But upon reading more this doesn't seem too well-suited. Thanks in advance!
