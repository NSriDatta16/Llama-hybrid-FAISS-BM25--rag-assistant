Aggregate two proportions from subpopulations to estimate population proportion

Assume there is a population of 2000 individuals, of which 1200 are male and 800 are female. Assume samples have been drawn from the male and female subpopulations separately to compute a proportion of a characterisic of interest, yielding the following: Population Population size Sample size sample proportion Male 1200 200 0.2 Female 800 200 0.6 Where the standard error/confidence intervals for the estimated proportions for each subpopulation can be estimated in the standard way. I believe I can generate a point estimate for the proportion of the characteristic of interest in the whole population from this data by calculating: $$ 1200/2000 * 0.2 + 800/2000 * 0.6 = 0.36 $$ i.e., the weighted average of the sub-population proportion estimates by the subpopulation prevalence in the whole population. How can I calculate a confidence interval for the global proportion? My intuition would be to calculate the standard error for the two subpopulations and basically weight it in the same way, and then use it to calculate the confidence interval for the global proportion. Is this approach correct?
