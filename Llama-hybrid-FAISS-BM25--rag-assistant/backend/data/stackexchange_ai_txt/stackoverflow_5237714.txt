I just encountered this problem a little while ago (with a slightly different scenario): I am using the jQuery dialog as a multi-purpose dialog with buttons that toggle the content displayed between 2 different views (info & a related form). In a helper method, I toggle the initial visibility between both elements: $("#element1").attr("style","display: block;"); $("#element2").attr("style","display: block;"); $("#element1").attr("style","display: none;"); $("#element2").attr("style","display: none;"); Then, within the conditional block I set the height of the modal to that of element to be displayed + 50px (to account for the custom set of buttons I have created), like so: var elementHeight = $("#element1").height(); $("#dialog1").dialog("option", "height", elementHeight + 50); Once I resize the dialog's div element, I set the final state for the dialog's content: $("#element1").attr("style","display: block;"); $("#element2").attr("style","display: none;"); I know this is a bit of a hack. There are probably more "elegant" ways to resolve this issue, but I didn't want to burn any more time on it (I just spent about 3 hours wrestling with this issue, trying different tweaks to the core jQuery code). If anyone comes up with a better way to resolve this, I am all ears (err, eyes?), but until then this is working for me.
