Combining monte carlo with deep learning to improve the estimation

I am in situation where i need to estimate the attenuation of an EM wave . we consider EM wave as collection of photons. These photons when strike with some dust particles they scatter in different direction and for a random path before colliding with next particle. We can estimate the attenuation using monte carlo simulations. I want to ask can applying the deep learning here can improve the estimation of attenuation ?
