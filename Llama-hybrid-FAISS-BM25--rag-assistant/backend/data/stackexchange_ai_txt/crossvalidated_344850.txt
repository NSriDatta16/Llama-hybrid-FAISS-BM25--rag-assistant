How to determine number of components to retain in manifold learning?

With PCA, one can use the explained variance ratio and keep the number of components that explain 95% of the dataset. How does one do the same for manifold learning methods for dimensionality reduction? For example, isomap or MDS etc. in python sci-kit learn. Thanks
