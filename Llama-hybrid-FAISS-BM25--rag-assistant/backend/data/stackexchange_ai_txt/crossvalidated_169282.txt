what is "Minimum Length Least Square"

I am in the process of implementing Bayesian Lasso with Normal-Gamma prior ; In section 3.3 mention The prior for the scale parameter $\gamma$ conditional on $\lambda$ is given by $v_\beta = 2 \lambda \gamma^2 \sim IG(2, M)$ where $IG$ denotes the inverted gamma distribution, the inverse of a gamma distribution, so that $IG(2, M)$ has expectation $M$; When $p > n-1 $; $M=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{p} \beta_i^2$ where $\beta_i$ is the Minimum Length Least Squares (MLLS) estimate. I am not sure, if "Minimum Length Least Squares" is same as "Least Square Solution"
