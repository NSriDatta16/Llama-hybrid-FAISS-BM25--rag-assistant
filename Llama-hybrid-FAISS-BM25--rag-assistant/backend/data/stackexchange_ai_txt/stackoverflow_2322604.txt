Team Build: The path 'Path' is already mapped in workspace 'workspace' error even after deleting all workspaces on build agent

I have this problem when I queue a build. The build dies with the error The path C:\[Path]\Sources is already mapped in workspace [Server Name]. the same as this question . but I've removed all the workspaces on the build agent by running this command: tf workspaces /remove:* and also by deleting the TFS cache folder. I've also restarted the server, but the error keeps happening on each build.
