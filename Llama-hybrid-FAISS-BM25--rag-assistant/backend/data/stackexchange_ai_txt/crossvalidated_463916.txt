To make the problem easier to read, I am going to use slightly different notation to you. I will confine attention to the case where the set of interest $\mathscr{X}$ is a finite set. Without loss of generality, take $\mathscr{X} \equiv \{ 1,...,m \}$ and let the values of interest have a categorical distribution : $$X_1,...,X_n \sim \text{IID Cat}(\mathbf{p}) \quad \quad \quad \mathbf{p} \equiv (p_1,...,p_m).$$ To facilitate the analysis, let $W_J \equiv | \{ i=1,...,n| X_i=X_J \} |$ denote the number of sample values that are equal to the $J$ th sample value. This can be written in alternative form as: $$W_J = \sum_{i=1}^n \mathbb{I}(X_i = X_J) = 1 + \sum_{i \neq J} \mathbb{I}(X_i = X_J).$$ If we condition on $X_J=x$ then we have: $$\begin{aligned} W_J = 1 + \sum_{i \neq J} \mathbb{I}(X_i = x) \sim 1 + \text{Bin}(n-1, p_x). \\[6pt] \end{aligned}$$ Since $J \sim \text{U}(1,...,n)$ you have $\mathbb{P}(X_J = x) = p_x$ , and so application of the law of total probability gives: $$\begin{aligned} \mathbb{P}(W_J = w) &= \sum_{x=1}^m \mathbb{P}(W_J = w | X_J=x) \cdot \mathbb{P}(X_J=x) \\[6pt] &= \sum_{x=1}^m \text{Bin}( w-1 | n-1, p_x ) \cdot \ p_x \\[6pt] &= {n-1 \choose w-1} \sum_{x=1}^m p_x^{w} (1-p_x)^{n-w}. \\[6pt] \end{aligned}$$ As you can see, the random variable $W_J-1$ has a binomial-mixture distribution, and so $W_J$ has a closely related distribution. We can confirm that the mass function we have derived is valid by checking that it sums to one. Using the binomial theorem we have: $$\begin{aligned} \sum_{w=1}^n \mathbb{P}(W_J = w) &= \sum_{w=1}^n {n-1 \choose w-1} \sum_{x=1}^m p_x^{w} (1-p_x)^{n-w} \\[6pt] &= \sum_{x=1}^m p_x (1-p_x)^{n-1} \sum_{w=1}^n {n-1 \choose w-1} \Big( \frac{p_x}{1-p_x} \Big)^{w-1} \\[6pt] &= \sum_{x=1}^m p_x (1-p_x)^{n-1} \Big( 1 + \frac{p_x}{1-p_x} \Big)^{n-1} \\[6pt] &= \sum_{x=1}^m p_x (1-p_x)^{n-1} \Big( \frac{1}{1-p_x} \Big)^{n-1} \\[6pt] &= \sum_{x=1}^m p_x =1. \\[6pt] \end{aligned}$$ This confirms the validity of the density. In the uniform case where $\mathbf{p} = (\tfrac{1}{m},...,\tfrac{1}{m})$ you have: $$\mathbb{P}(W_J = w) = {n-1 \choose w-1} \frac{(m-1)^{n-w}}{m^{n-1}}.$$ This gives you the distribution for $W_J$ and so the corresponding distribution for $Y_J = W_J/n$ is a simple scaled variation of this. I do not recognise this distribution by name, but it should not be too difficult to derive its properties. As stated, $W_J-1$ has a binomial-mixture distribution; mixtures of binomial distributions are examined in Blischke (1964) and various other papers.
