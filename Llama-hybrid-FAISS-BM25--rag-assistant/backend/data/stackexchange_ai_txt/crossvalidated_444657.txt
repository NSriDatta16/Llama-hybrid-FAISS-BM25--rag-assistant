The parameter in the population logistic regression line and its statistical inference

Under the assumption of the distribution of error and also the form that X takes to affect Y, we get this probability function: P = exp(β'x)/ (1 + exp(β'x)) Therefore, does it mean that we are looking for such a set of betas that will make the error to satisfy our logistic distribution form of error? Since we use the maximum likelihood method to fit the model, does the maximum likelihood also serve the need for statistical inference of the parameters? If not, what should be? Please feel free to rectify me, thanks in advance!
