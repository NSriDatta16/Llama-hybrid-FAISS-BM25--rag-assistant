Dealing with interaction effects between fractional variables ... Does it matter that they're fractional?

I have a number of variables, $X_1, X_2, ...$ which vary between 0 and 1. These are measures representing metrics in a large organization -- e.g: LeadershipScore on a scale of 0 to 1, ResponsibilityScore on a scale of 0 to 1 etc. The DV is whether an employee got a promotion in the last 5 years, a binary response variable. I am building two types of models: Random Forest Model: Goal is prediction Logistic Regression: Goal is explanation Maybe I am overthinking this but does it matter that the variables are fractional? When I compute interactions -- like ResponsibilityScore * LeadershipScore I get very small numbers.
