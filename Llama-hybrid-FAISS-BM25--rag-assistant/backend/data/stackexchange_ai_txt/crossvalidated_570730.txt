You did not say, what your actual final goal is. But in any case, what a VAE will learn in this setting, contrary to when a proper bottleneck is used, will simply be (a noisy version of) the identity. And the (noisy) values $z\in\mathbb{R}^m$ might also not be of much help, since it can actually be anything since there is no restriction. Think of any arbitrary mapping from $x\in\mathbb{R}^n$ to (a distribution in) $\mathbb{R}^m$ and this mapping could, in principle, be obtained by this VAE. So I don't see that the latent values would give useful representations of your data. However, adding some constraints might be worthwhile. E.g. people have, IIRC, tried to get better models via "anti-bottlenecks" by penalizing denseness of the $z$ -vectors (or, favoring sparsity). Or you could try to severely restrict the architecture of your network.
