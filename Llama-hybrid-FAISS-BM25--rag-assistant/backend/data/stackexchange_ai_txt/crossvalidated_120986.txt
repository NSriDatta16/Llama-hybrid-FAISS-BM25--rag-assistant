Distribution of large set of fold changes

My background in stats is limited to a few undergraduate classes. However, I have a question that intuitionally seems to have a statistical answer. Let me describe my intuition first. I do systems biochemistry, where I look at all the compounds in a biochemical environment; as far as I know, they typically number somewhere between 3000 and 60,000. In the particular experiment I'm doing now, I'm looking at the same environment over a time lapse. This produces pairs of concentration data for each compound, which I'd like to describe with fold changes such that fold change=[final]/[initial]. I've then transformed the data with a log10() operation. My thought was that if the compounds are mostly independent, I should end up with some sort of symmetrical distribution resembling a t-distribution or a normal distribution. I tested this by creating a histogram of my data with a normal curve superimposed (x-axis should be labeled log( foldChange ) ): It might not look like a close fit due to the binning scheme, but it is. Here is a Q-Q normal plot. Is there any way I can compare this distribution to a theoretical distribution and somehow quantify how much it differs from the distribution that would be created if the fold changes truly were random? I can imagine doing some sort of bootstrapping looking at the distribution of random pairs of points between 0 and 1. For example, if we imagine that the average concentration of my features is 1000, a Poisson distribution with lambda=1000 is a good model for my data. The distribution of log-fold changes between random points in this distribution produces about what I'd expect to see. Here is the R code that describes what I mean: #bootstrapping log(fold change) distribution based on a Poisson distribution testDistra It looks like this in case you don't feel like running the code yourself: The problem is that I don't really know how to compare that to my actual distribution in a quantitative way. Is there some sort of p-value that can be generated? (I know all of us idiot biologists ask that question, but is there? haha.) Any ideas on this would be appreciated.
