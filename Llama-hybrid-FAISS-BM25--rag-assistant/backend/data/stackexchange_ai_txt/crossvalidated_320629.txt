Can I use co-dependent features in a Random Forest?

Let's say my features for a random forest are: x,y,z,x/y,x/z,y/z . These are obviously co-dependent. Now, when training a Random Forest (using sklearn for example), the minimization of the entropy assumes that the features are independent - as this makes the entropy derivation much simpler. Still, these models seems to work - am I missing something?
