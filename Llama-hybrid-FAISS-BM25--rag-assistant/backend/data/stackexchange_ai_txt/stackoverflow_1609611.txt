Animations in jquery are performed asynchronously, therefore, they can take advantage of other functions that manipulate the animation timeline, i.e easing functions. Having said that, AFAIK this version of the parallax plugin does not leverage jquery animations (e.g. .animate() , .fadeTo() et. al), Instead it rolls it's own animation functions. That's why you cannot use the easing plugin like you have in your code. You can play around with the values for $.fn.jparallax.settings.frameDuration (defaults to 25) and see if that makes the animation any smoother...
