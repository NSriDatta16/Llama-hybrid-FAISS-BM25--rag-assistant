Essentially, principal components analysis breaks down the data into chunks which represent the variance of your matrix. Factor analysis does the same, BUT it only examines the variance which is common to multiple items. Basically, EFA is a tool for determining latent structure, while PCA is a tool for reducing the number of items. Both are useful, but FA tends to be more useful (for me, at least).
