How do I use the GPML package for multi dimensional input?

I have downloaded the Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning (GPML) package (gpml-matlab-v3.1-2010-09-27.zip) from the website, and I can run the regression example ( demoRegression ) in Octave . It works just fine. Now I have my own data for regression where the x (input) matrix is a 54x10 matrix (54 samples, 10 input vars), and the y (target) vector is 54x1. The problem is that I do not understand hov to calculate the meanfunc and the covfunc, the code provided for the regression example does not work for multiple input datasets. I do not understand enough Octave to decode the specific code used to calculate this. Are there anybody who has tried this, and maybe can show an example?
