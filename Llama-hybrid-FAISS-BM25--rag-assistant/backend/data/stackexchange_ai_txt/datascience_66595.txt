Synthetic time series generation according to some distribution

I'm trying to develop a change detection model that uses sliding windows. Given a time series with some features I've a sliding widows that analyses that time period and compares with a successive time window. If the distribution of data has changed than it is notified. Anyway, I don't have enough real data about my problem, so I need to generate some artificial time series but with different distributions, no matter what distributions, the important thing is that they are different, so that I can test when my model detects change in the data. How can I generate those data?
