Based on what I can gather from your question, you have a class with two Lists. Your requirements say that inside your class, you need to initialize the Lists to empty lists. Below is the example (the only difference is that I never initialize the Lists when they declared, but in the class constructor instead): public class YourClass { List organize; List anotherOrganize; // constructor public YourClass() { // initialize the two lists to empty lists organize = new List (); anotherOrganize = new List (); } }
