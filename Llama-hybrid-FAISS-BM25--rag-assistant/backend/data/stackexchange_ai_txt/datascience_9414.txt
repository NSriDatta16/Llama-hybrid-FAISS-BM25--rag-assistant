Okay, so from what I understand, you have a regression problem taking into account a variety of physical features. The reason I say that this is a regression problem, verses a classification problem is because the scale you are trying to predict is an ordinal scale. There are a couple approaches to this. If your features are discriminative and linear enough, a simple least squares linear regression might work. If you believe the problem you have is to complicated for linear regressions, a simple vanilla neural network with one single output. I would recommend using the scikit-learn library in python for all models that are not neural networks. Here is a link to the generalized linear regression page. That link has code samples and mathematical explanations. If you decide to use neural networks, and you don't have a great amount of samples or a need to use the GPU, the pyBrain library is great. I wouldn't recommend using a logistic regression (since you mentioned it in your question), simply because a logistic regression is a classification problem, and I believe you would be better off approaching this from a regression standpoint.
