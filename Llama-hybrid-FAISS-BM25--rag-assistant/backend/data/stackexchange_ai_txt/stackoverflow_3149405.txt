Differentiate Drag and Touch in cocos 2d iphone

Hii I have an issue in drag and touch an image. I have 3 images. Let it be left, right and middle. Initially middle image is shown in screen1. If i touch that image, it should open in a new screen(2). If i drag right side, it have to show right image in that screen itself. otherwise If i drag left side, it have to show left image in that screen. After that if i touched the left/right image it has to open that image in separate screen
