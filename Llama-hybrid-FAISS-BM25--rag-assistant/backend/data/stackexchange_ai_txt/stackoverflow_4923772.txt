UPDATE: The feature described here was added to C# 7. The feature you want is called "ref locals" and it is not supported in C#. The CLR does support generating code that contains ref locals, and a few years ago I wrote an experimental version of C# that had the feature you want, just to see if it would work. You could do something like: Person a = whatever; ref Person b = ref a; and then as you say, changes to "b" would change the contents of "a". The two variables become aliases for the same storage location. Though it was a nice little feature and worked well, we decided to not take it for C#. It's possible that it could still happen in a hypothetical future version of the language, but I would not get all excited about it in expectation; it will probably not happen. (Remember, all of Eric's musings about hypothetical future versions of any Microsoft product are For Entertainment Purposes Only.)
