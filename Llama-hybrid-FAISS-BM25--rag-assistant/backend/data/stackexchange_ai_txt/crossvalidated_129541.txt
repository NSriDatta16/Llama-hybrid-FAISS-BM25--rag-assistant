Building Bayesian Models with insignificant independent variables

My main goal is to use four independent variables (y~x1,x2,x3,x4) and develop a Bayes Linear Regression model. However when I ran a simple linear regression model using these same four independent variables I found out that none of these independent variables are significant. Does this matter at all that these independent variables were insignificant in predicting y to begin with, when I build a Bayes Linear model?
