Trying to use an XSLT for an XML in ASP.NET

i have the following xslt sheet: matches found And this is the xml that im trying to mix with the previous xslt: 15272 Im using a xslcompiledtransform and that's working fine: XslCompiledTransform transformer = new XslCompiledTransform(); transformer.Load(HttpContext.Current.Server.MapPath("xslt\\" + requestvariables["xslsheet"].ToString())); transformer.Transform(xmlreader, null, writer); My problems comes when im trying to put into a variable the "nhits" attribute value placed on the Answer element, but i'm not rendering anything using my xslt sheet. Do you know what could be the cause? Could be the xmlns attribute in my xml file? Thanks in advance. Best Regards. Jose
