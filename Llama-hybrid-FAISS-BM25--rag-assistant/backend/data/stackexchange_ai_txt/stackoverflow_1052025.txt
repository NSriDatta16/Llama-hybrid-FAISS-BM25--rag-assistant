Believe it or not, I don't think there's really enough information here to say for sure. For example, how will the results typically be processed? Will they be plotted, or perhaps have some sort of numerical analysis performed on them? How big are your waveforms? Unless your raw results are typically small, I don't like option 1 for this application. There's a lot of storage overhead to store one data point. To a lesser extent, the same objection would apply to option 2. Option 3 is the way I would likely go. I once developed an app for viewing waveforms from lightning strikes - millions of points per waveform. The only viable option is a BLOB for that kind of a dataset. And (again, depending on some of the unknowns) I'd seriously consider storing the data as binary floats or doubles and processing them with java or external C programs. Seriously, do you need keyed access to your individual data points? Isn't loading an array up and indexing into it far simpler, more compact and efficient?
