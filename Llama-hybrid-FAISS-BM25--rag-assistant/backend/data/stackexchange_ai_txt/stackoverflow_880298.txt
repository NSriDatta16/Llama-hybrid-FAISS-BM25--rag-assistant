C# PropertyGrid drag drop

I'm trying to implement drag/drop support to a propertygrid in C# using VS2005 (.NET 2.0). The propertygrid can handle the dragenter etc. events, but there doesn't seem to be a way to get the griditem under the pointer during a drag event. The best I've been able to get so far is to use the selectedgriditem property to retrieve a custom propertydescriptor and set the value, but this requires a grid item to already be selected before starting the drag/drop operation. Has anyone had any luck with implementing this? Thanks :-)
