First off, don't use the tag for that. Text is display: inline and the is display: block so you're going to run into all kinds of issues just dealing with that. What I would do, if I had this problem, would be to have each word enclosed in it's own tag, so that your markup would look something like: Lorem ipsum dolor Then use Javascript or jQuery to listen for the onmouseover event on all of the elements within the paragraph. Your event handler will determine which span has been moused over and set the className of all prior spans to a style that gives the text a background color. You can also do this with text ranges and absolute positioning, but that is a good deal harder.
