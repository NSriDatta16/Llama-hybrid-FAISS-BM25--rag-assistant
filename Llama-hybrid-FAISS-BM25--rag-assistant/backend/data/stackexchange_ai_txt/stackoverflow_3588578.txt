The problem is with this line Box newBox = new Box (); The new operator returns a pointer to a Box object created on the heap. The pointer will be of type Box * . The left side of that expression declares a Box object. You can't directly assign a pointer-to-X to an X. You should probably just omit the new keyword unless you have a reason to want to manage the storage lifetime of the object manually. Incidentally, I'm betting you come from Java, where new is always required to create objects. Not so in C++. Also I think it's awesome that your data structures class is introducing you to templates right off the bat.
