An index-organized table is generally a good choice if you only access data from that table by the key, the whole key, and nothing but the key. Further, there are many limitations about what other database features can and cannot be used with index-organized tables -- I recall that in at least one version one could not use logical standby databases with index-organized tables. An index-organized table is not a good choice if it prevents you from using other functionality.
