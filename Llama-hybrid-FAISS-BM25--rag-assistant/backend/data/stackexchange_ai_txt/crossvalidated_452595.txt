Suppose $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ are unbiased estimators of $\mu$ with a bivariate normal distribution. Let $\sigma_1 = k \sigma_2$ , with $k , so $\theta_1$ is the more efficient estimator. Let the correlation be $r$ , with $-1 . We seek the least-variance linear estimates for $\mu$ and $\mu^2$ . The results are: \begin{align} \min_{a,b}Var[\mu-(a\theta_1+b\theta_2)] \text{ has }&\mu \sim \frac{(1-kr)\theta_1+(k^2-kr)\theta_2}{1-2kr+k^2}\\ \min_{c,d,e}Var[\mu^2-(c\theta_1^2+d\theta_1\theta_2+e\theta_2^2)] \text { has }&\mu^2 \sim \left(\frac{(1-kr)\theta_1+(k^2-kr)\theta_2}{1-2kr+k^2}\right)^{\!2} \end{align} So for functions $f$ that are quadratic or well approximated by quadratics, if $\frac{\theta_1+\theta_2}{2}$ is the best linear estimate for $\mu$ , then $f\left(\frac{\theta_1+\theta_2}{2}\right)$ is the best linear estimate for $f(\mu)$ . In general an appropriate weighted average inside $f$ works even better. Example: $\theta_1$ is the mean of a sample from a normal parent with mean $\mu$ , and $\theta_2$ is the median from the same sample. Then $k=r=\sqrt{2/\pi}$ , and the above formula shows that the best estimate for $\mu$ is $\theta_1$ , and the best estimate for $\mu^2$ is $\theta_1^2$ , i.e. ignoring the median. Example: $\theta_1$ is the mean of a sample from a normal parent with mean $\mu$ , and $\theta_2$ is the median of a different sample of the same size. Then $k=\sqrt{2/\pi}$ , $r=0$ , so the best estimate for $\mu$ is $(\pi\theta_1+2\theta_2)/(\pi+2)$ , or $.611\theta_1 + .389\theta_2$ , and the best estimate for $\mu^2$ is the square of that. Example: $\theta_1$ is the mean of a sample from a normal parent with mean $\mu$ , and $\theta_2$ is the mean of a different sample of the same size. Then $k=1$ , $r=0$ , so the best estimate for $\mu$ is $(\theta_1+\theta_2)/2$ , and the best estimate for $\mu^2$ is $\left(\frac{\theta_1+\theta_2}2\right)^{\!2}$ .
