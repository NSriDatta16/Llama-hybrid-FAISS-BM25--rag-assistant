No forced registration This is a common problem with everyday web applications. Forced account registrations are not user friendly. It's nowadays a necessity to prevent spam and misuse. But it hampers adoption. I guess everyone has heard of Stackoverflow. They don't force registrations. You can paritipate without account. Instead of forcing registrations it systematically encourages it. The main point however being, that there is at least the option to gradually get accustomed before committing. It's a simple concept. But it's likewise difficult to implement. Seldomly can you tack on temporal and optional user accounts, the base application logic and database structure must be prepared for it. Regardless of the implementation effort, I believe this is an important and undercherished feature.
