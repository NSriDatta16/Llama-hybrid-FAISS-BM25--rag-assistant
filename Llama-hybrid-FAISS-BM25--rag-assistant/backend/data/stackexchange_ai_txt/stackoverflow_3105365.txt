Tab Bar Controller + Navigation Controller + Bar Button Item

Within my MainWindow.xib I have a setup like I have here below. I have a Tab Bar Controller with a Navigation Controller within the Tab Bar Controller. I can switch between the different Navigation Controllers and this all works. What I am trying to do now is add a Right Bar Button Item to the Navigation Controller. I can't seem to use Interface Builder to drag and drop into the Navigation Controller. Is there a way to add a button to the Navigation Controller... either for specific Views or more preferably that persists throughout all views. Tab Bar Controller Tab Bar Navigation Controller Navigation Bar XXXXViewController Tab Bar Item
