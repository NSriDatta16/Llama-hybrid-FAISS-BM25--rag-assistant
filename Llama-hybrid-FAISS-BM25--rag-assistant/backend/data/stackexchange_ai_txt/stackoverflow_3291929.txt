It turns out that there was a DLL that wasn't registered. It was sqloledb.dll (C:\Program Files\Common Files\System\Ole DB). I found this by using the ?diag on the merge agent. http:////sqlcesa35.dll?diag That page shows a nice summary of the versions of DLLs that it is using and such. When I did that at the client's site, it showed "unknown" for the version of that DLL. Running regsvr32 on the DLL allowed sqlcesa35.dll to see it and the diag page showed a version number.
