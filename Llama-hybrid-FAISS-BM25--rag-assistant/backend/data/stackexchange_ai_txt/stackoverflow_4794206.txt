Why it's simple! Just run the leaks performance tool. Press the following: Run -> Start with Performance Tool -> Leaks. This tool tells you what library is leaking, then you can debug your code as you deem suitable. If it is well organized, you will be able to see immediately what object is leaking and fix the problem with ease. Good luck :)
