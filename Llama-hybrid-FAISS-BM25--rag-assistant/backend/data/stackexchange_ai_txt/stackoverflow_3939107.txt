MyISAM is the default storage engine on your server. You'll note that next to each table it says InnoDB . Your tables are InnoDB. The final MyISAM is only there in the footer to indicate the default setting for your MySQL server. To change the default: If you omit the ENGINE or TYPE option, the default storage engine is used. Normally, this is MyISAM, but you can change it by using the --default-storage-engine or --default-table-type server startup option, or by setting the default-storage-engine or default-table-type option in the my.cnf configuration file. http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/storage-engines.html If you are in a shared hosting environment—which is likely since you are using phpmyadmin—you may not be able to change the default. But it is largely irrelevant, since it's only used if you omit the declaration when creating a new table. Since you select InnoDB when creating tables, all of your tables are InnoDB not MyISAM
