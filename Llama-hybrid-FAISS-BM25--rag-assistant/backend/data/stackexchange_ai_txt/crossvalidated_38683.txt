This falls in the area of survey sampling. In principle, the methods work because randomization is used. Here are the things that can differ in polls based on subjective decisions. Sampling frame. What group of voters should I draw my sample from? How do I handle the volatility of the undecided voter who may change his opinion on Obama vs Romney based on yesterday's poll or next week? Peter has touched on the bias. The literary digest poll of 1936 was a disaster. It picked the Republican candidate over FDR because the sampling frame was based on a random selection of telephone numbers. In 1936 only the upper middle class and the wealthy had phones. That group was dominated by Republicans who tend to vote for the Republican candidate. Roosevelt won by a landslide getting his votes from the poor and the middle class which tended to be very much a group of Democrats! That illustrates bias due to the subtly poor choice of a sampling frame. Survey sampling deals with finite populations. The population size is N. Say a simple random sample is drawn from that population and has size n. For simplicity assume only Obama and Romney are running. The proportion of votes Obama would get for this sampling frame is an average of binary variables (say 1 if the respondent picks Obama and 0 for Romney). The variance of the sample mean for this variable is [p(1-p)/n][N-n]/N where p is the true population proportion that would pick Obama. [N-n]/N is the finite population correction. in most polls, N is much bigger than N and the correct can be ignored. Looking at p(1-p)/n we see the variance goes down with n. So if n is large the confidence interval at a given confidence level will get small. It is this variance (really its square root) that is used to get the margin of error that gets quoted. Pollsters other survey samplers and statisticians at the US Census Bureau all have these statistical tools at their disposal and they do more complex and accurate methods (cluster random sample and stratified random sampling to mention a couple of methods). When their modeling assumptions are valid the methods work remarkably well. Exit polling is a prime example. On election day you will see the networks accurately project winner in almost every state long before a near-final count. That is because preelection day variability is gone. They know historically how people tended to vote and they can determine selected precincts in a way that avoids bias. The networks sometimes differ. This can be due to a competition to pick the winner ahead of the others' mentality. It also can in rare instances be because the vote is extremely close (e.g Presidential Election 2000 in Florida). I hope this gives you a clearer picture of what goes on. We no longer see gross mistakes like "Dewey defeats Truman" in 1948 or the Literary Digest fiasco of 1936. But statistics is not perfect and statisticians can never say that they are certain.
