For setting the text on a background thread do as BFree has explained. About your code I would suggest the following - I think, your the Thread - oThread = new Thread(new ThreadStart(server.Start)); is redundant. In Server.Start you are again starting a listener thread. So you should simply call Server.Start from your Winform. You are not starting your threads as background threads. If a thread is a foreground thread it will keep you application running as long as the thread is alive. See this link - http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/h339syd0.aspx . You should set the IsBackground property to true on all thread instances created by your program. For getting better performance either use threads from ThreadPool or PFX Tasks in .Net 4. The threads then will be background threads by default. Moreover your program will not have the overhead of thread creation. Using PFX will help leverage your multi-core processor providing great performance benefits. read this excellent guide on threading http://www.albahari.com/threading/
