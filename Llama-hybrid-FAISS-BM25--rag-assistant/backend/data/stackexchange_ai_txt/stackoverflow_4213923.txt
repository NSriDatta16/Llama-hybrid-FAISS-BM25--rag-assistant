Multi-Monitoring in VS 2010

I am working in Visual Studio 2010. The main feature of VS 2010 is Multi-Monitering. How to do that. I am having 2 systems (CRT, 17 inches). I had opened my appliction, by right clicking the tab, i got the FLOAT option.That particular screen comes seperately, i had draged to the edge of my system, but the screen is not shared to my next system. Whether any Specific Configuration needed for this.
