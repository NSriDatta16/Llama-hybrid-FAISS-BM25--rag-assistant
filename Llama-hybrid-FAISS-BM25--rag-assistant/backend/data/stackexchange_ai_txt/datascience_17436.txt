Problem designing CNN network

I seem to have a problem modelling my CNN network. I want to extract from features vector from different sized images. Whats consistent with the images is the y-axis, and the color dimension, but the x-axis is not constant. Depending on the length of the x-axis will the length of the feature vector also be altered. I already know how long they should be, but not the ratio between the length of the x-axis and length of the feature vector, I guess one does exist. Is it possible to train a CNN network such that it can alter the feature vector length depending on the length of the input of the x-axis of the image?
