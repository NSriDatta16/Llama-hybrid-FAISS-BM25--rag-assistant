Sun (now Oracle) doesn't really need to do much itself to create more JVM languages - since this role has largely been taken up by the open source community and/or the wider Java ecosystem. Consider: Modern, increasingly popular open-source JVM languages like Scala , Groovy and Clojure Libraries created or sponsored by organisations like the Apache Software Foundation that can be used by all JVM langauges IDEs / development tools by the Eclipse Foundation and others Various tools and enterprise products created by the major corporate backers of Java, including IBM, Red Hat, Google etc... Development of Java language and platform itself as an open source product through the OpenJDK project It's therefore more appropriate to think of Java as an open ecosystem with many participants, rather than a platform controlled by a single company.
