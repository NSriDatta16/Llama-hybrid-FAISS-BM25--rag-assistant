How to handle using input feature (clicks) when it is used in target too?

I am trying to create a ranking model, where I am thinking about creating ground truth based on clicks by user. But at same time past clicks made by users seems like a vital input feature too. Any ideas how can i handle such a situation? Edit: to clarify, If i include clicks in model input, and use it to create ground truth ranking. Model will just ignore every other input feature and focus on clicks. I am currently using xgboost (lamdamart) directly optimizing ndcg based on click. I have several features some of which are about how similar document is to query. others are about how popular document is compared to other documents. My ground truth ranking is based on how popular document is with a particular query.
