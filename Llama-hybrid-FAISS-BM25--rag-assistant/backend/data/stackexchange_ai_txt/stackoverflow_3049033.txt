I've never used the API from java before, but looking over your code example, you said you generated code using the v2 WSDL (which is supposed to have better Java/.NET SOAP support), but in your code sample you're pointing at the v1 URL http://localhost/magento/index.php/api/ I would assume you want your code sample pointing at http://magento1point4.dev/index.php/api/v2_soap but again, not a big Java (or SOAP, for that matter) guy, so appologies if there's something obvious I'm missing here.
