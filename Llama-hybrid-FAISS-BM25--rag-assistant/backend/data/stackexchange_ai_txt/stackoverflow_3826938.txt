UIControl for a Needle Gauge aka Google O Meter

For those times when a UISlider just isn't fun enough I was thinking I'd work up a custom UIControl to do something similar to a Google O Meter from the google chart API on iOS. Here's an example of what I'm talking about visually. My goal would be to enable touch manipulation of the needle and easy customization of the range labels and coloring gradients. The Google Charts API is a great inspiration: Before I re-invent the wheel is anyone aware of an existing effort I could leverage good sample code with something like this or project I could contribute too? Thanks for any pointers.
