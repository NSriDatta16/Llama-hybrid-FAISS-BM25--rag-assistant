I do not understand the issue: when checking dmvnorm, I do get positive values for the density and finite values for the logarithm: > range(dmvnorm(matrix(rnorm(1e5*150),ncol=150)) [1] 3.299652e-110 1.522980e-78 If you keep getting zero values for your target density in the MCMC steps, it is because you are in the "wrong" region of the space. To avoid being stuck, you can adopt the convention $0/0=1$ in the Metropolis-Hastings acceptance step, which will make the chain move like a random walk until hopefully you get to a region with positive target density.
