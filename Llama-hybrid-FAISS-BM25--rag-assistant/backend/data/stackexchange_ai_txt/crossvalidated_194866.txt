Can (how) you enter control variables in a binary logistic regression?

I'm running a binary logistic regression to test whether personality ratings (scale of 1-5) predict a binary outcome, in children. I want to enter factors such as age and gender as control variables, and then the personality ratings as the predictor variables. Is this possible? Many thanks.
