Well, the answer is: it depends. As @BruceET said, Bayesian models can be used to limit the possible values depending on the distribution you assume; furthermore they tend to be more reliable when evaluating rare events and data with high number of cells with 0 counts. However, when you have a huge number of data, also frequentis models tend to be equally reliable. It also depends on the type of analysis you are performing: in network meta analysis, when trials with more than two arms are included, bayesian analysis tend to perform better than frequentist, whereas frequentist analysis tend to perform similarly when only trials with twi arms are included (however, bayesian Network also give you better estimation of probability of being the best treatment calcukated with SUCRA or rankograms).
