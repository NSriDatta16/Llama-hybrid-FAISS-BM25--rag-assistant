Aside from concurrency problems the most likely cause of your slowup is memory cache contention. If all threads are accessing the same piece of storage the chances are its in the other processers memory cache when you want to access it. If the storage is "read only" you could give each thread its own copy which would allow the JVM & processor to optimise the memory acccesses.
