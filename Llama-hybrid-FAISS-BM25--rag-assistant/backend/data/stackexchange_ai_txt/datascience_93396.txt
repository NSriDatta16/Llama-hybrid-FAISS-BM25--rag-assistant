sklearn FutureWarning message when running a CNN model

When I run my model, I am receiving the following error message: FutureWarning: Pass classes=[ 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24], y=[20 16 4 ... 2 2 2] as keyword args. From version 0.25 passing these as positional arguments will result in an error FutureWarning) I am assuming I need to pass them as keyword args. I am new to the Sklearn library and wondered if anyone has had experience removing this warning before or passing arguments as keyword args? I can ignore the warning, but I don't think that would be best.
