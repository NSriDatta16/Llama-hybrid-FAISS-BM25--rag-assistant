I really dont think so, as there are fundamental aspects in statistics that are simply overlooked in machine learning. For instance, in statistics, when fitting a model to data, the discrpeancy function that is used (e.g., G^2, RMSEA) is essential because they have different statistical properties. In machine learning, it just doesnt matter, so it is not covered at all. Of course one could argue that you could learn those things later, but IMHO, it is better to undestand and care about some issues, and possibly in the future not care about them, then the other way around. cheers
