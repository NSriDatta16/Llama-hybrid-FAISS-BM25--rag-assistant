Eclipse to play nice wtih SVN version control and WAMP development environment

I've been using a WAMP stack for a while now and have my projects organized in this way wamp/www/project1 wamp/www/project2 wamp/www/project3 etc. Now I started to use Eclipse for PHP and have a workspace that's located in my C drive at C:/my_eclipse_workspace When I create new project in eclipse, a folder gets created for it at C:/my_eclipse_workspace/project1 Then on top of that I need to start using a local version control repository on my system. All this is getting me scratching my head. How do I use Eclipse + have my project files in their appropriate wamp directory (e.g. wamp/www/project1 so they can launched easily from within the browser like I normally do) all while keeping the project somewhere under SVN? This may be simple and I'm just not getting it, so a detailed slow answer for the stupid would be much appreciated here.
