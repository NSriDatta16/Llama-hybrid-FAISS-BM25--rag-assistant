You are probably using a MasterPage or user controls (ascx) and this is the reason the for client ids change. Imagine you have a control in the master page with the same id as one in the page. This would result in clashes. The id changes ensures all ClientID properties are unique on a page. FindControl needs some special attention when working with MasterPages. Have a look at ASP.NET 2.0 MasterPages and FindControl() . The FindControl works inside a naming container . The MastePage and the page are different naming containers.
