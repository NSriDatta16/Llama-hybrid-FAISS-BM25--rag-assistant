If dll_B is just an implementation detail of dll-A, then don't include [dll_B.h] from [dll_A.h], just include it from [dll_A.cpp]. Avoiding that header dependency may require a little redesign. E.g. you may want to think about PIMPL idiom for [dll_A]. More details are impossible to state without knowing more details... :-) Cheers & hth., PS: Linking has nothing to do with header files, except that with some Windows compilers (notably MSVC) a header file can include a #pragma that causes automatic linking with correct library.
