Is decompression possible with PCA?

PCA can be used to compress data by reducing the vectors containing the least amount of information based on the eigen vectors sorted according to the eigen Values. Is it possible to reverse this process ? What I mean by reversing the process is that we take the compressed data set and we must try to get an estimation of the original data set. I'm trying to accomplish this within the scope of sound compression and decompression. I have achieved decompression by using the original eigen vectors, this means the process is not applicable in real life. Thanks for your help!
