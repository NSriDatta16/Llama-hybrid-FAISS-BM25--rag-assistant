Problem facing in reading file from Internal memory of android

I am facing the problem with openfileinput class. First thing is , I am saving my username and password in the file.On sucessful login, I will be saving and moving to internal home screen.The problem is when I logout or close the application, and reopen the application I am able to read the data but when I convert it to String I get Out put as AAAAAA(each as 4 bytes). On succesful login on moving to Home screen , I am able to read it properly.I get this output before login. This is something like , saving username and password in internal memory of android.
