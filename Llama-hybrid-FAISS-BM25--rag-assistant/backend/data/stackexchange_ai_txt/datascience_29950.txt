Which cloud platform to maximize my impact as a data scientist?

I am looking to pick up the knowledge/software skills to move towards becoming an end to end deep learning engineer. By this I mean handling the following on my own: preprocess big data at low latency design & train deep learning models on massive data deploy models to serve predictions at massive scale stream/preprocess incoming data to update models in real time Which cloud platform would you choose to do this? GCP: Allows me to do the above with the minimum effort (serverless model hosting, model versioning etc), however, it ties me to tensorflow (I'm an MXNet fan). Looks like I need to pick up apache beam for distributed data preprocessing... AWS: Maximum flexibility but seems far less clean. Appears to be more suited to a team of 5 experts wanting to achieve the above. What software would you choose? I'm essentially looking to pickup the minimum amount of things to have the maximum impact. Currently spend most of my time using python + MXNet + EC2 and am comfortable with (2)
