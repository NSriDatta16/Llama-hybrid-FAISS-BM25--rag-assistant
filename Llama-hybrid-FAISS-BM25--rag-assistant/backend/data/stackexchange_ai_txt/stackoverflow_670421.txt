I do most everything either with LWP::Simple , LWP::UserAgent , Mojo::UserAgent or WWW::Mechanize . The REST stuff is just choosing the right URL to send the request too. Once you get the response, there are plenty of modules on CPAN to handle XML or JSON. I particularly like Mojo since it comes with its own JSON and DOM parsers and tools.
