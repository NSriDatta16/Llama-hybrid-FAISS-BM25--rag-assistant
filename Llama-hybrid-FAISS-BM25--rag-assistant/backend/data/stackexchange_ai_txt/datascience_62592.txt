Can I apply survival analysis to predict if a user will revisit the website?

I have one business problem in hand which is to predict if a user will revisit the website or not within 6 months. I need to majorly understand what are the factors which make the user return and also need to give business recommendations on what can be done to make a new user return to the website. My initial idea was to do logistic regression. Lately, I read about survival analysis. I want to know if I can use survival analysis for this problem. Also, my dataset has 20k users; each user having multiple transactions; the target variable was not given I aggregated the dataset to one record per user and did some feature engineering to come up with a target variable. If I want to use survival analysis in this problem, shall I consider only the last transaction of each user or shall I use the aggregated dataset?
