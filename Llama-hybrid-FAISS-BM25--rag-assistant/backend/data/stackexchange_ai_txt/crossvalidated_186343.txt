Can we forecast a random-walk time series with another one?

I have two time series that follow a random walk behaviour. I would like to use the one I know to forecast the other one. Suppose there is a strong correlation between them with $\text{lag}=k$, for example. This lag would permit me to forecast one because I have the information $k$ days before from the other one, even if it is a random walk. Does it make sense? The problem I intuitively observe is that I'm trying to forecast a random evolution.
