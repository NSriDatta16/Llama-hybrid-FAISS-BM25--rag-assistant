If I understanding what your asking for your looking for a build server, to my knowledge Microsoft don't offer one, but some to take a look at are Team City , Hudson (requires a plug-in), and CruiseControl.net . Basically they work by pulling from your source control building your application and running your tests. They all support scripting that will allow you to build then deploy to your servers. This can be set up to run nightly, weekly, etc. you can also set it up to monitor your source control for changes and build anytime it sees a change The only one I've used is Team City, the install was easy, and depending on how many build agents you need it's free. If your just looking to build and deploy from VS Another option is creating an NAnt script and running it from VS as an external tool. For a good over view of Build servers check out this SOF question cruisecontrol.net vs teamcity for continuous integration
