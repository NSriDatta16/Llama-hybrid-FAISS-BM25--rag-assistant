NCover 1.5.8 does generate coverate report

I run NCoverExploler, configure it, so command line look like this "D:\Development\Projects\t.net\lib\NCover\NCover.Console.exe" //reg //w "D:\Development\Projects\t.net\build_output\t.net" //v "D:\Development\Projects\t.net\lib\NUnit\nunit-console.exe" t.Core.Tests.dll /framework=4.0 Output coverage.xml appears to be empty. In the same time, if I run Coverate report by Visual Studio (by TestDriven.Net), it generates just perfectly. I've compared coverage.log files for 2 cases. In case if I run by NCoverExporer: EVENT: Log link established. EVENT: Communications link established. MESSAGE: Ready for command input. EVENT: Verbose Logging Disabled EVENT: Logging Enabled EVENT: AutoExclusion Enabled MESSAGE: Monitoring Assemblies: (All Loaded Assemblies) MESSAGE: Excluding Types and Methods with these Attributes: CoverageExcludeAttribute; MESSAGE: Received driver ready event. MESSAGE: v2.0.50727 In case of TestDriven.net EVENT: Log link established. EVENT: Communications link established. MESSAGE: Ready for command input. EVENT: Verbose Logging Disabled EVENT: Logging Enabled EVENT: AutoExclusion Enabled MESSAGE: Monitoring Assemblies: Microsoft.Web.Mvc;Moq;T.Core;T.Core.Tests;Web; MESSAGE: Excluding Types and Methods with these Attributes: CoverageExcludeAttribute;System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.ExcludeFromCodeCoverageAttribute; MESSAGE: Received driver ready event. MESSAGE: v4.0.30319 Please see the difference in Monitoring Assemblies and MESSAGE: v4.0.30319. In case of TD.net, it correctly supples .NET framework. Any clues, how to make NCover make work, as it in TD.net ? Where is it configured?
