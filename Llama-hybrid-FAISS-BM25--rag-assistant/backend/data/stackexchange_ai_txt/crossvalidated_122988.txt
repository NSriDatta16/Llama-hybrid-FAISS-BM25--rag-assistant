As mentioned above then panel data has often been used on individual level rather than on an aggregated level with large N and small T. There are many pros with using panel data since we can remove individual heterogeneity and often get higher power when testing to mention two. This new time dimension does introduce some new methods, assumptions and problems compared with cross-sectional data (I will refer you to Wooldridge's book to study these closer). It is however very common within economics to also use country level panel data with small N and large T. This introduces a whole range of difficulties not encountered when dealing with large N, small T panel data. We could for instance have unit roots in our panel and there are also specific panel unit root tests to deal with this specific issue. Notice that these have a significantly higher power than unit root tests on individual series. We could also have all sorts of other kinds of non-stationarity in these panels. Furthermore, when dealing with panel data with small N and large T we can also have cointegration. Another major issue when dealing with large T and small N panel data is that this data is often for country level economic variables and that in this case the independence assumption is often violated and this should be tested for. That being said this is not a problem only for small N and large T but can also be present in large N and small T panels. So panel data with large N and small T introduce a time series dimension compared to cross sectional data and are similar to cross sectional analysis while panels with large T and small N introduce a cross sectional dimension compared to the time series approach and which is similar to time series analysis. An excellent book on panel data with large N and small T is "Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data" by Wooldridge. This book is quite dense and packs a lot of information on every page so you might want to start with a introductory book in econometrics and read the section on panel data there first. I do not know a specific book for panels with large T and small N but there is a volume called: "Nonstationary Panels, Panel Cointegration, and Dynamic Panels", Baltagi, ed.
