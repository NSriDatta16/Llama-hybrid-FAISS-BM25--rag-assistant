I'd be tempted to approach this with Bayesian methods, especially if observations are correlated and you also want to model this. For example, using the brms R package makes it very easy to fit models with non-linear terms in them as illustrated in the vignette on this topic . By having at least vague prior information (which you probably have based on simple physical limitations one can deduce) any problems in identifying them model parameters are often substantially reduced. The standard deviation of MCMC samples from the posterior for a parameter then play a similar role as a SE in frequentist inference (but you could also look at the posterior median and credible intervals based on distribution quantiles).
