Most browsers that implement HTML5 are still in early beta - so it's quite likely they are still working the bugs out. However, the resolution of the canvas you are trying to create is very high .. much higher than what most people's monitors can even display. Is there are reason you need it quite so large? Why not restrict the draggable area to something more in line with typical display resolutions?
