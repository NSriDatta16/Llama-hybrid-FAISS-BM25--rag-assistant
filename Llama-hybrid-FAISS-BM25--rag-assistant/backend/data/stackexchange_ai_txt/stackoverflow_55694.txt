I can't claim that it's a best practice, but I often see files organized in a directory hierarchy that mirrors the namespace. If it fits your mental model of the code better, then do so - I can't think of any harm. Just because the .NET model doesn't enforce relationships between namespaces, projects, and directory structure doesn't mean you can't have such relationships if you want to. I'd be a little leery of breaking up the code into more projects than you need, as this can slow compilation and add a little bit of overhead when you have to manage multiple assemblies. EDIT: Note that this question is nearly a duplicate of should the folders in a solution match the namespace?
