Can anyone figure out my problem [Python]

I have been trying to debug the below python cgi code but doesn't seems to work. When i try in new file it these three lines seems to work filename=unique_file('C:/wamp/www/project/input.fasta') prefix, suffix = os.path.splitext(filename) fd, filename = tempfile.mkstemp(suffix, prefix+"_", dirname) But, when i try like this way then i get error unique_file is not define >>> form=cgi.FieldStorage() i=(form["dfile"].value) j=(form["sequence"].value) if (i!="" and j=="" ): filename=(form["dfile"].filename) (name, ext) = os.path.splitext(filename) alignfile=name + '.aln' elif(j!="" and i==""): filename=unique_file('C:/wamp/www/project/input.fasta') prefix, suffix = os.path.splitext(filename) fd, filename = tempfile.mkstemp(suffix, prefix+"_", dirname) file = open(filename, 'w') value=str(j) file.write(value) file.close() (name, ext) = os.path.splitext(filename) alignfile=name + '.aln' What i am trying to do is check two options from form:- Fileupload and textarea. If fileupload is true then there is nothing to do except separating file and its extension. But when textarea is true then i have to generate unique file name and write content in it and pass filename and its extension. Error i got is... type 'exceptions.NameError'>: name 'unique_file' is not defined args = ("name 'unique_file' is not defined",) message = "name 'unique_file' is not defined" Any suggestions and corrections are appreciated Thanks for your concern
