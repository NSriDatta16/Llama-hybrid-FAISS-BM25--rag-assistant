Correctly instantiating a nested fields_for without showing older saved objects?

I have a nested form that instantiates as this : - 2.times { @organization.referrals.build } - form_for @organization do |f| = f.error_messages - f.fields_for :referrals do |f| Except, the nested forms are supposed to be always new and unique. Where as this form shows previously created objects as well. So I tried to write as so.. - 2.times { @organization.referrals.build } - form_for @organization do |f| = f.error_messages - f.fields_for @organization.referrals.select{|r| r.new_record? } do |f| But now I do not see 2 blank forms, and I can not save my object because it tries to pass Organization.referral (which is not a method) instead of Organization.referrals . Question 1 How do I create 2 blank forms? Question 2 How do I get this to pass correctly ( as it does in the first example ) ?
