You should hash the passwords, if your database gets cracked an attacker can read out all the passwords if you don't. UPDATE: Check the post of Tomalak sha1($_POST['pass']); // will encrypt the password to a 40 character long string. echo(sha1('monkey')); // will become: ab87d24bdc7452e55738deb5f868e1f16dea5ace echo(sha1('Monkey')); // completely different: 4bd0ec65b8f729d265faeba6fa933846d7c2d687 // Just by making the letter upper-case! If you want to login a user encrypt the pass from the login form and compare it to the database. $pass = 'monkey'; if(sha1($pass)=='ab87d24bdc7452e55738deb5f868e1f16dea5ace'){ echo('Correct pass!'); } If you want to validate the length of a password, you can use this piece of code: if($upass=='' || $upass=='Password'){ $errupass = 'Please fill in a password.'; $valid = false; }elseif(strlen($upass) I shouldn't discourage people to use weird characters since they increase the strength of a password.
