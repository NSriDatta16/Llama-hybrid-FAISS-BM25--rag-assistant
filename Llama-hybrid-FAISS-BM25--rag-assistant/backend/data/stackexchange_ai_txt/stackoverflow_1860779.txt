POST and GET mean entirely different things, and you shouldn't be "testing" anything that way. Instead, you should do a real POST to the intended URL by using Perl's LWP . use HTTP::Request::Common qw(POST); use LWP::UserAgent; $ua = LWP::UserAgent->new; my $req = POST 'http://www.perl.com/cgi-bin/BugGlimpse', [ param1 => 'arbitrarily long blob', param2 => 'whatever' ]; print $ua->request($req)->as_string;
