Dynamically Linked Library. To give you an example, If you have someone else's DLL loaded into you application you can use bits of programming from it. You can load a DLL that generates random numbers that always start with "5" or something. In you program you can call CrazyDLL.GenerateRandomNumbersSorta() and it will return the number. For a real world example, I have DLL that combines 4 textboxes (you'd use these to type IP addresses) and it automatically only accepts numbers less than 256, and handles pressing the backspace key to jump to a previous textbox. I've created a DLL with that code, and now all I have to do is drag and drop more of those IP address textbox collections without having to duplicate all that code over and over again. The same DLL also has function for converting IP addresses to hexadecimal strings, and other useful code.
