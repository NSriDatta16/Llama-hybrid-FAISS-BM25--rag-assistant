You left out the details of your jQuery.ajax call... you may find a better answer if you can provide more detail. Assuming you're making a GET request, you can wrap your lists in a JSON object. JSON serialization will require far less badnwidth than HTML/XML serialization counterparts. Then, in terms of client-side access, you'll be dealing with an object literal: { Agents: [ {name:"Jane"}, {name: "John"} ], Channels: [ {someValue: 123}, {someValue: 456} ] } Using your JSON result you can use standard JavaScript for/in syntax to iterate over the Agents and Channels lists. It's not possible to say whether there's a "better" approach without knowing the details of your situation, but it sounds like you're already on the right track.
