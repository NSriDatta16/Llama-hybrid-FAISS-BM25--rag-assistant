How to choose negative examples to build a training set?

I want to use supervised machine learning method to do binary classfication, so a training set is needed. I already have the positive examples. My question is that all my negative examples are randomly selected from a very large dataset which may contain only a few positive examples. Is this approach right to construct the training set? Is any approach to evaluate the training set, especially negative examples?
