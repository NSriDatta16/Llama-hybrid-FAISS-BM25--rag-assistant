Is there any good or reliable way to figure out where a JavaScript error is using only an Internet Explorer error message?

I'm writing an app which for various reasons involves Internet Explorer (IE7, for the record), ActiveX controls, and a heroic amount of JavaScript, which is spread across multiple .js includes. One of our remote testers is experiencing an error message and IE's error message says something to the effect of: Line: 719 Char: 5 Error: Unspecified Error Code: 0 URL: (the URL of the machine) There's only one JavaScript file which has over 719 lines and line 719 is a blank line (in this case). None of the HTML or other files involved in the project have 719 or more lines, but the resulting HTML (it's sort of a server-side-include thing), at least as IE shows from "View Source" does have 719 or more lines - but line 719 (in this case) is a closing table row tag (no JavaScript, in other words). The results of "View Generated Source" is only 310 lines in this case. I would imagine that it could possibly be that the entire page, with the contents of the JavaScript files represented inline with the rest of the HTML could be where the error is referring to but I don't know any good way to view what that would be, So, given a JavaScript error from Internet Explorer where the line number is the only hint but the page is actually spread across multiple files? UPDATE: The issue is exacerbated by the fact that the user experiencing this is remote and for various network reasons, debugging it using something like Visual Studio 2008 (which has awesome JavaScript debugging, by the way) is impossible. I'm limited to having one of us look at the source to try and figure out what line of code it's crapping out on. UPDATE 2: The real answer (as accepted below) seems to be "no, not really". For what it's worth though, Robert J. Walker's bit about it being off by one did get me pointed in the right direction as I think it was the offending line. But since that's not really what I'd call good or reliable (IE's fault, not Robert J. Walker's fault) I'm going to accept the "no, not really" answer. I'm not sure if this is proper SO etiquette. Please let me know if it's not via the comments.
