MCMC Sample should be i.i.d

I'm a bit not sure how to show that MCMC samples are i.i.d. In my opinion the trace plot should behave like white noise model because white noise model has a strong stationary properties i.e. the joint distribution from any lag is the same hence the identical distribution achieve. Is it correct ? And if one see the ACF plot one need to see whether the ACF are exponentially decreasing. But 0 correlation or 0 covariance doesn't imply independence, so how to proof it ?
