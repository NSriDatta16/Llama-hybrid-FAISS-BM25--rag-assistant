Log-linear regression vs. Poisson regression

In this post , OP asked the difference between log linear regression and logistic regression. Two answers in the post are very clear and directly address OP's question. I understand log-linear regression and logistic regression are quite different but do not understand what's the difference between log-linear regression and Poisson regression? I think AdamO and Gung's answer do not explain my question in detail. From AdamO the log-linear model is actually just a Poisson regression model From Gung "log-linear regression" is usually understood to be a Poisson GLiM applied to multi-way contingency tables. Update: I am reading some source code fro R0 package in R. The author was trying to estimate the exponential growth rate using different methods: ##details Is there any relationship between linear regression on log scale and poisson regression? what is the reason to use different methods?
