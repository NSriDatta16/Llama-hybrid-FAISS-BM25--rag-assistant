In addition to Stephen C's answer and using the javadoc tool, you can specify exactly which packages appear in the javadoc (hence Stephen C's comment about 'pain' if they aren't organised logically) using something like this: Say you have 5 classes and you want only the classes in the org.notprivate package to appear in the Javadoc: org.notprivate.Foo org.notprivate.Bar org.notprivate.Stuff org.notpublic.Things org.notpublic.More You can use something like: javadoc -d target/api -source 1.6 -sourcepath src/main/java org.notprivate That's just a quick example, if you need to specify each class you'll need to look at the link Stephen C provided in more detail Posted here for clarity: Javadoc Documentation
