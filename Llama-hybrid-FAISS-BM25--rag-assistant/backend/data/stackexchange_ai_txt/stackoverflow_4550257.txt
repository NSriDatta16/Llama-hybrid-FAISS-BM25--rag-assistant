I actually just developed my first application using only one page. ..it got messy My idea was to create an application that mimicked the desktop environment as much as possible. In particular I wanted a detailed view of some app data to be in a popup window that would maintain it's state regardless of the section of the application they were in. Thus my frankenstein was born. What ended up happening due to budget/time constraints was the code got out of hand. The various sections of my JavaScript source got muddled together. Maintaining the proper state of various views I had proved to be... difficult. With proper planning and technique I think the 'one-page' approach is a very easy way to open up some very interesting possibilities (ex: widgets that maintain state across application sections). But it also opens up many... many potential problem areas. including... Flooding the global namespace (if you don't already have your own... make one ) Code organization can easily get... out of hand Context - It's very easy to I'm sure there are more... In short, I would urge you to stay away from relying on JavaScript dependency for the compatibility issue's alone. What I've come to realize is there is simply no need rely on JavaScript to everything . I'm actually in the process of removing JavaScript dependencies in loo of Progressive Enhancement . It just makes more sense. You can achieve the same or similar effects with properly coded JavaScript. The idea is too... Develop out well-formatted, fully functional application w/o any JavaScript Style it Wrap the whole thing with JavaScript Using Progressive Enhancement one can develop an application that delivers the best possible experience for the user that is possible.
