In LASSO, does it make sense to choose lambda based on the mean error associated with different lambda values, over multiple cross-validations?

I am running a LASSO regression, but am put off by the different values of lambda each time I run the cross-validation. Does it make sense to run a cross validation multiple times, take the mean error associated with each lambda value, and then choose lambda.1se (i.e., the largest lambda resulting in error within 1 se of the minimum) from the distribution of lambdas and mean errors? library(glmnet) set.seed(3) IV1 low) lambdas Edit: My question is unique because I am asking about how to implement the one standard error rule after iterating the cross validation. Edit 2: It's possible my question isn't clear. I am being linked to a previous question which is different. That one talks about running cross validation once and choosing the best lambda from that process. I would like to run cross validation multiple times , averaging over the different results, and choosing the best lambda based off of that. I would like to know if my code is an acceptable way of doing that.
