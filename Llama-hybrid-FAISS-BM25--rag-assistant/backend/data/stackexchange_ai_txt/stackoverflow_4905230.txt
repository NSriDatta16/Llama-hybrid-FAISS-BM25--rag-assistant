We use Paypal Payflow Pro . It basically gives you full control over the look and feel of your checkout page. It keeps the shopper on your domain during the entire transaction. Transaction data is sent to Paypal through a secure API. Unfortunately, this is considered somewhat advanced. You'll likely have to figure out how to integrate with Paypal by yourself. I find that many vendors try to discourage businesses from going down that route because many don't know what they are in for technically. But if you're a good problem-solver and are capable of digging into a problem and breaking it down, and you understand very basic security, such as using HTTPS on your checkout page as well as with the Paypal API, then you are more likely to be successful. Also, please don't print credit card numbers to log files or store them in the database. That's just not cool. Everytime someone does that, a kitten dies and Jon Skeet feels a tremor in the Stack Exchange force.
