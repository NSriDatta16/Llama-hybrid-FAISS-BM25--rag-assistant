Must a binary time series with a constant mean be stationary?

Suppose I have a binary time series $Y$ with support $\{0,1\}$ and a constant mean (i.e. $E[Y_t]=\mu,\forall t$ ). I know that this means the variance of the series is constant in time as well since, for a binary variable $X$ , $Var(X)=E[X](1-E[X])$ . However, do these conditions ensure that the autocorrelation of the series is independent of time and, thus, that the process is stationary? Does there exist a counterexample to such a claim?
