Multivariate stochastic time series forecasting

I have a multivariate time series like this Time Price Volume Buy_Side_Broker_Type Sell_Side_Broker_Type 09:00:00 4.590 60 HiInfBroker LInfBroker 09:00:23 4.662 34 MInfBroker LInfBroker 09:00:45 4.562 41 LInfBroker HiInfBroker I want to forecast the price using volume and Buy side broker type and sell side broker type as independent variables. How to do it for such stochastic process in R?
