Before changing weights the normality assumption was fine - ANOVAs are quite robust to deviations and that was a nice unimodal peak. However, equality of variance (an arguably more important assumption) was not met. Ignore Shapiro-Wilk in the first instance. It is much more sensitive to deviations from normality than the actual test you are using is. The gls weighted analysis corrected the heteroscedasticity but violated the normality assumption. This is not a huge problem if you have a decent sample size (i.e. n > 30), as the central limit theorem applies, but it does mean the model is unreliable for predictions. In saying that, it looks like you have quite a small sample size. Akaike's information criterion (AIC) is completely inappropriate in this case. A) your sample size is much too small. If anything you should be using AICc (AIC's second order derivative), and; B) AIC (or AICc) cannot be used to compare two completely different methods that are maximising two different likelihoods . PERMANOVA is probably the most sensible approach if you want to see how tree genotype is influencing multiple soil parameters, as it avoids some type II error issues. However, as mentioned in the comments, vegan::adonis is deprecated, you should be using vegan::adonis2 . Moreover, PERMANOVA does require that the multivariate spread of your groups is approximately equal. This is similar to the homogeneity of variance assumption for an ANOVA. You can check this with the vegan::betadisper function.
