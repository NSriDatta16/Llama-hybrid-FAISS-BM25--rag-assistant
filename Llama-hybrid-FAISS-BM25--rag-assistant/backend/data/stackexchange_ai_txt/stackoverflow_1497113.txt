C#/WPF: Binding Combobox ItemSource in Datagrid to element outside of the DataContext

I'd like to do following: public List PreLoadedUserList { get; set; } public List SomeDataRowList { get; set; } public class Users { public int Age { get; set; } public string Name { get; set; } } public class SomeDataRowList { public int UserAge { get; set; } Now my (WPF Toolkit) DataGrid looks like this: Now my problem is, that PreLoadedUserList is outside of the ItemSource (SomeDataRowList) and I don't know how to bind to something outside of it. What I actually want it: - Display in the ComboBox PreLoadedUserList - Set the Value of (RowEntries) SelectedItem.UserAge to the Value of the selected ComboboxItem.Age Let me know if my explanation is too weird :-) Thank you, Cheers
