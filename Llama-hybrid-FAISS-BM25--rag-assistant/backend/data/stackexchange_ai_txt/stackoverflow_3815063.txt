Tracking unique visitors in Rails app - session or explicit cookie?

So here is the situation - I have a store app that I want to ultimately calculate the number of unique visitors to number of orders placed each day (basic conversion percentage). I am debating whether or not to store a visitor_id in Rails session or setting an explicit cookie on client. Either way, both would check to see if a visitor record has been created for the client by doing a lookup on the visitor table by IP address, http user agent, etc. Now that I write this, I am thinking a cookie might be the best solution because I could create a unique identifier and store that in the cookie, then look up or create a visitor depending on that value.. Granted nothing is perfect since a "visitor" could switch computers, visit the site, and thus create another cookie / visitor record, but I am ok with that. Further research brought me to this: How can I track repeated visitors using cookies thoughts / best practices... :) thanks!
