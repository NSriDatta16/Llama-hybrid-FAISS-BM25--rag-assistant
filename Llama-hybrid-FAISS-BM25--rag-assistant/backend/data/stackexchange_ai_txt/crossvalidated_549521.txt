Derivation when priori probability is Unknown

I want to derive an expression for the Bayesian classification risk $L(r^*)$ when the priori $\tau_1\in[0,1]$ is unknown. For this problem, let: $X\in\mathbb{X}=[0,1],Y\in\{ 0,1 \}$ $\pi_y=P(Y=y)=1/2$ for $y\in{0,1}$ Also, conditional distributions are characterised by: $[X|Y=y]$ are characterised by $f(x|Y=0)=2-2x$ and $f(x|Y=1)=2x$ . In a binary classification case, $L(r^*)=E(min\{\tau_1(X),1-\tau_1(X)\}=1/2-1/2E(|2\tau_1(X)-1|)$ , so I'm assuming I need to replace the $\tau_1$ somehow, but I'm not exactly sure what else the classification risk would rely on.
