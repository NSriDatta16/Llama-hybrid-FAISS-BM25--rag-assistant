Error message when trying to insert method into touchesBegan

I am trying to create a new method within my TapDetectingImageView file and it's giving me a warning that it cannot find the method even though I have it declared in the .h file. The specific three warnings all point to the @end line in the .m file when I build it and they say: "Incomplete implementation of class 'TapDetectingImageView' ; 'Method definition for '-functionA:' not found" ; "Method definition for '-functionB:' not found" What am I missing? Am I not allowed to do this in a protocol file like TapDetectingImageView? In my .h file is: @interface TapDetectingImageView : UIImageView { id delegate; } @property (nonatomic, assign) id delegate; -(void) functionA:(NSString*)aVariable; -(void) functionB:(NSString*)aVariable; @end In my .m file is: -(void)functionA:(NSString*)aVariable { // do stuff in this function with aVariable } -(void)functionB:(NSString*)aVariable { // do stuff in this function with aVariable }
