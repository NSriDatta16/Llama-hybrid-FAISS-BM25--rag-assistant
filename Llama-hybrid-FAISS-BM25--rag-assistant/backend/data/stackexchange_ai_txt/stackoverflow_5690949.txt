Excerpts from Writing and Editing Source Code in the Xcode 4 User Guide: Xcode 4 provides libraries of file templates and code snippets that you can use in your program. File templates range from templates for applications to subclasses of commonly used Cocoa classes. File templates have subcategories, which you can choose from the pop-up menu below the line of buttons. You can display the templates as icons only or as icons and text. Drag file and project templates to the project navigator. Code snippets are short pieces of source code that you can use in your software. To use one, drag it directly into your source code file. Alternatively, you can select a portion of the code from the code information pop-up window and drag that into your file. When you create a code snippet, you can add a completion shortcut, which you can use when editing source code. Type the shortcut and select the completion shortcut from the completion list to add the code snippet to your file. Note that the new code snippet is flagged with the word “User”.
