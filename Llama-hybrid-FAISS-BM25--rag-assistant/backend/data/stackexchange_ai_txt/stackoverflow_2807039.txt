You do not need to call GlobalLock since you passed GPTR to GlobalAlloc. You only need to call GlobalLock when you pass GMEM_MOVEABLE. But, you shouldn't be using GlobalAlloc/GlobalFree, unless the documentation for the API you're passing the memory to says otherwise. Prefer HeapAlloc/HeapFree or just new/delete. GlobalAlloc is an older API intended for compatibility with 16-bit Windows.
