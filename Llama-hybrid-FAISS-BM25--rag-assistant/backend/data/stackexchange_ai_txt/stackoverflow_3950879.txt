User Control Margins

I have created a UserControl that contains an Ellipse and a few lines. I have drag and dropped them to position them how I like, but when I use the control on another page, the margins are relative to that page and not the user control so they are way off. Is there a way to force the margins to be relative to the user control and not he page it's contained in?
