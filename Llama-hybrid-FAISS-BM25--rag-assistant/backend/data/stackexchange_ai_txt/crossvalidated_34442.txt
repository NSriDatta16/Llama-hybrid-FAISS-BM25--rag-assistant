How to control for market return in an (SPSS) OLS?

Please consider the following panel dataset: comp obs industry weekDay ind10 ind15 day3 day4 day5 marketRet tweets stockRet ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1 1 15 3 0 1 1 0 0 0.10 5321 -0.90 1 2 15 4 0 1 0 1 0 1.30 4244 -0.30 1 3 15 5 0 1 0 0 1 0.90 5543 1.32 2 1 10 3 1 0 1 0 0 0.10 789 0.10 2 2 10 4 1 0 0 1 0 1.30 842 0.16 2 3 10 5 1 0 0 0 1 0.90 734 0.00 For a list of companies ( comp ) it describes the number of tweets and the stockreturn ( stockRet ) for a series of days ( obs ) weekDay gives the day of the week ( 1 = monday, 2 = tuesday, ...); this has been extracted in dummies day3 to day5 industry gives the company industry ( 15 = IT, 10 = banking, ...); this has been extracted in dummies ind10 and ind15 The final variable ( marketRet ) gives the average return of the stockmarket that day. Notice that for each day ( obs ), the market return is the same. Question 1: Say I am running an OLS regression with tweets as independent variable and stockRet as dependent. I'm also adding the dummies day3 to day5 and ind10 & ind15 to the model as independent variables. Does the model now include, as they say, "fixed effects for industry and day of week"? Question 2: I have read articles with similar research to mine, and they say they have "added the market return as a control". In SPSS preferably, how do I enter the variable marketRet as a control to the model? Just by adding it as an independent variable? Question 3: What is the difference between fixed effects and control variables? These questions are probably very basic, but I have not been able to find a clear answer to them. For instance, articles mention they "control for market return" but make no mention of how and why they do so. Thus, any help is greatly appreciated :-)
