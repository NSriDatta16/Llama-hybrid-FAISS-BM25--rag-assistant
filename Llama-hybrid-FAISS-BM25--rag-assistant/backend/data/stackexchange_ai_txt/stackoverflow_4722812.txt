Creating a modular and organized javascript heavy website

I'm looking for some general tips on how to keep my Javascript organized and modular. The latest javascript heavy project i've worked on looks like [the following][1] (formatted http://jsfiddle.net/wdkZd/ ) As you can i see i try to namespace my javascript and build quite some seperate functions. Still, when i need to implement features afterwards i can still get lost in my own code sometimes. And i'm getting the idea i can do better on organizing my code. Any general pointers based on what u can see here?
