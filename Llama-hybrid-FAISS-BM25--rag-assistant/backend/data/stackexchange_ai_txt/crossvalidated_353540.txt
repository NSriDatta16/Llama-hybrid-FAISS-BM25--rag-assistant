As per definition the 6-month ahead error is the error on the 6th forecast. On your example: $-2$ (you underestimate of 2 units), which correspond to $-2/8 = -25\%$. Now, you can also have the average error on the next 6 month, which can be computed in various ways (Mean absolute deviation, Mean squared deviation, Mean percent absolute deviation...) to count all the errors with the same sing. The simplest one is the MAD (Mean Absolute Deviation): compute the the average error after taking their absolute value to make them all positive. In your case $AVG(1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 2) = 4/6 = 66.6%$. If you want the MAPE , then compute the error in percentage first then take the mean: $AVG(1/1, 0/3, 1/5, 0/3, 0/4, 2/6) = 25.6\%$. Like me you can prefer to take the percentages relative to the forecast rather than the actuals: $AVG(1/2, 0/3, 1/6, 0/3, 0/4, 2/8) = 15.3\%$ There are may other methods.
