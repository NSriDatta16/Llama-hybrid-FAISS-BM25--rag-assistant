A quick simulation shows that doing this just gives you anti-conservative (rejects the null too often) normal regression Example: set.seed(123) x gives a test stat of 15 in the "normal" case and 122 in the pairwise difference case. You might be interested to know that the linear regression coefficient is the weighted average of the pairwise slope . That is: $$\hat{\beta}_{OLS} = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j \ne i} w_{ij} \frac{Y_i - Y_j}{X_i - X_j} / \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j \ne i} w_{ij} $$ where $w_{ij} = (X_i - X_j)^2$ .
