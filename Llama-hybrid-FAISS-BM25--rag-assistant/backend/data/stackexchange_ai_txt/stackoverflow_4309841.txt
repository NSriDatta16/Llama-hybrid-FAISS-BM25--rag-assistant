Update: Mocha is the best in my opinion. What is the experience with these frameworks? I played with expresso which is pretty cool testing framework which also has test-coverage. It has been created by TJ Holowaychuk who is also the creator of Express.js (insanely fast (and small) server-side JavaScript web development framework built on Node.js and Connect). I recently saw that he also has a cool library called should.js which can be used together with Expresso for a even better testing experience. Obviously, the ability to run in the browser would be a big bonus I don't believe it can run in the browser, but I also don't get why you would want to run it inside the browser? but I'm mainly interested in Node.js. Something with a heavily asynchronous slant would be great. Quote from the expresso: The argument passed to each callback is beforeExit, which is typically used to assert that callbacks have been invoked. You can use beforeExit to test asynchronous functions. TIP: Follow TJ Holowaychuk on GitHub , because he creates very good open-source code.
