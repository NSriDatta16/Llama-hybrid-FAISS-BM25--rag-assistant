Dropped in draggable elements drag and drop to other containers but not itself?

After referenced the JQuery UI Droppable example : Shopping cart. I rewrite it for a test.But got some problem. Suppose that : product container: drag and drop the product into shopping cart container. product 1 ... and shopping cart container: ... dropped products here and others shopping cart container : ... dropped products here And I want the shoppingCart1's products can drag and drop to other shopping cart container but not itselfï¼Œand vice versa.E.g: the problem is: When the products had been dropped in s* hoppingCart1 *, and then I can drag and drop the products in shoppingCart1 to other shopping cart container .But it seems that when I drag and drop the products inside of its own, it also append the products. I mean when I drag the shoppingCart1's product and drop in shoppingCart1 itself,it appended to shoppingCart1 ,too. Thank you very much! part of my code re-write from JQuery UI Droppable :shopping cart exmaple![ doesn't work as my want ] this.igtoMDMovieList = $(' ',{'class':'igtoMDMovieList'}) .appendTo(this.igtoMDMovieListWrapper); this.igtoMDMovieListOL = $(' ',{'class':'igtoMDMovieListOL'}) .html(' Add your items here ') .appendTo(this.igtoMDMovieList) .droppable({ accept:'li', drop: function( event, ui ) { $( " " ) .text( ui.draggable.text() ) .appendTo(obj.igtoMDMovieListOL)//$(this).children() .draggable({ appendTo: "#desktopFrame", helper: "clone" }) } }) .sortable({ items: "li:not(.placeholder)", sort: function() { // gets added unintentionally by droppable interacting with sortable // using connectWithSortable fixes this, but doesn't allow you to customize active/hoverClass options $( this ).removeClass( "ui-state-default" ); } });
