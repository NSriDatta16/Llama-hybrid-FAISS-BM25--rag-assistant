I am not sure that doing any kind of "live" stuff would be OK, considering the Acceptable Usage in Clients part of the documentation (quoting a few sentences) : The second update request should happen between 15-30 minutes later. After that, each update should occur once every 25-30 minutes. And the paragraph after that one is pretty interesting, too : To help maintain a high quality of service, it may be necessary for the update server to ask the client to make less frequent requests. Considering these, I would not do any king of "live" request : I'm afraid google wouldn't quite like it...
