In any case then, do Bayesian Models offer some sort of inherent advantages or disadvantages over non-Bayesian models? Simple answer: no. It's just a different type of thinking. Bayesian modeling just gives you a posterior density for the parameters your estimating. Usually, frequentist models like generalized linear models are simpler to compute but do not provide a posterior distribution because frequentists do not believe the parameters are random, but rather fixed things you have to estimate. Generally, if the sample size is large enough (about 300+ rows of data from my experience), both Bayesian models and frequentist models come out with the same parameter estimates. In simple terms, a frequentist views the data as the random variable, where as the Bayesian views the parameters you're estimating as the random variable. You should review some fundamental ideas about Bayesian statistical analyses before trying to apply them. A good reference that I recommend is Bayesian Ideas and Data Analysis: An Introduction for Scientists and Statisticians . It's a fairly easy read, with math at the Master's graduate level.
