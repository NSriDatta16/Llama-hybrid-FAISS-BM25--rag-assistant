Google App Engine and SQL LIKE

Is there any way to query GAE datastore with filter similar to SQL LIKE statement? For example, if a class has a string field, and I want to find all classes that have some specific keyword in that string, how can I do that? It looks like JDOQL's matches() don't work... Am I missing something? Any comments, links or code fragments are welcome
