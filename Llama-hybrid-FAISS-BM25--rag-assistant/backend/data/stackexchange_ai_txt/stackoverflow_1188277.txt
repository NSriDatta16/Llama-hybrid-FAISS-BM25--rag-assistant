MS CRM 4 - Custom name for entity lookup link

When I have a custom entity Referral, the primary attribute is a refid and this is what shows up in associated views (as the link text that opens Referral form). I need to change this name to something that is generated from entity attributes). Something like: Referral.ToString() { return ref.id + " " + ref.first_name + " " + ref.last_name + " "; } instead of the default ref.id.ToString() -- or however it works. Is this possible via the MS CRM 4? I fear it might not be (having clicked through the gui customizations for a while), but maybe I missed something. If not, what is the most elegant way of doing this? A javascript function would need to be somewhere global (otherwise it would need to be copy+pasted to every form/view that mentions Referral). Also, the javascript function (I assume), would need to do at least one additional XmlFetch on every view. Any suggestions, comments, ideas welcome. I've started modifying the MS CRM at work and I keep hitting issues that I feel have been solved by open source python web frameworks over and over again. Please help a poor soul at work :)
