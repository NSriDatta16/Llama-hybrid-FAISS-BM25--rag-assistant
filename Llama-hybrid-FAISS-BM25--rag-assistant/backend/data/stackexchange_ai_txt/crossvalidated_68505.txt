If you want to test its performance on data you don't have (like a missing month), something like a PRESS statistic (which is a leave-one-out type prediction sum of squares) adapted to the Poisson model's variance function might work okay (you don't need to refit, you can work it out from your GLM fit). In the case of your three April values, you could calculate a predictive residual for each month and just take the root-mean-square (and the average error if you want to look at bias) of the April ones... but it will be a pretty noisy estimate; you'll mostly be chasing noise. But from the second half of your question it sounds to me like you're actually interested in one step ahead predictive performance. In which case, you might back up to (say) one year of data, and then start doing one-step-ahead predictions, re-estimating and adding in new data. You can do something similar with multi-period forecasts.
