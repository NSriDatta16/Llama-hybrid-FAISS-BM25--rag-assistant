There are a lot of papers on this subject. Here are some good resources This doesn't use context sensitivity, but it's a good base to build from http://norvig.com/spell-correct.html This is probably a good and easy to understand view of a more powerful spell checker http://acl.ldc.upenn.edu/acl2004/emnlp/pdf/Cucerzan.pdf From here you can dive deep on the particulars.
