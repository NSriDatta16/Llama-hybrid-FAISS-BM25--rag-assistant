Using copied directories for tags and branches are a serious design flaw in SVN, regardless what the manuals say. It introduces many problems, of which the most serious one is the fact that the whole tagging vs. branching model relies only on convention, but there is really nothing preventing anyone from branching in the "wrong" directory. The second big flaw with the approach is that it encourages giant project structures, since people want to keep their single {trunk,tags,branches} at top level. Now one can happily go and copy (~branch) of only one sub-directory or even file, which also creates a potential big mess. So don't get too tied up with the SVN way to do things, but instead learn and embrace the "right" way to do things, as in Hg or Git. Forget about trunks and branches directories, and set up your project structure in some sane way.
