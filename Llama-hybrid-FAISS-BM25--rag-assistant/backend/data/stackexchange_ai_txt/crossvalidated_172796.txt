Detecting heterogeneity in simple data set

I have a data set with an amount of tests that were done by a group of people for each day over two weeks (no weekends). Basically, I need to know which days differ the most from others. Here is the data set: M T W TR F 48 43 42 40 50 47 49 42 46 51 38 44 47 53 52 41 46 47 40 44 49 47 55 45 49 39 44 36 54 57 42 46 51 49 60 41 37 49 53 54 34 52 49 56 48 45 43 43 57 58 39 51 42 48 45 43 37 48 45 45 43 35 46 39 46 40 34 40 36 40 36 40 34 37 41 39 36 43 40 38 42 50 34 40 48 36 30 36 35 46 37 51 38 33 44 44 48 40 42 46 43 44 45 44 48 41 41 45 39 55 43 40 47 40 54 45 43 48 40 54 40 41 46 43 51 43 42 44 43 43 What I have done is a pairwise test comparing each day to the others. For examples for Mondays vs. Tuesdays, for the first value I calculated 48 - 43, for the second value I calculated 47 - 49 and so on. Then I took the average of all of those values, which resulted in this: Mon vs Tue -2.8 Mon vs Wed -3.2 Mon vs Thurs -3.5 Mon vs Fri -8.1 Tues Vs Mon 2.8 Tue Vs Wed -0.4 Tue Vs Thur -0.6 Tue Vs Fri -5.3 Wed Vs Mon 3.2 Wed Vs Tue 0.4 Wed Vs Thur -0.2 Wed Vs Fri -4.9 Thur Vs Mon 3.5 Thurs Vs Tue 0.6 Thur Vs Wed 0.2 Thur Vs Fri -4.6 Fri Vs Mon 8.1 Fri Vs Tue 5.3 Fri Vs Wed 4.9 Fri Vs Thurs 4.6 I created a graph showing the results: From the graph, it looks like Fridays is an 'off day' here. But my analysis does not account for variance or standard deviation. I am not very confident in finding the day with the most heterogeneity.
