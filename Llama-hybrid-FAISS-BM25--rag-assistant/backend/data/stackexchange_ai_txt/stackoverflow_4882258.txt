If you can bring yourself to run this analysis using a Windows-platform application, save yourself a lot of time and trouble, and spend $200 on Enterprise Architect by Sparx Systems (I have no affiliation with this company, just a satisfied customer). (Note: this should not be confused with Microsoft's own "Enterprise Architect" bundle for Visual Studio.) EA can reverse-engineer a number of languages, including C++, C, Java, and Python, generating some very nice UML class diagrams. (EA comes in a number of different packages, Desktop is the cheapest but you have to by Professional, the 2nd cheapest, to get the code engineering feature included.) I also like the integration between the generated class diagrams and sequence diagramming, where you can drag a line between object lifelines and a menu of defined methods is presented to you based on the class definition of the target object. At my former consulting business, we used this tool quite a bit to develop system architectural proposals which we then included as part of our project bid (just copy/paste the diagram into a Word doc). It wont take long to make back your $200.
