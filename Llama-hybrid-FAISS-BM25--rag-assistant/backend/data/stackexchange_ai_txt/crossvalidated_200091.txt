Multiple Regression Assumptions

This may seem like a basic question, but I'm verifying the assumptions for a multiple regression and have some trouble wrapping my head around homoscedasticity. I have a few questions listed below: 1) Are the assumptions of linearity and homoscedasticity related? 2) Is the assumption of normality also related to linearity and homoscedasticity? In other words, can you still have a linear relationship between variables even though the data is skewed? Can you still have the assumption of homoscedasticity even though the data is skewed? 3) When do cook's distance and leverage values come in handy? 4) If all variables should be normally distributed in a multiple regression, how would you transform data that includes a true 0. For example, number of minutes exercised per week (which is strongly skewed in the positive direction as most people report not exercising)
