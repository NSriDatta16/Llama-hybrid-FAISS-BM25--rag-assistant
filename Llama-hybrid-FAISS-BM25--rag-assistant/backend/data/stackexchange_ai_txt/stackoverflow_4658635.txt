IsMouseOver property is not updated more than once for a Thumb

I have following grid which is resizable through Thumb: Other thumbs are omitted for the sake of brevity. The drag through the thumb is only possible for the for the first time only. After that the thumb is not being shown at all. Upon Snooping i found that thumb's sMouseOver property is not being updated after the first time. Can anyone suggest what may be the possible problem?
