I do think there is something to be said for just excluding the outliers. A regression line is supposed to summarise the data. Because of leverage you can have a situation where 1% of your data points affects the slope by 50%. It's only dangerous from a moral and scientific point of view if you don't tell anybody that you excluded the outliers. As long as you point them out you can say: "This regression line fits pretty well for most of the data. 1% of the time a value will come along that doesn't fit this trend, but hey, it's a crazy world, no system is perfect"
