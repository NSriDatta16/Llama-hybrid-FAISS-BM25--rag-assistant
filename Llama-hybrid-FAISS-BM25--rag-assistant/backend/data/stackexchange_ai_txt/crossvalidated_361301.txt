Do you need to quantitatively (and precisely) calculate correlation, or do you just want a way to be able to visualize? I use an "Outlier Heat Map" to identify across many time series the concentration of outliers by week of the year. I can see a) Any week of year that has a higher concentration of outliers across years (a column that is darker blue) and/or b) Identify any one week that has more outliers. Not sure the image is rendering correctly: https://github.com/chrisumphlett/Shared/blob/master/stackexchange/DATAMGMT_OutlierMap.png
