Seems like you will be inadvertently measuring the randomness (variation in accuracy) of your "expected time" estimation system. If your work load can stomach it, an ideal solution would be to assign the same actual work task to pairs of agents, one agent using treatment-A, the other using treatment-B. This removes the "expected time" aspect of the system entirely; allowing direct comparison between the two treatment systems. ALSO, it provides an opportunity to compare the results (not just the time-taken to complete the task). Do the results obtained by the two agents match? If not, then there is some sort of error rate difference that can be investigated too. (One "treatment" may make it faster, but what if it also increases error rate?)
