Is it possible to test if a parameter is positive?

Say I'm doing 1D linear regression. How can I test the hypothesis that the slope is positive? I have mostly been doing Bayesian analysis where this could be done easily by computing the proportion of marginal posterior density larger than 0. However, I'm not even sure where to start if using frequentist framework.
