Is Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) outdated?

I recently went through some litterature about knowledge-enhanced language models and found connections with the Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) task. However, I couldn't find papers more recent than 2020 on this topic. Therefore, I wonder whether this task is now outdated and if so, is there a known reason for that like it has been replaced by a more adapted task?
