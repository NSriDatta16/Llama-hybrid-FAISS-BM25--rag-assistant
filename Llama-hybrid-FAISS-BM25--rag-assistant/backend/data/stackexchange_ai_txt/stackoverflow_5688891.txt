Creating ContextMenu in XAML, and adding it to an Item in Code?

I'm using the ContextMenu control from the Silverlight Toolkit, and I'd like to define the contextmenu in xaml, and "add it" to a control that I create in code. I'm using the Telerik Outlook Radbar, that contains the Telerik RadTreeView. I'm currently creating the RadTreeView in code via a Converter class, but I'd like each treeviewitem to have a right-click menu. Is there a way to define the ContextMenu as a DataTemplate, and set the RadTreeView to use that? This is what I have, but it doesn't work as I expect (I get the default silverlight right-click menu) XAML CS var t = new RadTreeView(); t.IsLineEnabled = true; t.IsDragDropEnabled = true; t.ItemTemplate = (DataTemplate) MailboxView.MailboxResources["TreeViewItemTemplate"];
