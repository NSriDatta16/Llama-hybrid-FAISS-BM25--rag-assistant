How to Handle Non-Multinormality in the Context of Exploratory Factor Analysis for Logistic Regression

I'm trying to follow the book A Step-by-Step Guide to Exploratory Factor Analysis with R and Rstudio , by Marley W. Watkins, and apply the principles in the book to a real-world data set. Ultimately, my goal is to perform a logistic regression, but my variables are highly correlated; so although the model performs well, the coefficients are not easily interpreted. Interpretability is crucial to this project, hence the EFA. My data set has $13$ variables with $4452$ observations each. I have performed transformations $(x_{\text{new}}=\ln(x-\min(x)+1))$ on each variable so that they are each roughly normal. At least, skew and kurtosis are under control. However, the mardia test from R's psych package yields a multinormal distribution skewness of $26.64$ and kurtosis of $237.03$ . These are insanely out-of-bounds for being able to conclude that the joint distribution is multinormal, since the current consensus is a maximum of $2$ for skew and $7$ for kurtosis. The EFA assumptions require multinormality in order to be valid. Unfortunately, the book is a bit short (read that - completely silent) on remedies for fixing non-multinormality. What are your recommendations?
