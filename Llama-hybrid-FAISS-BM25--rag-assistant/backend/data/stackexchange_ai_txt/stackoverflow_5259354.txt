Problem solved. The problem was with another module which I was using. This module was overriding SendFriend Model class ( Mage_Sendfriend_Model_Sendfriend ). My problem will be helpful to those who fall on similar type of situation. When the core code seems to be working well or when you haven't changed any core code.. even then you are getting problem in Magento default functionality. The reason can be some local or community module overriding the core classes.
