I have found a solution that seems to work! If I add a channelUrl option to FB.init, I can log in. I got a warning from Opera saying the following: Warning http://www.yourdomain.com/channel.html?fb_xd_fragment A page on the public Internet requests data from your private intranet. For security reasons, automatic access is blocked, but you may choose to continue. LINK: Continue LINK: Always continue when data is requested from this server on my private intranet I clicked the link "Continue" and after that it worked (during this session). The original FB.init line looked like this (appId and some other stuff has been replaced in this example): // Facebook init FB.init({ appId: '123456789', status: true, cookie: true, xfbml: true }); After I had added the channelUrl it looked like this: // Facebook init FB.init({ appId: '123456789', status: true, cookie: true, xfbml: true, channelUrl: "http://www.yourdomain.com/channel.html" }); The file "channel.html" is a simple file that contains just this line of code: Create it and put it on your server at the location you have specified in the channelUrl. The server root is a good place. The next step is figuring out how to get rid of the Opera warning, if it's possible at all? Good luck! /Thomas Kahn
