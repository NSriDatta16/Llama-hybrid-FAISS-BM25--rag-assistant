A task is a group of components that work coherently together to fulfill a purpose for the user (not necessarily a very specific purpose, but a purpose nonetheless). It's what the user sees as an application. A music player exists to allow the user to manage and play songs. It may include various activities that display album/artist/song metadata, control playback, organize playlists, etc. It may also include services that implement the playback and that watch for new songs. The user doesn't know what an activity and a service are; he or she only knows that this series of screens lets him or her manage and play songs. The activities in a task don't need to belong to the same 'application' from a development standpoint. If the music player task allows users to link an image to a song, then it might launch an image gallery activity or the camera activity. Since the new activity is still working toward the purpose of managing songs, it's still part of the same task. On the other hand, if the user completely breaks out of the task's purpose, it might be time to start a different task. For example, if you launch a web browser to view the artist's website, the user is now doing something different. The user probably doesn't associate web browsing with managing and playing songs, so this should probably be a different task.
