Count average from another MySQL table

I have 2 tables, one is supplier and one is supplier_feedback - how can I calculate the average rating for each supplier? I currently have this: SELECT s.premium, s.supplier_id, s.name, s.phone, s.website, s.price_low, s.price_high, s.address1, s.address2, s.town, s.county, s.postcode, (SUM( f.rating ) / ( COUNT( f.rating ) -1 )) AS rate, GROUP_CONCAT( REPLACE( t.name, ' ', ',' ) SEPARATOR ',' ) AS tags FROM suppliers AS s JOIN suppliers_to_tags AS st ON st.supplier_id = s.supplier_id JOIN supplier_tags AS t ON t.tag_id = st.tag_id JOIN supplier_feedback AS f ON s.supplier_id = f.supplier_id GROUP BY s.supplier_id HAVING tags LIKE '%HI%' ORDER BY s.premium DESC LIMIT 0 , 30 But I get very strange results, which definitely aren't correct. The supplier_feedback table will have many records, but the first record must be discounted for various reasons.
