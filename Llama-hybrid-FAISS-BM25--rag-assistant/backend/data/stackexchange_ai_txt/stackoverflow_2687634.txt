C#: Drag & Drop with right mouse button

I'd like to do Drag & Drop with the right mouse button instead with the left one. However calling DragDrop.DoDragDrop() from MouseRightButtonDown instead of MouseLeftButtonDown doesn't do the job - DragDrop.DoDragDrop looks for mouse movements while holding down the left mouse button. Any idea how to realise Drag & Drop using the right mouse button? Thanks for any hint!
