Mercury Quick Test Pro and Virtual machines: Works from one client machine but not another

I have a virtual machine (VMware) with Mercury Quick Test Professional 9.2 installed. I have a script to test an application, written in VB.NET using the Infragistics library. If I access this virtual machine using my laptop (using Remote Desktop), everything works fine, the script completes without a problem. My laptop runs XP, with Windows Classic theme. If I access this virtual machine using another machine (using Remote Desktop), the script starts fine, but stops halfway through, without no error message from QTP, nothing. This machine runs XP, with Windows Classic theme. One difference between the two setups is the size of the screen, the laptop is 1920x1280, other machine 1280x1024. The step where the script stops involves checking a checkbox within an UltraWinGrid. The checkbox itself is displayed, is on the screen in both cases. Has anyone had this problem before, or have any idea why the behaviour is different between the two machines? Thanks.
