The conventions that you use for you application would depend on 1) What type of application it is. 2) What operating system you are using. Linux? Windows? They both have different conventions. What I would suggest is look at other command line interfaces for other commands on your system, paying special attention to the parameters passed. Having incorrect parameters should give the user solution directed error message. An easy to find help screen can aid in usability as well. Without know what exactly your application will do, it's hard to give specific examples.
