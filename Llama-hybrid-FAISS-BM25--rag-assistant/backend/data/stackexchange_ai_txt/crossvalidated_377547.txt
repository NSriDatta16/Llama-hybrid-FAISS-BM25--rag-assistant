The mapping that I know is from a n x m space to a one-dimensional space. $$\begin{array}{c|ccccc} & d_{11} & d_{12} & \cdots &d_{1n} \\ \hline d_{21} & d_{11} + d_{21} & d_{12} + d_{21} & \cdots & d_{1n} + d_{21}\\ d_{22} & d_{11} + d_{21} & d_{12} + d_{22} & \cdots & d_{1n} + d_{22}\\ \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & & \vdots \\ d_{2m} & d_{11} + d_{21} & d_{12} + d_{2m} & \cdots & d_{1n} + d_{2m}\\ \end{array} $$ The $\text{$P($sum $2$ rolls $= k)$}$ are not all the same. Here the trick for the double dice roll is that some of the values $k$ may occur in multiple ways and you have to collect/count all the possible cases $d_{1i}+d_{2j}=k$ . This is probably one of the reasons why this example is so prevalent. It is a simple (and recognizable and intuitive) exercise of summing multiple pathways that lead to a single result (e.g. you get the sum equal to 4 when you roll 1+3, 2+2 and 3+1). I do not think that the two dice rolls exercise/example is used to particularly demonstrate the pyramid shape (which is indeed not general for all types of dice rolls), but more like showing a specific case of a convolution and practicing/showing how to compute it ( Why is the sum of two random variables a convolution? ) A similar problem (as in one that would require the student to make a table matching every case in the sample space with events) is Bertrand's box paradox
