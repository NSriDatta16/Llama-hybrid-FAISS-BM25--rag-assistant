If available, use the jsonpCallback parameter in the call to $.ajax like: jsonpCallback: "cbfunc", Its description, from the jQuery API docs reads: Specify the callback function name for a jsonp request. This value will be used instead of the random name automatically generated by jQuery. The docs later go on to say: It is preferable to let jQuery generate a unique name as it'll make it easier to manage the requests and provide callbacks and error handling. You may want to specify the callback when you want to enable better browser caching of GET requests. However it is not advised to make use of this "preferable" behaviour when making use of YQL. Precisely why that approach is not ideal might make this answer far too verbose, so here is a link (from the YQL blog) detailing the problems with jQuery's preferred approach, making use of jsonpCallback and so on: Avoiding rate limits and getting banned in YQL and Pipes: Caching is your friend
