Is there a way to optimise this program in Haskell?

I am doing project euler question 224 . And whipped up this list comprehension in Haskell: prob39 = length [ d | d I compiled it with GHC and it has been running with above average kernel priority for over an hour without returning a result. What can I do to optimise this solution? It seems I am getting better at finding brute force solutions in a naive manner. Is there anything I can do about this? EDIT: I am also unclear about the definition of 'integral length', does this just mean the side length has a magnitude which falls in the positive set of integers, i.e: 1,2,3,4,5... ?
