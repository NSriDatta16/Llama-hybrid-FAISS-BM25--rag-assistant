One problem is that you are relying far too much on significance tests and not showing us all the effect sizes. You say that in separate analysis by levels of X, the X=1 test was not significant while the X=0 test was. But the X=0 group is 59 times bigger than the X=1 group. Your interaction says that the effect of M is smaller in X=1 than X=0. That is not inconsistent with the above, since p values are affected by sample size. But looking at overall main effects (as you do, in your second paragraph) is not sensible. Those main effects are the effect when the other variable is 0. The OR for M is 5 when X = 0. It is much lower when X = 1. In a situation like this, where all the variables are dichotomous, a good way to see what is going on is to make a table with 4 rows with the conditions for X and M, and then the proportion with Y for each row. EDIT in response to comment: This is not what I meant, sorry for not being clearer. What I had in mind was something like this: X M P(Y = 1) 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 Since you are doing logistic regressions, I'm assuming that you are interested in the proportion of Y that are 1. EDIT #2 Looking at your new table, when X = 1. M makes almost no difference. When X = 0, M makes a big difference. Similarly, when M = 1, X makes little difference, but when M = 0, X makes a huge difference. That's an interaction, which is what you found.
