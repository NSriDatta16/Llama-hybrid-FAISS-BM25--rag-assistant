Why is a Bayesian not allowed to look at the residuals?

In the article "Discussion: Should Ecologists Become Bayesians?" Brian Dennis gives a surprisingly balanced and positive view of Bayesian statistics when his aim seems to be to warn people about it. However, in one paragraph, without any citations or justifications, he says: Bayesians, you see, are not allowed to look at their residuals. It violates the likelihood principle to judge an outcome by how extreme it is under a model. To a Bayesian, there are no bad models, just bad beliefs. Why would a Bayesian not be allowed to look at the residuals? What would be the appropriate citation for this (i.e. who is he quoting)? Dennis, B. Discussion: Should Ecologists Become Bayesians?
