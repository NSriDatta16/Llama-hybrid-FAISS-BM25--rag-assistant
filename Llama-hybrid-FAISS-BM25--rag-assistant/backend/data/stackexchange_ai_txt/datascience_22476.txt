Is feature scaling necessary in reinforcement learning for the agent to learn successfully?

I often have trouble deciding how to tweak my input data for the agent. I am changing my data so that values in the hundreds get changed to a value between -1 and 1, and values that are originally small get changed the same ratio. However, my agents often aren't successful. Could the numeric range of the input data be a cause for the inability to learn?
