Why Liblinear performs drastically better than libsvm linear kernel?

l have a dataset of dim=(200,2000) 200 examples and 2000 features. l have 10 classes. l used sklearn for both cases : svm.svc(kernel=linear) LinearSVC() However LinearSVC() performs drastically better than svm with linear kernel. 60% against 23%. l'm supposed to get the same or comparable results since they are fed with same parameters and data. What's wrong ? Thank you
