App Engine already does compress the content, if the client supports it. If the client sends HTTP headers with the request indicating that the client can accept compressed (gzipped) content, App Engine compresses the response data automatically and attaches the appropriate response headers. It uses both the Accept-Encoding and User-Agent request headers to determine if the client can reliably receive compressed responses. Custom clients can force content to be compressed by specifying both Accept-Encoding and User-Agent headers with a value of "gzip".
