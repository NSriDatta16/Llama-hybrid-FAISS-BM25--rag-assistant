Read the compiler error messages: You're missing a '#' from #include, for starters. In the your destructor, you don't need to specify vector :: - you are deriving from the vector, so call its methods without qualification, e.g. size() etc. The vector will clean up its own storage so you don't need to call pop_back() on it. Try for (iterator i = begin(); i != end; ++i) delete *i; Instead of doing this manually, you cold hold a smart pointer such as shared_ptr in your vector, the elements would then be deleted for you without needing a derived class. There are differing opinions on whether deriving from standard library containers is a good idea, a search here will point you to several discussions on the issue.
