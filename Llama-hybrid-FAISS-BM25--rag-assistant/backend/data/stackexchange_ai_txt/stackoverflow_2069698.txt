You can emulate goto's functionality with exceptions: try: # blah, blah ... # raise MyFunkyException as soon as you want out except MyFunkyException: pass Disclaimer: I only mean to bring to your attention the possibility of doing things this way, while in no way do I endorse it as reasonable under normal circumstances. As I mentioned in a comment on the question, structuring code so as to avoid Byzantine conditionals in the first place is preferable by far. :-)
