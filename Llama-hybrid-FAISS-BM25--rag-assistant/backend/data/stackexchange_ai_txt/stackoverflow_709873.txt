Windows Error Reporting is part of Microsoft's Winqual service. Sign up at the Winqual web site. Instead of just using a username/password to log in, you'll need to purchase an SSL certificate to identify yourself and your organization. This costs $99 if you only need the cert for identification purposes. If you also want to use it to sign code, it's $499. Run the Microsoft Product Feedback Mapping Tool (available from the Winqual site) on a local copy of your application, and submit the results to the Winqual web site. This registers your application with Winqual. From this point forward, any errors reported via Windows Error Reporting against your submitted applications are available to you if you log in to Winqual.
