This is a great problem. Rain affects the image through a localized lensing effect, so I'd partition the image into patches big enough to capture a raindrop, then run a classifier on each patch. Training data is not an issue since you say you have video. I'm not sure how to capture this lensing effect, but my intuition would be to use a 2D FFT or wavelet decomposition to extract the raw features your CNN will run on top off. If this does not work well enough, I suggest asking about what kind of features to use to detect lensing on physics.SE.
