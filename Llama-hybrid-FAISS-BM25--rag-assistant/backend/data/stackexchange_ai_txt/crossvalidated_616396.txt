You may wish to take a look at the spatial statistics literature where different classes of massively scalable Gaussian processes have witnessed significant development with the number of space or space-time coordinates (inputs into the Gaussian processes) into several millions. The idea is not to rely solely upon computations but build different classes of Gaussian processes that can scale up to tens of millions of locations. Most of these methods are agnostic to any specific algorithm and can be adapted to full inference using MCMC or faster approximate Bayesian algorithms such as Variational Bayes or INLA. Some recent pointers are available here: Sparsity-inducing Gaussian processes including Nearest Neighbor Gaussian Processes (NNGPs) based upon an approximation due to Vecchia (arranged chronologically): Vecchia's original paper https://doi.org/10.1111%2Fj.2517-6161.1988.tb01729.x While the paper was published in 1988, interest in this approach was rather lukewarm until the following NNGP paper was published in 2016: https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.2015.1044091 (accompanying R package: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spNNGP/index.html ) For dynamic NNGP with space-time inputs (where neighbors of inputs are estimated rather than fixed): https://doi.org/10.1214/16-AOAS931 https://doi.org/10.1080/10618600.2018.1537924 (focusing on efficient Bayesian algorithms for NNGP models) https://doi.org/10.1214%2F19-STS755 (accompanying R package: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GPvecchia/index.html ) Meshed Gaussian processes https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.2020.1833889 (accompanying R package: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/meshed/index.html ) Apart from this, there is ExaGeoStat here: https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/stsds/exageostat Here is some recent work on Variational NNGPs: https://proceedings.mlr.press/v162/wu22h/wu22h.pdf In terms of pure scalability, these approaches have been applied to data sets with number of inputs exceeding millions.
