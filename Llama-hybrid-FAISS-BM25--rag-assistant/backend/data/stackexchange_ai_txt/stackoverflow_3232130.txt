Multiple Cell Editing within a Grid

So I'm looking for a way to allow a user to enter numbers and dates into a grid of cells in bulk. What would be ideal is if they could simply highlight/select a range of cells, type "42" or "12/31/2010", and move on and then "42" or "12/31/2010" would exist in every cell. This is kinda like entering data into Excel that we're trying to mimic but we don't need a true spreadsheet-like control here. So are there any third-party solutions that do this? As far as I can tell, Telerik, Infragistics, and all of the other usual third-party component vendors don't provide such a product.
