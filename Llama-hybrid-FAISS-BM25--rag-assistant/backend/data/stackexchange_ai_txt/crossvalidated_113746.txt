Are Auto-Associative Regression Trees Distinct from Auto-Regressive Trees?

After some reading in the field I was confused as to whether these two models are distinct or really the same. I'm just looking for a simple yes/no with a brief explanation. Note that Auto-Associative is a term used mostly in the context of Neural Networks, only rarely in the context of decision or regression trees.
