@MaxG and @Conjugate-Prior have both put forward what I consider to be good answers. I will add a few more small thoughts. First, there is no 'bright line' between small-n and large-n. That is to say, if you want to be hyper-technical, you should always be using the t-distribution. However, around N=100, the t-distribution becomes virtually indistinguishable from the normal. At that point it no longer makes a difference which you use. Some people will say this at N=50; that's fine with me, since this is just a judgment call and there is no bright line. I suppose if 'significance' is all that's important to you, and it is hanging on whether you use the t-distribution or the normal, then that should tell you something. Although I don't know anything about the class you are going to teach, I want to second @MaxG's note about using mathematical precision. In practice, it often makes students anxious and less able to grasp the point you are trying to make. This depends on your students, of course, and it's sad, I suppose, but it's still often true. I have taught introductory classes with highly math-phobic students; I always try to explain things as conceptually as possible. With that in mind, here's the way I typically explain it: The problem with the population variance formula is that it's biased (note that the reason for this is given by @Conjugate-Prior). Specifically, it yields estimates that, on average, are too small. However, the degree of bias diminishes as your sample size increases. So we need a way to compensate for that. Dividing the average squared deviation by N-1, instead of by N, yields a larger value. Because, for any division problem, if the numerator is held constant, the quotient increases as the denominator decreases. Moreover, the amount of the adjustment in the estimated variance diminishes as the sample size goes up. So this approach meets our criteria. (I make clear that this is not the 'real' answer in the mathematical sense, but that I explain it this way so that it's easier to understand. Furthermore, I illustrate this with a simulation of samples drawn from a population using the population and sample formulas, and also by working a couple of division problems and variance estimation problems. Even innumerate students can get it when done this way.) For your third question, @whuber's comment to @MaxG's answer is excellent. Best of luck with your class.
