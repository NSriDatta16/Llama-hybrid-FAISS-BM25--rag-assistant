AVL trees are intended for in-memory use, where random access is relatively cheap. B-trees are better suited for disk-backed storage, because they group a larger number of keys into each node to minimize the number of seeks required by a read or write operation. (This is why B-trees are often used in file systems and databases, such as SQLite .)
