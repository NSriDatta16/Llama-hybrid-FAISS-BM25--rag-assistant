Upstart or Cron for neverending python background process in Ubuntu?

I have a simple little mail queue in Python that I want to run as a neverending background process. I'm on Ubuntu 10.04 and started down the cron route but have been reading some encouragement for upstart. I can't get either to work very well or at all. Any advice?
