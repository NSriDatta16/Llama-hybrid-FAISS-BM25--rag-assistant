json characters are nothing special when it comes down to storage, chars such as { , } , [ , ] , ' , a-z , 0-9 .... are really nothing special and can be stored as text. the first problem your going to have is this { profile_id: 22, username: 'Robert', password: 'skhgeeht893htgn34ythg9er' } that stored in a database is not that simple to update unless you had your own proceedure and developed a jsondecode for mysql UPDATE users SET JSON(user_data,'username') = 'New User'; So as you cant do that you would Have to first SELECT the json, Decode it, change it, update it, so in theory you might as well spend more time constructing a suitable database structure! I do use json to store data but only Meta Data, data that dont get updated often, not related to the user specific.. example if a user adds a post, and in that post he adds images ill parse the images and create thumbs and then use the thumb urls in a json format.
