Why does Create GUID display different GUID parts with different capitalization?

Visual Studio is shipped with a Create GUID tool that is used for generating GUIDs. Now here's a GUID it generated for me: {7A09BF85-9E98-44ea-9AB5-A13953E88C3D} each of the 4 GUID parts contains both letters and digits. Why does the third part contain only lowercase letters and other only upcase letters? Is there any sence behind that?
