Even though @hxd1011 already explained some important things in his answer, I would like answer the second part: What if there is no validation set? There are methods trying to find the optimal stopping point based solely on the training error. One example is the Optimal Approximation Algorithm by Yinyin Liu and Janusz Starzyk. For details see the article Optimized Approximation Algorithm in Neural Networks Without Overfitting ( http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4471901/ ).
