Rather inelegant hack around objdump and dd : IN_F=/bin/echo OUT_F=./tmp1.bin SECTION=.text objdump -h $IN_F | grep $SECTION | awk '{print "dd if='$IN_F' of='$OUT_F' bs=1 count=$[0x" $3 "] skip=$[0x" $6 "]"}' | bash The objdump -h produces predictable output which contains section offset in the elf file. I made the awk to generate a dd command for the shell, since dd doesn't support hexadecimal numbers. And fed the command to shell. In past I did all that manually, without making any scripts, since it is rarely needed.
