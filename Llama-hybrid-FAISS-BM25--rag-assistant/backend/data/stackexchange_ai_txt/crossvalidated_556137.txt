This is the logistic regression model, where the log-odds are posited to change as a linear function of some predictors. $$ \log\bigg( \dfrac{p}{1-p} \bigg) = X\beta $$ $X\beta$ is the linear combination. You denote it as $w_1 x_1 +w_2 x_2 +w_3 x_3 $ . A more traditional way to write it would use $\beta$ as the symbol for coefficients and would involve an intercept, so more like: $$X\beta = \beta_0 +\beta1x_1 + \beta_2x_2+\beta_3x_3$$ In order to solve for $p$ , we must do some algebra. $$ \log\bigg( \dfrac{p}{1-p} \bigg) = X\beta\implies\\ \dfrac{p}{1-p} = \exp(X\beta)\implies\\ p = (1 - p) \exp(X\beta)\implies\\ p = \exp(X\beta) - p \exp(X\beta)\implies\\ p+p\exp(X\beta) = \exp(X\beta)\implies\\ p(1 + \exp(X\beta)) = \exp(X\beta)\implies\\ p = \dfrac{\exp(X\beta)}{1 + \exp(X\beta)\implies}\\ p = \bigg( \dfrac{1 + \exp(X\beta)}{\exp(X\beta)} \bigg)^{-1}\implies\\ p =\bigg( \dfrac{1}{\exp(X\beta)} + 1 \bigg)^{-1}\implies\\ p =\bigg( \exp(-X\beta) + 1 \bigg)^{-1}\implies\\ p = \dfrac{1}{1 + \exp(-X\beta)} $$
