Microsoft Anti-Cross Site Scripting Library

I'm evaluating the Microsoft Anti-Cross Site Scripting Library (AntiXSS V3) I have to say it seems to me that apart from providing a more comprehensive white list of acceptable characters, it's not really bringing anything to the party that a diligent programmer who encoded all his user/agent modifiable output wouldn't be doing anyway. Am I missing a trick?
