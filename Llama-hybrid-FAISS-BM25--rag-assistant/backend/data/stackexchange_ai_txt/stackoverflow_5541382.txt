threading.py._release_save & socket.py.accept cpu time

I'm creating an app of which I like to limit its resource footprint as much as possible. I noticed my app is consuming by average 4% cpu usage on a low load and although that doesn't necessarily mean a bad thing, I was wondering where exactly this comes from. I started to use a profiling software (yappi) and while all threads not seem to spend much time there are 2 exceptions: name #n tsub ttot tavg Thread 1402.. ../lib/python2.6/socket.py.accept:19 340 678.6799.. ..bmit_listene 1402.. ..n2.6/threading.py._release_save:21 5032 932.8961.. Are these methods/classes known to be "resource intensive"? Do you have any performance improving tips related to these? Thanks, Jay
