It's a node cycles coverage problem. It can be solved as Maximum matchings in bipartite graphs . In short: Split every node in two, each in one partition of a graph, so that all edges go from partition P1 to partition P2. In your sample, nodes A and D will turn into nodes A1, D1 in partition P1 and A2, D2 in P2. Edge A-D will turn into A1-D2, and D-A - to D1-A2. Then find a maximum matching, some algorithms exist. Then merge the nodes back, and you got a cycle coverage.
