Assessing model prediction performance using tolerance interval coverage

I am trying to assess a model's prediction performance, and one metric I look at is the percentage of new observations that fall within the 95% tolerance interval, and see whether or not it is actually close to 95%. If the percentage of new observations that fall in the tolerance interval is much lower than 95%, could I conclude based on this metric, the model has poor prediction? Is the method I described above widely used? If you know of any references, please list a few. Please note: I look at other metrics as well, but I want to verify whether or not I can draw such a conclusion using this metric. I am not looking for other suggestions for assessing model prediction performance.
