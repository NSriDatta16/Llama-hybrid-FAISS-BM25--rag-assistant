Eta is about the proportion of variance explained. If you have an ordinal outcome, you don't have a variance, so I'd say no. Here's some more explanation. Variance is about how different the scores are. So: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 has a small difference , hence a large variance. 1, 101, 201 has larger differences, hence larger variance. 1, 2, 10001 has even larger differences, and so the variance is even larger. But in an ordinal measure, we don't know about differences - all we know about is the order, so for each of those variables, they go in the order 1, 2, 3. The classic example is position in a race - people came first, second, third, all we know about the winner is that they were ahead of whoever came second. Where they 0.1 seconds ahead, or 3 hours ahead. We don't know. So the times could be: 10, 11, 12 Or 10, 100, 101 Or 10, 1000, 1001. We don't have knowledge of differences, so we don't have variance, so we can't have eta-squared. You should (possibly) use some form of ordinal logistic regression, then you have options for effect sizes based on likelihood ratios, and/or classification probabilities.
