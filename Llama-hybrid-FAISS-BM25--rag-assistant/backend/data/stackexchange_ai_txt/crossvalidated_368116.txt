The intuition for the variance is best understood in geometric terms, by likening the variance to a geometric analogy. With this analogy, the intuition of the additive nature of the variance operator goes back to Pythagoras Theorem . The natural scale for measuring variability is the standard deviation, which is a scale-preserving measure of variability. When summing independent random variables, this measure operates effectively like a vector norm in Euclidean space, with the individual dimensions being the standard deviations of the individual random variables. The variance operator operates like a squared-norm, and so it has the additive property of the Pythagoras theorem. Hence, intuitively, the square-root law in an IID model arises from the geometric properties of vectors composed of orthogonal parts. To see this more clearly, note that moment relations for independent random variables can be represented using orthogonal vectors in Euclidean space. If $Y_1,...,Y_n$ are orthogonal vectors in Euclidean space then from Pythagoras theorem, the squared-norm obeys the following property: $$||\dot{Y}||^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n ||Y_i||^2.$$ (And of course, it is also notable that this can be extended even to correlated random variables, in which case the squared-norm of their sum becomes a more general quadratic form of the vectors.) Hence, taking the "sample mean" (in this case an average of orthogonal vectors) for vectors with a common length $||Y|| = ||Y_i||$ , gives: $$||\bar{Y}||^2 = \frac{1}{n^2} \sum_{i=1}^n ||Y_i||^2 = \frac{1}{n} ||Y||^2.$$ If each vector has the same norm (which is analogous to the common variance in the IID model) then the square-root law $||\bar{Y}|| = ||Y||/\sqrt{n}$ holds geometrically from the additive nature of the squared-norm.
