Prediction model approach for small data samples with correlated features

I have the following prediction problem- Train data: A person's personality traits(around 50 correlated features) and his/her GPA in a course(related to HR/Management) example- Given the test sample with the the candidates personality traits, I have to predict the person's gpa if he would take the course. The issues I am facing with the data set are - No. of sample is small= 20-30 No of features is small=50 Some features have strong correlation such as extraversion and self-expression Could someone guide me on What models will be desirable Should I go for PCA or feature selection Do I apply LOOCV for better performance?
