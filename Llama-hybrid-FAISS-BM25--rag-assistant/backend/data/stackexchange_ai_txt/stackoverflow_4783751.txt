As I understand it, this is your problem when using "Meg Meg"... - Your code identifies an exact match with "Meg Meg" - Your code also identifies a partial match with "Megan Fox" - You don't want the partial matches to be included if you get an exact match The issue here is that no single record in the return set 'knows' about the other records. To know that you do Not want to include the partial match, you must have already completed a full check for the exact match. There appear to be two ways of doing that to me... 1) Sequential but seperate queries... Have your client run a query for exact matches. If no records are returned, run a query for partial matches on first AND last name. If no records are returned, run a query for partial matches on first OR last name. etc, etc. 2. Run one query where you specify the type of match Add a field to your query that is something like this... CASE WHEN (users.firstname = 'Meg' AND users.lastname='Meg') THEN 1 WHEN (users.firstname LIKE 'Meg%' AND users.lastname LIKE 'Meg%') THEN 2 WHEN (users.firstname LIKE 'Meg%' OR users.lastname LIKE 'Meg%') THEN 3 END AS 'match_type' Then also add it to the ORDER BY clause, to make full matches at the top, etc, etc. Your client can then see how many of each match type were generated and choose to discard/ignore the matches that are not relevant.
