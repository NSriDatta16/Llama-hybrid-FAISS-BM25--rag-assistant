Is it possible to meta-analyze means on different scales?

I have study-level means/SDs reflecting depression symptom severity from multiple single-group studies. I do not have access to participant-level data. The studies all use different measures, and I have the sample size and the minimum and maximum possible scale scores for each. I would like to be able to aggregate the means using meta-analysis to indicate the average severity of depression across these studies. I was thinking about rescaling the means to a 0-100 scale so they roughly represent % of maximum severity but I'm not sure what I could use as the variance, because I can't compute a rescaled SD without participant-level data. Is there any other way I could go about this? I'm using metafor to calculate other effect sizes for this project but could also calculate by hand. I'm assuming it would be inappropriate to treat the rescaled means as if they were percentages or event counts with ni or ti = 100, respectively, because that wouldn't take into account the actual variation in estimates, but if I'm wrong I'd love to know.
