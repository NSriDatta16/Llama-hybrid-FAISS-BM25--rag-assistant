I'm having the same problem trying to automate Gant scripts running. The solution I found is: copy gant-starter.conf (or groovy-starter.conf if it's just groovy) from $GROOVY_HOME/conf to your own dir; add "load [directory]" or "load [jar]" there, as described in javadocs to org.codehaus.groovy.tools.LoaderConfiguration, found in Groovy source distribution; before starting groovy set groovy.starter.conf.override system property to the name of that file, like -Dgroovy.starter.conf.override=[filename]
