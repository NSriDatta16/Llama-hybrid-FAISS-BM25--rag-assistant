Yes, of course this is an issue. The most obvious case where this pops up is in autoregressive models, where we use lagged values of the time series itself as a predictor. It is the exact same problem as for any other predictor we don't know with certainty in the future, e.g., if we use weather data as a predictor. This is commonly addressed by forecasting the predictor itself and feeding this forecast into the model. If there are interrelationships between the predictor and the target, one typically runs the forecasting system step by step into the future. In this method, it makes most sense to use an expectation forecast for the predictor (which is not necessarily what we are aiming for for the focal variable, depending on our accuracy measure, Kolassa, 2020 ). A more sophisticated approach would be not to account for the uncertainty in the forecast of the predictor. For instance, one could re-run the prediction multiple times, each time feeding in a sample from the predictive distribution of the predictor. This will do a better job at capturing the uncertainty in the focal variable.
