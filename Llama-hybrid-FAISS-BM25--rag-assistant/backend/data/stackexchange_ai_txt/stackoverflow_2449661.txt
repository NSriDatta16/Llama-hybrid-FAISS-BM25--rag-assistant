HTML tags in mysql text field

I'm creating a database with what I anticipate will be a long (perhaps several paragraphs for some tuples) attribute. I'm assigning it text instead of varchar. I have two questions: Should I give a maximum value for the text field? Is this necessary? Is it useful? Since the contents of this field will be displayed on a website in HTML, do I need to include paragraph tags for paragraph formatting when I enter records into mysql?
