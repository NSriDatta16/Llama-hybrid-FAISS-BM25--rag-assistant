How do I deal with additional input information other than images in a convolutional neural network?

I try to convert a game state of a board game into the input for a convolutional neural network. A convolutional neural network is useful because the players have to place items on the board, and the convolutional neural network can take advantage of that spatial structure. Therefore I can describe the board well with a binary feature plane for each player (1 if there is an item on the board and 0 if not). The players can not only place objects but also collect cards. A player can own a maximum of 19 of five different card types. How many cards a player has and what type they are, is important information for the neural network, but I cannot describe this with another feature plane. This has nothing to do with spatial structure. So how do I give the convolutional neural network such additional information, for example that the player has 6 cards of type A, as input? There are also "places" where a player can place his items. These places have a number (so to speak how good the place is) from 2 - 12. I can describe these places again with a feature plane. But I wonder if the network distinguishes well enough between two numbers like 6 and 7? I could imagine that it can distinguish much better between ones and zeros.
