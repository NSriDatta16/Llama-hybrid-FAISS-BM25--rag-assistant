DCI (data, context, interaction) persistence example

All the examples of DCI I've seen seems to be based on the object as the ultimate holder of information, and the transaction boundaries are defined inside the methods. I would like to see an example of a persistent application, where there is some sort of persistence layer, i.e. where there can be duplicate object copies of the underlying persistence storage and where a change to an object is a change to a copy that will later be persisted. Does DCI work for that model at all?
