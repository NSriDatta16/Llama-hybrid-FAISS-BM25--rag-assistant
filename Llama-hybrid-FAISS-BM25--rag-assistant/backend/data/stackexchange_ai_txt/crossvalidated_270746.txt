Comparing 2 models with very different R2 values but with very close RMSE values

In my prediction model, there are 20 independent variables, and the dependent variable [ y ] has a range of 0-4. In the first approach I use LASSO to make a prediction [I have separate training and test sets]. Here is the result of the model evaluation: METHOD MAE R2 RMSE LASSO 0.561 0.141 0.985 In the second approach, first I train a classification model to identify records whose y value is 0 [ y0 ] and whose y value is non-zero [ ynon0 ]. After the classification, I run the LASSO regression model to predict the ynon0 . At the end, I combine the items classified as y0 with the predicted ynon0 to evaluate the performance of ensembling two methods. Here are the results: METHOD MAE R2 RMSE CLASS+LASSO 0.536 0.437 0.971 I see that the second model explains much more variability in the outcome variable (given the R2 values) whereas the MAE and RMSE has improved slightly. Based on these results, I wonder if I should pay attention to R2, and should still consider the ensembling approach more effective, if my goal is to make an accurate prediction. Or, more generally, in what situation, I am supposed to favour the second approach or the first approach? Any ideas?
