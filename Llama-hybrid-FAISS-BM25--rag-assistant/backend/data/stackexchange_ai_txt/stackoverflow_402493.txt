Hmmm...I disagree with @StevenMcD completely. The tilde always references the root of the web application that you're developing, whereas the relative path notation is based upon your current location within the web application. I think in the long run, if you reorganize or restructure the file locations of the web pages, the tilde notation will make it much easier for you to refactor since you always know that the base path (~) is referring to the root of the web application. You cannot be assured of that if using "../" notation. One other note...the tilde (~) notation is very handy when using user controls and masterpages in ASP.NET. When you drop in a user control onto a webform, that webform can be nested in any part of your application's file structure. Relative paths simply aren't guaranteed to work in that scenarion. By using the tilde notation, all paths can be written in code and will work because they're based on the root of the web application. Hope this helps. By the way, the use of the ~ is not deprecated in any way in ASP.NET. UPDATE: As Cyril mentioned, the ~ is only available to you when using ASP.NET controls. Pure HTML elements won't work with it.
