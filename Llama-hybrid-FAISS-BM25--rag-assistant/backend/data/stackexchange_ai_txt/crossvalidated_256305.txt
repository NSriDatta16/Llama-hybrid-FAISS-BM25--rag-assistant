Intuition behind One-Way Random Effects ANOVA

I am trying to understand a single factor Random effects anova from a book. In this case : - $y_ij = \mu+ \tau_i + e_{ij}$, where $i = 1,...,a$ and $j= 1,...n$. Assumptions: The treatment effects $\tau_i$ are $N(0,\sigma_\tau^2)$ and $e_{ij}$ are $N(0,\sigma^2)$ $\tau_i$ and $e_{ij}$ are independent Hence we have : $Variance(y_{ij}) = \sigma_\tau^2 + \sigma^2$ The observations in the random effects model are normally distributed because they are linear combinations of the two normally and independently distributed random variables $\tau_i$ and $e_{ij}$. However, unlike the fixed effects case in which all of the observations $y_{ij}$ are independent,in the random model the observations $y_{ij}$ are only independent if they come from different factor levels. Note that the observations within a specific factor level all have the same covariance, because before the experiment is conducted, we expect the observations at that factor level to be similar because they all have the same random component. Once the experiment has been conducted, we can assume that all observations can be assumed to be independent, because the parameter $\tau_i$ has been determined and the observations in that treatment differ only because of random error. I don't understand the above paragraph. Can some one please explain?
