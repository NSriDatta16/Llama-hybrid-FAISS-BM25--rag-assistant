Lets investigate problem on web browser. When you load page with 10 pictures saved in database. You browser send new http request to the server. Each request init DB connection and server side script. Or just read static image from the file system. what will be faster? Other part - get data from file system or database. If we do not use cache for the database (but for 10 GB of images you should have 10 GB RAM to cache this data). Database and HTTP server reads data from file system in any case. But I think HTTP browser reads data faster then Database server. Only one thing cons for the Database storage - very easy to migrate data from one server to other. But this is not matter for system performance. And do not forget make path for images like /a/b/c/abc.jpg - it will be faster for big amount of images, then put all images in one directory.
