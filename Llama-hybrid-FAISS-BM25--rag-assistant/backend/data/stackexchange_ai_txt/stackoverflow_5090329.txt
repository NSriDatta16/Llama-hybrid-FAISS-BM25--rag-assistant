As far as I know, the most convenient way to securely store a purchased asset would be to use some form of encryption. The user should be able to download an encrypted asset, and the app should decrypt it on the fly. However, make sure that you store the key in a secure fashion as well, as string keys (within the app binary) can easily be recovered by a skilled hacker. A good way to secure the key would be to use some sort of authentication with a server-based system. The app would get the key off the server and keep it only for the few moments required to decrypt the asset. This defense mechanism is not impregnable; I feel that it is sophicaticated enough to discourage most users from attempting to undermine it. To decrypt your assets on the device, a good idea would be to use CommonCrypto . It's provided by Apple (with the iOS SDK), so you don't have to build it from scratch and you don't have to provide documentation (required by US law) for your app. I find Jim Dovey's Common Crypto wrapper the easiest way to use it. Hope that helps. :)
