I actually wondered the reason of not choosing mechanistic modeling if it models the data well. I would always favor ODE if it is feasible for a known system and good observations. The primary goal of machine learning is to find a model which can approximate well the underlying patterns of observed data, when we don't have much knowledge about the target system or there are too many entangled parts of the system. This also highlights ML's better applicability and worse interpretability in comparison to mechanistic modeling. A few words of my understanding about modeling: Essentially, modeling is to abstract the essentials from “real world” objects or phenomena to build their representations. Models enable us to investigate ideas for generating scientific hypotheses. To build sensible mechanistic models we will need good knowledge of the real system. For instance, if we want to know how fast the enzymes in our stomach catalyze the digestion of the proteins in our food, we need to understand in general how enzymatic reactions work, but we wouldn't need to know how genes encode such enzymes. The well-known Michaelis-Menten Equation captured the essentials representations of the enzymatic reactions in food digestion, therefore it is a good model. On the other hand, tons of factors are involved in forming a protein structure, therefore ML would show its advantage over mechanistic models in predicting protein structures, especially when we have lots of data at hand.
