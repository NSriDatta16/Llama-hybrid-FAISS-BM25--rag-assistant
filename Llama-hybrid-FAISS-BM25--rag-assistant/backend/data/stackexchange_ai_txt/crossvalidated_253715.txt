Francis has provided the definitive elegant solution. Following his beautiful method, it seems possible to produce a somewhat simpler form for the pdf. In particular, following Francis' elegant solution, let $V \sim \text{Beta}(m,m)$ with pdf $f(v)$ : .. and let $U \sim \text{Gamma}(2m, c)$ where $U$ is independent of $V$ , and let $Z = \frac1U$ , so that $Z \sim \text{InverseGamma}(2m,c)$ with pdf $g(z)$ : Then the desired pdf of $Y = \frac{V}{U} = V Z$ , say $h(y)$ , can be found with: where I am using the TransformProduct function from the mathStatica package for Mathematica to automate the nitty gritties. So does it work? Here is a quick Monte Carlo check of the: simulated pdf of $Y = \frac{A}{(A+D)^2}$ (generated from $A$ and $D$ ) (blue squiggly) compared to the exact theoretical pdf $h(y)$ (dashed red) derived above: when parameter $m = 4$ and $c=3.01$ . Looks fine.
