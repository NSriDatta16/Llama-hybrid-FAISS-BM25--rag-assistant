how to solve this hypothesis test?

I didn't understand how to solve this problem from the beginning. I tried to establish the parameters for example, but I don't know if I did it correctly and applied the right formula In a certain online search system, the time to complete searches is approximately normal, with a mean of 55 seconds and a standard deviation of 16 seconds. Some modifications were applied to the system and it was observed, in 35 searches, that the average time reduced to 43 seconds. Is there evidence of improvement? Assume that the 35 observations are random samples. (a) Set the variables and parameters (b) Establish the null (H0) and alternative (H1) hypotheses. (c) Carry out a test for the hypotheses in (b) at the 0.05 significance level. (Build a critical region and make a decision)
