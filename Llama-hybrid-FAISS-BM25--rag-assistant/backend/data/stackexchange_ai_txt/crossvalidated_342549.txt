Questionaire scores correlated with 8 different surgery types

Sample of about 70 people, each underwent 1 type of surgery on a certain organ. Quality of life questionnaires were constructed, with each patient having a satisfaction score. Intervals were created. There are 8 types of surgery on the same organ. Which test must i apply to see if the scores correlate with the type of operation? Are my satisfaction scores ordinal or interval? The 8 types of surgery have proper names, must i transform each type in a number?
