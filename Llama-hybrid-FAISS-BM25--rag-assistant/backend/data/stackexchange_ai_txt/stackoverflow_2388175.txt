If you are able to execute the queries then I would suggest getting familiar with the DBMS_PROFLIER functionality. The Oracle PL/SQL Profiler is a tool that can help provide statistics about the run-time behavior of PL/SQL code. The tool gathers information about PL/SQL source code as it executes and stores that information in tables. Once the execution is complete you can report on the stored profiler data to determine: The total number of times a line was executed The the minimum, maximum, and average execution time of each line of code How long SQL statements took to execute to completion Code coverage (the actual lines executed during the analysis period) One this information is summarized for a Profiler run you can determine which lines of source code or SQL statements can benefit the most from tuning. Oracle documentation on the DBMS_PROFILER package is here for 10g. Metalink Doc 243755.1 has a script to produce pretty HTML output for your profiling runs. PROFSUM.SQL is another script that reports on the gathered data, it is available here .
