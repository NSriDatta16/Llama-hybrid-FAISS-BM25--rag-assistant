Tools and Techniques for Analyzing German Automotive Discussion Forum Posts

I work for a German online disussion forum around all things automotive , a bit like a “StackOverflow for cars”, if you will. We would like to train a model using TensorFlow with our high quality content, to be able to evaluate the quality of new content our users post on our platform. Our ultimate goal is to be able to put a link to the best answer to a question on our discussion forums. We (two backend Java developers and myself, a JavaScript frontend web developer) are very new to the field of data science and machine learning, currently going through the tutorials from Google and trying to figure out where to start. Which tools and technologies would you recommend to use for this project? How can we train a model to suit our needs? Are there any tutorials that demonstrate how to train a model to use German text as input?
