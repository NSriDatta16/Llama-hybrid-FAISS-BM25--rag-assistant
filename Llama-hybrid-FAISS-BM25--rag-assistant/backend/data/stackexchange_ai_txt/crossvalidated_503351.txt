I don't see why integers as explanatory variables should cause any issues when treated as continuous in a logistic regression. Note that your variables are counts, as opposed to the variables in each of the questions linked by @kjetilbhalvorsen. The main thing to be worried about is the same for any continuous variable in logistic regression: is the response log-odds linear in the predictor? Your test seems to suggest that in this case that's not a bad assumption, except that you don't appear to have done anything to check zero counts, which in context seems to be the most likely to not fit into the same relationship as the other values. If you decide the relationship isn't linear enough, then treating them as factors, or fitting splines/polynomials as @kjetilbhalvorsen suggests in a comment, or some other transformation, all sound like good approaches; the latter approaches should reduce the problem of the large counts being uncommon. If the positive values look good for a linear fit but zero does not, maybe just adding an indicator "is 0" variable would suffice.
