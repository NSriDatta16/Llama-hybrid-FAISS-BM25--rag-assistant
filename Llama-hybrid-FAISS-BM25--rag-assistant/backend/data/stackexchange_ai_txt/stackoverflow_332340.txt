We have a multi-project WinForms app built out of .NET 2.0. One of the projects holds: all the images used across the whole solution an ImageManager class, which has one static method, containing one line of code: Return CType(My.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(name), Image) Then we just refer to the images (mostly .PNGs) by name. For instance, button.Image = ImageManager.GetImage("CancelIcon") This is all a lot easier to manage than it was with .NET 1.1. Now all you have to do is add the image to the project, drag the image on to the graphical resources display (in Project | Properties), and compile. Since projects are reusable across solutions, we can use the same image library everywhere we need to. Not sure if this really answers your question, but I hope it's helpful.
