If you have a Windows box with IIS and MSSQL (including SQL Server Express), you should look at Bugtracker.net . It is free and open source (you get the source code), and it is extensible. Even if you are a one man shop, having a free bug tracking system with this much power will allow you to grow over time, because it is fairly easy to add future users into the system. You can also customize it for the look of your organization, business or product.
