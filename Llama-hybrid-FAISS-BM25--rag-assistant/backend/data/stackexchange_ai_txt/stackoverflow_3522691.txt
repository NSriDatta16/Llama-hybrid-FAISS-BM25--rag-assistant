You need to change the StoreGeneratedPattern value for the property in the EF designer. Set it to Identity . This will cause EF to avoid setting the value on an insert, then capture it after the insert is complete. Note that if you're using EF 4, you may have trouble with this using the designer only (see this link ). You may have to edit the .edmx manually and set the StoreGeneratedPattern in the storage model itself.
