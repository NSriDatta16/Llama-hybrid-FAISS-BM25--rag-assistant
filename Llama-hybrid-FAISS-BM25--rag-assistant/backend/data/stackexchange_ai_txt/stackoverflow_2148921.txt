Best way to comparing perormance of different version of library

Currently for each call in library,I am doing multiple iteration , Measuring time taken for each call and then calculating : Average time taken for each call Min time take Max time taken Standard Deviation But it seems its not a good method . As these time depends upon state of machine ,As if CPU is busy with other process result will be impacted. Please suggest me still if its a good way.Or i can use some better method.
