commons beanutils alternative

I am looking for a commons beanutils alternative. The reason is that beanutils relies on commons-logging which is conflicting with existing libraries I am using. I would like a small self-contained alternative which will cause no/minimal conflicts. The main functionality I am after is nested property retrieval. Thanks in advance, Steven
