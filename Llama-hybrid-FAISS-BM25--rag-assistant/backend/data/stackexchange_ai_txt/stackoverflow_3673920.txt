I think, that they will see how well your code is organised.... Building the data model may use inheritance or composition or association. Eg. in case of c++, we can have inheritance like: class Base{}; class Derived:public Base{}; Other thing is association : class X{} class Y{ X *a; //you have pointer to class X }; Composition: class X{} class Y{ X a; //you have object of class X }; So it depends which way you implement what they have told you to as complexity vary according to that...All languages provide these in some or the other way. They just see how well you design your class and make code human readable .
