I'm almost in complete agreeement with @Michelle's answer. I'd modify it slightly, in light of your original post + comments, to recommend that you do a Z -test of the difference between proportions. As she said, you can use rate per 1000 or some similar indicator. And since you're averaging the 2 or 3 results within each district and summing across all the different types of crimes you're tracking, you end up with one proportion for each district, as in a/1000 vs. b/1000. That difference is what would be most convenient to test. If you prefer Chi-Square, you'd use a 2x2 table populated by a, 1000-a, b, and 1000-b. Either of these tests will give equivalent results, but the former will give you the chance to construct a confidence interval for the difference. You asked about SPSS procedures: I wouldn't try to do either using SPSS. It'll be easier to use an online calculator.
