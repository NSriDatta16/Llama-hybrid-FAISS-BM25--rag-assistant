jQuery UI get dragged/dropped offset

I'm trying to get the ui object's dropped offset value. As in the offset at the dropped position and not the element's initial position. The following code hasn't worked for me: $(ui.helper).offset().left; $(ui.helper).draggable().offset().left; $(ui.helper).droppable().offset().left; Each of those returns the initial offset of the element. How do I get the dropped offset value?
