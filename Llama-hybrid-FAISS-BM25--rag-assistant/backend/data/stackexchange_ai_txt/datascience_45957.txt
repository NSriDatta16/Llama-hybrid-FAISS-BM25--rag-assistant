using neural networks to predict set of charactertics

Say i have a matrix with m rows and n features where m is the number of people on say an dating website such as tinder. So n could be age, sex, location,job... etc these kinds of features. My output 'Y' would be a features vector containing features of a person they have previously liked/matched. So it would have m rows and x features(columns) ( x can be age, sex, job, etc...). I would like to predict/suggest a possible match given this training data of X and Y. Is it possible to use any machine learning/neural networks to predict a SET of features so Y being a matrix rather than a single columned vector? I have seen examples where given some data X we can predict Y but Y is normally a classification such as 0/1 or some sort of wine classification from (1-3) for example. What if it was a set of features? is it possible.
