How do I enable code coverage in Visual Studio 2005?

I have looked at this question; Why don't I get code coverage results for C++/CLI project in Visual Studio 2010? and the F1 page, but that doesn't help me much. I have set the profiling on and rebuilt, but I can't find the 'Data and Diagnostics' page, or see anything which resembles a coverage data file in the project folder. What I am trying to do get an equivalent to 'gcov' on a Linux platform, get a chart of how much code is being missed by the test suite. I'm using Visual Studio 2005 Professional Edition and UnitTest++ as the test framework. Any help would be most welcome.
