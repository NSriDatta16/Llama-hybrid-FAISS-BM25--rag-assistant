Comparison of statistical models with different target variable definitions

Situation: I have a couple of statistical binary classification models (e.g. logistic regression, xgboost, random forest) and want to compare the model probabilities with each other. For simplicity, let's say each model were fitted on the same/similar training data. However, the target variable definition varies among the models. So, e.g., there are target variables which are defined as e.g. customer falls into category XYZ in the next month. Another model defines the target variable as customer falls into category XYZ in next three month... or the month after next month. Problem: Currently, I cannot compare probabilities from Model A with probabilities from Model B as the target variables are defined over different time horizons. Question: Does there exist any kind of adjustment s.t. I can compare the models with each other (taking into account the time horizons of the target variable)? EDIT: I have several product affinity models, each of them giving me a probability how likely it is that the customer will buy the according product. Since the targets are defined on varying time horizons I cannot directly compare the model probabilities with each other. So aim is to adjust model probabilities (taking into account time horizon) such that I can compare the product affinities with each other. (I don't ant to retrain all models again)
