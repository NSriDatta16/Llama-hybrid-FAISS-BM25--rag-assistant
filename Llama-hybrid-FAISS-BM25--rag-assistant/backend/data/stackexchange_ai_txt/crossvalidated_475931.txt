From here: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/coronaviruscovid19infectionsurveypilot/2july2020 we see that: "We estimate that an average of 1 in 2,200 (45 in 100,000) individuals within the community population in England had COVID-19 at any given time between 14 June and 27 June 2020." Assume the ratio of cases between my area and the rest of the UK has been constant for a while. Estimating the number of new cases of Covid-19 in the UK this is 7 per 100,000 on average. My area has 2 cases per 100,000. So a very rough estimate for the rate of Covid-19 cases in my area is 2/7 x 45 = 13 per 100,000 people in my area have Covid-19. So a good approximation will be: between 10 and 30 per 100,000 in my area have Cov-19.
