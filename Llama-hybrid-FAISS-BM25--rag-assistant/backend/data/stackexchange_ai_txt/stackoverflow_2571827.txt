Upgrading to a "larger" version of the data type should be harmless. The only "drawback" of course would be that the column requires more storage space. But this shouldn't be a deal breaker unless you have a massive table. Just be sure to check your foreign keys before you make a change like that. Foreign keys must have the same type (even down to specific attributes like UNSIGNED )
