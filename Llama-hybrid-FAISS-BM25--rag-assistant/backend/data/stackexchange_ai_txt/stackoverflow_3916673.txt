Is it generally discouraged to use a varchar/string field as a join between two tables? If there's a natural key to be used (extremely rare in real life, but state/province abbreviations are a good example), then VARCHAR fields are fine. When is the best case where a string field can be used as a join field? Depends on the database because of the bits allocated to the data type, but generally VARCHAR(4) or less takes around the same amount of space (less the less number of characters) as INT would.
