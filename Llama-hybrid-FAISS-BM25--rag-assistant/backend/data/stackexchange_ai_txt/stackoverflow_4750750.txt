If you are using NSString and stringWithFormat: , then I don't think the C99 compliance really applies: while stringWithFormat: is similar to printf , it has its own implementation that has been around for a while. The NSLocalizedString() macro actually does this for you automatically. For example, say I have the following code: @implementation MDAppController - (id)init { if (self = [super init]) { NSArray *catsArray = [NSArray array]; NSString *string = [NSString stringWithFormat: NSLocalizedString(@"There are %lu %@ %@ in my home.", @"no comment"), (unsigned long)[catsArray count], NSLocalizedString(@"red", @""), NSLocalizedString(@"cats", @"")]; NSLog(@"string == %@", string); } return self; } @end If I then run the following in Terminal /usr/bin/genstrings ~/Developer/NSLocalizedString/MDAppController.m -o ~/Desktop/Strings (Though I prefer just dragging the proxy icon in the window title bar onto this AppleScript droplet I keep in my Dock: GenerateStrings.app . It (over)writes the generated .strings files into ~/Desktop/Strings/ (creating it if necessary). You can edit the script by dropping it onto AppleScript Editor). It will generate a UTF16 Localizable.strings file which you can add to your project. In it it will have the following: English.lproj/Localizable.strings /* No comment provided by engineer. */ "cats" = "cats"; /* No comment provided by engineer. */ "red" = "red"; /* no comment */ "There are %lu %@ %@ in my home." = "There are %1$lu %2$@ %3$@ in my home."; Duplicate it to a Spanish language project sub folder and change the order of items as necessary (since in Spanish adjectives usually come after the noun): Spanish.lproj/Localizable.strings /* No comment provided by engineer. */ "cats" = "gatos"; /* No comment provided by engineer. */ "red" = "rojos"; /* no comment */ "There are %lu %@ %@ in my home." = "Está %1$lu %3$@ %2$@ en mi casa."; When English is my primary (topmost) language in Language & Text pref pane: 1/20/2011 12:59:37 PM NSLocalizedString[1777] string == There are 0 red cats in my home. When Spanish is my primary (topmost) language in Language & Text pref pane: 1/20/2011 12:37:02 PM NSLocalizedString[1702] string == Está 0 gatos rojos en mi casa. The .strings files are in a sense key value pairs. For more info see Resource Programming Guide: String Resources
