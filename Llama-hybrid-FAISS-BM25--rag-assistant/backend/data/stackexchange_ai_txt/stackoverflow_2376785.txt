Using a flash drawing program to create dynamic HTML possible?

I am interested in developing an application where people can draw the background to their personal homepage using a generic flash drawing program (like graffiti app on facebook.. something very simple). I have little/no experience with flash, but I assume I could simply output the drawing as an image file and have that be the background. That seems easy enough. The real question is how to then incorporate simple HTML into it. I see problems in regards to different screen resolutions and browsers. For example, the most basic setup would be drawing a picture and incorporating a search box. Let's say the search box (fixed HTML code) was an option to be dragged into the flash program onto the canvas. Is there any way to get around how/where the HTML would show up on different screen resolutions and browsers? I feel like as the browser is enlarged, the alignment of the picture with the HTML would get messed up. Would only allowing fixed image sizes solve it? Any ideas on how to implement something like this? Would be greatly appreciated!!
