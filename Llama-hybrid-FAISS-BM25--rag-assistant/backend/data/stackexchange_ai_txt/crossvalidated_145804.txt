Why R linear ksvm don't use all support vectors

I was playing with svm and I made this data: x y | type ----------- 1 1 | 1 2 2 | 1 2 0 | 1 0 0 | -1 0 1 | -1 1 0 | -1 and using this setting svp The result is like that (the support vectors are filled with red/black) My question is why the other point (0,1) was not included as a support vector?
