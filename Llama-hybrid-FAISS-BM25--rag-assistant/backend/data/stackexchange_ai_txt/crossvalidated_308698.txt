How do recurrent neural networks know how to close brackets?

I read that an RNN given a lot of text to read can learn to generate text which matches brackets (....) {...} [...] etc. How does the RNN "know" that it has to close a bracket? Or is this just a fluke that we're reading too much into? Where does it store the "state" that the bracket has been opened and so needs closing? And how does it learn this?
