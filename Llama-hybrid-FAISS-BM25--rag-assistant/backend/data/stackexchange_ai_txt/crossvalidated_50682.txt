What is the intuition of invertible process in time series?

I'm reading a book on time series and I started scratching my head in the following part: Could someone explain the intuition for me? I couldn't get it from this text. Why do we need the process to be invertible? What is the big picture here? I'm new on this stuff so if you could be kind to use student-level terms when explaining this :)
