Predicting changes in values across two time series

I have data from an experiment in which participants provided time series data tracking their emotion (on a scale from -10 to 10) after experiencing two discrete stimuli. Data were collected at a rate of once a second for 300 seconds. Thus, every participant has 300 values in time series 1 and 300 values in time series 2. Participants also completed a self-report measure of trait X. I first examined how values in time series 1 are predicted by trait X , by building an MLM regressing series 1 value on trait X , with the data nested within participants. Now I am interested in running some tests to examine relationships between the time series, specifically: a) are series 1 values predicted by trait X when controlling for values in series 2 values ? b) is the change in series 1 values to series 2 values predicted by trait X`? I can envision the non-hierarchical way of modeling these data. I would compute the average of all series 1 values for each participant (which I'll call avg_series_1 ), and the average of all series 2 values for each participant (which I'll call avg_series_2 ). a) using multiple regression, regress avg_series_1 on trait X and avg_series_2 b) compute change in avg_series_1 and avg_series_2 , regress the change on trait X However, I would like to perform these analyses hierarchically, and I'm struggling to envision how to build these models. For (a), I could, hypothetically, build a multi-level model in which the DV was series 1 value , with series 2 value and trait X as fixed effects. However, given how my data are structured (see example data below), I'd be predicting series 1 at second 1 with series 2 at second 1 and trait X (and so on and so on). This doesn't seem right as I wouldn't expect any certain relationship to emerge among data points at the same time point in their respective time series. Rather, I'm wanting to see how controlling for average values in series 2 impacts the effect of trait X on average values in series 3. Are these data better handled non-hierarchically? I also had the idea to restructure the data by collapsing series 1 value and series 2 value into the same column ( value ), and create a new variable (called series # ) representing whether the time series value belongs to series 1 or series 2. I could then use series # as a predictor in my model, and perhaps in (a) I'd be looking to see if trait X interacts with series # to predict value . Is this a way of testing (a)? Also, I don't know how to test (b) using this method. pt # | time | series 1 value | series 2 value| trait X 101 | 1 s | 4 | 3 | 35 101 | 2 s | 5 | 3 | 35 101 | 3 s | 6 | 2 | 35 101 | 4 s | 7 | 1 | 35 101 | 5 s | 7 | 1 | 35 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 199 | 1 s | 2 | -7 | 42 199 | 2 s | 1 | -8 | 42 199 | 3 s | 1 | -9 | 42
