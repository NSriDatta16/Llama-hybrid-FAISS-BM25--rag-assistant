I once did a project like this. It's about pattern recognition. You'll probably end up using a Neural Network which you will have to teach the Chinese characters. The Image library can pick a piece out of the image (like LexRema describes). After we did that we resized the image part to, let's say 10x10 pixels, converted the colours to black and white values (0 and 1). This will create a map of binary data. You will have to teach the Neural Network that the data you pass IS the character you tell. This is pretty default and I'm sure there are a lot of Neural Network examples on the web. Good luck!
