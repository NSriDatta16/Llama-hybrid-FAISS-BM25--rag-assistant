is translating frequentist results to a chain of bayesian models scientifically sound?

Let us say that we have available a catalog of known frequentist models. For example: continuous variable coagulation time $CT$ linear regression on outcome $CT$ for the predictor transfusion $T$ linear regression on outcome $CT$ for the predictor fresh frozen plasma administration $FFP$. We can compute $P(CT>x | T)$, and we could also do it for the event sequence $P(CT>x | T, FFP)$, assuming no interaction between $T$ and $FFP$, but I would like the probability distribution instead. I aim at representing the event sequence as a program and compute the probability distribution of $CT$ after each event and also the full event sequence. The literature only makes available summary statistics describing the distribution of $CT$ before the event, and model parameters such as regression coefficients. Given that I do not have access to the raw data, is the translation of a sequence of events as above to a sequence of bayesian models something viable? Could you give me a hint about how to proceed?
