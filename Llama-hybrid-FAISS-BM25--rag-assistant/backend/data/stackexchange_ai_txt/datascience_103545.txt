Transparent Matching / Recommendation System

I am thinking of a matching/recommendation algorithm which matches students to the right teachers for their individual problems. The dataset would look like this: Student Name Age Gender Weak Subjects Years of College... Teachers Name Age Gender Specialzation Type (chilled or strict etc.) Learn methods etc. Thus, both students and teachers have their own set of variables that might be relevant to the matching process. I have training data from past years where you can see what kind of students did best with what kind of teachers (Training set). Based on this data, I would like to develop an algorithm which a) brings students to the best possible teacher (each teacher has unlimited capacity) b) is transparent which variables have led to this decision. Especially point b) leads me to think that the first thoughts of classical Recommendation Systems or Siamese Neural Networks are not explainable enough. Any ideas about algorithms or opinions about my previous thoughts that conventional recommendation systems are not quite suitable?
