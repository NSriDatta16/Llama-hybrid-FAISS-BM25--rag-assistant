Here's the approach I'd take: Store your data (the stuff in the 3-4 pages with 60 columns/1,300 rows) in a DB or other data store. Do the calculations by either using DB functions (select sum(foo) from blah;), temp tables, in-memory arrays, whatever Save calculations in data store (for later easier retrieval and auditing)
