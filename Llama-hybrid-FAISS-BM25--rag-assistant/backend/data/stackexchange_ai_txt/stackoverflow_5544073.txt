I would take the preprocessor option. You can put all your preprocessor in one file/method and it will not be too messy. Like oefe said, change the .sqlite is overkill. And with the multiple plist, you will find yourself dragging things around and doing a lot of error prone actions. However , I would not make a lot of apps. I would just make one app, let the user select his city at launch. You could also add in-app purchases to let the user add more cities when he wants to. Your app will be easier to maintain : do you want to upload, change description and screenshots for 10+ apps at each update? I find this painful to do with 1 app... You will not spam the AppStore : having 10+ more apps in the AppStore with the exact same purpose is ridiculous... That's exactly why Apple made in-app purchases, to avoid that situation. You will have to find different icon for each of your city : your icon is one of the most important aspect when selling your app on the AppStore. You want it to be as polished as possible. Apple won't allow multiple apps to have the same icon and differentiate icon by putting a label on it is not a good option.
