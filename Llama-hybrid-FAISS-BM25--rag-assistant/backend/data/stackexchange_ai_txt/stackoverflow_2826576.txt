Android: custom view onClickEvent with X & Y locations

I've got a custom view and I want to get the X and Y coordinates of a user click. I've found that I can only get the coordinates from the onTouchEvent and an onClickEvent won't fire if I have an onTouchEvent. Unfortunately the onTouchEventfires when the user drags the screen as well as clicking. I've tried to differentiate between the two, but I still get the code firing when I'm dragging: public boolean onTouchEvent(MotionEvent event) { int action = event.getAction(); if (action == MotionEvent.ACTION_DOWN) { //fires on drag and click I've had a look at this but as I mentioned above I don't think the solution there will work as I can't get the onClick and the onTouch events working at the same time. Maybe I'm doing something wrong in this respect, is there a normal way of dealing with capturing user input on custom events? Should I be able to use the onClick and onTouch events at the same time? Thanks, Martyn
