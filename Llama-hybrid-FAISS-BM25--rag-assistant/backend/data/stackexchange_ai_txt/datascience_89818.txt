How to create a multi label classification network in Keras if I have the training data with various accuracy?

I'm trying to create a neural network that finds the most effective treatment for each patient. I have a medical database for training. The inputs are histological and pathological data (mostly 0/1 data of having some diseases, conditions) and the outputs are the treatments. And there is an accuracy score, which is the patient's reaction to the treatment (this shows how good was the treatment for the symptoms, so how accurate was the input-output pair). How can I create a multi label classification network that finds the best treatment if the training data pairs are not always totally correct , rather having these variable accuracy scores?
