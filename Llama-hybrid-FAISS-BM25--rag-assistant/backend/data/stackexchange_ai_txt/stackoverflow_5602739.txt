c# playing movie in windows media player "Not" embedded

I have looked around, everything I find is talking about embedding it. I do not want to embed it. I want to click a button and launch windows media player seperatly. For example, I have a location saved in XML file. I have a right click to click Play. It pulls the location. like so. int dd = dataGridView1.CurrentRow.Index; string eLoc = dataGridView1.Rows[dd].Cells[4].Value.ToString(); if (eLoc == "") { MessageBox.Show("You have not saved a location for this movie","Movie Play",MessageBoxButtons.OK,MessageBoxIcon.Information); } else { MessageBox.Show(eLoc); ProcessStartInfo ps = new ProcessStartInfo("wmplayer.exe", eLoc.ToString()); Process.Start(ps); } As you can see, I have a pop up to view, what the string is. It is this. I added %20 to replace spaces, thinking that was the problem but it isn't. As you can see it pulls the full location. All I get back from windows media player is this. Any ideas? To me it seems like this should be working..
