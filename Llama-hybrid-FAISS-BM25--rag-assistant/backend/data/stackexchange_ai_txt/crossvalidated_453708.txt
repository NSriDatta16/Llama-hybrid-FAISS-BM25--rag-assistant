Calculating AUC on test set of random forest model in R

I have built a random forest model within a k-fold cv, and have had no problem calculating the AUC on the training set, but after trying a few methods of calculating AUC I keep getting errors to the effect of "response and predictors must be of the same length" when I try to use that same code on the test data. I suspect this is because I built the model on the larger training data, but i'm not sure. Below is an example of the code i've been using. # setting up k-fold k $outcome, rf.model$ votes[,2]) auc(roc.train) # calculate ROC/AUC on test data roc.test $outcome, rf.model$ votes[,2]) auc(roc.test) As I said, it works fine on the training data, but not on the test data. What is the appropriate way to calculate this? Any advice is appreciated!
