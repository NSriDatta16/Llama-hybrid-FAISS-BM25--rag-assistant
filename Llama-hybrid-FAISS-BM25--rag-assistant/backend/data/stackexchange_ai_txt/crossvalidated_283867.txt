Time-Series Forecast where the data is a random variable itself?

I have one concern regarding a time series forecast. I have panel data from which I computed the monthly mean. These monthly variables are now itself random and have a relatively high standard error and weird distrubtion (basically uniform) Now I'm wondering, what method I could apply in order to predict the macroeconomic influence on that time series? Are there any specific models or even machine learning methods in order to Analyse my model? Thanks, Konstantin
