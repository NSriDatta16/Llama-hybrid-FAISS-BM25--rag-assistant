Your specific problem has a simple solution, which is that the AR(1) process you are describing is not stationary. Thus, it does not admit a moving average representation. However, the more general problem can be relevant. For some intuition, consider a stationary AR(1) model with an autoregressive parameter $\beta$ , and assume it has been transformed into an MA( $\infty$ ) model with moving average parameters $1,\beta,\beta^{2},...$ . When considering the difference of that process, the coefficients are such that you need to difference the original MA( $\infty$ ) model. So if the aforementioned coefficients were $1,\beta,\beta^{2},...$ , then the differenced MA coefficients are $1,\beta-1,\beta^{2}-\beta,...$ . It's perhaps easiest to convert this into a state space form. We can combine together both the difference equation and the level equation into one form $$ \left[\begin{array}{c} \Delta y_{t}\\ y_{t} \end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{cc} 0 & \beta-1\\ 0 & \beta \end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c} \Delta y_{t-1}\\ y_{t-1} \end{array}\right]+\left[\begin{array}{c} 1\\ 1 \end{array}\right]\varepsilon_{t} $$ Simplifying some of the notation, we can write this as $$ X_{t}=AX_{t-1}+B\varepsilon_{t} $$ Which through some standard time series techniques implies $$ X_{t}=\left(1-AL\right)^{-1}B\varepsilon_{t} $$ We can extract the difference series as $$ \Delta y_{t}=\left[\begin{array}{cc} 1 & 0\end{array}\right]\left(1-AL\right)^{-1}B\varepsilon_{t} $$ Note that $$\left(1-AL\right)^{-1}$$ is fairly standard in time series and expands to $$I+AL+\left(AL\right)^{2}+..$$ This can easily be extended to an AR(p) process and adding in constants, etc.
