Is choice of machine learning algorithm a secondary issue?

Currently I’m attending the great "How to Win a Data Science Competition" course on Coursera. At one point it’s authors claim that given their experience, the actual choice of machine learning algorithm † and parameter tuning is far less important then feature engineering. On one hand this seems to intuitively have much sense, on another, it seems to contradict the “no free lunch” theorem. Do you know any references that more rigorously deal with this topic? † Notice that they implicitly seem to consider here only the high performing algorithms like XGBoost.
