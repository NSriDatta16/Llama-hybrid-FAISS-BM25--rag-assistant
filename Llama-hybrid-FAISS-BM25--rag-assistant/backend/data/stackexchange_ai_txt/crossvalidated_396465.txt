The literature on missing data is pretty clear. If a lab tech drops and shatters a vial of biospecimen on the way to the centrifuge, you can use complex models to impute the values. In surveys and self-report, levels of "don't know" or "not applicable" are the most informative levels of response available. To put it bluntly: refused/don't know/not applicable is very much non-missing and highly informative. As you design and analyze your response, propose hazard ratios for the outcome comparing NA/DK/NR levels to other "given" levels, and be prepared to interpret their findings. Be aware of bad survey design. For instance, if an instrument is sent to men and women, and asks, "Are you pregnant or nursing?" then who might answer "not applicable"? men? non-fecund women (underage girls, post-menopausal women, and/or women with hysterectomy)? In each of those cases, the "N/A" vs. "no" response compares the average hazard for each of those types of individual against fecund women who are not pregnant or nursing. It is useful to estimate effects and describe the possible limitations of the survey instrument design, and suggest modifications. The type of model is inconsequential. I would recommend a similar approach for Cox, logistic, and linear regression alike.
