AR model with vector valued variables (in R)

I want to estimate a vector-valued model $$\mathbf{y}_t = a\mathbf{y}_{t-1}+b\mathbf{y}_{t-2}+\cdots$$ Here, each $\mathbf{y}_t\in\mathbb{R}^n$ and the coefficients $a,b,\dotsc$ are real numbers (unlike in VAR, where they are matrices). I wonder what the best way to do this in R is. Applying the function ar doesn't seem to work for me ([i] is this only for series that lie in $\mathbb{R}^1$ ?), and when I apply standard linear regression, I'm not sure how I should test for the order of the model, etc. [ii] Should I go for the $R^2$ value and significance of the coefficients? Also, I have my data in a matrix $Y$ where each column corresponds to one time point. Currently, I regress as follows Y = c(Y[,10], Y[,9],..., Y[,2]) Y.l1 = c(Y[,9],..., Y[,1]) fit = lm(Y ~ 0 + Y.l1) [iii] Is there a more elegant way?
