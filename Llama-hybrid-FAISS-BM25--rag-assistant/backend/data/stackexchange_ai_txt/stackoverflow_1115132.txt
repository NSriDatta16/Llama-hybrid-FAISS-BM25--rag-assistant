STATHREAD as async workflow in F#

Consider the following code fragment: let t1 = async { return process1() } let t2 = async { return process2() } let t3 = async { return windowsProcess() } let execute = [ t1; t2; t3 ] |> Async.Parallel |> Async.RunSynchronously |> ignore What to do in the case the windowsProcess requires a STATHREAD? Is this possible with this construction?
