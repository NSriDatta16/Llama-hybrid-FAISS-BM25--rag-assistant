I've found that JNLP/Webstart does not like multiple signatures/signing via jarsigner.exe for a given JAR. If a JAR such as BouncyCastle (which comes presigned) is signed again with your Company's certificate, visual inspection leads me to believe that the new Certificate and Signatures are performed properly in the JAR. but that JNLP may be reading only the first (Alphabetical?) signature in the META-INF, and thereby complaining it doesn't match your other JARs (which have only one, Corporate, signature on each JAR).
