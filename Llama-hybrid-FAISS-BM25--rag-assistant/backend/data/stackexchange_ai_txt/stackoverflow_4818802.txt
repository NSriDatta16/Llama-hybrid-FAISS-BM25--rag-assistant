For example, I have a library that generates instances of some class. Each of these instances must have a unique integer ID, as these instances represent commands being sent to a server, and each command must have a unique ID. Since multiple threads are allowed to send commands concurrently, I use an AtomicInteger to generate those IDs. An alternative approach would be to use some sort of lock and a regular integer, but that's both slower and less elegant.
