IIA assumption: difference logit and probit

Considering the following question about the Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives assumption: Alternatives to multinomial logistic regression It seems as if IIA is only a problem when using a multinomial logit model, but, as the answers seems to imply, this assumption is not necessary for nested probit models and/or mixed multinomial logit . Why is this the case? What about nested logit models? It seems as if the IIA assumption is only a problem for logit but is not necessary for probit models. Is this true?
