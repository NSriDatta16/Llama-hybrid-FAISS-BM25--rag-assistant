Are datasets scalable? Would a site like myspace use them for data retrieval?

How scalable are datasets? Team member wants to use datasets for data retrieval and manipulation, use the built in data integrity etc. to use the object to perform data updates etc. Our system is expected to scale to millions of users. Everything that I have read is against dataset's in an enterprise environment, am I wrong here or what?
