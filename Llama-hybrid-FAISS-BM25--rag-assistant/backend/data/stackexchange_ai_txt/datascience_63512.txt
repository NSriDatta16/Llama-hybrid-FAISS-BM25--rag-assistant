The data here is bit noisy and has a lot of fluctuations. As a few of the comments suggest, apply some transformation on it. I would say get your data in some smaller range and then apply a LSTM to predict it. I made time-series work with a LSTM with removal of noise by eliminating outliers and it worked with nice further prediction. RNNs tend to work better with time-series data especially bidirectional-LSTM due to their backwards learning capabilities.
