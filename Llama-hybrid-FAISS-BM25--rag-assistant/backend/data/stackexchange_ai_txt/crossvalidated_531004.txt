Logistic Regression - Conversion of variables

I have as dataset where I got independent (X-Variables) in different versions which need to be converted/transform so that an logistics regression can be run. I am new to L.regression and don't understand how to structure variables so that it can be used. Dataset can be download from here: https://ufile.io/apxl0n75
