I believe you want to be able to define how much free space is below the image. Try adjusting margin-bottom of the image: IMG text text text IMG text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text This way all the text may be in the same paragraph. And it will wrap around image nicely. Then put an element with clear:both; style to disable wrapping after the text (just in case the text is not long enough)
