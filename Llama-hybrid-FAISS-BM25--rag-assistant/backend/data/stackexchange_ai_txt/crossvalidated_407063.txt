The rule of thumb is: the more data you have available, the less you have to care about feature engineering (which is basically inputting some prior knowledge into the model, based on the domain expertise). Theoritically (with huge enough number of the samples) you could solve imagenet without using any convolutions, only deep feedforward network. But by knowing that pixels are spatially correlated (which makes it so that the convolutions will be much better way to tackle this problem) you can design an algorithm which is much more data-efficient.
