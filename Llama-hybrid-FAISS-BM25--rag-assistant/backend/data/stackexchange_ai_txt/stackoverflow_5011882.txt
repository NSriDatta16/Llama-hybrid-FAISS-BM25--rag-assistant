Android CSS for different screen sizes

I have a simple web page that displays some text and images and trying to find a non complicated way to handle multiple screens. I have looked through the docs and the only way I can see to do it right now is having to create three separate css files, one for low, one for medium, and one for high res. Unfortunately each one of these have to have different font sizes and dimensions of every element/image. This seems rather wasteful considering every hdpi element should just be exactly 1.5x the size of the normal one. Is there not a way to make Android just automatically scale this for us while using hdpi versions of the images instead of mdpi ones? Am I missing something here?
