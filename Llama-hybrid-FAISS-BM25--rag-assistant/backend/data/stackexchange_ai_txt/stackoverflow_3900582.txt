code coverage in visual studio 2008 pro

I am writing some unit tests using visual studio 2008 professional edition. I learned that visual studio has a built in code coverage utility however it seems that this feature is not available with my version of visual studio. Do someone know which versions of visual studio 2008 include the code coverage utility ? Tzachi
