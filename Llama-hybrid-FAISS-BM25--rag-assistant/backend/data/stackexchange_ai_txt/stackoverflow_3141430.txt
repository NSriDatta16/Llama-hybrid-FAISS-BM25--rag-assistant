Create div dynamically with options for the selected object

I have a component that is draggable, and would enable the option to select when you show a little div on one corner, with some options (delete, new). Well, I'm trying to see some components some programming to do that, and unfortunately found nothing practical. There are some library but has a size gigange (versions with 112KB min.) some of his friends, he would tell me somewhere or I can achieve something similar, or a component that makes it more optimized? Thanks Obs.: I am using jQuery and jQueryUI.
