If you have some control over the order of insertion and update you can enforce uniqueness of permutation: alter table t23 add constraint tags_ck check (tag1 This works because the check constraint rejects ('dog','cat') as an invalid combination. Consequently the unique constraint can ensure that there is only evy one record with that particular permutation of tags. As a solution this does require some intervention at insert and update time, which may be enough to sink this implementation for you. I know of an elegant solution whcih woks in Oracle, using a function-based index (I posted it here ) but I don't think MySQL supports a similar type of index.
