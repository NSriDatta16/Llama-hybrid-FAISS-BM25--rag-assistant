A table without a clustered index is called a heap. A heap can be fragmented too. Performance would probably improve if you added a clustered index with an auto-increment primary key. A clustered index does not slow deletes or inserts (to the contrary.) In addition, the scheduled routine maintenance will keep tables with a clustered index defragmented.
