My solution was to create a module that overrides the Toolbar class which is what controls the grid/list view of the catalog and the number of items to display. The specific class to override is called Mage_Catalog_Block_Product_List_Toolbar . Clone the file and add the following method to it: /** * Sets the current View mode (grid, list, etc.) * * @param string $mode */ public function setCurrentMode($mode) { $this->setData('_current_grid_mode', $mode); } You also need to create a config.xml file for it. Example_Catalog_Block_Product_List_Toolbar Now, in the admin panel, to change the layout of a category, go to Catalog > Manage Categories and select the category that you wish to change. Go to the Custom Design tab and in the field labelled Custom Layout Update , enter the following XML code: list Of course, remember to flush the layout caches of Magento or your change won't appear.
