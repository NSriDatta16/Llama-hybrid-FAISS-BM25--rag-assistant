Problem rotating image with MOUSE_MOVE

Hey gang. Stumped on something. I have a disc I am rotating with the mouse with event.MOUSE_MOVE, like a jog wheel on some audio equipment. Everything almost works as expected, but the problem I am experiencing is that the disc always jumps to the point where the user clicks on the disc. I need the point on the disc that the user clicks on to remain under the mouse while the user spins the disc but I can't seem to come up with the correct math to make it happen. Here's the code i am using: var xd = (_knob.x - _stageRef.stage.mouseX); var yd = (_knob.y - _stageRef.stage.mouseY); var radAngle = Math.atan2(yd, xd); _knob.rotation = int(radAngle * 360/(Math.PI * 2) - 90); _knob is a vector circle wrapped in a movieclip, with the circle centered on the movieclip's reg point. _stageRef represents the main stage. Any help would be awesome. I've scoured the interweb and can't come up with anything. Thx!
