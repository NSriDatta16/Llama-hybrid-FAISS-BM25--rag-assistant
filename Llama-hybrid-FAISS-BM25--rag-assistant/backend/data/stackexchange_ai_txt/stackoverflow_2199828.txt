Next to looking at performance issues with queries, I would also check whether the DB and the tables within the DB are not to much fragmented. You can issue the DBCC showcontig statement to check this. If it shows that the tables are heavily fragmented, you should consider creating a maintenance plan that is regularly executed. In that maintenance plan, you should specify that indexes should be rebuild. By doing so, the tables will be defragged.
