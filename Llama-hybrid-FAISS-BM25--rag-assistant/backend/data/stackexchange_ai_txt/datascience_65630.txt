If you are new to Deep Learning (or even if you have some experience), I recommend to use one of the classic architectures. Here you can find a simple tutorial of how to build a GAN in Pytorch. Here you can find the paper of the WGAN, that is the one that works normally the best for me. Here a medium blog that can be useful since everything is explained. And here some code that can help you to see how actually loss functions are implemented. # Adversarial loss ## Generator loss_G = -torch.mean(discriminator(gen_imgs)) ## Discriminator loss_D = -torch.mean(discriminator(real_imgs)) + torch.mean(discriminator(fake_imgs))
