How do you stress load dev database (server) locally?

Wow, this title gave me immediately "The question you're asking appears subjective and is likely to be closed." Anyway, after some searching and reading, I decided to ask it. Coming from my question: What are the first issues to check while optimizing an existing database? , which boiled down to necessity to stress load a local SQL Server dev database received as backup .bak file. Did I understand correctly the answer by paxdiablo to question: "DB (SQL) automated stress/load tools?" that there is no general purpose stress loading testing SQL tools independent on RDBMS? What are the stress test load-ing tools for SQL Server? What are you doing for cheap and dirty stress loading of local dev SQL Server database? Update: And I am interested in stress loading SQL Server 2000, 2005, 2008 databases (having no clue about 2000). OK, let's put aside final/real test (to QA speacialists, DBA and sysadmins) and confine the question in context of stress loading to find obvious (outrageous) flaws in design, performance bottlenecks.
