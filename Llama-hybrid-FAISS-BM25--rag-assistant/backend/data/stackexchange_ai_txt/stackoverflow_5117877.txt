Build a dll with static libraries

I want to build a DLL to use it as an IIS/ISAPI application. So far so good. It works. However, I have to drag arround the runtime dll and other dependencies (like some boost libraries). I would like to make a single DLL (in order to ease the deployment on multiple servers). So I changed the switch from /MD to /MT. However, now I get errors of duplicate symbols during link. For example : msvcprtd.lib(MSVCP100D.dll) : error LNK2005: "public: void __thiscall std::basic_ostream >::`vbase destructor'(void)" (??_D?$basic_ostream@DU?$char_traits@D@std@@@std@@QAEXXZ) already defined in gateway.obj I'm puzzled that /MD or /MT are compiler flags and not linkers flags. And it could in some way explain why I get duplicated symbols (as the will be included in each .obj). So the question is: how do I configure visual studio 10 in order to get a dll that includes all its dependencies.
