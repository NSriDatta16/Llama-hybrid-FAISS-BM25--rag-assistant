Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems like you want all the rows where the value in column c occurs more than twice. "Repeated" makes me think that they need to occur consecutively, which is what rle is for, but you would only want rows 1-4 if that was what you were trying to do. That said, the code below finds the rows where the value in column c occurs more than 2 times. I'm sure this can be done more elegantly, but it works. lines 2,1] Data[Rows,] # a b c #1 1 201 1 #2 2 202 1 #3 3 203 1 #4 4 204 1 #5 5 205 4 #7 7 207 4 #8 8 208 4
