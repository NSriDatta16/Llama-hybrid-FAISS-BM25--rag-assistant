By saying you want to "explain Y by X" it sounds that you try to build a classifier F that can map X values into expected Y: F(X) --> Y. If so, you don't have to search for "correlation" necessarily. There are various methods to build such a classifier. You can use logistic regression \ SVM \ Neural network \ etc. Besides, if it make more sense for you, you can always first discretize the continuous variables into categorical vars and than use also other methods such as decision trees \ Naive Bayes and more.
