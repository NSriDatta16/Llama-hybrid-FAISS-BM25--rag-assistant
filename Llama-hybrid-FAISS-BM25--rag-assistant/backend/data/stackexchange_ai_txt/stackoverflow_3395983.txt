Drag and drop ala GMail a gem for Ruby / Rack?

Is there a widget or a gem which implements this feature? It works only in Chrome and Firefox but it is very cool and no plugins are needed http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2010/04/drag-and-drop-attachments-onto-messages.html Or which would be the best practises to implement it?
