How Do I Import a 3D Object into Adobe Flex?

I wanted to know if anyone here knows how to import a 3D Object (i.e. Maya 3D Model) into Adobe Flex Application? I needed to create a simple Flex application which will allow me to rotate the 3D Object by dragging but I cannot seem to start doing it because I'm having a hard time trying to figure out how I can import my 3D model into Flex. This is exactly what I wanted to do: 3D Object in Flex I hope someone can help me. Thanks a lot :)
