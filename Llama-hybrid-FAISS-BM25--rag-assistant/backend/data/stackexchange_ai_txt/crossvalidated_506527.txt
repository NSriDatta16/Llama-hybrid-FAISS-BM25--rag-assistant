I think the issue here is that there is a dependency between Period and DAY . Since DAY is a covariate, emmeans() reduces it to its average when it determines the reference grid upon which the EMMs are based. Here is a simpler (and reproducible) example that illustrates this: set.seed(1.2021) fake = data.frame(Day = 1:50, Period = factor(c(rep("A",20), rep("B",10), rep("C",20))), y = rnorm(50) + 100 - 1:50) plot(y ~ Day, col = Period, data = fake) Here we can see that there is a linear trend with Day , and the periods comprise the first 20 days, the next 10 days, and the last 20 days, respectively. Now let's fit a model and obtain the EMMs: fake.lm = lm(y ~ Period + Day:Period, data = fake) library(emmeans) emmeans(fake.lm, "Period") #> NOTE: Results may be misleading due to involvement in interactions #> Period emmean SE df lower.CL upper.CL #> A 75.0 0.531 44 73.9 76.1 #> B 74.4 0.270 44 73.8 74.9 #> C 74.5 0.531 44 73.4 75.6 #> #> Confidence level used: 0.95 All the EMMs are about 75. This is because we are predicting everything on the same average value of Day : ref_grid(fake.lm)@grid #> Period Day .wgt. #> 1 A 25.5 20 #> 2 B 25.5 10 #> 3 C 25.5 20 But now let us account for the dependency between Period and Day by requiring that we compute the average Day for each Period : ref_grid(fake.lm, cov.reduce = Day ~ Period)@grid #> Period Day .wgt. #> 1 A 10.5 20 #> 2 B 25.5 10 #> 3 C 40.5 20 With this change, the EMMs reflect the averages we see in the graph: emmeans(fake.lm, "Period", cov.reduce = Day ~ Period) #> NOTE: Results may be misleading due to involvement in interactions #> Period emmean SE df lower.CL upper.CL #> A 89.69 0.1906 44 89.31 90.07 #> B 74.37 0.2696 44 73.82 74.91 #> C 59.63 0.1906 44 59.24 60.01 #> #> Confidence level used: 0.95 Created on 2021-01-25 by the reprex package (v0.3.0) In this example, the Period and interaction effects are very close to zero because the generated y values are just a linear function of Day . That makes all the EMMs in the first set about equal. In your example, there really are Period and interaction effects, making the results more irregular.
