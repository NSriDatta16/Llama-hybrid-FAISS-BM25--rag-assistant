Sounds to me that Y(X) is a sigmiodal process. Thus logistic regression should be suitable for this data. If you model this in R with: glm(Y~X,family=binomial) you will find that the "sharpness" of the transition is determined by the magnitude of the X coefficient, and the point of transition (technically the mid-point) is at the ratio of the intercept coefficient to the X coefficient times -1. I made an image to illustrate this but cannot seem to upload it for some reason.
