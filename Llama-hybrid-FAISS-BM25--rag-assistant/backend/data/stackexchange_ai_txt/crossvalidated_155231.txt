What are some examples of statistics problems where Bayesian and frequentist approaches give different answers?

I've heard of the one found here: http://www.behind-the-enemy-lines.com/2008/01/are-you-bayesian-or-frequentist-or.html about flipping a coin fourteen times, having it come up heads ten times, and then betting on whether the coin would come up heads on the next two tosses. Are there others? Are there any really classic problems in this area?
