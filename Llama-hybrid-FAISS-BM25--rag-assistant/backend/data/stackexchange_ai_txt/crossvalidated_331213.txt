Anomaly detection with geo spatial data

I have geo spatial data. Dataset represents concentration of something. For instance, social media activity of people in point [time, lat, lon] I have some list of feature for every points (lat, lon): constantly value for every time max value in time slice, more than average value in time slice etc How can I detect anomalies within these dataset? What method should I use to detect anomalies? I think to collect points (lot, lan) because their have features listed above. Then I have to use clustering methods for this points which were collected Which methods can be appropriate?
