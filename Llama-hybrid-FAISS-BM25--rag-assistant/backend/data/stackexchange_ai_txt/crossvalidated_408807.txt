Yes, there is theoretical basis, and No, we don't know why it works. Look up "forecast combination puzzle" in interweb, e.g. this presentation , p.20. Somehow, a simple average of multiple models appears to outperform single model forecast and weighted average forecasts in practice. There are many hypotheses of why this happens, but there is no consensus in forecasting literature. This could be because an optimal weight in a weighted average combination has too much noise, so in the end a simple average works better
