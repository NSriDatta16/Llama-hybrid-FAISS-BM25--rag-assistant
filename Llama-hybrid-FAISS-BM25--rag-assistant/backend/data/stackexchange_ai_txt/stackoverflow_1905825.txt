DHTML is not a standard, it's just an umbrella term for dynamic controls using a mixture of HTML, JavaScript, CSS, etc. Most sites include something that you could reasonably call "DHTML". HTML5, while promising and the "next big thing", is definitely not implemented across browsers yet. If you need compatibility with a variety of user agents, that is not the way to go. For maximum compatibility, HTML4 is sort of the gold standard at this point. XHTML 1.1 is also a good way to go, although it probably has a few more quirks than HTML4 at the moment. It really depends on your needs and preferred style between the two.
