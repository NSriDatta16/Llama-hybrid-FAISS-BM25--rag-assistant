Ok, so you have an app with multiple drag/drop datagrids, and you only want items dragged within a datagrid, and not from 1 to the other, is how I understand this. What you need to do is create a custom dragDrop event handler for each datagrid which has the following command: event.preventDefault() . This in effect will stop a datagrid from receiving items from another . This does not prohibit the dragging an item outside its host's borders, but it will prohibit the item being dropped into a different datagrid. HTH.
