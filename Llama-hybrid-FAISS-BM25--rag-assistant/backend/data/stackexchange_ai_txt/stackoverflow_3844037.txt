is iphone capable of switch between Wifi & 3G?

this is really important for me to switch between Wifi & 3G on iphone via code . so is there any possibility any backdoor or some way to crack. i can scan all the wifi hot spot and can drag their details but i need a background process that help me to scan 3g also and allow me to auto-switch whenever it finds wifi
