You should not be installing 3rd party controls unless the control provider has a redist agreement saying it is allowed. If installing the control requires anything beyond placing the file in your own application install location (such as requiring registry keys) then you really need to get an MSM from the control provider. After that, you would have to schedule your custom action to run after WriteRegistryValues on install and before RemoveRegistryValues on uninstall. The solution you get end up iwth is likely to be pretty fragile so be careful and good luck (and you might try to remove the requirement from the product in the future).
