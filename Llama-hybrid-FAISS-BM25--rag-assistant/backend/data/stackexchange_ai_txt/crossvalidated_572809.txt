Arima model not showing seasonality in its forecast

The following is a seasonal(not perfectly) time series sequence that I am trying to fit an ARIMA model to: I performed box-cox transformation, 1 seasonal differencing and 1 regular differencing to get the data in stationary format(confirmed by adf test). Following are the acf and pacf plots after the transformation: Then i used the following model to fit the data(I tried a few other combinations as well, but this one gave the best AIC): model The model specs: Series: data ARIMA(3,1,4)(3,1,1)[12] Box Cox transformation: lambda= 0.4061528 Coefficients: ar1 ar2 ar3 ma1 ma2 ma3 ma4 sar1 sar2 sar3 1.3674 -1.3623 0.8400 -1.4801 1.6890 -1.1270 0.2671 0.0487 -0.0524 -0.1724 s.e. 0.0490 0.0545 0.0474 0.0620 0.0731 0.0707 0.0454 0.0661 0.0554 0.0547 sma1 -0.7865 s.e. 0.0524 sigma^2 = 0.003792: log likelihood = 706.92 AIC=-1389.84 AICc=-1389.22 BIC=-1338.84 Training set error measures: ME RMSE MAE MPE MAPE MASE ACF1 Training set -0.001031931 0.1744619 0.1306821 0.01718023 2.23941 0.1712296 0.04060468 The model residual diagnostics are as follows: The residuals seem to be satisfying the requirements of zero mean and Homoscedasticity but not the normality assumption(shapiro test with a p-value of 0.001227). The forecast however, doesn't seem to replicate any sort of seasonal patterns, it is just a straight line(I used forecast(model, h=150) for this), there are no 10 year fluctuations, as there are in the original data: The model fit: What am I missing? Any suggestions?
