Well, imagine you need to patch a server and not stop it. If you do this in a "typical" language, that's going to involve some heavy magic. You have to grub around 'behind' the executing code. I think it'd require patching the function tables and so forth, all in assembly and manipulating the pointers to functions. A good place for bugs. In Lisp, the idea of updating without downtime is built into the language model. While there are some update complexities you can't get away from (how do you handle a long-running connection), it doesn't require the heavy magic of a compiled language. Although I haven't spent significant time on it (ie anything useful), I did work out a prototype of a server in Common Lisp that would do at least some live patching over a network without downtime.
