I have never seen sound analysis about suitableness of using PCA to pre-processing data for t-SNE. All those suggestions were just based on few examples. On the other side, I have encountered many cases (for data with >20K features), that PCA significantly alters the embedding, especially when large perplexity was used or correlation was used as distance metric. So, normally I won't use PCA for pre-processing for t-SNE.
