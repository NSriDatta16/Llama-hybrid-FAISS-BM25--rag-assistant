Connect a UILabel in Interface Builder and XCode?

I am trying to do something as simple as add a Label to a View in XCode and IB and I can't figure out how to do it. All the samples I find online are for older versions of IB so the directions aren't correct. I have a label on my .xib file, in my Controller.h file I have an IBOutlet UILabel declared with a Property set up. In my Controller.m file I synthesized that Property. In Interface Builder, I cannot for the LIFE of me figure out how to associate my label in my code with the Label on the .xib. Whenever I try to drag the Connection to File's Owner, the only option that shows up is "View". If I look at the Controller under the Library Window of Interface Builder, the Label shows up as a UILabel under Outlets. I am pretty sure that it used to be a type "id", but it automatically shows up as UILabel and if I try to add an "id" one, it doesn't work either. Can someone point me to somewhere to explain this stupid thing? It should not be this difficult to make a label have text.
