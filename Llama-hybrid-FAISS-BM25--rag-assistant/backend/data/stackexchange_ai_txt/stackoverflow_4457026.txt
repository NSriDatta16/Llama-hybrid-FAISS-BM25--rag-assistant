Problem with Zend and addRoute()

With this code: $frontController = Zend_Controller_Front::getInstance(); $router = $frontController->getRouter(); $router->addRoute( 'test', new Zend_Controller_Router_Route( '/test/:action/:type/:id', array( 'controller' => 'admin' ) ) ); http://app/test/param1/param2/param3 -> OK http://app/test/param1/param2/ -> FAIL In the second case the application don't recognize param2. It seems that the application needs the param3 in order to read the param2... How can I do it? Thanks! Test with the code from @RageZ $frontController = Zend_Controller_Front::getInstance(); $router = $frontController->getRouter(); $router->addRoute( 'test', new Zend_Controller_Router_Route( '/test/:action/:type/:id', array( 'controller' => 'admin', 'id' => 0 ), array( 'id' => '\d+' ) ) ); http://app/test/ -> OK http://app/test/some -> OK http://app/test/some/more -> FAIL http://app/test/some/more/andmore -> OK Ideas?
