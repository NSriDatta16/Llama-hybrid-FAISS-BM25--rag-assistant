@guddu Since you wait for the browser to load another page, use Browser.Sync where applicable. If an object does not appear right after a page is reloaded, use .Exist method with a parameter. Example: boolRC = Browser("Home").Page("Shopping Cart").WebElement("$3.99").Exist(15) This way, you give up to 15 seconds for an object to appear. If the object appears earlier, your script moves on faster. If the object becomes available for operating with a delay after it's appeared, use WaitProperty method, as @katmoon pointed out. Finally, you can implement your own synchronization function with customizable parameters like event (appear/disappear, etc.), time-out, property to check...
