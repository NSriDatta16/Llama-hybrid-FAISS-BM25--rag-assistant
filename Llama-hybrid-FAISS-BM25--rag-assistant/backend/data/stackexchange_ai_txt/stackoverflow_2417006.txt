You can use UIView subclass and handle touch event there. Methods to look at (defined in UIResponder ): - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event - (void)touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event - (void)touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event - (void)touchesCancelled:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event If you want to use "invisible" UIButton you should set its type to UIButtonTypeCustom - by default it will appear with no image and title and with transparent background. So technically it will be invisible to user but still be able to respond to all events.
