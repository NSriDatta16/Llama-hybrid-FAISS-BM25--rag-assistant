How to clear screen area or Redraw screen in C#

I am creating a User Control in C#.Net 2.0. I have to apply drag and Drop Images in between these controls. I have done drag and drop effect. But the problem is that i have to show the control movement while mouse dragging. For that i am drawing a rectangle on screen with the help of ControlDraw.DrawReversibleFrame() Problem is that while drawing with mouse move event Rectangle is drawn over whole screen and because no repaint on screen it exist on screen. So please can anybody tell me either how to clear drawn graphics or how to force to redraw screen.
