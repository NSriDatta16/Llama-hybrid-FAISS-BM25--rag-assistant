Calculating boxplots with imputed data

I have imputed a dataset which has over 200 variables, and 20 observations. In worst case, 80% of the data is missing, in the best case 100% is available. 5 out of the 20 participants provided data for all the variables. Participants were aksed to rate the importance of 13 variables under a certain circumstance, from 0 to 25. I imputed this using mice(imp=25, max_it=25) , and got a nice dataset after a few hours. I'm now analysing it using boxplots per circumstance (thus 13 boxplots at a time), but wonder how I should do this. From a Dutch textbook, I understood that you do the tests for each imputation, and then average the results. Does that mean that I should calculate the data for each variable/imputation, and then divide by 25? It seems a bit crude... I also wonder how much it differs for these descriptive statistics...
