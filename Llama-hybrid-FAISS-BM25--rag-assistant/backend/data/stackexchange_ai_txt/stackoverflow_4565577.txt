Assuming a customer can only be signed to at most one agent, then you need a foreign key column in the customers table that points to the agent table (rather than pointing from agent to customer, as your question suggested): CREATE TABLE agents ( agent_id int PRIMARY KEY, ... more columns ... ); CREATE TABLE customers ( customer_id int PRIMARY KEY, agent_id int REFERENCES agents, ... more columns ... ); (If, however, a customer can be signed to multiple agents, then you need OMG Ponies' answer with a linkage table. You need to clarify for yourself what you need.)
