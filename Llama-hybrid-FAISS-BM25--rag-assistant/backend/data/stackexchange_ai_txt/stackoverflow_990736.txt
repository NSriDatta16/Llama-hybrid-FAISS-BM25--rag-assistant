Well, you might want to think of the following "model" for a guess: guess = right answer + error If we ask a lot of people a question, we'll get lots of different guesses. But if, for some reason, the distribution of error s is symmetric around zero (actually it just has to have zero mean) then the average of the guesses will be a pretty good predictor of the right answer. Note that the guesses don't necessarily have to be good -- i.e., the errors could indeed be large (grade B or C, rather than A) as long as there are grade B and C answers distributed on both sides of the right answer. Of course, there are cases where this is a terrible model for our guesses, so collective intelligence won't always work...
