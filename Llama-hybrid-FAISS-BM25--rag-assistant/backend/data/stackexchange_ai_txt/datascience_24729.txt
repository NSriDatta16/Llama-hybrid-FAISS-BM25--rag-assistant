One hot encoding alternatives for large categorical values

I have a data frame with large categorical values over 1600 categories. Is there any way I can find alternatives so that I don't have over 1600 columns? I found this interesting link . But they are converting to class/object which I don't want. I want my final output as a data frame so that I can test with different machine learning models? Or, is there any way I can use the generated matrix to train the other machine learning models other than Logistic regression or XGBoost? Is there anyway I can implement it?
