JBoss 6 unpacks jars from WEB-INF/lib of war

when I start JBoss 6 I see that it unpacks all jar files from WEB-INF/lib in tmp/vfs/automountXXX folder. E.g. jackrabbit-server.war contains library asm-3.1.jar, then in tmp folder I see the following folders with files: asm-3.1.jar-83dc35ead0d41d41/asm-3.1.jar asm-3.1.jar-2a48f1c13ec7f25d/contents/"unpacked asm-3.1.jar" it does not take files from my.ear/lib only WEB-INF/lib... Why is it so? And is here any way to prevent it doing so? It just slows down application server starting (and stopping), what is not that comfortable at development... btw. repacking war to ear structure that way, gave me the same working application and saved 1 minute while application server starts... 1 minute is good enough... I hope there is simpler way, wihtout repacking in development mode. If it is somehow related to JavaEE 6 specification and ejb-jars, which can be located now in WEB-INF/lib, so I don't have such libraries in my war files... UPDATE : actually when I repack jackrabbit-server.war to jackrabbit-server.ear which contains jackrabbit-server.war and moved all its libraries to jackrabbit-server.ear/lib then I still see two folders in tmp: asm-3.1.jar-215a36131ebb088e/asm-3.1.jar asm-3.1.jar-14695f157664f00/contents/ but in this case last folder is empty. So it still creates two folders, but does not unpack my library. Also I use exploded deployment so the question is only about jar files, not unpacking ear/war.
