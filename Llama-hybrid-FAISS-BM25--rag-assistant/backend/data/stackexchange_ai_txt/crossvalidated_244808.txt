How to find the combined variable with sub variables?

I asked many questions to the Respondents. Each question represent a variable and they are part of the main variable. Each question has two possible answers : Agree and Disagree which I have coded to 1 and 0 respectively. It is like following: Vraiables: tax_revenue_a tax_revenue_b tax_revenue_c non_tax_revenue_a non_tax_revenue_b non_tax_revenue_c I need to combine the result to main variable like tax_revenue and non_tax_revenue and use it in cross tabulation. Can I simply sum up the variables and use it like following? or Can I get the average of the sub-variables as the combined variables? Sum: tax_revenue_sum = tax_revenue_a + tax_revenue_b + tax_revenue_c non_tax_revenue_sum = non_tax_revenue_a + non_tax_revenue_b + non_tax_revenue_c Average: tax_revenue_avg = (tax_revenue_a + tax_revenue_b + tax_revenue_c) / 3 non_tax_revenue_avg = (non_tax_revenue_a + non_tax_revenue_b + non_tax_revenue_c) /3 I have many more sub variables I have to use the result in cross-tabulation. If there are 3 sub-variables, we get value in range [0,3] if we sum up. If there are more than 3 sub-variables, there will be more levels and it is not very good to use in cross tabulation. I need to change this to dichotomous - Agree / Disagree variables. Can the variable be broken at middle to get agree/disagree. For an example, if I have summed up 3 variables to get [0,3], then will recoding it as follows is okay or I need to try another method? if combined variable is Sum of sub-variables: Any value less than 1.5 => 0 (Disagree) Any value greater than 1.5 => 1 (Agree) If combined variable is Average of sub-variables: Any value less than 0.5 => 0 (Disagree) Any value more than 0.5 => 1 (Agree) How can it be done in better way? Is there any resource where I can find more about this?
