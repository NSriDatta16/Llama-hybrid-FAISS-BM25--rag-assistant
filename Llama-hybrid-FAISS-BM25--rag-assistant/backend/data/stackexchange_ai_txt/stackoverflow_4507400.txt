header('Content-Type: text/plain') is correct. You must call this method before anything is written to your output, including white space. Check for whitespace before your opening . If your Content-Type header has been set to text/plain , no browser in its right mind would collapse whitespace. That behaviour is exclusive to HTML and similar formats. I'm sure you have your reasons, but as a rule, serving static content through PHP uses unnecessary server resources. Every hit to PHP is typically a new process spawn and a few megs of memory. You can use apache config directives to point to different robots files based on headers like User-Agent - I'd be looking into that. It's likely that search engines ignore the Content-Type header, so this shouldn't be an issue anyway. Hope this helps. -n
