That is one of the big problems of every website with LOTS of users. Think about Facebook, how many requests do they get every second? How many servers do they have to store all the data? If they have many servers, how do they separate the data across the servers? If they separate the data across the servers, how would they be able to call normal SQL queries on multiple servers and then join the results? And so on. Now to avoid complicating things for you by answering all these questions (which will most probably make you give up :-)), I would suggest using Google AppEngine. It is a bit difficult at the beginning, but once you get used to it you will appreciate the time you spent learning it. If you are only having a database and you don't have many requests, and your concern is just the storage, then you should consider moving to MSSQL or -better as far as I know- Oracle. Hope that helps.
