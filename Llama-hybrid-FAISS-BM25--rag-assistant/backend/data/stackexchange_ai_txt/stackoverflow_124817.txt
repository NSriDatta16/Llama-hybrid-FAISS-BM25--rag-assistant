I don't have an exact answer for what you wish to do. However you may wish to think about building the whole document on your server. MS Excel 97 onwards supports creating a simple XML or HTML (with tables) file and just calling the file something-uniqueid.xls It's possible that MS Word also does something similar. Take any basic HTML file (use tags for a start) and change the name to something.doc See if Word will open it by double clicking it. If this works you can serve up the whole document as a html file but tell the client that it is called something-unique-id#.doc For this to work from a web server you will need to set the HTTP headers Content-type: application/msword and Content-disposition: Attachment; filename=something-unique-id.doc Please check the MIME type for msword.. i'm not sure if that is correct. Last but not least to be 100% sure try using URLs with the very last GET variable set to .doc this means your URL should look like /listing.asp?var1=abc&var2=def&output=.doc This was necessary nine years ago to give 100% coverage of the browsers. You'd have to test whether it was still required.
