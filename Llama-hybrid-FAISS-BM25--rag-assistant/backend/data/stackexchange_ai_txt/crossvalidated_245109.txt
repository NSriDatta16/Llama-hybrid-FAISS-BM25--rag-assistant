how do you calculate the number of combinations recursive partitioning uses in decision trees?

So I was wondering why random forests limit the levels of a variable to 32 levels, and I found an answer here : R's randomForest can not handle more than 32 levels. What is workaround? My question is why is the solution 2^N+2 ? I thought it would be the classic combination equation of N choose K, such that if I had 32 levels of data, choosing 2 at a time to partition would yield 32=N choose 2=K producing : N! / K!(N-K)! 32! / 2!(30!) =496
