I would recommend these resources to you: Tom Mitchell: Carnegie Mellon University (Only for Supervised Learning and follows Bishop) Pattern Recognition: Indian Institute of Science (I personally like this course as I have attended it, but this course requires you to know probability theory.) Both the courses are maths oriented, for a lighter course on machine learning would be "Machine Learning" by Udacity
