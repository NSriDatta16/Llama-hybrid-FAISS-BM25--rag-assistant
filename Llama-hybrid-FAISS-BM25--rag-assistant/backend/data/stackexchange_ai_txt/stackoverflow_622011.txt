iPhone debugging: variables are not up to date?

I've only recently began using the debugger extensively, so I'm not sure if this is a limitation. When I debug on the iPhone, the variables aren't up to date unless I explicitly view it ( ctrl + click -> view variable as expression ). Is there a way to view actual variables without viewing explicitly?
