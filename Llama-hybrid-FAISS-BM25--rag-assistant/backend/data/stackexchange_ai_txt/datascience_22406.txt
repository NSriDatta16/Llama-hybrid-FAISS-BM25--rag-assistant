New values for categorical variable in Prediction dataset

I am performing regression task using *random forest**.In my prediction set I am having *new levels for categorical variable** which are not present in training data .Currently I am performing one hot encoding to handle this.At present I am not getting considerable results. This article is saying that it is not good to perform one hot encoding .How to handle this case?
