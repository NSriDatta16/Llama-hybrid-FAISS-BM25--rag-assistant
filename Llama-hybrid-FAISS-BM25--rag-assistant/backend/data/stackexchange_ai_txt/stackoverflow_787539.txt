Using #pragma once should work on any modern compiler, but I don't see any reason not to use a standard #ifndef include guard. It works just fine. The one caveat is that GCC didn't support #pragma once before version 3.4 . I also found that, at least on GCC, it recognizes the standard #ifndef include guard and optimizes it , so it shouldn't be much slower than #pragma once .
