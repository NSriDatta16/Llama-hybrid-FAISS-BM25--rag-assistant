Machine learning algorithm which gives multiple outputs from single input

I need some help, i am working on a problem where i have the OCR of an image of an invoice and i want to extract certain data from it like invoice number, amount, date etc which is all present within the OCR. I tried with the classification model where i was individually passing each sentence from the OCR to the model and to predict it the invoice number or date or anything else, but this approach takes a lot of time and i don't think this is the right approach. So, i was thinking whether there is an algorithm where i can have an input string and have outputs mapped from that string like, invoice number, date and amount are present within the string. E.g: Inp string: the invoice #1234 is due on 12 oct 2018 with amount of 287 Output: Invoice Number: #1234, Date: 12 oct 2018, Amount 287 So, my question is, is there an algorithm which i can train on several invoices and then make predictions?
