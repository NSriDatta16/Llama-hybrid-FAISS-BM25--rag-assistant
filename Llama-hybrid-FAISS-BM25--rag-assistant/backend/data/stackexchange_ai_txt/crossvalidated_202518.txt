Prior Parameters in Bayesian Hierarchical Linear model

I'm trying to fit a linear model to describe student performance in 2 different schools. My response variable is $$Y_{ij}= X_{ij}*\beta+Z_{ij}*\gamma_j + \epsilon_{ij}$$ . $$i = 1,...,n $$ $$j = 1,2 $$ $\beta $ are the fixed parameters, while $\gamma_j$ is the vector of mixed ones. $\epsilon_{ij}$ ~ $N(0,\sigma^2)$ $\sigma^2$ ~ $Inv-Gamma(a,b)$ $\beta$ ~ $N_p(b_0,B_0)$ $\gamma_j$ ~ $N_p(0,\Sigma)$ $\Sigma$ ~ $Inverse-Wishart(S_0^{-1},\eta_0)$ . In my model $X_{ij}$ and $Z_{ij}$ are the same, so that to each predictor is associated a fixed and a random effect. I've tried to implement this model both with MCMChregress function in R and $Jags$, but unfortunately I can't find any literature regarding the parameters of my mixed effects (for $\beta$ I used an uninformative prior and then I cheated using the ols estimates, but I still get no significance in my mixed effects ).
