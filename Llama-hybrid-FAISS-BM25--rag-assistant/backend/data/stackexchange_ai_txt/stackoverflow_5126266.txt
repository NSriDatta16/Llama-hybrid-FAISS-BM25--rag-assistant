One important difference, I suppose, lies in the fact that : malloc is the C-way of allocating memories ; and there were no exceptions in C new is the C++, object-oriented and all, way ; and there are exceptions in C++, and using them is more clean . Why keep malloc in C++ ? I suppose it's because C++ compiler can also work with C code... ... But I've often heard (from teachers, while I was still at school, a couple of years ago) that using malloc in C++ is discouraged, and new should be used instead.
