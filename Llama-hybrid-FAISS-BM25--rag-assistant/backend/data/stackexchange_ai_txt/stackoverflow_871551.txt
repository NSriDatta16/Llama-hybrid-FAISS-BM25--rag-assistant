Add background image/color to DMG using hdiutil or other tool?

Possible Duplicate: How do I create a nice-looking DMG for Mac OS X using command-line tools? It seems like using Finder UX or some sort of UI tool ( Create drag-drop graphic when installing OS X application from dmg ) the only way to customize how a DMG looks when opened up. That doesn't scale too well and isn't automatable enough. Anyone know of way to achieve the same thing but using tools such as hdiutil on Mac or mkfs.hfsplus on Linux?
