By "which domain they're being loaded from" do you mean: The SWF itself? The page that contains the SWF? If #1, you can get the value easily from the root.loaderInfo.url property of any display object. #2 is trickier. If allowscriptaccess is set to true in the embed code, you can use Javascript with an ExternalInterface call. It's on the document.location.host or document.location.hostname . If you don't have access to Javascript (like if your SWF is in a Facebook post), you'll need to do a little setup, and the solution will be dependent on the user's browser behaving. Here's one way to do it: Set up a server-side script that your SWF can ping. This script should look for the http "referer" header, and send that back when pinged. Then have your SWF send a URLRequest to this script. The data will be the embedding site. In PHP, the script would just be echo $_SERVER["HTTP_REFERER"]; . It's similarly simple in most other languages. Here's another way to do it: How do I get the domain of the page that's loading my swf when I don't have script access? If you just want to protect your SWF from being embedded in others' pages, that's easier. Just check for ExternalInterface.available . If it's false, disable the SWF. If it's true, check the domain using the above (#1) method and disable the SWF if the domain is wrong.
