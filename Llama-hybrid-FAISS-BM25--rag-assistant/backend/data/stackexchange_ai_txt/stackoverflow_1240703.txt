storage of user, error, exception messages (c++)

Rather simple question. Where should I store error,exception, user messages? By far, I always declared local strings inside the function where it is going to be invoked and did not bother. e.g. SomeClass::function1(...) { std::string str1("message1"); std::string str2("message2"); std::string str3("message3"); ... // some code ... } Suddenly I realized that since construction & initialization are called each time and it might be quite expensive. Would it be better to store them as static strings in class or even in a separate module? Localization is not the case here. Thanks in advance.
