Using SQLite over a network share is a dangerous practice due to the buggy implementations of network file sharing software on both UNIX and Windows machines (causing SQLite locking mechanism to fail sometimes). Don't be surprised if your database gets corrupted this way. So - regardless of your current problem, I'd advise you change your software to prevent using a network share with SQLite. If you still want to use the network share solution - I'd suggest you add Synchronous=Full pragma (or its equivalent) to the connection string you are using in order to make SQLite flush everything to disk synchronously.
