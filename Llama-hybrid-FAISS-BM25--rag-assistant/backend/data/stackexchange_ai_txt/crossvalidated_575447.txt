Will these skills in machine learning be relevant in fall 2023?

I have a masters in civil engineering but would like to work within IT. From my education I have a mathematical and data analysis background. I'm considering taking a course in machine learning to learn the methods/tools currently used in data analysis. I graduated from uni 10yrs ago, so my skills in IT are probably outdated. The course in machine learning will take 1 year to complete and will cover the following: has knowledge of processes and methods that are used to solve data-driven problemsList item has knowledge of processes tools that are used for programming with Python has knowledge of data collection and preparation that is used for Machine Learning tasks has knowledge of tools, development methodologies and processes that are used in Machine Learning applications can update his/her knowledge related to data mining, programming and machine learning has a knowledge of the IT industry and is familiar with the importance of Machine Learning understands the importance of effective and situation-appropriate data visualisations for communicating the outcome of Machine Learning can apply knowledge to identify and solve problems using Machine Learning masters descriptive statistical techniques and tools to evaluate and prepare data for Machine Learning modelling masters relevant tools and techniques for programming applications that utilize Machine Learning masters relevant tools, materials and techniques to solve real-world IT problems can find information relevant to developing Machine Learning applications can study a data problem situation and identify code and optimisation issues and what measures need to be implemented to solve the problem understands the ethical guidelines and codes of conduct that apply in Machine Learning can carry out Machine Learning projects using problem that can be solved using applied Machine Learning can build relations with his/her peers across discipline boundaries and with external target groups can develop Machine Learning applications using programming languages can develop work methods and present the results of Machine Learning applications My questions are, is this course worth taking? will the skills learnt be relevant to the job market in approx. fall 2023? Thank you for your response :)
