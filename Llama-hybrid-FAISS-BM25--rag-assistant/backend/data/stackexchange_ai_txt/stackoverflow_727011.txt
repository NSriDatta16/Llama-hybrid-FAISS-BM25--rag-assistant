It's not possible to over-emphasize what Robert Rossney just said, but I'll try. ;-) The benefit of International Standards is that, when everybody follows them, life is good. All our software gets along peacefully. XML has to be one of the most important standards we have. It's the basis of "old web" stuff like SOAP, and still 'web 2.0' stuff like RSS and Atom. It's because of clear standards that XML is able to interoperate between different platforms. If we give up on XML, little by little, we'll get into a situation where a producer of XML will not be able to assume that a consumer of XML will be able to consumer their content. This would have a disasterous affect on the industry. We should push back very forcefully, on anyone who writes code that does not process XML according to the standard. I understand that, in these economic times, there is a reluctance to offend customers and business partners by saying "no". But in this case, I think it's worth it. We would be in much worse financial shape if we had to hand-craft XML for each business partner. So, don't "enable" companies who do not understand XML. Send them the standard, with the appropriate lines highlighted. They need to stop thinking that XML is just text with angle brackets in it. It simply does not behave like text with angle brackets in it. It's not like there's an excuse for this. Even the smallest embedded devices can have full-featured XML parser implementations in them. I have not yet heard a good reason for not being able to parse standard XML, even if one can't afford a fully-featured DOM implementation.
