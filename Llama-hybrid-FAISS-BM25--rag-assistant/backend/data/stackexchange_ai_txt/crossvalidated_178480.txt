You are dealing with a clasification problem with mixed variable types (continuous and categorical) along with missing data. Now in this case, rather than SVM or GMM, a decision or a random forest classifier is more appropriate. These classifiers will work even in the presence of missing data. And don't replace the missing data with -1 because the technique considers that it is its actual value. Replace it with a value so that the algorithm considers it as a missing value. For example, replace these values as NaN in Matlab or ? in Weka, according to the programming platform.
