As previous respondents have said, (Bayesian) hypothesis testing and (Bayesian) continuous-parameter estimation provide different information in response to different questions. There may be some occasions in which the researcher really needs an answer to a test of a null hypothesis. In this case, a carefully conducted Bayesian hypothesis test (using meaningfully informed, non-default priors) can be very useful. But all too often null-hypothesis tests are "mindless rituals" (Gigerenzer et al.) and make it easy for the analyst to lapse into fallacious "black and white" thinking about presence or absence of effects. A preprint at OSF provides an extended discussion of frequentist and Bayesian approaches to hypothesis testing and estimation with uncertainty, organized around this table: You can find the preprint here: https://osf.io/dktc5/
