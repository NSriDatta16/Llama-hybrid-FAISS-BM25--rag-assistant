Number of independent samples for weighted samples?

I am taking random samples from one distribution, $f(x)$, but trying to get information about another distribution, $g(x)$. I have a weighting function, $w(x)=Cg(x)/f(x)$, to correct for this. The result is that I have $N$ independent samples, with different weights, $w_i$, attached to them. The question is then, what is a good estimate for the number of independent samples I really have. For example, if my weights are {0.49, 0.48, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01} then I have pretty close to 2 independent samples. If they are {0.3, 0.3, 0.4} then I have about 3. Presumably there is a quantitative way to do this. Also, how could I determine, given $f(x)$ and $w(x)$, what the efficiency of sampling is (i.e. How many independent samples of $g(x)$ do I, on average, get for $N$ samples of $f(x)$)?
