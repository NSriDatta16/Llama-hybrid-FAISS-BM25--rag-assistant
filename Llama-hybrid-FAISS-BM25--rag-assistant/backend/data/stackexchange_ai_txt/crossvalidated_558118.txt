As you point out, at least for "real" processes which happen over historical time, there is no way we can tell whether they look ergodic or not: a single realization is all we get to see. I think is was A.J. Ayer who said that, for a question to be meaningful, we should be able to describe an experiment whose outcome would provide an answer. Inasmuch as we cannot experiment reversing time, we probably cannot answer your question for time processes. I conjecture that we could obtain empirical results close to ergodicity for processes not indexed over time. For instance, if we could measure a magnitude (e.g., temperature) along infinite paths in different directions starting from planet Earth, it is conceivable that the averages measured along each "ray" might be close to the ensemble average. But this is mere speculation.
