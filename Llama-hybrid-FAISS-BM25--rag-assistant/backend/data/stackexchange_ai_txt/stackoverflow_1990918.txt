OCR is very, very hard. Even with computer-generated characters, it's quite challenging if you don't know the font and font size in advance. Even if you're matching characters exactly, I would not call it a "beginning" programming project; it's quite subtle. If you want to recognize scanned, or handwritten characters, that's even harder - you'll need to use advanced math, algorithms, and machine learning. There are quite a few books and thousands of articles written about this topic, so you don't need to reinvent the wheel. I admire your effort, but I don't think you've gotten far enough to hit any of the actual difficulties yet. So far you're just randomly exploring pixels and copying them from one array to another. You haven't actually done any comparison yet, and I'm not sure the purpose of your "random walk". Why random? Writing correct randomized algorithms is quite difficult. I would recommend starting with a deterministic algorithm first. Why are you copying from one array to another? Why not just compare directly? When you get the comparison, you'll have to deal with the fact that the image is not exactly the same as the "prototype", and it's not clear how you'll deal with that. Based on the code you've written so far, though, I have an idea for you: try writing a program that finds its way through a "maze" in an image. The input would be the image, plus the start pixel and the goal pixel. The output is a path through the maze from the start to the goal. This is a much easier problem than OCR - solving mazes is something that computers are great for - but it's still fun and challenging.
