How to run python script on my server?

I have a server hosting by Blueshot. I have been using php to get post variables from iPhone... But now I have to use python to get post variable from iPhone. I wrote something like this import cgi import cgitb; cgitb.enable() # for troubleshooting print "Content-type: text/html" print print """ Sample CGI Script Sample CGI Script """ form = cgi.FieldStorage() message = form.getvalue("message", "(no message)") print """ Previous message: %s form message: """ % message And uploaded to my server but it doesn't work...If I navigate to the page then it just shows the source code.. I don't know whether or not python is installed on my server (I believe python might be installed as default)..How do I check if python is runnable on my server and if not how can I run python scripts on my server? All I want to do is to get POST variables from iPhone (I know how to send the variables from iPhone) Thanks in advance...
