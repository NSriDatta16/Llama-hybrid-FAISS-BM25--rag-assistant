How do you calculate log likelihood p(x) for a VAE?

I was reading the Importance Weighted Autoencoders paper and its experiment section compares the density estimation result on MNIST for IWAE vs VAE. I know that density estimation estimating log p(x) of test set examples (where x: observed data, z: latent) under the model, and higher log p(x) is better. However, how do you compute log p(x) on a test set data using a VAE? I thought that involves computing an intractable integral, but the paper includes many statistics of log p(x) under different VAE configurations without mentioning how they computed these values. Thanks in advance!
