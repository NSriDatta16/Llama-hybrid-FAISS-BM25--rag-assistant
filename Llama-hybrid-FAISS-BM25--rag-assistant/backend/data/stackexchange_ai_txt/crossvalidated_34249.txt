I have taught statistics to business majors (undergraduates and MBAs) at Cal State Fullerton and USC at Irvine. I can recommend the business statistics books that i have used. These books include general hypothesis testing and time series in addition to regression but they are all well written use business applications and give excellent coverage to regression. As an MBA student you should be interested in these other aspects of statistics related to business anyway. Here is my list: Not a book that I used because it is more recent but still excellent: Business Statistics: A First Course Also not one that i used but David Moore is an excellent writer of introductory statistics books: The Practice of Business Statistics This is the book I used (an earlier edition): The Practice of Business Statistics I know Jay Devore very well. He is an excellent writer: Probability and Statistics for Engineering and the Sciences I know Steve Book very well and highly recommend this book: Statistical Analysis: Resolving Decision Problems in Business and Management
