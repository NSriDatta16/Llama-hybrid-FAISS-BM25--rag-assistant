The 1st, 2nd, and 4th numbers are the average of the 1st, 2nd, and 4th lists, but the 3rd is not. I'll assume that's a typo, and you meant '69.666...'. You went wrong in the 'L[i][j] / i' bit. You can think of that statement as computing a value, and then dropping it; you don't assign it to anything. You might want to return a new list as well, perhaps, rather than putting values into the parameter. Also, you went wrong in the looping and indexing, and not actually calculating an average. Also, you went wrong in the j loop: what if some list has more values than another one? Also, you went 'wrong' by not making it pythonic and looping over the list with range and indexing, rather than looping over the items themselves ('for sublist in L: ...'). Also, you went 'wrong' by not using list comprehensions. This is what I would have done: def avrg(L): return [sum(sublist) / len(sublist) for sublist in L] print(avrg([[85, 23, 45], [66, 75, 54], [85, 54, 70], [34, 10, 0]])
