Beware you foolish mortals. The Entity That Is has indeed fed on your polymorphed objects. But this also means that you have inherited the Big Slimy Interface that lurks in the dark. So you can retire your puny barbarians (by proxy if you wish). And yes, thanks to the Entity That Is, your objects got lazy and have their garbage collected. So their joy is only temporary because their life is immediate ended when they move out of scope. And not a single one of then can get away. If you show fear to the Entity That Is, dead is only a destructor away. So be careful when you ride the waves of the workflow, because they are as unpredictable as the average market stock. Your objects are never save for the Entity That Is. Persistance can back them up for a while but eventually all wil fail as the last clock cycle has rung. Fortunately thanks to persistance, your objects can be send to better places where they can multiply and live in peace. The Entity That Is, is strict but fair, so if you use the propert command, your virtual doors to other realities wil open and allow swift and reliable trafic. Good luck and honour the Entity That Is, you may not always agree with it, but its rule is the law and death the only penalty.
