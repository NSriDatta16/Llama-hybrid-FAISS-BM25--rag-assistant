You may be looking for count data models (google that term). Poisson regression or Negative Binomial regressions are standard examples of Generalized Linear Models. Your favorite statistics package should be able to deal with those. In R, for instance, look at glm() . If you have time series ("events" suggests time series to me), you may want to look at integer autoregressive models, or INAR. You may get better answers if you could be a bit more specific about your situation and about what you are trying to achieve.
