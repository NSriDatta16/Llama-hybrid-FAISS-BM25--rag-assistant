Type HELP MEMORY for your options. Error in ==> dist>apply at 119 z = zeros(S,Q); Error in ==> boiler_weight at 38 result = apply(a,b,c); Error in ==> dist at 90 boiler_weight Error in ==> newrb>designrb at 143 P = radbas(dist(p',p)*b); Error in ==> newrb at 127 [w1,b1,w2,b2,tr] = designrb(p,t,goal,spread,mn,df);** I'm working with 2 GB RAM Virtual Memory Initial size 4 GB & Maximum size 8 GB I tried Maximizing the virtual memory Under Windows XP x32, I managed to almost double the amount of memory available to Matlab by editing boot.ini to add the switch /3GB /USERVA=3030 /fastdetect /3GB /USERVA=3030 pack (for memory defragmentation) but all this with no use Any help please ?!!!!!!
