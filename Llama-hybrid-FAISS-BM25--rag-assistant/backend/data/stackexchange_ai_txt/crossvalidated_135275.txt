Subject-specific graphics for repeated-measure design

I am doing linear mixed effect modelling testing the effect of treatment on pitch , with repetitions nested inside items , in turn nested within speakers . I am looking for ways to present my data like in the following graph, x-axis marking treatment in my case and ColorScheme marking item . I have 10 speakers, so I want to generate 10 graphs, preferably all shown together or in two pages. Is this doable? Data: Note on my data: tone is the treatment int is the five sample points I take on a repetition, which for graphics purpose should be averaged? semitone is the dependant variable I want speaker to go on the x-axis I want item to be on the ColorScheme (there are three items) I want repetitions averaged for graphics purpose. Part of actual data can be found in https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8Q7ztgF6nEPNWtqRnRsSW1RU0k/view?usp=sharing
