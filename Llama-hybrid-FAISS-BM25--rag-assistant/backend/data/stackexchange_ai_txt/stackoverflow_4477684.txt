Three words: Here be dragons . By going off the path of doing things "The Rails Way", then you will encounter foes of unimaginable power and cunning. At first, you will think "OH HO HO I am doing it my way, aren't I awesome?". Then you'll grow tired. Exhausted even. Forlornly, during your struggles, you'll look at all the cool gem s that are using Active Record and wonder why you chose to venture down a path so fraught with doom and gloom it would make Chuck Norris shit his pants. Please, do not stray from Active Record. It is only here to help you, not hinder you. If you wish to write your own queries then there is a find_by_sql method, or an even lower Model.connection.execute method. However, these should only be used, much like nuclear weaponry, in times of exceptionally dire needs. If you don't want to use Active Record at all, then I would encourage you to look at either DataMapper or Mongoid . DataMapper provides much of the same functionality as Active Record and some have been known to prefer the syntax. As a bit of trivia: it was one of the first gems to be compatible with Rails 3. Mongoid on the other hand is for MongoDB databases, which some other people also fancy. I beg again: do not stray from the beaten path, lest you want a beating yourself.
