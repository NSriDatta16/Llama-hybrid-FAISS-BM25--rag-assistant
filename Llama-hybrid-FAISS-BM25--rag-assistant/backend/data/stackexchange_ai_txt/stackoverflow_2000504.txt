Magento Catalog Search (filter by id)

I'm writing a custom plugin thing which needs to search the product catalog. Based on some sample code I saw somewhere (possibly this site), I came up with this working prototype: $searcher = Mage::getSingleton('catalogsearch/advanced') -> addFilters(array('name' => $_REQUEST['name'])) -> addFilters(array('sku' => $_REQUEST['sku'])) ; $products = $searcher->getProductCollection(); This works great for those two fields, but I also need to search by product id. It seems like the proper field to search on is 'entity_id', but its not working: $searcher->addFilters(array('entity_id' => $_REQUEST['id'])); I've also tried using 'product_id' and simply 'id' with no luck. Keep getting this error: Mage_Core_Exception: You have to specify at least one search term Any thoughts on how to accomplish this? Maybe I should be using a different class to do my searching?
