I don't know much about what you're doing but how about these rules of thumb? If you're having to store the points in a Collection of some sort, then make them classes to save the overhead of boxing structs for storage. If you're just using the points as input data to another object for processing, e.g. as points in a mesh for processing, then prefer an array to save the Collection class overheads. If you're storing the points in an array then just make them structs as this is more efficient than making them classes.
