Let me play Devil's Advocate here. I think many answers have made convincing cases that the boss' procedure is fundamentally mistaken. At the same time, I offer a counter-example that illustrates that the boss may have actually seen results improve with this mistaken transformation. I think that acknowledging that this procedure might've "worked" for the boss could begin a more-persuasive argument: Sure, it did work, but only under these lucky circumstances that usually won't hold. Then we can show -- as in the excellent accepted answer -- how bad it can be when we're not lucky. Which is most of the time. In isolation, showing the boss how bad it can be might not persuade him because he might have seen a case where it does improve things, and figure that our fancy argument must have a flaw somewhere. I found this data online, and sure enough, it appears that the regression is improved by the independent sorting of X and Y because: a) the data is highly positively correlated, and b) OLS really doesn't do well with extreme (high-leverage) outliers. The height and weight have a correlation of 0.19 with the outlier included, 0.77 with the outlier excluded, and 0.78 with X and Y independently sorted. x plot (x$height, x$weight) points (xx$height, xx$weight, col="red") So it appears to me that the regression model on this dataset is improved by the independent sorting (black versus red line in first graph), and there is a visible relationship (black versus red in the second graph), due to the particular dataset being highly (positively) correlated and having the right kind of outliers that harm the regression more than the shuffling that occurs when you independently sort x and y. Again, not saying independently sorting does anything sensible in general, nor that it's the correct answer here. Just that the boss might have seen something like this that happened to work under just the right circumstances.
