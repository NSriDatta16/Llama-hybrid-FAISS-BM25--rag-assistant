If LASSO is equivalent to Bayesian Regression with a Laplace (double exponential) prior, what would be the prior for non-negative LASSO? Exponential?

We know that the LASSO penalty is equivalent to Laplace prior. So what would be the corresponding prior for a non-negative LASSO? Is it exponential distribution? More generally, is it true that every constraint can be translated into a prior distribution under the Bayesian framework? Then if we have constraints like sparse, non-negative, smoothness, etc., what will be the strategy to find the corresponding Bayesian prior? I know this might be too general, but I believe I am not the first one to consider this question. Any suggestions/references/papers will be much appreciated!
