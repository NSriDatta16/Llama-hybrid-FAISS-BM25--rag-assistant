You write '"Teaching expertise accounts for about 30 percent of the variance in student achievement" means that a teacher is responsible for 30% of what a student achieves.' A better formulation would be "A teacher is responsible for 30% of the difference in performance between students ". In other words, if the average performance of some group of students with teacher A is 80 points and the average performance of another group with teacher B is 70 points, the performance of the teachers A and B can account for around 3 points (30% of the 10 point variance in performance).
