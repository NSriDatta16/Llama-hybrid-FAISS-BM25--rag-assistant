To me, Javascript is both an imperative language and a functional language, and you can choose to use it either way, and even ( egad ) both ways. Or you can choose to use one paradigm and never touch the other. It's up to you. I, like you, don't think Javascript should be called a Functional Language, because it allows you to wander in and out of the functional programming paradigm. Perhaps if it had a pragma of some kind, to limit you using only functional programming paradigms, then that would be useful, I think. But, in summary, I say it's more of a imperative/procedural language with some functional programming features tossed in.
