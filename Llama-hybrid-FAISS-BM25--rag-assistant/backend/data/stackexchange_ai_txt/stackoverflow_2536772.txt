I was trying to get a table with only the outer border and no inside ones. I've been trying the following HTML: However, in the Word that table appears with both outer and inner borders, not just with outer border as I was trying to get it. Well, that is what border does. Hmm. You say inline CSS doesn't get picked up, so I guess both this: or surrounding the table with a won't work? Those would be the most elegant solutions. If all that fails, why not put the table into a table? it's a horrible practice to use in 2010 from a web design point of view, but if it's the only workaround so you can import the page correctly, maybe it's necessary. I'm pretty sure however that some form of CSS must work. Maybe a different notation or something. But I'm no Word HTML expert.
