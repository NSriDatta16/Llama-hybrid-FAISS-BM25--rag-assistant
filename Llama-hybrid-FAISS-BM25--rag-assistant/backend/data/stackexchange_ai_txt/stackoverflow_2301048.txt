First (and probably obviously), put the users' files in some dedicated place so they don't risk overwriting other stuff. Second, if you expect lots of files then you may want to have subfolders. The easiest way to do that is to use the first letter of their filename as the folder. So if I were to upload "smile.jpg", you could store it there: s /smile.jpg If you're super popular and still have too many files, you can use more letters. And if you expect to have tons of users and you have tons of servers, you can imagine splitting the work by saving on s .example.com/upload/ s /smile.jpg (but really if you have tons of servers then you probably already have a transparent way of sharing storage and load).
