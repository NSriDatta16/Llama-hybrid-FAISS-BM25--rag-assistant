I don't think it can be done automatically. Even with code coverage tools, you need to provide sufficient input data to run. May be very complex and high priced static analysis tool such as from Coverity's or LLVM compiler could be help. But I'm not sure and I would prefer manual code review. UPDATED Well.. only removing unused variables, unused functions is not hard though. UPDATED After read other answers and comments, I'm more strongly convinced that it can't be done. You have to know the code to have meaningful code coverage measure, and if you know that much manual editing will be faster than prepare/run/review coverage results.
