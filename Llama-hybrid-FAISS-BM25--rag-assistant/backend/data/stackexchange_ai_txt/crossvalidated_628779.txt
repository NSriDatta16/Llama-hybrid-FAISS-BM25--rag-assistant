Saying there are averages in sports just kicks the explanation further down the field (pun intended). The confusion comes from thinking the average exists by itself, as a lone parameter. It doesn't, it includes a variance or standard deviation. So the variance will always show real numbers of children are included, no matter how many families you count. If you weren't counting children, and say measuring the height of similar height people, and the mean turns out to be 1.5 m, the variance could feasibly show they are localized around 1.5 m within a few 0.1 m. Something similar couldn't happen with 1.5 children.
