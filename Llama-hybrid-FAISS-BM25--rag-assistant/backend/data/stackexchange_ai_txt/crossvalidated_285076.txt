Is it a good idea to cluster predictor variables to try an improve classification performance with logistic regression?

I have trained a logistic regression model on on a selection of 10 socio-demographic predictor variables, all of which are categorical, in order to predict customer behavior on an outcome measure. Out of the 10 variables only three significantly contribute to the model, as assessed by a forward elimination model comparison procedure. The AUC on the testing set is .64 which is ok but we want to improve the model more. My question has two parts: 1) is it a good idea/good practice to cluster the remaining seven variables and enter these clusters as predictors in the model? 2) When clustering, should I include the outcome measure as an input variable to the cluster analysis in order to make the clusters more related to the outcome measure?
