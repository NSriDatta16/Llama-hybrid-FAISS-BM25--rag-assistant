To account for all your samples, first check if the text is English at all (solution as others hinted). If yes, then there is a question what makes a 'complete English sentence'. From your (two) samples, one can deduce that there should be a subject and a verb in finite form in relation with it. To raise attention to some 'edge cases': "Go!" "Done!" To check subject-verb existence, you can try to parse - determine syntactic structure of the text but as this is still a tricky task, you can use part of speech tagging (actually morhological analysis plus disambiguation but PoS tagging made it's way as a name for the task). E.g. SpaCy does this https://spacy.io/usage/linguistic-features (It does dependency parsing too actually but error rate would be higher than using 'just' PoS tagging). Then you can check in the output if there is a verb in a finite form - VBD, VBP in VBZ in SpaCy tag set ( https://spacy.io/api/annotation#pos-tagging ).
