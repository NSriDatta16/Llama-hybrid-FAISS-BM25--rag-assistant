Fitting a Markov chain with variable path lengths (survival analysis)

I have a data set that is analogous to a survival analysis dataset. I have experimental animals, and these animals are modelled as having two states where the second state is absorbing . i.e. Each individual will only transition once, and when it reaches state 2, it stays there. The individual may also opt to never enter state 2 for the whole experiment. I understand this to be a basic setup for a survival analysis using Markov chains. I'm worried about the effect of individual variance in this setup. For example… those individuals with a tendency to quickly transition into state 2, they will have a small impact on the transition parameter estimate, and those individuals who never transition, will have an over represented effect on the transition parameter estimates (as they are in state 1 for a longer period, they are evaluated more times by the likelihood of the state transition). From my understanding of Markov chains, I'm assuming the parameter estimates will be biased to representing those individuals who are less prone to transitioning into state 2 . When dealing with individual variance… my intuition is to add a random effect to capture that variance and integrate it out of the likelihood. However, in this context, since each individual can only transition once (or never), that means each random effect level will have a sample size of 1 or 0… which feels problematic. I was wondering if there were any standard methods to deal with this kind of bias in Markov chain-style survival analysis . Or perhaps, Markov chain is just a bad choice when there is expected individual variance that can't be accounted for with covariate data. Also, please let me know if I'm misunderstanding something about Markov chains here. Edit: Why not a cox-prop-hazard model? In this dataset, I have experimental individuals which share the same environment & hazard covariates. Hence, when one individual encounters high-hazard covariates , this means all other individuals are also exposed to the same high-hazard covariates . My understanding of cox-prop-hazard is that covariates are only evaluated at event times (death) accorss individuals. So in this context, the cox-prop-hazard model will always be comparing individuals exposed to the same covariates. My understanding is that a Markov-chain approach will get around this, as Markov-chains will take into account the whole covariate history of all individuals. Comments Sorry for describing this setting in rather abstract terms... but this is a field experiment with animals. I'm worried if I start going into the intricacies of my field setup, it will just confuse matters, as it will take a lot of text to describe the experimental setting and expected behaviours.
