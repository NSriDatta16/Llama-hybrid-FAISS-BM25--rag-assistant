PCA: 7/8 variables important and approx. equal in first Principal Component

I'm conducting a PCA and, according to my rotation table, 7/8 loadings are important (abs(loading)>0.3), and roughly equal in my first principal component. I'm not sure how to interpret this, as I think it doesn't represent a reduction in the number of variables (from 8 to 7), and they're all approx. equally correlated. Also, the variance explained by PC1 seems quite low at 32%, and all 7 important variables in PC1 appear in PC2 and/or PC3. Does this mean that PCA is not particularly meaningful in this case?
