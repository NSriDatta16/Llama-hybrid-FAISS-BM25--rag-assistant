Core Data doesn't store NSDecimalNumber , only NSNumber . NSNumber doesn't have the method that gets called. You either need to change the entities definition to use NSNumber or build your own NSValueTransformer to store the NSDecimalNumber in Core Data. Please look here for more details about properties: http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/ipad/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CoreData/Articles/cdMOM.html%23//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002328-SW1
