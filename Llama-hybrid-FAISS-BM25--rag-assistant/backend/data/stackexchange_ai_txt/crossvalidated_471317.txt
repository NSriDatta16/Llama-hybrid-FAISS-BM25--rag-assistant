Different feedback signals and loss functions The difference lies in the interpretation of the values / logits. More precisely, how the values / logits are tied to different feedback signals. First, their similarity First, let's paraphrase the question. Let $\mathbf{z}\in\mathbb{R}^n$ be proper logits and let $\mathbb{q}\in\mathbb{R}^n$ be (temperature-scaled) values. Then, from their softmax's $$ p_i\ =\ \frac{e^{z_i}}{\sum_je^{z_j}}\ , \qquad \tilde{p}_i\ =\ \frac{e^{q_i}}{\sum_je^{q_j}}\ . $$ it looks like $\mathbf{p}$ and $\tilde{\mathbf{p}}$ are pretty much the same. For instance, both $\mathbf{p}$ and $\tilde{\mathbf{p}}$ live in the probability simplex $\Delta^n=\{x\in[0,1]^n\,|\,\sum_ix_i=1\}$ . Now suppose that $\mathbf{z}\in\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\mathbb{q}\in\mathbb{R}^n$ are outputs of some neural net. In order to learn these quantities, you need to tie them to some sort of feedback signal. This is where they differ. Categorical signal A proper logit is usually tied to some MLE objective associated with a categorical distribution , e.g. tensorflow's softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits . $$ \text{loss}\ =\ -\sum_iy_i\,\ln p_i $$ where $\mathbf{y}$ is a one-hot encoded categorical variate. Choosing an objective like this gives $\mathbf{z}$ the interpretation of proper logits. Gaussian signal In contrast, the values $\mathbb{q}$ are tied to an MLE objective associated with (multi-variate) Gaussian distribution, i.e. mean squared-error loss. $$ \text{loss}\ =\ (y_i - \tau\,q_i)^2 $$ where now $\mathbf{y}$ is just a real-valued vector in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\tau>0$ is the Boltzmann temperature. Conclusion Thus, $\mathbf{z}$ and $\mathbf{q}$ differ because they are tied to completely different feedback signals. Applying the same softmax operation to both doesn't undo their differences. Finally, it should be noted that there is in fact a close relation between the interpretations of $\mathbf{z}$ and $\mathbf{q}$ in the context of reinforcement learning, see [arXiv:1704.06440] . The relation is subtle, but it requires only a small amount of additional structure to derive. Some practical considerations The reason why all of this theoretical stuff matters is that in practice the values $\mathbf{q}$ may really not be suited to be interpreted as logits. The problem might be that the values fluctuate too much (resulting in insufficient exploration) or the values be too similar (resulting in too much exploration). In most cases, however, this may be fixed by tuning your Boltzmann temperature $\tau$ to suit your specific environment.
