Well, defining what it means to have much knowledge about something is hard - and measuring the knowledge is even harder. If you have already decided to use an approach where the user's ratings have not equal weights, then I would base the weight over each user's mean rating. So if a user who normally gives ratings around 5.0 rates a book with 9 he must really like it. But if a user with only ratings of 9 rates a book with 9, it is just an average book for him. Please note that this sketched algorithm has its own flaws (e.g. if a user only rates books he really likes) but it may be a good start.
