Either way you should transform your categorical variables into dummy ones(and consider multicollinearity ). I agree with previous answer observation on possible non-independence between samples(items). If you have a reason to believe this is the case, many methods wont apply. If you think that such issue does not exist i would go with a simple Chi-Squared test to examine each variable separately, and a logistic regression for cross variables effects.
