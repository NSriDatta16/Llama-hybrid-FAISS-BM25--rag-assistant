You don't necessarily need to save the credentials as plain text in Local Storage; in fact, Local Storage (SharedObject) is actually serialized as AMF, so it's not plain text to begin with. Whatever medium you use to store your sensitive data, you should certainly consider using some sort of hashing or encryption techniques like SHA1 or RSA. The difference between hashing and encryption is this: Hashing (SHA1, MD5, etc) is a one-way encryption - in other words, it's very difficult to determine the original value of the hashed value, so what you can do is compare one hashed value to another since these hashing algorithms will always spit out the same thing. Encryption (RSA, AES, etc) is a two-way encryption - in other words, you can determine the original value of the encrypted data, usually by using a public/private key combination It really depends on what you're trying to do. Hope you come right
