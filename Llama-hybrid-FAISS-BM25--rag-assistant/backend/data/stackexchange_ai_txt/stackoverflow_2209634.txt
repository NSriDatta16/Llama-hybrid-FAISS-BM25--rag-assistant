If you aren't able to change existing data to strip the leading zeroes / convert to INT, it might be faster to just do something like so: WHERE prod_upc IN (@tryUPC, '0' + @tryUPC, '00' + @tryUPC, '000' + @tryUPC [...]) That's about as elegant as my foot, but it would be more static & legible, and (probably) more likely to get at any relevant index. That's assuming there's a finite limit on how many leading zeroes you have, mind. Converting the data to INT (or adding a new INT column and calculating it on insert) would probably be the best fix for the problem.
