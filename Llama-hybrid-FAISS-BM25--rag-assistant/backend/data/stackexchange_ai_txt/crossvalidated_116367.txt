Since no one seemed to actually answer the question directly: yes you can use MCMC to sample from $g(\omega)$. MCMC can be used to sample from any distribution where the distribution is known only up to a constant of proportionality. In addition, you may want to look up variance reduction techniques in the MC integration field. A great self contained set of resources are the free book chapters available from Art Owen at Stanford. Specifically chapters 8, 9, and 10. There you will find in-depth treatments of adaptive sampling, recursion, and other techniques.
