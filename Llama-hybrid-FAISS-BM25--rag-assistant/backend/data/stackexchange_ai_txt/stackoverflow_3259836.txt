Is it possible to use SSL to secure the Web Service on the internal server? This would seem to offer the protection you require. If you don't have SSL, you will want to serialize the class to XML and then encrypt it. Then decrypt to the serialized XML format. You could then deserialize the XML files created on the share. Encryption is fairly straightforward to program because you have a string of XML that you want to encrypt and decrypt. The challenge is with the choice of the encryption algorithm and the storage of encryption keys. You should read up on symmetric and assymetric encryption. If the key is exposed then an attacker can easily decrypt your data. Use file permissions to tightly control access. The simplest option is to use symmetric keys and store the keys on the both ends. There are a number of examples and docs out there.
