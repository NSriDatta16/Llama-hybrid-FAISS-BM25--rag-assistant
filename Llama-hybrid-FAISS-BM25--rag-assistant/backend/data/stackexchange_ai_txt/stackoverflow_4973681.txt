I'm not sure why you would need a custom handler. Either you are leveraging the navigation, which means these pages exist on every subsite, or you are manually entering the URL. If it is the latter, why not point to the URL on the root site? When I've done something like this in the past, I create a custom master page and add the URLs to the pages in the root site in either the left nav or footer (or both). You should be able to use a URL in the style of: ~sitecollection/Pages/About.aspx
