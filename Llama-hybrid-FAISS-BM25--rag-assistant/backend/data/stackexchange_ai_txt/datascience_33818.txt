Invoice processing has been evolved over time and place. For big corporations, their finance department may require vendor to put purchase order number on the invoice. The purchase order number might have a fixed format, e.g. PO-0001. So while extracting the invoice, all it has to do is to find that pattern. Once you have the PO number, a database lookup will return all information you need. The next phase, if you have limited set of vendors, you can define templates for each vendor's invoice. For example, the upper-left corner has vendor name. It will help you to pinpoint the information you need to extract. When there's unknown invoice, some human operator has to create that template. Some commercial applications fall into this category. If you have the resource of human operator, that can be an option. Similarly, using machine learning, you can generate clusters based on the layout of those training invoices. When a new invoice arrived, you can try to match the corresponding cluster / template. This approach has limitation for handling unknown invoice. There are some machine learning based software as a service (SaaS) providers out there, such as mlreader . It's more sophisticated than above. If you don't have to build it in-house, you can give that a try. It could be more cost effective.
