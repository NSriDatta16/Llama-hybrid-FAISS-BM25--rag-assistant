How to optimize my BinaryWriter?

i am currently working at a program that transfer files via FTP. I send the files in binary because with ASCII I canÂ´t send special characters. Here is my currently code : using(BinaryReader bReader = new BinaryReader(srcStream)) using (BinaryWriter bWriter = new BinaryWriter(destStream)) { Byte[] readBytes = new Byte[1024]; for(int i = 0; i My Problems with this code are : It works really slow, is there a way to optimize ? The way i ask for EOF(EndOfFile) seems to be very strange, is there another elegance option ? Thanks alot :D
