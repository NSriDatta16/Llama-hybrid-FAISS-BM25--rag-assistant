Intuition of Bayesian normalizing constant

In the commonly mentioned mammography screening problem with a screening likelihood of 80%, a prior of 10% and a false positive rate of 50%, or its variants, it is easy to explain that the conditional posterior probability that a positive screening indicates a cancer is present is only 15%. This is most easily shown by counts, with an n = 1000, true cancer cases = 100, cancers detected = 80, and false positives = 450. Then the probability that a positive screening indicates a cancer present is true positives / (true positives + false positives) or 80 / (100 + 450) = 0.145 or 15%. The intuition is that the true positives are conditioned on the sum of the true and false positives because the sum of the true and false positives constitute a subset of all results. This is because the false negatives and true negatives are excluded from the calculation, and so the conditional set is a subset. If we shift the problem to the continuous case with a binomial likelihood and a beta prior, then the normalizing constant becomes an integral, as for the true positives term (p = proportion) $$\int_0^1 {\left( {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}n\\x\end{array}} \right)p_{}^x{{(1 - p)}^{n - x}}\frac{{\Gamma (a + b)}}{{\Gamma (a)\Gamma (b)}}p_{}^{a - 1}{{(1 - {p_{}})}^{b - 1}}} dp % MathType!MTEF!2!1!+- % feaagKart1ev2aaatCvAUfeBSjuyZL2yd9gzLbvyNv2CaerbuLwBLn % hiov2DGi1BTfMBaeXatLxBI9gBaerbd9wDYLwzYbItLDharqqtubsr % 4rNCHbGeaGqiVu0Je9sqqrpepC0xbbL8F4rqqrFfpeea0xe9Lq-Jc9 % vqaqpepm0xbba9pwe9Q8fs0-yqaqpepae9pg0FirpepeKkFr0xfr-x % fr-xb9adbaqaaeGaciGaaiaabeqaamaabaabaaGcbaaeaaaaaaaaa8 % qadaWdXaqaamaabmaapaqaauaabeqaceaaaeaapeGaamOBaaWdaeaa % peGaamiEaaaaaiaawIcacaGLPaaacaWGWbWaa0baaSqaaaqaaiaadI % haaaGccaGGOaGaaGymaiabgkHiTiaadchacaGGPaWaaWbaaSqabeaa % caWGUbGaeyOeI0IaamiEaaaak8aadaWcaaqaaiabfo5ahjaacIcaca % WGHbGaey4kaSIaamOyaiaacMcaaeaacqqHtoWrcaGGOaGaamyyaiaa % cMcacqqHtoWrcaGGOaGaamOyaiaacMcaaaWdbiaadchadaqhaaWcba % aabaGaamyyaiabgkHiTiaaigdaaaGccaGGOaGaaGymaiabgkHiTiaa % dchadaWgaaWcbaaabeaakiaacMcadaahaaWcbeqaaiaadkgacqGHsi % slcaaIXaaaaaqaaiaaicdaaeaacaaIXaaaniabgUIiYdGccaWGKbGa % amiCaaaa!6018! $$ and a similar term for the false positives. What is not clear however, it how to restate the idea of a subset in the continuous case, and I can find no one who does this. Rather one finds language that either 1) this integral gives the constant to make the calculation needed to have a probability distribution defined on the [0, 1] interval, or 2) that proportionality is invoked and the value of the integral is not needed to find the posterior, especially using MCMC, or 3) the integral is the probability of the evidence. This last explanation seems closer to the idea of a subset, but it is not clearly and explicitly connected. I am writing an intuitive introduction to Bayesâ€™ theorem, and want to continue the intuitive idea of a subset for the conditional probability that defines the posterior. So I need language to explain how this integral is just the continuous restatement of the subset in the discrete numbers case. Any suggestions?
