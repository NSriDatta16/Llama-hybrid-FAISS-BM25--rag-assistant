I think it is too little data (features) to make any ML algorithm perform well. Do you have access to any other features? Such as movie genre, cast and crew, movie length, etc? If you have those data then you can start with a simple neural network. This paper might give you some ideas. Also, before thinking of any ML algorithm, you can think of what are the criteria that impact a movie ranking beyond just user input. That might help you formulate the problem better, come up with some simple heuristics and you might not even need any Machine Learning/Deep Learning algorithms.
