surface drop image scatterview to librarystack, trigger event

I am new in this field and am trying to do a drag and drop from scatterview to librarystack, and when drop is executed, an event should be triggered ( after an image is dropped in the librarystack, a message box will be shown). However, I can not find the way to do it.. Below is the code snippets and public SurfaceWindow1() { InitializeComponent(); SurfaceDragDrop.AddDropHandler(myLibraryStack, OnPreviewDrop); } private void myLibraryStack_Drop(object sender, SelectionChangedEventArgs e) { MessageBox.Show("HALLO"); } Would appreciate for any guidance
