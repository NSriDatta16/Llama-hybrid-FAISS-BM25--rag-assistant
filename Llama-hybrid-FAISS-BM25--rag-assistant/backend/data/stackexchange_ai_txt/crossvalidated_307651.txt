Predicting the time until a given event occurs is survival analysis . In the medical field, the event is typically the patient's death, and it is predicted using medical data. For instance: how long do we expect a patient with a given medical condition and history to survive? Classical survival analysis, especially in the medical field, does not really leverage time series information though, only snapshot data. Nevertheless, you may be able to find something by combining the two search terms. A more recent field of study that may be of interest would be predictive maintenance . Here, we typically predict when a piece of machinery will fail, based on a time series of sensor data. The idea is to schedule maintenance before the machine breaks down, so we can arrange for maintenance, spare parts and a replacement machine more gracefully than if we wait for the machine to actually die on us. The underlying problem is similar to survival analysis, but time series data are commonly used - as above, one typically uses data from the hundreds of sensors that modern machinery contains. (I saw an interesting presentation on predicting when electric train engines will fail, based on time series of power readings and similar data of their batteries.) One difference is that medical survival analysis typically is concerned with a single unambiguous type of "event", i.e., the patient's death, whereas predictive maintenance looks at many different possible ways a piece of machinery can break down.
