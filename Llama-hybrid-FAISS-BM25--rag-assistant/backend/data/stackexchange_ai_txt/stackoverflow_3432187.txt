@crocpulsar, you need to install Visual Studio on your build server, but you do NOT need to buy an additional licence . There are just way too many dependencies to getting build & MSTest to work without VS installed, and it is most definitely not supported. As long as the person who starts the build has a license, you do not need one for the build server. This has been the case since the dark days of 2005, and as long as there is edition parity then you are OK. If everyone in your team has Ultimate, then you are free to install it on the build server; but if one of your team member's has Premium, then you should ideally install Premium on the build server. This also enables lots of other bits like Code Coverage, Test Impact Analysis, and Architecture Validation among others.
