This explanation consists of two parts. The distribution of a t-statistic under the assumption of normality The construction of confidence intervals using pivotal quantities The distribution of a t-statistic under the assumption of normality Consider $X_1, X_2, ..., X_n\stackrel{\text{iid}}{\sim}\text{N}(\mu,\sigma^2)$ Then $$Q=\frac{\bar{x}-\mu}{s_\bar{x}} = \frac{\bar{x}-\mu}{s/\sqrt{n}}$$ has a t-distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom. I presume you are familiar with this part . (If not, we might need to explore that in another question.) The construction of confidence intervals using pivotal quantities A pivotal quantity is a function of the data and parameter(s) whose distribution doesn't depend on the parameter(s) Because of that, we can write down a probability statement relating to an interval for the pivotal quantity. So if we can write down a pivotal quantity involving the data and the parameter $\mu$ in the above iid normal situation, then we can write an interval for that pivotal quantity. From that we can back out an interval for the parameter. In this case, the t-statistic above ($Q$) is a pivotal quantity; it is a function of the parameter $\mu$ and the data and its distribution is $t_{n-1}$, which doesn't depend on $\mu$. If $t_{1-\alpha/2}$ is the ${1-\alpha/2}$ quantile of a t-distribution (with $n-1$ d.f. being understood as given), then we can write $$P(-t_{1-\alpha/2} From there we can write $\frac{\bar{x}-\mu}{s_\bar{x}}$ for $Q$ and manipulate the probability statement above to obtain an expression giving an interval for $\mu$ with the desired coverage, which is the interval you stated.
