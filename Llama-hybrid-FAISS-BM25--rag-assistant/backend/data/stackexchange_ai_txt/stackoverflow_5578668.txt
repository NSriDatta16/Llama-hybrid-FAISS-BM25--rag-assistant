Supporting MongoDB write when client is disconnected

I'd like to develop an app that uses MongoDB as the database, but which can cope with wifi dropout disconnects, so that the javascript client can cope with unreliable net connections, syncing when the connection is restored. Does MongoDB support any kind of client-side API/data storage, and if not then what would be the best way to code the client so it can cope with wifi dropouts? Thanks very much.
