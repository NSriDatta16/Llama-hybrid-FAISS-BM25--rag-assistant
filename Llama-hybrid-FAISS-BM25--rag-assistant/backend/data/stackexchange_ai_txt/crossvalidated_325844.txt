Is Bayes-Ball algorithm enough to argue that correlation can imply causality?

You always hear that correlation does not imply causation. But taking a Bayesian perspective, can one counterargue this statement? I was reading the paper linked below (Bayes-Ball argument), and it seems that it isn't true to say that correlation does not imply causation. Am I wrong to tell students that correlation does not imply causation? This meaning that correlation actually can imply causation. Link to paper
