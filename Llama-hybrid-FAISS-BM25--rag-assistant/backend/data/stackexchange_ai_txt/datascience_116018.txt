How to cluster components of a graph containing text data?

Suppose that I have a graph that has components like the image below. Graph nodes contain text data (titles) and the edges data is the similarity (percentage). I know that each component represents a cluster, but my question is how to cluster these components. Example: A graph component may have these data for their nodes (titles). How to make pizza How to make pepperoni pizza Recipe for cooking pizza ingredients needed for Italian pizzas And I have one other graph component with these titles. Kebab restaurants Homemade Kebab How is kebab cooked? I know that these two graph components with the title mentioned are clusters individually. My question is how can I cluster these two graph components since they both may have the same topic (cooking, food, etc)? Things I have looked into or think can be the solution: There is a library called BERTopic that clusters records of text but in my problem, I already know that certain records form a cluster. I want to cluster these text clusters (graph components) Maybe there is a way to form a representation using transformers or word vectorization for a graph component, and based on that representation vector and some distance metric we can cluster the components but the question is if this solution is plausible what is the best way to implement it? GNN (Graph Neural Networks) is usually used for node classification or edge prediction (Functionalities that I am aware of). Can they be used for clustering graph components which do not contain connections to each other?
