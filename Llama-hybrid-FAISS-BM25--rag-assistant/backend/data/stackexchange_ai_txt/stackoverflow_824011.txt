A simple way to create static imports for constants in existing code?

If I have a constant BAR in Foo, which I will use in a class C I'll have to write Object o = Foo.BAR + "..."; which I can use Ctrl-Shift-M in Eclipse (with the cursor on BAR) to create a static import for like: import static Foo.BAR; Object o = BAR + "...."; I am current updating legacy code with literaly thousands of these I'd like to convert to static imports. Ctrl-Shift-O / Organize imports does not do it. Is there a trick I've missed? EDIT: Actually, what I would prefer is a way to tell Eclipse that I want to have Ctrl-Shift-M do its magic on ALL instances in this particular class instead of just the single instance I have the cursor placed at. (It is legacy code so this actually IMPROVES readability :) ) EDIT: I've found that IntelliJ suggest doing this.
