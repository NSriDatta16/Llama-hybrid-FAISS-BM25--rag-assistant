Your code seems to work fine for me. That is I see 5 images. This looks a little strange: pnlholding.setOpaque(false); pnlholding.setBounds(0, 00, 330, 143); pnlholding.add(lblholding); //plane pnlholding.setOpaque(false); pnlholding.setBounds(0, 0, 48, 60); pnlholding.add(lblplane); I think the lblplane should be added to pnlplane. Even easier is to just add the label to the layered pane directly, there is no need to add it to a panel first. This is the way the Swing tutorial on How to Use Layered Panes works.
