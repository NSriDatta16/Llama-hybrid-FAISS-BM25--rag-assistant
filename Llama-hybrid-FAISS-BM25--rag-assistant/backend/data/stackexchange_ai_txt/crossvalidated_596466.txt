Spectral analysis can be based on both the ACF (computing its Fourier transform) or the observations (computing the Fourier transform and taking the modulus squared). Both approaches are equivalent. Historically, the first was perhaps easier and faster before the introduction of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). First question: True, an ACF does not uniquely determine a time series. Nor does the spectral density. The ACF contains enough information to compute the spectral density $f(\lambda)$ . Many different time series can share the same spctral density. Second question: Not quite clear to me what is the question here. Yes, transferring the time series to the frequency domain we can do all the things you mention and more. The spectral density is not something that enables us "to do something to the series", but rather a way to summarize its harmonic properties. Based on what we see in the spectral density, we can design filters, pre-process de series, etc.
