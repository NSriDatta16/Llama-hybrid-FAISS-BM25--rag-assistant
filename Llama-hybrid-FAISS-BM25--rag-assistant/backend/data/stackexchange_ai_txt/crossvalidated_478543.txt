Let's say you are measuring height in the current world population and you want to caompare male and female height. To check the hypothesis "average male height for men alive today is higher than for women alive today", you can just measure every man and woman on the planet and compare the results. If male height is on average 0.0000000000000001cm bigger even with a standard deviation trillions of times bigger, your hypothesis is proven correct. However, such a conclusion is probably not useful in practice. Since people are constantly being born and dying, you probably don't care about the current population, but about a more abstract population of "potentially existing humans" or "all humans in history" of which you take people alive today as a sample. Here you need hypothesis testing.
