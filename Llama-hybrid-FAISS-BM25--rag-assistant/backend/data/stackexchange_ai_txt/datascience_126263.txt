I have never used Boltzmann Machines or similar models in my past 6 years of data science experience. I have worked in NLP, Computer Vision, Search, Transaction Frauds etc. But I have used Autoencoders multiple times to generate embedding, detecting outliers in Fraud Transactions. I dont think energy based models is popular currently among practicing data scientists.
