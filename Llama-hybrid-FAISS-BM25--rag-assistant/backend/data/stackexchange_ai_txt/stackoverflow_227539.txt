Dashogun is correct, at least in my experience. Larger projects / solutions create a lot of small, temporary files on the way to producing the final binary(ies). I find that if I defragment my disk once a week or so (even if the defragmenter does not recommend it) I do not see the performance degradation that I experience if I fail to do that. As a corroborating factor, there are a couple of guys I work with that have the same experiences.
