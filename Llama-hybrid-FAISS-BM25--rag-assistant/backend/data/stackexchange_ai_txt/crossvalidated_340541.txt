VAEs: Basic Math example for pass through VAE

As great as many papers and videos are at teaching Neural Net concepts, I see a surprising lack of basic numerical examples explaining these concepts. These examples would let me make sure I know what's going on under the hood and give me intuition for how these models behave when interpreting results. Admittedly, I haven't looked too much into Coursera, Udemy, etc. But I prefer good ol'-fashioned pen and paper. Any suggestions? My sources: tutorial Siraj An example of what I'm looking for: We want to explain addition to babies. We show them examples: 1+1 = 2, 2+1 = 3, and 1 apple next to 2 apples is 3 apples. Without VAEs broken down so basically, it's hard for me to really understand how things are working
