I've never actually tried this myself, but have you tried using the BDC to populate items from your external data store into a list, and reference your BDC list as a lookup column in your second list? Check out this BDC Blog . It talks about how to tie BDC data to a list. Presumably, you'd be able to use that as a lookup value in your second list. If you're unfamiliar with the BDC, take a look at this article series for more information on what it is, and how you can leverage it. Cheers, Adam
