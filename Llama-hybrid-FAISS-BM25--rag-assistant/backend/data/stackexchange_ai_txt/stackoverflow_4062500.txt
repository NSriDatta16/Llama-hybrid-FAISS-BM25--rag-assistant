I have a "WinsockWrapper.h" header which helps me ensure consistency... The gist of it is; #ifndef _WINDOWS_ #define WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN #include #undef WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN #endif #include #pragma comment(lib, "ws2_32.lib") Include this before anything else which might pull in windows.h in any file which needs winsock2.h This, IMHO means putting it at the top of most files that need winsock2.h ... Make sure your precompiled header, if you're using it, also has this first.
