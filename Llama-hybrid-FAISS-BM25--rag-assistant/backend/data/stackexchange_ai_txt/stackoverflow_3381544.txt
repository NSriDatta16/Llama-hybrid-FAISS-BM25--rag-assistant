How to hint to GCC that a line should be unreachable at compile time?

It's common for compilers to provide a switch to warn when code is unreachable . I've also seen macros for some libraries, that provide assertions for unreachable code . Is there a hint, such as through a pragma, or builtin that I can pass to GCC (or any other compilers for that matter), that will warn or error during compilation if it's determined that a line expected to be unreachable can actually be reached? Here's an example: if (!conf->devpath) { conf->devpath = arg; return 0; } // pass other opts into fuse else { return 1; } UNREACHABLE_LINE(); The value of this is in detecting, after changes in conditions above the expected unreachable line, that the line is in fact reachable.
