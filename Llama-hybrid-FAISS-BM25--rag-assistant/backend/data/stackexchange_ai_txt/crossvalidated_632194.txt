Is it right to call the values produced by emmeans coefficicents?

I have a logistic regression model with a categorical predictor with five levels. I compute emmeans for the model, splitting by my categorical predictor. emms Then I compare these to chance. test(emms, null = 0) My output looks like this: Factor emmean SE df z.ratio p.value A -0.0787 0.110 Inf -0.714 0.4754 B 0.2217 0.111 Inf 1.999 0.0456 etc Results are given on the logit (not the response) scale. Would it be right to call the values in the emmean column: coefficients comparing levels of a factor to chance, computed using marginal means.
