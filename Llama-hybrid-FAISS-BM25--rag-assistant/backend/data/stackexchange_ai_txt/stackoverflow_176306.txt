Unit testing gives you speed and most of all, pin point accuracy of where a failure or bug has been introduced. It enables you to test each component, isolated from every other component and be assured that it works as it should. For example, if you had a web test, that sent an Ajax request back to a service on the server which then hit a database, which then fails. Was it the Javascript, service, business logic or database that caused the problem? Where as if you unit test each of the service on its own, stubbing/mocking out the database, or each business logic unit, then you are more likely to know exactly where the bug is. Unit testing is less about coverage (although important) and more about isolation.
