Designing a Simple (a.k.a 'bad') Ranking value from several values of unknown distribution

I am but a humble developer, so please forgive if I butcher terminology of confuse concepts. I am looking at designing a simple ranking of Average Internet Audience Rank based upon a bloggers audience size (Twitter/Tumblr/Facebook friends) and how many times their content has been shared (i.e. 'Reach'). Here are the metrics I want to combine: | metric | weight | range | distribution (est.) ------------------------------------------------------------- | shares | 1st | 0 - Millions | power law | comments | 2nd | 0 -thousands | power law | Klout score | 3rd | 0 - 100 | normal , weighted toward lower end | Twitter fol. | 4th | 0 - Millions | power law | LinkedIn con.| 5th | 0 - 1000 | normal Goal None of the individual metrics will completely crowd out any of the others if it is significantly higher than normal. For example if someone had 10,000,000 twitter followers, but all other values were 0, I would never want them to rank higher than someone who had even 1000 blog post shares. I know this Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis which I've been reading up on, but operations research is not a field I'm very familiar with. Hopefully you guys can help point me in the right direction.
