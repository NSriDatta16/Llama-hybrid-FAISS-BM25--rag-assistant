Here's an answer from a different forum about how you might use coding to handle your polytomous variables in regression in general; the original question was about logistic regression here too, so this corroborates other answers here that logistic vs. linear regression isn't an important distinction in the use of coding for polytomous variables. Here's another answer on Cross Validated from @StasK that answers a question just like yours, again suggesting coding. However, in @GaetanLion's answer to one of those similar questions, some discussion of a drawback of coding appears (mostly interpretive complexity, I think) to emphasize that coding may not be necessary depending on your statistical software. On the other hand, judging from @gung's answer to another very similar question about the interpretive complexity of an analysis like yours, some software may code automatically, and different tests are necessary for estimating the significance of the polytomous factor as a whole (as opposed to particular levels).
