Here is the full quote from the section you reference (bold added): When data have a trend, the autocorrelations for small lags tend to be large and positive because observations nearby in time are also nearby in value . So the ACF of a trended time series tends to have positive values that slowly decrease as the lags increase. Surely that gives the intuition. As the lags increase, the values are further apart in both time and value due to the trend.
