Visual Studio 2008: Is it worth the upgrade from 2005?

As of the fall of 2008 I'm about to embark on a new development cycle for a major product that has a winforms and an asp.net interface. We use Telerik, DevExpress and Infragistics components in it and all are going to have a release within a month or so which will be the one I target for our spring release of our product. They all support VS2005 and we will continue to target .net 2+ so I can't see any compelling reason so far to upgrade to VS2008. Has anyone found a compelling reason for upgrading to VS2008?
