How much time takes a form to resize?

In order to compare performance of custom drawing I need to calculate the time a form takes to resize (or maximize - pass from its normal to maximized state). Where should I start / stop the StopWatch? Tried OnResize/OnSizeChanged and also OnResizeBegin/OnResizeEnd but both depends of how quick I drag the mouse...
