Given your a student and assuming your looking to spend little money, a lot of Git and SVN hosting providers offer free hosting for students or free accounts if your a small team with minimal storage requirements. Check out Codesion's student offering for example (disclaimer, I work for Codesion). This plan also comes with Trac / Bugzilla for your PM requirements. I wouldn't be concerned with security and reliability for the same reason that Simon points out above. As for CI on EC2 - this is probably your best bet since you pay by the hour each instance is running. I'd recommend using Amazons API to fire up an instance each time Hudson needs to perform a build, store the results of the build on more permanent storage, and shut the instance down when finished. If your doing a lot of CI builds, it might be better to just keep the instance running, but this will cost you more of course.
