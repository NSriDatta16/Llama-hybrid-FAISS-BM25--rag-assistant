Arduino: Lightweight compression algorithm to store data in EEPROM

I want to store a large amount of data onto my Arduino with a ATmega168 / ATmega328 microcontroller, but unfortunately there's only 256 KB / 512 KB of EEPROM storage. My idea is to make use of an compression algorithm to strip down the size. But well, my knowledge on compression algorithms is quite low and my search for ready-to-use libraries failed. So, is there a good way to optimize the storage size?
