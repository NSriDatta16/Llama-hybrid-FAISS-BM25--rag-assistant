What are some applications of Chinese restaurant processes?

What are some applications of Chinese restaurant processes? I'm trying to learn a bit about non-parametric Bayesian methods, starting with Dirichlet processes and CRPs, but all the tutorials I've found are about theory, without describing any applications in depth. Names of papers would be great. I'm not really looking for state-of-the-art applications, but just some "canonical" examples (say, in natural language processing) of why Dirichlet processes and Chinese restaurant processes are useful and why I should care.
