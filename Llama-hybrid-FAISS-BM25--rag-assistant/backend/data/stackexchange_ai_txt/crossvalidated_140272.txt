Okay method to aggregate moving averages?

I want to make a map of investments in foreign countries made by country x. I have collected data for a ten-year period. Since investments change from year to year and there's lack of data for some countries, I thought that I would aggregate moving averages of this period of time, and then map this. I am a statistics novice, and don't know whether this is a robust method? If so, which method do I ultimately use to aggregated the moving averages? Many thanks!
