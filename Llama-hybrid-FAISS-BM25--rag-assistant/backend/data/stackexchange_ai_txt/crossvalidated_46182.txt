Combining posterior distributions

I have 5 different posterior distributions (mcmc samples) which all estimate the same parameter beta. The 5 models are all obtained from 5 independent standardized datasets but estimate the same parameter. What I want to obtain is a single posterior distribution, combining information of my five original distribution. By instinct, following the rules of probability, I would say I can obtain a joint posterior distribution simply as the product of my 5 different posterior distributions. Is this correct, and if yes, how to do this in practice? Is there any BUGS/JAGS or R code anybody is willing to share?
