PCA of non-Gaussian data

I have a couple of quick questions about PCA: Does the PCA assume that the dataset is Gaussian? What happens when I apply a PCA to inherently non-linear data? Given a dataset, the process is to first mean-normalize, set the variance to 1, take an SVD, reduce rank, and finally map the dataset into the new reduced-rank space. In the new space, each dimension corresponds to a "direction" of maximal variance. But is the correlation of that dataset in the new space always zero, or is that only true for data that is inherently Gaussian? Suppose I have two datasets, "A" and "B", where "A" corresponds to randomly sampled points taken from a Gaussian, while "B" corresponds to points randomly sampled from another distribution (say Poisson). How does the PCA(A) compare to the PCA(B)? By looking at the points in the new space, how would I determine that the PCA(A) corresponds to points sampled from a Gaussian, while PCA(B) corresponds to points sampled from a Poisson? Is the correlation of the points in "A" 0? Is the correlation of points in "B" also 0? More importantly, am I asking the "right" question? Should I look at the correlation, or is there another metric that I should consider?
