This question has been partially discussed at this site as below, and opinions seem mixed. What is the difference between fixed effect, random effect and mixed effect models? What is the mathematical difference between random- and fixed-effects? Concepts behind fixed/random effects models All terms are generally related to longitudinal / panel / clustered / hierarchical data and repeated measures (in the format of advanced regression and ANOVA), but have multiple meanings in different context. I would like to answer the question in formulas based on my knowledge. Fixed-effects model In biostatistics, fixed-effects, denoted as $\color{red}{\boldsymbol\beta}$ in Equation (*) below, usually comes together with random effects. But the fixed-effects model is also defined to assume that the observations are independent, like cross-sectional setting, as in Longitudinal Data Analysis of Hedeker and Gibbons (2006). In econometrics, the fixed-effects model can be written as $$ y_{ij}=\boldsymbol x_{ij}^{'}\boldsymbol\beta+\color{red}{u_i}+\epsilon_{ij}$$ where $\color{red}{u_i}$ is fixed (not random) intercept for each subject ($i$), or we can also have a fixed-effect as $u_j$ for each repeated measurement ($j$); $\boldsymbol x_{ij}$ denotes covariates. In meta-analysis, the fixed-effect model assumes underlying effect is the same across all studies (e.g. Mantel and Haenszel, 1959). Random-effects model In biostatistics, the random-effects model (Laird and Ware, 1982) can be written as $$\tag{*} y_{ij}=\boldsymbol x_{ij}^{'}\color{red}{\boldsymbol\beta}+\boldsymbol z_{ij}^{'}\color{blue}{\boldsymbol u_i}+e_{ij}$$ where $\color{blue}{\boldsymbol u_i}$ is assumed to follow a distribution. $\boldsymbol x_{ij}$ denotes covariates for fixed effects, and $\boldsymbol z_{ij}$ denotes covariates for random effects. In econometrics, the random-effects model may only refer to random intercept model as in biostatistics, i.e. $\boldsymbol z_{ij}^{'}=1$ and $\boldsymbol u_i$ is a scalar. In meta-analysis, the random-effect model assumes heterogeneous effects across studies (DerSimonian and Laird, 1986). Marginal model Marginal model is generally compared to conditional model (random-effects model), and the former focuses on the population mean (take linear model for an example) $$E(y_{ij})=\boldsymbol x_{ij}^{'}\boldsymbol\beta,$$ while the latter deals with the conditional mean $$E(y_{ij}|\boldsymbol u_i)=\boldsymbol x_{ij}^{'}\boldsymbol\beta + \boldsymbol z_{ij}^{'}\boldsymbol u_i.$$ The interpretation and scale of the regression coefficients between marginal model and random-effects model would be different for nonlinear models (e.g. logistic regression). Let $h(E(y_{ij}|\boldsymbol u_i))=\boldsymbol x_{ij}^{'}\boldsymbol\beta + \boldsymbol z_{ij}^{'}\boldsymbol u_i$, then $$E(y_{ij})=E(E(y_{ij}|\boldsymbol u_i))=E(h^{-1}(\boldsymbol x_{ij}^{'}\boldsymbol\beta + \boldsymbol z_{ij}^{'}\boldsymbol u_i))\neq h^{-1}(\boldsymbol x_{ij}^{'}\boldsymbol\beta),$$ unless trivially the link function $h$ is the identity link (linear model), or $u_i=0$ (no random-effects). Good examples include generalized estimating equations (GEE; Zeger, Liang and Albert, 1988) and marginalized multilevel models (Heagerty and Zeger, 2000).
