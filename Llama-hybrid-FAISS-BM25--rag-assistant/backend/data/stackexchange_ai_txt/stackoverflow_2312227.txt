The way to use opendir / readdir / closedir is to make the function recursive! Have a look at the snippet here on Dreamincode.net . Hope this helps. EDIT Thanks R.Sahu, the linky has expired, however, found it via wayback archive and took the liberty to add it to gist . Please remember, to check the license accordingly and attribute the original author for the source! :)
