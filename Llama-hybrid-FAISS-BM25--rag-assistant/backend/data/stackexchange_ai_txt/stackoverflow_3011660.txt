Changing CSS height property removes anchors?

I am working on a standard header/navigation for my website. I started with having a CSS "height" value of 100% for the html, body elements but this resulted in the wrong layout. However, when I change the CSS height property from "100%" to "auto", the layout is correct, but I lose the anchors. The text is still there (e.g "Advice", "Do It", "Home", Help") but the anchors (organized as list items) no longer appear in the navigation. I can't click on them anymore. Why is this? Here's my CSS: html,body { height: auto; /* This is the only property that I'm toggling */ margin: 0; } body { margin: 0; min-width: 978px; font: 12px/16px Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #000; background: #000001 url('../images/bg-body.jpg') no-repeat 50% 0; } #nav { position: relative; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0 2px 0 271px; list-style: none; background: url('../images/sep-nav.gif') no-repeat 100% 0; } #nav li { float: left; padding: 11px 0 0 2px; height: 35px; width: 128px; line-height: 22px; font-size: 18px; text-align: center; background: url('../images/sep-nav.gif') no-repeat 0 -1px; display: inline; } #nav li a {color: #FFFEFE;} ..... Here's the header HTML: Site Name Feedback, please Home Feedback Settings Help Sign out Advice Do it Your Profile Search Form I compared the computed CSS in Firebug when the html, body height property was set to "auto" vs. "100%" and they were the same. Can somebody please shed some light on how retain the anchors in the navigation while setting height to "auto"? Thanks for your help.
