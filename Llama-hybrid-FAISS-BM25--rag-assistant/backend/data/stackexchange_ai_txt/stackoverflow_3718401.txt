My interpretation of these has been that: avg_total_user_cost is the current average of all queries that could potentially benefit from the creation of the missing index group. The "cost" is a unitless value calculated by the optimizer. See: SQL SERVER – Execution Plan – Estimated I/O Cost – Estimated CPU Cost – No Unit avg_user_impact is a percentage representing the average decrease in cost of all queries if the missing index group was created. The higher the percentage, the greater the benefit of the new index will be.
