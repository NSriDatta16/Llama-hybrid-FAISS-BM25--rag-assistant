Eagerly load recursive relation

I have a recursive one-to-many relationship that has the default lazy value of true. What code can I write against the NH API that will efficiently retrieve the ENTIRE tree AS IF I had lazy="false" on the SubCategories mapping? Here's the recursive one-to-many relationship: ... I don't specify lazy="false" on the list since laziness is required in about half the queries I need to run. I have fetch="subselect" on the list as an optimization for when I do manage to retrieve the entire tree. I've tried the ICriteria API: session.CreateCriteria ().SetFetchMode( "SubCategories", FetchMode.Eager ).Add( Restrictions.IsNull("ParentCategory") ).SetResultTransformer( CriteriaSpecification.DistinctRootEntity ).List (); but that only eagerly loaded only the first level in the hierarchy.
