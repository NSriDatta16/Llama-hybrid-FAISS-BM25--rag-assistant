I believe your issue is with your first parameter, which should be a IScriptFragment. You are passing a string. You would need to pass something that derives from TSqlFragment . Using something like the TSql100Parser.ParseStatementList method, you will get a list of fragments. EDIT: This blog post has a similar issue to your second error.
