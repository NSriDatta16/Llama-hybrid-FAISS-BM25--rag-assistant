Yes, Prism encourages you to put everything (models, views and view models) into one self-contained functional module. In any case, I would strongly NOT recommend you splitting views and view models into separate projects. This is because they are tightly coupled together and are developed side-by-side. Well, there are two recommended approaches on how you organize you MVVM application. First is when you organize your project by layers and put you views and view models into separate folders inside a project. Second, when you create folders by feature and don't separate views and view models, i.e. they lie in the same folder side-by-side. I personally choose the second one because, as I mentioned, they are developed and maintained always together and this way it is very easy to find corresponding view or view model.
