If I understand what you want, you can use getAbsolutePath() method to get the full path of a file. Edit: Store the path to your folder, i.e. String myPath = sdcardEnvironment.getExternalStorageDirectory().getAbsolutePath() + "/my/"; and then access the files as: File currentFile = new File(myPath + path.get(position));
