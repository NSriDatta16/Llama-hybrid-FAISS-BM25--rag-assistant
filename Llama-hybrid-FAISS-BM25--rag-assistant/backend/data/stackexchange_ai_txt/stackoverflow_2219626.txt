Using ggplot, how to have the x-axis of time series plots set up automatically?

Is there a way of plotting a univariate time series of class "ts" using ggplot that sets up the time axis automatically? I want something similar to plot.ts() of base graphics. Also it seems to me that the coarsest time granularity is a day. Is that right? In my work I have to work with monthly and quarterly data and assigning each observation to the beginning/end of the month/quarter would cause the observations to be irregularly spaced horizontally since months/quarters are of unequal length. That may make more sense, but my audience is used to seeing months/quarters regularly spaced. I know I can solve all of the above by manually setting up the x-axis as a time axis or as a numeric axis with my own labels. I am specifically looking for a method that does this automatically by using the time information in the ts object..
