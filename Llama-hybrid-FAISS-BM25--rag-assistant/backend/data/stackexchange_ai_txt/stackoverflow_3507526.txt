Paragraph translation in Python/Django

I translated a site using django i18n, I have no problems for menus, little paragraph, etc.. The thing I dont understand is for translating big paragraph. On my site, the admin can write some news by administration page, but he wants them in differents languages. I can imagine some methods to do that : one field per langage, but it will be difficult to manage with severals languages (for example news table has title and content, we will have 4 fields ? title_en title_fr content_en content_fr ? update the .po file for each new news ? the real solution ? What is the best solution for that ? Thanks ! (sorry for my english)
