Custom sorting object datasource bound gridview

I want to sort my GridView bound to an object DataSource fetching business objects. I have already implemented custom paging & now want to implement sorting. Just read this article but there is lot of concatenation going on there with the SQL Query. Any other elegant solution? https://web.archive.org/web/20211020202742/https://aspnet.4guysfromrolla.com/articles/032206-1.aspx#
