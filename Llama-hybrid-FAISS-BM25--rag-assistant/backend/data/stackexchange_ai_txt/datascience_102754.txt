You should be looking at the frequency distribution of your dependent variable(output feature) when considering imbalance datasets because we are trying to predict the dependent feature and not the independent feature. The distribution of the independent features doesn't matter when considering imbalanced datasets (though they matter a lot when considering other things such as model selection, feature engineering/selection etc).
