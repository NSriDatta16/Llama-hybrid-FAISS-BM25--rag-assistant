Whether any space is wasted by giving too big a capacity is actually an implementation detail that Apple deliberately doesn't expose, I guess. NSMutableArray is a class cluster which means you don't actually get an instance of NSMutableArray but some other, specialized class following the same interface. And Apple doesn't tell you which class gets returned in which case and how it's behaving. So it's hard to give real advices here. If you really know that on average you'll need a capacity of X , just use it. Otherwise, unless you have performance problems I wouldn't care about the capacity at all and just use [NSMutableArray array] ...
