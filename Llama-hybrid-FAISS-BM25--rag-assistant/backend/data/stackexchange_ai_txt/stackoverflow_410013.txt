Where do OSX applications typically store user configuration data?

I've noticed on OSX, installation is frequently a drag and drop one file kinda deal. I assume that file is an archive of all the applications necessary bits and that the application runs directly from it. Where does the application store configuration data, particularly per user settings when there are multiple users? On Windows, this type of stuff might go in the registry under HKLU or HKLM, or in the Application Data folder for the user or for all users.
