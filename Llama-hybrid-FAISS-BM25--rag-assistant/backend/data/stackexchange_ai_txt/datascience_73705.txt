Could you talk a bit more about your model training and evaluation? If you are viewing correlations, it sounds like exploratory data analysis to me. Typically, I believe a machine learning model will be trying to predict a data point/variable. This could be in the form of classification or regression (i.e. did you do one of these? ) Just curious, why is it important to label as a machine learning project? If a class project, maybe you would be interested in your model predicting points, points per game, or win/loss ratio. Or maybe based on your model, you would want to be clustering players into different segments. Good luck!
