A std::stack is only limited by the underlying container (a std::stack is a container adapter). Depending on what the underlying container is, you'll have different limits. A std::vector will require contiguous memory whereas a std::list will only be limited by the size of the heap (and possibly any heap fragmentation). But std::deque (the default container) is between the two; it requires smaller chunks of contiguous memory but will primarily be limited by the size of the heap.
