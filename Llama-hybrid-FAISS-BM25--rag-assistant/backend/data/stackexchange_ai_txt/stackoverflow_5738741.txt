How to create e-mail reminders in Django

I am looking to send e-mail reminders to users X amount of time before a scheduled even. I've been reading through the documentation for django-mailer , which seems to support such scheduled mailing, but am unable to find such functionality in the code. My thought is to have a script in my project that gets called by cron every several minutes that will will loop through event occurrence objects, check the "lead time" against the current time, and send an e-mail through the default Django e-mail backend if needed. However, I'd like to avoid re-inventing the wheel here if there is an elegant existing solution for scheduling e-mail.
