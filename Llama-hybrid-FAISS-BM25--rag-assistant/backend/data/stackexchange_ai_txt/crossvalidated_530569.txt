A covariate means the same as predictor, input variable or the old term independent variable. So it is not the same thing as covariance! And then the Q in the title Why does high leverage point in SLR have unusual covariate values? Leverage means influence, so a high leverage point is a point with high influence on the fitted regression model. You can find details at Leverages and effect of leverage points . In short, a high leverage point is an outlier in $X$ -space.
