Where can I get wikipedia XML corpus

I don't know if this can be asked here, but I have looked so hard for this and have reached deadend time and again. I'm working on a project for Information Retrieval Research. I've coded up my search engine but cannot test it because I need this xml corpus of Wikipedia. This I found http://www-connex.lip6.fr/~denoyer/wikipediaXML/ but it turns out useless. Please let me know if someone knows a way of getting me this corpus
