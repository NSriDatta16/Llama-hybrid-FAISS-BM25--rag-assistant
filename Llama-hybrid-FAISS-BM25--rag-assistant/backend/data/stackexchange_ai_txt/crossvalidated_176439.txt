Assuming your likelihood and MCMC work correctly, which we can't know of course, and assuming your new variables are not ineffective: If you increase the number of parameters under calibration with data fixed, an increase in marginal posterior uncertainty up to the point that the marginal posterior looks like the prior is quite common. This happens if your data is not any more informative enough to constrain all parameters at once to a particular value (i.e. you have trade-offs in parameter space = equifinality) A way to check this is to look at the correlation between parameters in the posterior - typically, you will see that while the marginal posteriors look flat or like the prior, the the multivariate posterior space is smaller than the multivariate prior space (i.e. you see correlations between the parameters that were not in the prior). A further check would be to compare the prior predictive distribution to the posterior predictive distribution. I'm sure there are better references, but an example of this phenomenon is in the appendix of 1 , where we decrease the information in the data, and you see how marginal posteriors and correlations increase. For a moderate decrease of information in the data, you can still see the reduction of uncertainty in the posterior pair correlations, but if you further increase the information in your data, you get higher-order correlations and all looks random (it likely isn't though). 1 Hartig, F.; Dislich, C.; Wiegand, T. & Huth, A.

Biogeosciences, 11, 1261-1272. http://www.biogeosciences.net/11/1261/2014/bg-11-1261-2014.html Addition: I thought for further reference, an illustration would be useful. What are are talking about is this type of correlation in posterior space: library(psych) par1= runif(1000,0,1) par2 =par1 + rnorm(1000,sd = 0.05) scatter.hist(par1,par2) As one can see, the marginals look flat, but there is actually a large reduction in uncertainty in the two-dimensional space.
