There is a sizable literature on robust time series models. Martin and Yohai are among the major contributors. Their work goes back to the 1980s. I did some work on detecting outliers in time series myself, but Martin was really one of the many contributors to both the detection of outliers and parameter estimation in the presence of outliers or heavy-tailed residuals in time series. Here is a link to a survey article on the topic with a list of over 100 references. It even includes my 1982 JASA paper. Here is a 2000 PhD thesis (pdf) that covers the theory, methods and applications of robust time series analysis and includes a nice bibliography. Here is a link on software that includes some robust time series tools.
