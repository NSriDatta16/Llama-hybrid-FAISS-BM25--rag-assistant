Developing an appropriate time series model to predict sales based on past month record

I have been operating an online business for two years in a row now, so I have my monthly sales data for about two years. My business for every month is certainly affected by seasonal swing ( performs better at Christmas, etc), and probably some other factors that I am not aware of. In order to predict future sales better, and in order to gauge the effectiveness of my sales campaign, or the impact of new competitors, I want to be able to develop an appropriate time series model to extrapolate my current sales data into future. This is so that when I compare the result of my prediction with the actual result, I can quantitatively test the effectiveness of my sales campaign, or the impact of competitors. My question is, given that I have 2 years worth of sales data, is there anyway I can formulate a predictive time-series model for this? Note: I am interested more in the background concepts and theories, rather than the black box tools. Speaking of tools, I have mathematica, matlab, R, Excel, Google Spreadsheet.... you name it.
