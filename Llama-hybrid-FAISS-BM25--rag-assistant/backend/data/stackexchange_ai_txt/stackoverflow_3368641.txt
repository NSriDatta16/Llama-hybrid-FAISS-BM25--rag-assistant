MS Reporting services - How to pass cell color

I am trying to create a report that has some data values. Each data value can be of a 'good' or 'bad' quality. I would like to pass a value color through the dataset using a custom C# data provider object. Once in the report designer, I can use ' Fields!MyColumn.Value ' and it works fine. There is also an option to type ' Fields!MyColumn.Color ', but I don't know how to initialize it. Please help. This is a code fragment I use to load some data to the report: IDataReader dataReader = command.ExecuteReader(); dataset.Tables["dtTable"].Load(dataReader); dataReader.Close(); //provide local report information to viewer reportViewer.LocalReport.ReportEmbeddedResource = "Client.Reports.Reports.Sample.rdlc"; //prepare report data sources ReportDataSource dsTable = new ReportDataSource(); dsTable.Name = "dtTableData"; dsTable.Value = dataset.Tables["dtTable"]; reportViewer.LocalReport.DataSources.Add(dsTable);
