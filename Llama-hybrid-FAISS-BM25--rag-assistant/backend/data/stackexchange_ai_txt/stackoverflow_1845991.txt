Socket support using wamp in windows 7

I'm running windows 7 and using WAMP for my local development. Now I Installed Cultbooking (sourceforge.net/projects/cultbooking/) in my wamp and can't finish my installation because it says sock "Socket support - Socket not supported". I don't know how I can enable my socket. I'm new to web development. This is what I did, I download the Cultbooking from the (sourceforge.net/projects/cultbooking/) and drag the files to my 'www' directory of my wamp. Now when i pointed my browser to my localhost it say PHP version >= 5.0 Yes zlib compression support Available XML support Available MySQL support Available Socket support Unavailable configuration.php Writeable Now my only problem is my Socket support. How do I enable it? if you're in my shoes, Any Ideas? Thanks!
