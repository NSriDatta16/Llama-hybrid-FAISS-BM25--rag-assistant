You could make the test(s) in question data-driven. For example, use an XML file with a bunch of blank test rows so that the test runs multiple times. It will report the success/failure of each test-row individually. You don't actually have to make the test(s) extract any data from the XML file. http://callumhibbert.blogspot.com/2009/07/data-driven-tests-with-mstest.html
