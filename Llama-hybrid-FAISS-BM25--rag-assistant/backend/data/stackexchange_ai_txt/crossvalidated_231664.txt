L2 or L1 penalty, maximizing likelihood

Logistic regression can be penalized with L2 or L1 to avoid overfilling and/or select variables. The idea is to maximized the likelihood. Accordingly, the total quality formula is following: total quality = measure of fit (likelihood of the data) - measure of the magnitude of the coefficients (L2 penalty). Why do we substract the measure of the magnitude and do not add it?
