You can't directly because the button click is a client side activity and PHP is server side. If you make all the inputs submit then the one the user clicked will be submitted as part of the $_GET array but that only works if the user clicks one of them and doesn't submit the form by, say, hitting Enter in a text input. You could attach AJAX events to the button and have them trigger off a PHP script to run the function you want to run, but that has its own set of issues. EDIT: I should note that your method of redirecting is rather inelegant to say the least. You can just use header() to do the redirection, it would be much cleaner than all this messing around with echoing out javascript.
