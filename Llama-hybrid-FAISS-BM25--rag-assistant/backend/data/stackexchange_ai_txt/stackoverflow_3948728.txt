I'd recommend splitting the issue in two: Implement the view which has the text box at the bottom - You will just have to implement your own custom view/view controller. Add your view as a subview of a UIScrollView. This is a good tutorial which demonstrates proper initialization of UIScrollView and embedding content in it. Custom views/controllers are a bit of a broader subject :)
