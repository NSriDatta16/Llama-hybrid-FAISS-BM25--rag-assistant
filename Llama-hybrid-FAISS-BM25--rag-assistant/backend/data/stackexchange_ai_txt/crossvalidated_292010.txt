In a Bayesian framework, these could be defined as conditional probabilities. But significance testing makes even less sense than usual in a Bayesian framework, so significance testing is rarely done in a Bayesian fashion. Instead we use a frequentist framework, in which conditioning a random event on a statement about population parameters is pointless. $H_0$ is not random; it's either definitely true or definitely false. So, $p(A | H_0) = p(A)$ for any event $A$, and the type-I error rate and the familywise error rate are not conditional probabilities, but marginal probabilities that are only correct if a certain condition holds. If in fact the condition fails, the probability no longer need be correct. Admittedly, this an angels-dancing-on-the-head-of-a-pin issue and has little relevance for everyday data analysis.
