CREATE TABLE `df_mainevent` ( `idDf_MainEvent` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, PRIMARY KEY (`idDf_MainEvent`) ) ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT=0 DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1; works with MySQL >= 5.0.3. EDIT: Just noticed that MySQL in general does not like auto-increment values equal to 0 - that's independent from the used storage engine. MySQL just uses 1 as the first auto-increment value. So to answer the question: NO that's not possible but it does not depend on the storage engine.
