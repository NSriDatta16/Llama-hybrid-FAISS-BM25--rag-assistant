You can use logistic regression to build a perceptron. The logistic regression uses logistic function to build the output from a given inputs. Logistic function produces a smooth output between 0 and 1, so you need one more thing to make it a classifier, which is a threshold. Perceptrons can be built with other functional forms, of course, not just logistic . The logistic regression produces you the model that looks like this: $$y(x_1,x_2|b)=\frac{e^{b_0+b_1x_1+b_2x_2}}{1+e^{b_0+b_1x_1+b_2x_2}}$$ The regression part is how to estimate the coefficients $b_1,b_2,b_3$, the logistic part is the function form $\frac{e^x}{1+e^x}$ Once you calculate $y(x|b)$ given inputs $x$ and parameters $b$, you need to decide whether this is 0 or 1 because the output $y$ is any number between 0 and 1. So, you need a threshold $Y$, such that you $\tilde y=0$ for $y(x|b)
