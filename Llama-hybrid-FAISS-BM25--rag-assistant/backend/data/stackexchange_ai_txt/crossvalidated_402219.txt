You very probably have multiple-seasonalities : intra-daily, intra-weekly and intra-yearly. Therefore, my first choice would be models that explicitly address these. Examples of such models are bats and tbats . Both are available in the forecast package for R (beware: they take a long time to fit), but I am not aware of any implementations for Python. Seasonal ARIMA can only deal with a single seasonality. You could (and should) certainly fit this as a benchmark, separately for the three kinds of seasonality your data probably contains. That said, both years of your history exhibit a marked dip around August, but the dips are different in both years. Even if this is apparently not the focal time period for your forecast, it would be good to understand what actually happened here and perhaps to model it in some way, e.g., by regressing your consumption on dummy variables and then applying a time series model to residuals.
