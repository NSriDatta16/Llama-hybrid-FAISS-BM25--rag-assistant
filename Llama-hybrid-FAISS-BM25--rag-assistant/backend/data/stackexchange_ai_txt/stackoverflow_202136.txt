How to search a string based key/value collection fast

Hello fellow stackoverflowers! I have a word list of 200.000 string entries, average string length is around 30 characters. This list of words are the key and to each key i have a domain object. I would like to find the domain objects in this collection by only knowing a part of the key. I.E. the search string "kov" would for example match the key "stackoverflow". Currently I am using a Ternary Search Tree (TST), which usually will find the items within 100 milliseconds. This is however too slow for my requirements. The TST implementation could be improved with some minor optimizations and I could try to balance the tree. But i figured that these things would not give me the 5x - 10x speed improvement I am aiming at. I am assuming that the reason for being so slow is that i basically have to visit most nodes in the tree. Any ideas on how to improve the speed of the algorithm? Are there any other algorithms that I should be looking at? Thanks in advance, Oskar
