Django: writing a view to delete an item with checkboxes

I need help writing a view that gets the POST data which then finds out which checkboxes have been checked, and then deletes the items from the database matched by id. Originally, This was a checkbox problem. In a edit order form, there are a list of items. Now I CAN remove the item using a bit of javascript but it does not get save because I need to remove it completly from my database. I tried using my edit order views to remove an item using the delete(), but that doe not work. There must be something else I am doing wrong but I don't know what. delete_item = request.POST.get('delete_item', None) if request.method == 'POST': form = forms.OrderForm(request.POST, instance = order) if form.is_valid() and save_item is not None: form.save(True) request.user.message_set.create(message = "The order has been updated successfully.") return HttpResponse(" window.opener.location = window.opener.location; window.close(); ") if status is not None and contact is not None and save_status is not None and delete_item is not None: try: for id in status_items: item = models.StorageItem.objects.get(pk = id) delete = item delete.delete() current_status = models.ItemStatusHistory(item = item, contact = contact, status = status, user = request.user) current_status.save() except: pass request.user.message_set.create(message = "Status successfully changed for {0} items".format(len(status_items))) {% for item in items %} {{item.tiptop_id}} {{item.alternative_id}} {{item.title}} {{item.type}} {{item.format}} {{item.itemstatushistory_set.latest}} {{item.itemstatushistory_set.latest.date.date|date:"d M Y"}} Edit {% endfor %}
