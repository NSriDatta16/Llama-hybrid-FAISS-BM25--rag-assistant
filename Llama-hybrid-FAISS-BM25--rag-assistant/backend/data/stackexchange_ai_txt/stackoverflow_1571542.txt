Embedding fonts in Flash is not as straight forward as it should be, and there are a bunch of special cases... One way to ensure that you are embedding the correct characters of your font is enabling "Generate size report" in the Flash Publish Settings.... there you will see all characters of all fonts that are being embedded. The only exception is that fonts embedded using the [EMBED tag do not show there. Adding the font to the library doesn't embed the whole set of characters of that font (Arial for instance is about 8mb)... it only embeds a subset of them... I'm not sure if its always the standard occidental Latin set, or if it depends on the computer language. You can extend this set manually using any textfield in your movie (with the "Character embedding..." dialog) as long as you use the actual Library Font name (it shows in the font list with an asterisc at the end... in your case it would be "Arial*"). You can also use the [EMBED tag with the unicodeRange to declare de character set, but bare in mind that the fonts you declare there wont be available in the Flash IDE during editing time... you need to set them at runtime with ActionScript (TextFormat, StyleSheet, etc...), which is not very practical when working with Flash.
