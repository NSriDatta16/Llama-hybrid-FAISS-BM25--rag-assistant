Whether it can be interpreted depends entirely on whether the PCA is measuring something meaningful or not - if you have a substantive interpretation for the 1st component (and better if that's supported in previous work in the literature) then you may be ok - if it's just that there are a bunch of very different outcomes that co-vary then you probably shouldn't put them through a PCA in the first place.
