I had the same problem, You need to configure apache and add the php module... e.g I compiled the php from source as well as the apache. After doing so I then copied the libphp5.so from php/lib dir in to the apache/modules dir. Than you have to add php in the http.conf LoadModule php5_module modules/libphp5.so AddHandler php5-script php you can then restart apache....it's not the most elegant of solutions but it works.
