Is there a way to avoid throwing/catching exceptions when validating Textboxes used for number entry?

In the pursuit of elegant coding, I'd like to avoid having to catch an exception that I know well may be thrown when I try to validate that the Text field of a Textbox is an integer. I'm looking for something similar to the TryGetValue for Dictionary, but the Convert class doesn't seem to have anything to offer except exceptions. Are there any that can return a bool for me to check? To be clear, I'd like to avoid doing this TextEdit amountBox = sender as TextEdit; if (amountBox == null) return; try { Convert.ToInt32(amountBox.Text); } catch (FormatException) { e.Cancel = true; } in favor of something like this: TextEdit amountBox = sender as TextEdit; if (amountBox == null) return; e.Cancel = !SafeConvert.TryConvertToInt32(amountBox.Text); Thanks!
