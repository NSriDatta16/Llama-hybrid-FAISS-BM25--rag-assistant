Using offline storage

I am trying to make a website which will store all the contacts of the user on the server database. The user can add, edit, delete or update a contact. I want the user to be able to do all these functionality even when he is offline. What should I use to achieve this. I came across web sql database which can be use to store database offline. But I dont know how to synchronise the online and offline database. I am using Ruby on Rails
