From the Handbook of Technical Writing. 8th Edition (p. 262): You can make sentences shorter by leaving out some articles(a, an, the), some pronouns (you, this, these), and some verbs, but such sentences may result in telegraphics style and be harder to understand. So, I'd say it's OK to use you, but like Gilbert Le Blanc said in his comment, it's often better to write 'then click the button' instead of 'then you click the button'.
