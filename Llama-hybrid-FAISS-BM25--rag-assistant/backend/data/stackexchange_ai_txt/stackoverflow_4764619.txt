After some more investigation it appears the problem may be with the sequence-identity generation strategy . It attempts to use a query like this: INSERT INTO my_entity (id, name) VALUES (hibernate_sequence.nextval, :p0) returning id into :nhIdOutParam To make a sequence based identity work similarly to the way it would on SQL server (allowing an insert and ID retrieval with a single query). I'm guessing that the out param comes through as a decimal and that is where I'm having problems. Switching to the "native" generation strategy it is working, but I'd still like to hear any other insights on this.
