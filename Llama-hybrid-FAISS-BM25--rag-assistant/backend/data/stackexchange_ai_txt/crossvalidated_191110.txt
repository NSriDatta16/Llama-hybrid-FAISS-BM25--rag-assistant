Detect bounding box of tables in PDF page

I am new to Machine Learning, doing courses and reading papers, and would like to solve the following problem as my learning journey: Given a PDF page I would like to detect the bounding boxes of all tables on the given page. Converting to an image or other semi-structured format is fine during processing. What model and approach would be suitable for this task? What would be the features and output of the algorithm ([(x1,y1;x2,y2),...] coordinates)? What would be good papers, books, videos, articles to start with related to this specific problem?
