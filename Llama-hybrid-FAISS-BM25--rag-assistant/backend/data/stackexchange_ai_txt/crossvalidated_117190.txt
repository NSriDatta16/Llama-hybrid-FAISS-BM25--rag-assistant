How to find a GBM Prediction Interval

I am working with GBM models using the caret package and looking to find a method to solve the prediction intervals for my predicted data. I have searched extensively but only come up with a few ideas to find prediction intervals for Random Forest. Any help/R code would be greatly appreciated!
