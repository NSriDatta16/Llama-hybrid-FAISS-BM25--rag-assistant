Passing several parameters as a single parameter in Java

I've seen an example of it before, but I've never really found any good reference material dealing with it. I know it's possible to pass in several parameters, ints for example, by defining the method as public void aMethod(int...a) But I don't know any more about it than that. I've seen an example, and it returned the average of the ints passed. Is this an out-dated way of passing parameters? Is it even acceptable to use this? What exactly is the syntax like when doing this? (Some reference material would be great)
