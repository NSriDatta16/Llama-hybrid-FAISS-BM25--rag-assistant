Back-transformed confidence intervals

Having come across this discussion I'm raising the question on the back-transformed confidence intervals conventions. According to this article the nominal coverage back-transformed CI for the mean of a log-normal random variable is: $\ UCL(X)= \exp\left(Y+\frac{\text{var}(Y)}{2}+z\sqrt{\frac{\text{var}(Y)}{n}+\frac{\text{var}(Y)^2}{2(n-1)}}\right)$ $\ LCL(X)= \exp\left(Y+\frac{\text{var}(Y)}{2}-z\sqrt{\frac{\text{var}(Y)}{n}+\frac{\text{var}(Y)^2}{2(n-1)}}\right)$ /and not the naive $\exp((Y)+z\sqrt{\text{var}(Y)})$ / Now, what are such CIs for the following transformations: $\sqrt{x}$ and $x^{1/3}$ $\text{arcsin}(\sqrt{x})$ $\log(\frac{x}{1-x})$ $1/x$ How about the tolerance interval for the random variable itself (I mean a single sample value randomly drawn from the population)? Is there the same issue with the back-transformed intervals, or will they have the nominal coverage?
