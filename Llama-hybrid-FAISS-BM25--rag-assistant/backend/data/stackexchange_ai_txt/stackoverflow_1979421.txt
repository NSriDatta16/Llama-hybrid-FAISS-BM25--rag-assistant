No provisioned iPhone connected....!

Hii all, I tried to test my application on the simulator and it fails. Just the day before it was working fine. i checked in the organizer window.. all the provision certificates are installed, but still the color is Orange,. its not working. and when i try to debug the application it shows "No provisioned iPhone connected" error. I got the same problem before, at that time i changed the name of the folder which specify the iphone version, but unfortunately i don't remember now where that folder is. Can anyone help me please.. or is there any alternative. Thanks, Shibin
