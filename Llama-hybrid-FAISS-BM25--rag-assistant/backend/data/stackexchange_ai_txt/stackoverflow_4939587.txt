In Xcode, go to your Target , then right-click and choose: Add -> New Build Phase -> New Run Script Build Phase then add the following: open /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app Now, every time you Build your app, Xcode will run this build script and launch Terminal. Note that you need to point to the correct location of the terminal application. Best way to do this is find the Terminal.app and drag and drop it onto the above screen after you type "open". Once you have Terminal open, you will need to make an AppleScript to send the commands to Terminal to open the specific directory. Use the 'osascript' command to send an AppleEvent to Terminal.
