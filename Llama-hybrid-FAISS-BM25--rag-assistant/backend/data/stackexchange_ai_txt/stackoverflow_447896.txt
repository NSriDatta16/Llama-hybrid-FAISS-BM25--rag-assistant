No offense, but I'd bet that performance issues are more likely to be due to your application code than Spring. If you look at the way they've written their source code, you'll see that they pay a great deal of attention to quality. The only way to know is to profile your app, see where the time is being spent, analyze to determine root cause, correct it, rinse, repeat. That's science. Anything else is guessing. I've used Spring in a production app that's run without a hitch for three years and counting. No memory leaks, no lost connections, no server bounces, no performance issues. It just runs like butter.
