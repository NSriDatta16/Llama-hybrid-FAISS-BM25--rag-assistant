Does your categorical variable only have 2 levels? or more? If only 2 levels then you could fit a logistic regression (or generalized linear mixed model) with effects for group (control/pilot), time (before/after), and subject (this would be the random effect if doing the mixed model) plus the interaction between group and time. The interaction term would be the main one of interest in seeing if the change was different between the 2 groups. Conditional logistic regression may be a compromise between the above 2 methods. If more than 2 levels you could either combine groups until you only have 2 and do the above, or use a multinomial regression (but this is much more complicated with the design you describe).
