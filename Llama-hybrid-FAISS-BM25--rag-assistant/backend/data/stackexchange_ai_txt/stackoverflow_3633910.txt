The package is really a part of the "fully qualified class name". You can actually use that fully qualified name everywhere you use the class name, e.g. com.android.util.UtilClass myUtil = new com.android.util.UtilClass(); But that's rather inconvenient. Therefore, classes in the same package (and in the package java.lang ) can be used shorthand (i.e. only the class name) without imports. Classes from other packages have to be imported before they can be used that way. It's just a way to organize the code and prevent problems when different programmers write classes with the same name - as long as they are in different packages, the collision can always be resolved by using the fully qualified class name.
