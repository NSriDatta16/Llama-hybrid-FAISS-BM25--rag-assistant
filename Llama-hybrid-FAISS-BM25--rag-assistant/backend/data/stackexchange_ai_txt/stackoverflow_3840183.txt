Returning a logical vector for matches: regexp supported?

I want to return a logical vector for regexp matches over a character vector, but match or %in do not seem to support regular expressions, e.g.: > x grep("^B", x) [1] 1 2 > x %in% "^B" [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE I would like this to return [1] TRUE TRUE FALSE Ideas? Thanks, Roberto
