(Seasonal) ARIMA would be one possibility, but fitting it with plain Excel without specific plugins would be a major pain. An alternative would be Exponential Smoothing , specifically seasonal Exponential Smoothing, also known as the Holt-Winters method . The formulas can easily be coded in Excel. I warmly recommend Forecasting: Principles and Practice , 2nd edition, by Athanasopoulos and Hyndman . And I also recommend that you consider looking at R. FPP2 is a good introduction to time series forecasting using R.
