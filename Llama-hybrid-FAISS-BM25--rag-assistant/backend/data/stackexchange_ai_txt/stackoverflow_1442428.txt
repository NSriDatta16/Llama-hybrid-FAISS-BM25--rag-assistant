How can I cache LINQ to SQL results safely?

I have an ASP.Net MVC web app that includes a set of Forums. In order to maintain flexible security, I have chosen an access-control-list style of security. However, this is getting to be a pretty heavy chunk of data to retrieve every time somebody views the forum index. I am using the EnterpriseLibrary.Caching functionality to cache various non-LINQ items on the site. (The BBCode interpreter, the Skins, and etc.) My question is this: What is the safest and most elegant way to cache a LINQ result? Essentially, I would like to keep a copy of the ACL for each forum in memory to prevent the database hit. That way, for each person that hits the site, at most I would have to fetch group membership information. All-in-all I'm really looking for a way to cache large abouts of LINQ data effectively, not just these specific rows.
