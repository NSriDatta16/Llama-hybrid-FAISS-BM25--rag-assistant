While there may be some concept of insertion order in to a database, there is certainly no concept of retrieval order. Any rows that come back from the database will come back in whatever order the DB sees fit to return them in, and this may or may not have ANYTHING to do with the order they were inserted in to the database. Also, the order that rows are inserted in to the DB may have little to nothing related to how they are physically stored on disk. Relying upon any order from a DB query without the use of an ORDER BY clause is folly. If you wish to be certain of any order, you need to maintain that relationship at a formal level (sequences, timestamps, whatever) in your logic when creating the records for insertion.
