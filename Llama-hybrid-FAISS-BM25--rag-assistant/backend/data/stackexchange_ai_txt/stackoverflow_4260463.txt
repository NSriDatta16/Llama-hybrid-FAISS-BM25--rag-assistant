Depends on if you are using actual button objects or CGRect regions that your touchesBegan method responds to. I agree with GamingHorror that the cleanest approach would be to enable/disable the button objects directly as needed. However, this is a workable kludge as long as the sliding touch region is a UIView subclass. Before it slides in you can disable all user touches with: [[[UIApplication sharedApplication] keyWindow] setUserInteractionEnabled:NO]; After your view slides in, you may need to setUserInteractionEnabled:YES on that particular view. When it slides out, you can put it all back with [[[UIApplication sharedApplication] keyWindow] setUserInteractionEnabled:YES];
