Sorry for being blunt, but if you are thinking of applying "security" measures in your executable you are doomed. No scrambling schema will retain an average hacker. You also haven't explained how is your app designed. Is the database hosted by you, or resides in your client's premises? If the latter, then just forget about security and start hiring a lawyer to get a good confidentiality contract so your clients behave. If the former, then using stored procedures is the easiest way.
