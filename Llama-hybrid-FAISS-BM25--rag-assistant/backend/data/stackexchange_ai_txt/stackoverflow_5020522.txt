Querying Amazon Product API to get ASIN of MP3 download using artist and title

I am new using Amazon's Product Advertising API, and for my first project with it, I am trying to get the ASIN of the MP3 download product of a particular song, based on the artist and title. I will eventually be using these ASINs to populate an Amazon MP3 Clips Widget . I am using the PHP class from CodeDiesel.com to get started. It works just fine, and I have added the following function: public function searchMusic($artist, $title) { $parameters = array("Operation" => "ItemSearch", "Artist" => $artist, "Title" => $title, "SearchIndex" => "Music", "ResponseGroup" => "Medium"); $xml_response=$this->queryAmazon($parameters); return $xml_response; } Now, the trouble is, I can only seem to get albums this way. For instance, if I put in "Robert Randolph" for the artist, and "Colorblind" for the title, I get Robert Randolph and the Family Band's Colorblind album. If I search for a particular track, such as "Thrill Of It", Amazon can't find anything. So what I need to do is first figure out how to make a query for track title. Then I need to figure out how to limit my results to just MP3 downloads. How can I do this? If there is documentation on the topic, can you point me in the right direction? I have been reading through it , but don't see any parameters for what I want. Thank you for your time.
