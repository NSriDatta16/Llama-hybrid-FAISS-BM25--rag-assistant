Unfortunately you're not going to be able to create the exact solution you're looking for. The company's existing system depends on linear relationships between the factors and the final score, which is a proxy for probability. Your logistic model, on the other hand, depends on S-shaped curves rather than linear relationships between factors and the probabilities. The latter are bounded at 0 and 1; if you were to try to use linear weights to compute probabilities, you would no doubt have to assign to certain cases probabilities less than zero or greater than one. This is one of the classic reasons why logistic regression is preferred over linear regression when the outcome variable is binary. Your best bet, from a statistical point of view, is to create the best logistic model you can and to use that instead of the existing linear weights system. This will give you the best predictive accuracy while also keeping all predicted probabilities in a reasonable range.
