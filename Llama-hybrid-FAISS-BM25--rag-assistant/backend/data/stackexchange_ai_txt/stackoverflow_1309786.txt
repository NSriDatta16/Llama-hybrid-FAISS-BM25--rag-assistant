If you just require a smoothed average a quick/easy way is to multiply the latest value by x and the average value by (1-x) then add them. This then becomes the new average. edit: Not what the user asked for and not as statistically valid but good enough for a lot of uses. I'll leave it in here (in spite of the downvotes) for search!
