I agree with @Demian Brecht in that you should generate the images server-side, and just output to the browser a simple .png image. However, that won't work too well if you want users to be able to drag things around inside the avatar, to customize the position of the dog, or the hat, or whatever else. Here's a HTML/CSS solution using boring rectangles instead of cool images: The idea is to make exact sized, transparent .png images of each item which could be placed. You have available the top, left, width, height, z-index attributes - that's all you need to allow your users to precisely position; with the addition of a little jQuery magic. Live Demo (doesn't contain any JS, yet) CSS: .avatarContainer { width: 153px; height: 226px; border: 1px solid #666; background: #ccc; position: relative } .avatarContainer div { position: absolute } HTML: I would use this just to allow users to drag stuff around and submit the placement to the server; then you can make the final images in PHP.
