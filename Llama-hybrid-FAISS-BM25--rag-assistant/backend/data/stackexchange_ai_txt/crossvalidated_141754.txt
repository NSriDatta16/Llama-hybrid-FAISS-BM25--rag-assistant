PCA and Correspondence analysis in their relation to Biplot

Biplot is often used to display results of principal component analysis (and of related techniques). It is a dual or overlay scatterplot showing component loadings and component scores simultaneously. I was informed by @amoeba today that he has given an answer departing from my comment to a question which asks about how biplot coordinates are produced/scaled; and his answer consideres several ways in some detail. And @amoeba asked if I would share my experience with biplot. My experience (both theoretical and by experimenting), although very modest, nevetherless highlights two things that are not so frequently recognized: (1) biplot should be classified as analytic technique rather than subsidiary scatterplot; (2) PCA, correspondence analysis (and some other well known techniques) are actually particular cases of the biplot. Or, at least, they both are almost twins to biplot. If you can do biplot you can do the other two. My question to you is: how are they (PCA, CA, Biplot) connected for you? Please, share your thoughts. Meanwile I'm posting my own account about it. I would like to ask to add more answers and to make critical remarks.
