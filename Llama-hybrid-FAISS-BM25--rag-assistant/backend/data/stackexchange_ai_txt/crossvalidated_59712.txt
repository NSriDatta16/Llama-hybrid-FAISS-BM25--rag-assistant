The way an MA(q) model works

I am trying to understand the way MA(q) models work. For this purpose I have created a simple data set with only three values. I then adapted a MA(1) model to it. The results are shown below: x While the MA(1) model looks like this: $$X_t = c +a_t - \theta*a_{t-1}$$ and $a_t$ is White Noise. What I cant figure out is how to get the fitted values: library(forecast) fitted(m) Time Series: Start = 1 End = 3 Frequency = 1 [1] 3.060660 4.387627 3.000000 I tried different ways, but I cant find out how the fitted values ( 3.060660 , 4.387627 and 3.000000 ) are calculated. I would be very thankful for an answer!
