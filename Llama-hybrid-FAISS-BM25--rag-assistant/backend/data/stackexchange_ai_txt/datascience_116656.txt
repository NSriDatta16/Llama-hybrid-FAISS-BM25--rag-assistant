Loss for ordered multi class data in classification

Assume data which is labeled $y_i \in \left\{ 1, 2, 3, \ldots, 9, 10\right\}$ . Assume the labels are ordered, namely, given $y_i = 10$ to estimate $\hat{y}_{i} = 1$ is much worse than $\hat{y}_{i} = 9$ . I am looking for a loss function to take that into consideration and be usable both for deep learning, namely gradient friendly, and decision trees (XGBoost, Scikit-Learn). I'd be happy even to be able to set the weighted loss by a matrix: $$L_{i, j} = loss(y_i, \hat{y}_{j})$$ Namely the loss weight (Or multiplier) will be set by a matrix. Is there a way to achieve this? What other approaches would you use in that case?
