Hyperparameters occur in hierarchical Bayesian models; they are parameters that occur in the prior distribution for the initial parameters that occur in the sampling distribution. If you are undertaking a Bayesian regression model then you have a choice of how you want to impose limits on the slope parameters in the regression. If you are comfortable imposing fixed bounds on the slope parameters then you could treat $S_{\text{max}}$ and $S_{\text{min}}$ as fixed values that are specified by you, in which case they would be constants. Alternatively, you could take them as unknown, in which case they would be hyperparameters with a specified prior distribution. So the short answer is: they are hyperparameters if you choose to treat them as unknown.
