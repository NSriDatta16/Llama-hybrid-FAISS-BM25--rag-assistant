Testing for heteroskedasticity of time series in R

I wish to test my time series data for volatility clustering, i.e. conditional heteroskedasticity. So far, I have used the ACF test on the squared and absolute returns of my data, as well as the Ljung-Box test on the squared data (i.e. McLeod.Li.test). In a recent paper ( http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1771862 , the test is reported on page 8) co-authored by a well-known researcher, they have employed the White test ( http://ideas.repec.org/a/ecm/emetrp/v48y1980i4p817-38.html ) to directly test for heteroskedasticity. I have tried the same approach, however was unable to do so. From my understanding, the White test needs residual variance (usually from a linear regression model) as an input. Now my question is: How did the researchers perform the White test? I do not understand which inputs they used for their White test. While searching for solutions, I have found the sandwich package which uses the vcovHC and vcovHAC functions to estimate a heteroskedasticity-consistent covariance matrix, however the input is also a fitted linear regression model..
