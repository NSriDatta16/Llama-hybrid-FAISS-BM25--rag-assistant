Why does the output of logistic regression using GLM is different from using the formula 1/(1+exp(-y)) with y=b0 + b1*x1 + b2*x2 + ... + bn?*xn

When I use glm with family=binomial I get different results than if I use the direct formula, I have looked for an explanation for this and I can't find anything. I hope you can help me! input I would like to understand why there are differences in the results of this two methods if in theory both are the same
