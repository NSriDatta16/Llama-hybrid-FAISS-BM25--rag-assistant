Memory release problem with cvHoughLines2

I have a problem with javaCV: CvMemStorage storage = CvMemStorage.create(); CvSeq lines = cvHoughLines2( houghInputImage, storage.getPointer(), cv.CV_HOUGH_PROBABILISTIC, rho, Math.PI/theta, threshold, param1, param2 ); // ... storage.release(); This code doesn't release the memory. Used memory groving until my laptop die. If I comment out the cvHoughLines2 line then there is no problem, used memory doesn't groving. Can you help me why it's happening? What do I wrong? My environment: XP Home, OpenCV 2.1, JavaCV20100730, JRE6.
