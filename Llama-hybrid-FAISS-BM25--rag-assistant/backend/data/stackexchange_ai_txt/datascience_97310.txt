What is the difference between BERT and Roberta

I want to understand the difference between BERT and Roberta. I saw the article below. https://towardsdatascience.com/bert-roberta-distilbert-xlnet-which-one-to-use-3d5ab82ba5f8 It mentions that Roberta was trained on 10x more data but I don't understand the dynamic masking part. It says masked tokens change between epochs. Shouldn't this flatten the learning curve?
