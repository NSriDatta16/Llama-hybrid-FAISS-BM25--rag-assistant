It's just going through all the elements in order, using a "binary search" sort of algorithm, and printing out each element. I think the result is just all the elements from indices x to y . Notice that the word mid is a hint: If you're taking the average of two things and getting the middle, then your original variables were probably start and end , respectively. So try rewriting it: void display(int start, int end) { int[] a = { 0, 1, 2, 3 }; if (start == end) { System.out.print(a[start] + " "); } else { int mid = (start + end) / 2; display(start, mid); display(mid + 1, end); } } and it should look a little more obvious: You divide the array in half, call yourself on each half, and when the length of your half is 1, you print the value at that position.
