You need to listen for the textInput event and you need to constantly search for "smile" using something like the search() function(u can use strings or regular expressions). It returns -1 if the string you're searching for wasn't found, otherwise it returns the first index where the searched string was found. Here's a really basic example: var ti:TextField = new TextField(); ti.type = TextFieldType.INPUT; ti.border = true; addChild(ti); ti.addEventListener(TextEvent.TEXT_INPUT, onInput); function onInput(event:TextEvent):void { if(ti.text.search('smile')!=-1) trace('display smiley image'); } You did mention smileys, so depending on your level of comfort with actionscript 3, it might be also worth having a look at Thibault Imbert's SmileyRenderer . Careful it uses the new FTE so you need to use Flash Player 10, etc.
