My understanding was that using for row headers was not just legal but encouraged As far as I know, this was always legal in HTML 4 (and possibly its predecessors), and hasn't changed in HTML5. W3C's HTML5 validator , while still experimental, reports no warnings or errors. Then again, I'm sure the HTML5 validation Visual Studio is using is experimental as well since HTML5 itself hasn't yet been finalized. The HTML5 spec on marking up tabular data, specifically section 4.9.13 , shows the use of within and to scope row data: 2008 2007 2006 Net sales $ 32,479 $ 24,006 $ 19,315 Cost of sales 21,334 15,852 13,717 Gross margin $ 11,145 $ 8,154 $ 5,598 Gross margin percentage 34.3% 34.0% 29.0% So it's perfectly legitimate to have elements inside elements inside either a or . As it should be anyway, since table headings aren't just found on table headers.
