Using Azure as storage for Windows Phone 7 apps

I am trying to figure out why I should use Azure. At the moment, I am using a generic web hosting provider to store my users accounts and data. It works pretty ok for me. I am a very small hobbyist so Azure may not be something for me(?). Anyhow, I now have a problem - I am wondering if Azure might be able to help me with. For my apps and sites, I usually have some kind of user account and data storage. For a new WP7-app, I am making I want to store the data online so I can access and modify it from my web site as well. Now I would like to remove the requirement for the user to create another new account for this little app. I realized that the user of the phone already must have a live-account (because its a requirement for using WP7). Could I use this somehow in combination with Azure to store the data specific to every user and then also access it from my web site?
