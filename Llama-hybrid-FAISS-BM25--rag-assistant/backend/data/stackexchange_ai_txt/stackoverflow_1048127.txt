How can I write a complex CGPath or vector image to disk?

Can I write the bytes of a CGPathRef to disk and then read them back later? Is there an easy way to store a SVG style path to disk? I have a very complicated SVG file (~500K) that I would like to convert into a binary format for easiest storage and loading on the iphone. Looking at the svg file there are only lines and bezier curves all of which map exactly to core graphics path primitives. Thank you so much, Carl C-M
