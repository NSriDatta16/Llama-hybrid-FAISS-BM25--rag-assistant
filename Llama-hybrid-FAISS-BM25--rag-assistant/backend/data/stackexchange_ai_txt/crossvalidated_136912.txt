Estimating the true distributions from a sample of distributions

I am having a hard time formulating the following problem. Consider a company that runs a survey across several cities in the US to estimate the percentage of right-handed people and left-handed people each city (we can ignore that ambidextrous people exist for this problem). We are told that the the counts are biased (presumably with the same bias across all cities), but we don't know how exactly or how much. The input are the counts for a long list of cities: city, # right-handed people, # left-handed people X, 100, 90 Y, 80, 75 Z, 90, 120 ... How can we estimate the true distribution of right-handed people vs left-handed people in each city from this data knowing that there is a bias in the samplng method? I am looking for both Frequentist and Bayesian solutions.
