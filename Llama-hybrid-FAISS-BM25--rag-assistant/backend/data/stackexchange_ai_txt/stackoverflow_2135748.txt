Just because we don't get to multitask our apps doesn't mean the iPhone is doing multitasking. Open web pages in Safari stay in memory until the OS sends Safari the same memory warning you're getting. Mail might start working while your app is running and require more memory. the iPod app is also keeping quite a bit of memory for itself. If you look at the console of the iPhone using the Organizer while your app getting a low memory warning you'll probably see some of the built in apps also getting memory warning and terminating things to free memory. It's quite interesting.
