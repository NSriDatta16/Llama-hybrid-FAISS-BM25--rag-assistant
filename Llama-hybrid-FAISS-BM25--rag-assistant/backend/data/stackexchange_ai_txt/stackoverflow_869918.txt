I know I may not write production code until I have written a failing unit test, so can I tell my manager I cannot write UIs?

I've been using TDD for server-side development. I'm not really sure if the benefits of having all of my production code surrounded by unit tests outweigh the disadvantage of spending 4x more time than needed on refactoring. But when I'm developing UI code, I simply cannot apply TDD. To all fundamentalists out there, the first law of TDD states that "you may not write production code until you have written a failing unit test". But how can this be if you are developing UIs? (One can use acceptance test frameworks like Selenium, but that doesn't count, because you don't interact directly with the source code.) So, can I tell my manager that because of the new >90% code coverage policy I cannot write user interface code?
