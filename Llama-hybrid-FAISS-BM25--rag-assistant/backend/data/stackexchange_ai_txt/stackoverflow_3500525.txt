WPF Application is slow / jerky whilst being moved

I have a rather basic shell of a WPF app that I am creating. When I move it using the DragMove() function the app moves properly but seems to "jerk" a lot. It seems to me that the redraw rate is very low making the application look slow and unresponsive. Currently there is no "code" besides a call to DragMove() . The XAML consists of an outer border with rounded corners and drop shadow set to RenderingBias="Performance" . There is also a small gradient on the title bar and a path. But even commenting these out of the code still makes the app appear jerky and slow whilst moving. Note I have ran this in Release and outside the debugger too.
