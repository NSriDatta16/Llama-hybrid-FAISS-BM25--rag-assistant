You could try applying the knownType attribute to your service contract, like this: [ServiceKnownType(typeof(ACSIS.Core.Common.Configuration.UserAcountDetials))] [ServiceContract] public interface IMyService {... And yes, while it is less elegant, you could use the BinaryFormatter to serialize your header object into a byte[] array, stick that in the header, then de-serialize on the other side. Binary serialization is tricky when it comes to versioning, so you have to be a bit careful.
