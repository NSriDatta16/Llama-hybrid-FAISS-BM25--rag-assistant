jquery: removing everything after an element

I have html code like this: Example &nbsp; Edit &nbsp; Delete and I want to remove everything after the first , including the spaces. What is the most elegant and simple way to do this? I have achieved my purpose with the following jquery: $('li').children(".sub").remove(); $('li').html($('li').html().replace(/&nbsp;/g,'')); but the second line looks too much like a hack. Is there a better way?
