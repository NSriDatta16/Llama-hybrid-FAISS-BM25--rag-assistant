Yes you can. One example is reconstructing an image from its compressed representation: take the original image apply PCA on the original image decide of much variance you want to retain and from that build your compressed data apply the inverse PCA transformation from point 2. on the compressed data to get the reconstructed image In point 3. the higher the variance you pick the more similar to the original/higher quality your final reconstructed image will be, but of course also less compressed. On the other hand picking smaller variance leads to better compression but lower final quality. Check out this notebook for one of the many examples you can find over the internet.
