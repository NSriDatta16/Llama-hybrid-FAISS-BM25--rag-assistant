Here is what i would do: Make it so that the site somewhat works with javascript. if you use ajax all over the place, then make sure that the links have href set to the url you will ajax in. This might get your site to "somewhat" work without javascript. Add some .htaccess redirects for the bots. redirect them to some sane place where they can go to some links and index some stuff Your site as it stands is probably very bad in terms of crawl-ability and SEO. edit : ok, i see your problem. The crawlers get redirected away after seeing the stuff inside noscript. how about this solution then: if you have just one page that has the noscript, then you can add some rewrite rules to your apache config that will show a different version of the page to the bots, and this version will not have the noscript tag. for example: RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} Googlebot [OR] RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} msnbot [OR] RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} Slurp RewriteRule ^.*$ nometa.html [L] Also, what technologies are you using? are you using any server side languages, are you even using apache? i assumed you have apache+html but no server side language. If you do have something running server side, then this is easier.
