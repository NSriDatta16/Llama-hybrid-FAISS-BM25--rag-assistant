Neural networks as finite approximations of continuous functions: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_approximation_theorem In short, neural networks can approximate continuous functions with arbitrary accuracy (that depends on the number of neurons) and consequently form a dense set in the space of continuous functions on any closed and bounded sets. This is tangentially related to stuff like fourier series, and polynomial approximation.
