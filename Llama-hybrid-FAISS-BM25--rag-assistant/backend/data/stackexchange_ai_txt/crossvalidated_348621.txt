Sampling posterior of empty cluster in GMM and Gibbs

Consider performing inference via a standard Gibbs sampler for a standard Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) with $k$ components that are Gaussians $$\mathcal{N}(\mu_{k}, \sigma^{2}_{k})$$ where we assume a classical Normal-InverseGamma (NIG) prior $$\mu_{k}, \sigma_{k}^{2}\sim NIG(\mu_0, V_0, \alpha_0, \beta_0)$$ and you have observed some data $X$. For each iteration of the Gibbs sampler, for each clustering component $k$ I would draw the corresponding parameters from the posterior $$p(\mu_{k}, \sigma^{2}_{k}, | X) = NIG(\mu_n, V_n, \alpha_n, \beta_n)$$ where the parameters $\mu_n, V_n, \alpha_n, \beta_n$ can be derived by conjugacy from $\mu_0, V_0, \alpha_0, \beta_0$ by looking at how many instances ($n$) have been assigned to cluster $k$. Now assume that no instances have been assigned to cluster $k$ at all for a certain iteration of the Gibbs sampler. Therefore it would be correct to just sample $\mu_{k}, \sigma^{2}_{k}$ from the prior $\mu_{k}, \sigma_{k}^{2}\sim NIG(\mu_0, V_0, \alpha_0, \beta_0)$. But what about one does not sample them and keep them "freezed" to the values obtained in the last iteration the cluster has been assigned some values? This does not sound like Gibbs sampling to me anymore, would it be still a MCMC of some sort?
