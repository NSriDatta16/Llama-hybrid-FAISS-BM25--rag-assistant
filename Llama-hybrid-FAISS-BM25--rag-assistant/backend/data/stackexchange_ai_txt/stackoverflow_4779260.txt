Some hosters allow (1) windows scheduled job. (not in that list of 3 you gave). Use it to call your web page. Some hosters allow SQL Agent jobs. Call the page from that. Failing that, have a service/task/job running on an off hosting server that triggers it. (eg cron on your router, windows server)
