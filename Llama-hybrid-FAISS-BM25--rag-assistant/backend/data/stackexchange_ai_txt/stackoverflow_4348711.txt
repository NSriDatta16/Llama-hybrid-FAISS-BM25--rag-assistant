My guess is .Net 3.5. From http://www.codeproject.com/KB/WPF/CentralizingWPFCommands.aspx : The current WPF version's XAML does not allow us to bind event handlers in this way. The event handlers must be defined in the code-behind file inside the MainWindow class. I don't know if this is a bug, an accidentally left out feature, or if we are not even supposed to use this functionality, but this stops us from defining a centralized location for handling all commands' Executed and CanExecute events. The workaround is to define bindings in code: window.CommandBindings.Add(new CommandBinding(Help, HelpExecuted, HelpCanExecute));
