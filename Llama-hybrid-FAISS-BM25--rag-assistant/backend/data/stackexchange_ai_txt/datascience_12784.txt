If you can transform those sentences into number vectors (e.g. into a bag of words or tf-idf representation), I guess you could use k-Means or hierarchical clustering functionality from Orange , a GUI and machine learning library written in Python. It also has an add-on for text mining specifically, but I cannot attest to it as I haven't tried it yet.
