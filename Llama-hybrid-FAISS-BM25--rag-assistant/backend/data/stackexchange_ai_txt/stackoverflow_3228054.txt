If the code is related to the retrieval or 'serving' of data, put it in the appropriate model . If you are writing code that is going to do something with or without that data, ultimately for display on a webpage, put it in the controller . If you're manipulating data for display - e.g. looping over an array of results to build a table (see a standard CakePHP index.ctp for an example) or if you're simply echoing data to display or using helpers to build a page, then it goes in the view (.ctp). This is all well covered in the first three chapters of the book .
