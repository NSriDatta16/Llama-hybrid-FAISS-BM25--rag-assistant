As far as drawing the torus/sphere goes, create a separate class for that and implement a "draw" method. Have the class contain the location of both the sphere and torus and have draw() render those things on the screen. Then just call myRing.draw() in your main drawing method and you'll have a sphere and torus! If you mean you want to have a a circle/ring rendered in 2D (which might be easier) in the top right corner of the window, then the same sort of idea would apply as in your hitbox post (except without that annoying projection calculation!) Lastly, I'd consider using a function key in combination with mouse drags to implement the functionality you want... E.g. the user holds "shift" and then click-drags the mouse across the screen. These mouse events are caught and the x-delta is used to compute the angle of rotation. The camera's location is updated as this happens and you get a smooth sliding motion :)
