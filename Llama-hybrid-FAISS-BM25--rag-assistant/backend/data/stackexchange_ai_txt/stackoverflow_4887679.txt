PHP's rawurlencode is not equal to JavaScripts escape! Why?

i realized when i used urlencode or rawurlencode in PHP encoding the simple character ยง (paragraph) i get the following result: "%C2%A7". But when i use escape in Javascript to encode that character, i get only "%A7". In this case i have encoding problems when sending/receiving data between the server running PHP and the javascript client trying to fetch the data via ajax/jquery. I want to be able to write any type of text i want. For this i encode the text and send it to the backend php script, escaping the data and sending. When i retrieve it, on php side i take the data from mysql and do rawurlencode and send it back. Both sides, work in UTF-8 mode. jquery ajax function is called with "contentType: application/x-www-form-urlencoded:charset=UTF-8" , mysql server is set for UTF-8 both for client and server, and the php script starts echoing with header( "application/x-www-form-urlencoded:charset=UTF-8"); Why is PHP producing that %C2 thing, which generates the character ร on javascript side. Coult somebody help?
