In a way, PCA does not use the outcome you are trying to model/predict, i.e. it is an unsupervised technique. From that perspective, its parameters are not parameters that get trained in your supervised model. Of course, using PCA for dimensionality reduction is not in any way guaranteed to preserve "the signal" for the outcome of interest that may be in the data (see e.g. this previous question for a discussion ). I.e. it may well be preferable to select the most important variables based on subject-matter expertise, if there is a decent amount of prior knowledge. There's of course also other techniques/alternatives to PCA (e.g. various variants of PCA, UMAP, t-SNE, training a denoising autoencoder on the features and so on). However, a lot may also depend on your goals. Are you trying to interpret the model coefficients (if so, PCA does make that harder), are you trying to create a prediction model that is meant to achieve a certain level of performance (if so, interpretability of PCA may be less of a concern, but it may also be even more of a problem to be working with too little data), or are you trying to do something else?
