How to play YouTube Movie on an iPhone Application when tapped on UITableViewCell?

I'm a newbie to iPhone development and just started on developing an application that contains a UITableView where each cell consisting of youtube video thumbnails in the form of webviews. For embedding YouTube Player on iPhone, I have used the follwing piece of code. - (void)embedYouTube:(NSString*)url frame:(CGRect)frame { NSString* embedHTML = @"\ \ \ body {\ background-color: transparent;\ color: white;\ }\ \ \ \ "; NSString* html = [NSString stringWithFormat:embedHTML, url, frame.size.width, frame.size.height]; if(videoView == nil) { videoView = [[UIWebView alloc] initWithFrame:frame]; [self.view addSubview:videoView]; } [videoView loadHTMLString:html baseURL:nil]; } Now that I can see the thumbnail on the tableviewcell and once I tap on the thumbnail, YouTube player opens and play the movie. My thumbnail occupies only a small portion of the cell and the rest of the area of the cell contains some text descriptions. My problem is that I must tap exactly on the thumbnail for the movie to play. If I tap somewhere else on the cell then it wouldn't play because my thumbnail doesn't extend all over the cell. Isn't there a way to make the movie to play in didSelectRowAtIndexPath ? I have seen some chaps suggest using Javascript but nobody seem to have an idea on the correct way of using it for this problem. Highly appreciate it if anybody can help.
