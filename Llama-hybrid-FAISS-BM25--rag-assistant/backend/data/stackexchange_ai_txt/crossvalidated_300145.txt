Cluster Employees based on multiple Check in-Check out time in a day

Using machine learning techniques, is it possible to analyse Employee Check in-Check Out time over a period of time and cluster them. 1. An employee can check-in/checkout any number of times in a day. 2. They have a defined roster schedule. 3. Employees may go to different buildings for work. 4. Location, department can be some additional fields while clustering. Edit: How to represent multiple check-in/check-out in a day to expose to time series algorithm and then cluster ? Sample test data of 6 employees for a week period https://www.dropbox.com/s/5f9hxuyr12x26rc/testData.csv?dl=0 * Initials rows * Idnumber,Dept,EventTime,Location 1651589,D2000,2017-08-14 15:39:02,BLDG2-7F-D015 Entry 1651589,D2000,2017-08-14 15:38:54,BLDG2-7F-D018 Exit 83240,D1000,2017-08-14 15:22:37,BLDG1-4F-D004 1651589,D2000,2017-08-14 15:11:26,BLDG2-7F-D018 Entry 1651589,D2000,2017-08-14 15:11:20,BLDG2-7F-D015 Exit 62879,D1000,2017-08-14 14:49:15,BLDG1-4F-D004 62879,D1000,2017-08-14 14:47:10,BLDG1-3F-D004 83240,D1000,2017-08-14 14:45:40,BLDG1-4F-D006 Entry 83240,D1000,2017-08-14 14:37:53,BLDG1-4F-D006 Exit 84778,D1000,2017-08-14 14:24:41,BLDG2-GF-G018 Entry 1662394,D2000,2017-08-14 14:13:11,BLDG2-1F-G025 Entry 1662394,D2000,2017-08-14 14:12:19,BLDG2-1F-G025 Exit 84778,D1000,2017-08-14 14:11:17,BLDG1-GF-G003 Exit ...
