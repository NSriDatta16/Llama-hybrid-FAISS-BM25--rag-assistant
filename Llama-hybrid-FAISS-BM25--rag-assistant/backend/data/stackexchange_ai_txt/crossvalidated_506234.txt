Looking for a non parametric test for a continuos variable by two categorical variables (one with greater than 2 levels)

I have two categorical variables (one with greater than 2 levels(let's call this Categorical.variable1) and one with 2 levels (Categorical.variable2) and a continuous variable. I want to test my continuous variable grouped by Categorical.variable2 at each Categorical.variable1. Also, my continuous variable is not normally distributed so I need a non-parametric test. I find it difficult to explain so I will re-iterate with examples- Age will be the categorical varibale in this case with greater than 2 levels (age 0 until 20 is the range). the other categorical variable is sex (M,F). Finally, the continuoes variable is weight. I want to test for signifigant differences of weight between sexes at a given age. (not comparing age 3-4 but age 3-3 between sexes). I know i can use a wilcox test to test at each individual age but im looking for a single test to do this across all ages at once.
