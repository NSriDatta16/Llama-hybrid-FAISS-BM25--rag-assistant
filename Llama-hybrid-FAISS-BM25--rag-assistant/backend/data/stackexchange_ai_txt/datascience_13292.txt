e.g. linear SVM is less prone to overfitting than non-linear SVM, especially when you have a large number of features (comparing to your training samples) But yeah in general the more complex a model is the more prone it is to overfitting, e.g., Deep Neural Networks are Easily Fooled: High Confidence Predictions for Unrecognizable Images
