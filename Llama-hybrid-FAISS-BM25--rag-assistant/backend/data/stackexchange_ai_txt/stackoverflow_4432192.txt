Use nohup to have your script ignore SIGHUP, which is sent to backgrounded processes when the parent shell exits. spawn ssh -l root2 ${add} nohup /home/jason/localCopy/selfMonitor & Also, ssh intentionally makes it difficult to script the password entry and you are encouraged not to work around this behavior. The right way to allow password-less ssh access is to use pre-authorized keys. Run ssh-keygen on the client. You can press enter at all the prompts to use a blank password. Add the contents of ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub to the end of a file called authorized_keys on the server: root2@server:~/.ssh/authorized_keys . Creating a key and then adding it to authorized_keys allows the client to connect to the server without using a password, and it lets you do it without hard coding a password into a plaintext script.
