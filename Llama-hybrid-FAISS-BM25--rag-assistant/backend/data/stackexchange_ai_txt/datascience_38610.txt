Actually, Google Brain already did similar thing for image classifiers Still, their research uses backpropagation to train networks, but they use genetic algorithms to find a good architecture. One more thing to mention: to get to their best model - it required them enormous amount of computation power. They published first paper in 2017 and in 2018 got an improved version . You can read about it in their blog-post There is another research for network architecture search, but they use bayesian optimization instead of genetic algorithms
