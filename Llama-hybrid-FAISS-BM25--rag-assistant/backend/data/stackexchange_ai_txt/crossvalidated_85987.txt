Which is better, stl or decompose?

I am doing time series analysis using R. I have to decompose my data into trend, seasonal and random component. I have weekly data for 3 years. I have found two functions in R -- stl() and decompose() . I have read that stl() is not good for multiplicative decomposition. Can anybody tell me in what scenario these functions can be used?
