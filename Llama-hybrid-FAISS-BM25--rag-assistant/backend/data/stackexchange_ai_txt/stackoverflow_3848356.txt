Declaration or Definition

I have a confusion about declaration and definition. In the statement int switchon(float duration); Q1. Is the parameter 'duration' being defined or is it being declared? As per section 3.1/2 of the holy Standard, it is a definition, but I am unable to understand why. Q2. What is the exact difference between declaration and definition? C++ In a Nutshell says that A definition defines the storage, value, body, or contents of a declaration. The difference between a declaration and a definition is that a declaration tells you an entity's name and the external view of the entity, such as an object's type or a function's parameters, and a definition provides the internal workings of the entity: the storage and initial value of an object, a function body, and so on. This definition of 'definition and declaration' also does not help me to understand why 'duration' is a definition and not a declaration in the statement above. REDIT: UncleO's post gave me an idea and this is what I tried: I changed my code as: int switchon(float duration, int duration); // idea is to see what error // compiler gives int main() { } error C2371: 'duration' : redefinition; different basic types
