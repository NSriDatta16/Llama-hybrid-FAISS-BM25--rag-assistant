I'm not sure exactly what you mean by a single column CSV file; if it has a single column, isn't it just a text file? Anyway, if each line looks like above and we have a file like this: bash-3.2$ cat example.txt The sample battery has a Voltage: 11.1V, and capacity: 4500mAh The sample battery has some other info but no v entry The sample battery has a Voltage: 12.1V, and capacity: 4200mAh Then you can achieve this easily strip out the 11.1 with a regexp and retain the indexing with like this: bash-3.2$ sed -e 's/.*Voltage: \([^V]*\)V.*/\1/' -e 's/^The.*//' Which can be adjusted if I've misunderstood the format of the not voltage containing lines. Note that my expressions are very fragile with respect to your formatting, and can be improved. Also note that I didn't include quotations, as your intent was unclear. The above needs to be (trivially) adjusted to work with them.
