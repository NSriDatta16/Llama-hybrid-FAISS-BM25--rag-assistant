This type of hierarchical model does shrink the estimates and reduces the number of false claims to a reasonable extent for a small to moderate number of hypotheses. Does it guarantee some specific type I error rate? No. This particular suggestion by Gelman (who acknowledges the issue with looking at too many different things and then too easily wrongly concluding that you see something for some of them - in fact one of his pet topics on his blog) is distinct from a the extreme alternative viewpoint that holds that Bayesian methods do not need to account for multiplicity, because all that matters are your likelihood (and your prior).
