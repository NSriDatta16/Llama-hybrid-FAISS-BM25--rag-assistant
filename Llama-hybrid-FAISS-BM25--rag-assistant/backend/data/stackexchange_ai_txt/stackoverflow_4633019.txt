The #pragma pack directive modifies the current alignment rule for members of structures following the directive. Hence, it affects the size of structs defined after the pragma! You most likely don't need this. Just use sizeof(Foo) wherever you want to know the size of your struct. And don't write pragmas, as they are used in some special cases! You can see these links to know in details about pragmas: GCC - Structure-Packing Pragmas MSVC++ - Pack pragma pack
