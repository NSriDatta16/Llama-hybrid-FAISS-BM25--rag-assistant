You have a few options to get data back into Lotus Notes. I think the best bet is to use the Java API to call into Lotus Notes and add the data back in. There is an open-source interface to the Java API that might make life easier, called domingo . Otherwise, see the domino designer help on how to use the Java API. Here is a list of all the ways to get data back into Notes that I can think of in five minutes: use COM or Java API to call Notes objects and methods ( see Domino Designer Help) . use NotesSQL to INSERT data back into Notes using SQL commands. Setup the Notes database as a mail-in database and pass data via an email Setup a scheduled agent to read from a specified directory (have it run every minute or two), and import the data from a file. If you are using Domino, you can pass data in via a URL's query string and process it within an agent.
