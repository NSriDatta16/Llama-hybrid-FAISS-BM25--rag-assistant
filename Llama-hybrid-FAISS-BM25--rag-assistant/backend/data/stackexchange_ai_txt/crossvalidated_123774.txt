Placement of earlier features in more complex features in CNN

I'm trying to understand convolutional neural networks better. I've been doing different tutorials, but there are some basics concerning how the hidden units represents features that I really would like to have clarified. Look at the following picture (from slide 31 from www.cs.stanford.edu/people/ang//slides/DeepLearning-Mar2013.pptx by Andrew Ng): When combining features from layer 3 (object parts) to layer 4 (object models), how does the specific hidden unit know where to place the different features? I would guess it would know that the hidden unit should represent 0.3 x "mouth feature" and 0.6 x "eyebrow feature", but how does it know to place the eyebrow above the mouth? Thanks. Any links to books or websites with easy-to-understand material on this would also be greatly appreciated!
