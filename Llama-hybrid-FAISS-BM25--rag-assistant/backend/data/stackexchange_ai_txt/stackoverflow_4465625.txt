MySQL keeps crashing due to bug

So about a week ago, I finally figured out what was causing my server to continually crash. After reviewing my mysqld.log I keep seeing this same error, 101210 5:04:32 [Warning] option 'max_join_size': unsigned value 18446744073709551615 adjusted to 4294967295 Here is a link to the bug report, http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=35346 someone recommend that you set the max_join_size vaule in my.cnf to 4M, and I did. I assumed this fixed the issue, and it was working for about a week with no issues until today... I checked MySQL and the same error is now back, 101216 06:35:25 mysqld restarted 101216 6:38:15 [Warning] option 'max_join_size': unsigned value 18446744073709551615 adjusted to 4294967295 101216 6:38:15 [Warning] option 'max_join_size': unsigned value 18446744073709551615 adjusted to 4294967295 101216 06:40:42 mysqld ended Anyone know how I can really fix this issue? I can't keep having mysql crash like this. EDIT: I forgot to mention every time this happens I get an email from linode staying I have a high disk io rate Your Linode, has exceeded the notification threshold (1000) for disk io rate by averaging 2483.68 for the last 2 hours.
