How do I obtain the url of an application in VSTO application

I have an webapplication in C#, where I will call the VSTO 2003. It works fine. I want the url of the application, so that I can connect to a webservice. For the time being I have hardcoded the webservice url, in the Sheet1_Startup method. But the url will be changed, so I need a way obtain the url dynamically. That is when I call the VSTO, i want the url to be placed in one of the cells in the Excel OR Is there any method where I can pass a query string to the VSTO 2003 application from my web application. Kindly help please. @RobertG5 I wrote the code in my web application as below System.Data.OleDb.OleDbConnection objConn = new System.Data.OleDb.OleDbConnection( "Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0;Data Source=" + @"C:\Examples\VSTO2007\VSTO2007\VSTO2007.xlsx" + ";Extended Properties=Excel 8.0;"); objConn.Open(); System.Data.OleDb.OleDbCommand objCmd = new System.Data.OleDb.OleDbCommand(); objCmd.Connection = objConn; objCmd.CommandText = "Insert into [Sheet1$]" + " values ('Test')"; objCmd.ExecuteNonQuery(); // Close the connection. objConn.Close(); And the values did get inserted into the vsto excel sheet. Now how do I download this excel. Regards, cmrhema
