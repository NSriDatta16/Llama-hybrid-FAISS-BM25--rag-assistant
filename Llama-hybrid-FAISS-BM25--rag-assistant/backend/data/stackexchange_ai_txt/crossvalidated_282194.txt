Interpretation of cloglog model in layman's terms

I fitted a beta regression model via MCMC with a complementary log-log link function. Is there a way to interpret it in a layman's terms? The estimates of the model are: \begin{align} \beta_0 &= -1.12 &\beta_1 &= -0.142 &\beta_2 &= 0.127 \\ \eta_0 &= -3.22 &\eta_1 &= 0.72 &\eta_2 &= 0.87 \end{align} The response variable is the proportion of income spent on children's education, $X_1$ is the family income, and $X_2$ is the number of sons. The $\beta$'s are associated with the mean parameter of the distribution and the $\eta$'s with the dispersion parameter. I already read this topic interpreting estimates of cloglog logistic regression , but I think that that interpretation is not appropriate.
