In your case the response variable actually is binary, it has just been summarised into a ratio. Each individual either gets out of the building (1) or doesn't (0). So logistic regression is quite appropriate, you just need to put your data into an appropriate form (which will depend on your software). In R you do this by making the proportion the response and specifying the population sizes (ie number of trials) as weights. It sounds like you also have some questions about hypothesis testing and model selection but they might be best put into a separate question, perhaps after you are happy with the logistic regression issue.
