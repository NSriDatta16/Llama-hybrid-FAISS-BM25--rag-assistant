Strange Crystal Report formatting problem

I am using Crystal Reports v10.0.x on Windows Server 2003 SP2. I have an .rpt file that gets exported into a PDF format using the Crystal Reports Engine thingy. new CrystalDecisions.CrystalReports.Engine.ReportDocument().ExportToDisk(CrystalDecisions.Shared.ExportFormatType.PortableDocFormat, fullExportFileName); I have this report on two boxes. Both the boxes are Windows Server 2003 with SP 2 running the same version of Crystal Reports. Let's call these boxes box 1 and box 2. Till now, all reports ran fine on both the boxes. Suddenly, since yesterday, one box 1, all reports have a formatting issue. All reports that have text fields/text boxes with running paragraph text truncate the right most few characters on every line, or at least that is how they display it, if you know what I mean. For e.g. the text Today is a great day for everything else except this problem I am facing with Crystal Reports. And then, there's a whole lot of work to do after this. I am sick and tired of this job. is displayed as: Today is a great day for everything else except this problem I am facing w Crystal Reports. And then, there's a whole lot of work to do after this. I a sick and tired of this job. The code on both the boxes is the same, and the .rpt files, too, are the same. Please help.
