Floats would be way more than sufficient for storing GPS coordinates, even if consumer-level GPS devices had anywhere near the accuracy claimed for them. If you don't believe this is true, try these two simple experiments: Take two or more GPS devices out into one spot on a field somewhere, and jot down the coordinates measured by each device. Go back inside and plot the points from each device on a map (I think Google has something that does this for you). You'll be suprised at how far apart the points are (even though they're all supposed to be measuring the exact same spot). Take your (allegedly) most accurate device, and place it somewhere where it can get a satellite fix but won't get rained on, and record a series of measurements taken over a couple of days. Plot all of the readings (as in #1). Again, you'll be surprised by how the points (which should all be the same or nearly the same) wander all over the map, sometimes by as much as a couple hundred feet. I've been writing applications for GPS-enabled PDAs for years, and I've verified this for dubious customers over and over again (I've even won bets this way). There are higher-quality GPS devices out there that do achieve better accuracy than this, but the better accuracy is achieved with more expensive chipsets, and the devices are left in one spot for days or even weeks, with the readings averaged over time. A four-byte float is far more accurate than the devices themselves . It would of course not hurt you at all to use a double instead, as long as the 2X factor isn't a problem for you.
