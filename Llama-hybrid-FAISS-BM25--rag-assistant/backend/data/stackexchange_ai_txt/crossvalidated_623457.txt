The P-value approach to hypothesis testing

When we do a hypothesis testing we follow the steps given below: Step 1: Form a null hypothesis $H_0 : \mu_{\bar{x}} = K$ . Form an alternative hypothesis $H_1 : \mu \neq K$ Step 2: Decide a significance level $\alpha$ . Step 3: Take a sample of size $n$ , find its mean $\bar{x}$ . $\color{red}{Step~ 4} $ : From the known population mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$ , calculate $$ \mu_{\bar{x}} = \mu \\ \sigma_{\bar{x}} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$$ Step 5: Convert $\bar{x}$ to standard units as follows $$ z = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_{\bar{x}} }{\sigma_{\bar{x}}}$$ Step 6: Find the probability of $z$ If $P(z) \gt \alpha$ , do not reject the null hypothesis, else reject it. My doubt is quite foundational here, what would we do by doing a test of any kind when we already know such great things about population: its mean and its standard deviation. And how would be ever be able to know the standard deviation of the population? Let me illustrate my question through an example: I told my friend that on average I make 5 successful 3-pointer in a basket-ball game. That would me by $K$ and $\mu$ . And how can I tell him $\sigma$ , it doesn't make any sense (after all the population size is also not decided, I'm simply telling him what I have observed since my childhood)? If he wants to check, he would ask me to play a few games (let's say 10 games), and he would count the number of successful 3-pointer shots, but he wouldn't be able to convert his $\bar{x}$ to $z$ , because I cannot provide him with $\sigma$ . Thus, the test of hypothesis through $P-value$ approach is totally inapplicable. Can you please show me in what type of research we find the P-value approach helpful when all the research is to be done by one person only? (By that I mean, the person doesn't want to check a government data, but have to come up with his own hypothesis and data. Wouldn't population mean, in itself, be the gem a researcher seeks for?)
