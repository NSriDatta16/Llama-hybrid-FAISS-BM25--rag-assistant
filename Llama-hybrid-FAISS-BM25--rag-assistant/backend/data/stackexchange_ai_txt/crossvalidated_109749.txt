Can I have multiple individuals for each time point in ARIMA?

I am a novice learner of ARIMA modeling. I have a dataset which includes many cities that are followed up regularly for several years. Each city has its own record (household income, and well-being index) for each time point. Then I sort it by year (so it's a long-form data, a single record for each city at each time point). If I want to use ARIMA to check the relationship between household income (covariate) and well-being (outcome) over time, is it okay to perform ARIMA by using this data set? Or I must generate two "summary" variables called "average well-being of all cities in a given year" and "average income of all cities in a given year" (which is the mean of the whole sample for each time point) before performing ARIMA? I am confused because most tutorials online only include one subject (rather than multiple cities) for each time point. Thanks!
