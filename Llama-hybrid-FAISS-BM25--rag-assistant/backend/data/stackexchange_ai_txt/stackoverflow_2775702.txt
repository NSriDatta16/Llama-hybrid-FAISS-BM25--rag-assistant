I've done things like this using variations of substring and replace. I'd probably use regex today but you wanted an alternative so: For the tags, I'd do something like: $text = replace($text, " ", ""); $text = replace($text, " ", ""); (My php is really rusty, so replace may not be the right function name -- but the idea is what I'm sharing.) The tag is a bit more tricky. But, it can be done. You need to find the point that starts and that the > ends with. Then you extract the entire length and replace the closing That might go something like: $start = strrpos( $text, " ", $start ); $text = substr( $text, $start, $end ); $text = replace($text, " ", ""); (I don't know if this will work, again the idea is what I want to communicate. I hope the code fragments help but they probably don't work "out of the box". There are also a lot of possible bugs in the code snippets depending on your exact implementation and environment) Reference: strrpos - http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.strrpos.php replace - http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.str-replace.php substr - http://php.net/manual/en/function.substr.php
