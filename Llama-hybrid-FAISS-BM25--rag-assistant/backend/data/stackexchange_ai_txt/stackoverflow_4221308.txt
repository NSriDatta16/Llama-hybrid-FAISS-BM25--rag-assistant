Firing touchesBegan on a MKMapView with VoiceOver enabled

As an exercise with accessibility and a personal challenge to myself I decided that I'd like to write a relatively simple app. The app would show an MKMapView of the United States and when you tap anywhere on it, it uses an MKReverseGeocoder to show you the locality, state and country where you tapped. This works fine, although I have to hijack the touch events by adding a WildcardGestureRecognizer to the MKMapView . This works great with VoiceOver turned off. When I turn VoiceOver on and tap on the map, it says "map". If I double tap it makes it little clicky noise which indicates that you've activated it. To be honest, I'm at a loss for how to intercept these events. I know the general solution is to put a transparent view above the whole screen and pass down touches, but will that work with VoiceOver ? For the record, the WildcardGestureRecognizer I'm using is found here: How to intercept touches events on a MKMapView or UIWebView objects?
