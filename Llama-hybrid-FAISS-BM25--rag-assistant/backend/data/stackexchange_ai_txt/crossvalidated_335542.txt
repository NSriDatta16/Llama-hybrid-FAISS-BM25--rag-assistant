How do I deal with imperfect detection of a covariate in Bayesian Binomial Regression?

First time question, I've had a search around but couldn't find anything, but apologies if this repeats someone else's question. I am running a binomial regression with JAGS, attempting to model the probability of pregnancy given the results of a diagnostic test and membership to one of four groups. I also have a random effect for the Site at which these results were collected. Currently, my JAGS code looks like this: model { for(i in 1:N){ PregStatus[i] ~ dbin(regression_prob[i], 1) logit(regression_prob[i]) I would like to incorporate the fact that the diagnostic test variable x1 is imperfect (not 100% specificity or sensitivity). I've found many examples in the literature where the dependent variable has imperfect detection, but I am trying to code imperfect detection of the covariate, which then feeds in to a larger regression model. I've been trying adapt the models found in Valle et al., 2015 ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4634725/ ), but these are all examples where the response variable has imperfect detection. I thought of adapting the first model in the paper with sensitivity (SN) and specificity (SP) values from the literature like this; #imperfect detection of x1 tmp[i] In the paper tmp[i] is a function of the covariates, so I'm not sure how this should really be produced when it's feeding in to a covariate that is part of a bigger model. Has anyone got any examples where model covariates have imperfect detection, or any insights on if my model is doing what I hope it does?
