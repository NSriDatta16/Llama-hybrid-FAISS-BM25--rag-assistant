Most of the earlier examples (e.g. the original NerdDinner ) were based on either Linq to Sql or Entity Framework (without CodeFirst). Since CodeFirst is the 'new hotness' most of the latest examples use it. The interesting part of the question, though, is that it highlights an important point: "it doesn't matter". Your data access strategy (EF, EF code first, NHibernate, L2S, raw SQL) is totally irrelevant to MVC. By that I don't mean it's unimportant, I mean that MVC doesn't place any constraints on you at all in that regard. You will generally (in a well-designed MVC app) pass your controllers interfaces which let them call data access methods of various sorts (or perhaps another layer of indirection with services that do other things before hitting the storage layer). The implementation of the data access, if it is using an ORM like EF or Nhibernate, will then have mechanisms for you to either use a query syntax of some sort (e.g. LINQ) or to call stored procedures (possible in all major ORMs that Iv'e used) or to push raw SQL if hte situation calls for it.
