So, I went on an investigation to track down this bug, and I found out that when you use a CSS transform property (not limited rotate) it is re-rendered. Usually elements that come after a floating element know not to overlap it but to flow under it (the content floats but the background of a paragraph for instance still span the entire width of the containing element, going behind the floating element). When an element is rotated however the browser doesn't take in account the floating elements. The rotated element will overlap floating elements. The same goes for relatively/absolutely positioned elements that come before the rotated element in the DOM; they get overlapped too. Some test cases: jsFiddle
