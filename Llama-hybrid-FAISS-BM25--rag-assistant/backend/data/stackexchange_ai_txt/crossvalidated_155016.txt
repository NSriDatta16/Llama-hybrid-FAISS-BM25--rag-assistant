The formalism used to write models in R can be quite handy, in this case with factor variables explicitly noted: Y ~ age + calendar + factor(teacher) + factor(gender) + factor(prep_course) You could expand to indicate more specifically that this is a logistic regression, and I suppose to indicate the reference levels of the factor variables (although that probably isn't so important for your presentation).
