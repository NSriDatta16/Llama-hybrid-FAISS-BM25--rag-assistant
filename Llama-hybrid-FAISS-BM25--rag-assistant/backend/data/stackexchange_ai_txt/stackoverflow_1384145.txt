Consider using a C++ library on the writer side. If the reader side is constrained, create structures with the very same memory layout in unmanaged C++ and dump them to the binary file. You probably have to use #pragma pack(1) to disable the default packing and put some char[] dummies between your structure elements to resemble the alignment on the reader side. Don't forget about endianness. Then just call the writer library using DllImport or via C++/CLI (it's a matter of taste).
