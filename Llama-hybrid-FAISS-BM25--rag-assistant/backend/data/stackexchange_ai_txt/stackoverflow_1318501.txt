I just found the solution here . App.config is now being used properly when running my tests through the NUnit GUI. Apparently if you are using the NUnit GUI and add the assembly by going through Project > Add Assembly, it doesn't access the app.config. However, if you add the assembly to the NUnit project by dragging the dll from Windows Explorer into the NUnit GUI, then it will access the app.config. Alternatively, you can add the assembly through the GUI and then go in the NUnit GUI > Project > Edit, and set the Configuration File Name to the name of the configuration file (VS will set this to name.of.your.dll.config) and set the Project Base to the \bin\Debug directory of your project (these are the extra steps that are done in the background when you drag in the assembly vs adding it manually.
