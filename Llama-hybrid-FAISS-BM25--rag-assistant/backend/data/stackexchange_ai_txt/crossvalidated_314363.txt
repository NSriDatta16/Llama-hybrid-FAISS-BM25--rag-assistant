Let the regressor be $x$ and the response be $Y$ with possible values $0$ and $1$. The logistic regression model is $$p(x) = \Pr(Y=1) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-\alpha - \beta x}}.$$ Given estimates $\hat \alpha$ and $\hat \beta \ne 0$, this formula can be inverted to solve for $x$ in terms of any $p$ between $0$ and $1$: $$x = \frac{1}{\hat\beta}\left(\log\left(\frac{p}{1-p}\right) - \hat\alpha\right).\tag{1}$$ Here is an example from the mtcars dataset. It plots am against mpg , shows the curve $x\to p(x),$ and (using matching colors) locates the values of mpg corresponding to $p$ in the set $\{0.05, 0.10, 0.20, 0.50, 0.80, 0.90, 0.95\}$. The visually evident fact that the intersections of all pairs of like-colored lines fall along the curve demonstrates the correctness of formula $(1)$ in this example. Formula $(1)$ is implemented in the third line of the R code that produced this example. fit
