Caleb, In case you don't already know, Visual Studio 2008 Team System Editions of VS2008 can do code coverage for you. It's not as comprehensive as NCover, but it should be a great start for you. If you like what it does and you want more bells and whistles, than I don't see why not. (It's only $200 for the classic edition the last time I checked). -Artel
