Turning a player's points value into a 1-10 match rating scale?

So I have the players "fantasy score" stat. This stat is the sum of their ingame stats multiplied by preset weights. These weights are from the video game DOTA 2's official fantasy points weights. For example: Points for kills are calculated by the number of kills *.3 Points for deaths are calculated by starting at 3 and subtracting .3 per death There isn't a set minimum nor maximum for what these scores can be. I want to take these scores and normalize them to a 1-10 scale similar to soccers 1-10 match rating system. I don't have a sold statistics background so I don't know where to start. Should I play around with the weights work? Should I look at the standard deviation? Should I look at the distribution and scale it that way? I know a decent amount of machine learning through python, but I worry that my lack of stats background could negatively influence the scale I would have to create for the training data
