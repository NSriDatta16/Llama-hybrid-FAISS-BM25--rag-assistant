How can I appropriately handle cleaning of gender data?

I’m a data science student and I’ve begun working with an open mental health dataset. As part of this, I need to clean the data so that I can perform an analysis of it. In this dataset, the gender field is a string that could have had anything entered into it. While cleaning most entries are fairly straightforward (“f”, “F”, “female”, “cis female” and “woman” can all be coded to “F”), what I was wondering about was how to properly handle trans or queer identities (e.g. an entry that says something like “trans female” or “queer/she/they”). Should I create a new code for trans entries for each gender, or should I just code them as though they were members of the gender they identify as? Should I just drop them from the dataset entirely, because they might distort it? I remember reading that trans individuals suffer from much higher rates of mental illness than cis individuals. Are there any best practices that I should follow in this regard?
