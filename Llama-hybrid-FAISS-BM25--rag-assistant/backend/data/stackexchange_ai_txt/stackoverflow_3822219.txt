Thanks guys for all of your response, I'm already done with it. ALTER TABLE tbl_user MODIFY gender char(1) AFTER username; Well it's just like organizing your table right? you don't want your primary key field to be on the last order of your table, at least I know how to coonfigure it if ever I encounter that problem, I'm trying to get used in text based database and not using gui for now. Thanks again guys :)
