Binary Classification Probabilities

I'm using keras in R to predict financial time series. I guess that ANN converges. But when I do predictions I can see that probabilities don't sum up to 1 I'm using relu as final activation and loss = "binary_crossentropy" . Does that mean the net doesn't converge or do I miss something else?
