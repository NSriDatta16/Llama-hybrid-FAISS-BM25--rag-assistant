Confusion about Bayesian statistics. Does the probability for heads change from .5 to 1, after observing heads?

P(A): The coin has a 50 percent chance of being Heads. P(A|X): You look at the coin, observe a Heads has landed, denote this information X, and trivially assign probability 1.0 to Heads and 0.0 to Tails. I have seen this example many times. However, it does not make senses to me. Given that I know a fair coin would be 50/50 chance. When I see a head landed first, I would naively guess that the next one to be Tail. So then when should I update my belief that the probability of Head should be 1.0? If I were a Frequentist then I would have known the events are independent so I continue to assign 0.5 probability to both Head and Tail. Is that correct?
