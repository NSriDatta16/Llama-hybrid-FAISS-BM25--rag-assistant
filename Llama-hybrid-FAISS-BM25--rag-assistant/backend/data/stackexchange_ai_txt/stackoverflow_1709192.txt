I've not used DockPanel suite, but with Visual Studio form designer creating form drop enabled and appropriate handers on the form, almost everything I add (no properties changed) allows the form to "see" the drag/drop. Including, Panel, SplitContainer, TabControl, ListBox, Button, ListView. The only thing I tried that didn't work (and the question I had when I arrived at this page) was the RichText control, I guess that's because it allows Drag-n-Drop editing. My guess would be this is DockPanel suite specific behaviour. I don't know anything about that, but I'd guess it has to consume drag-n-drop to implement its dock functions. Maybe there are events you can hook at the DockPanel panel level rather than the form level.
