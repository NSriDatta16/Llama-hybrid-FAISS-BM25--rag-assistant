How can I use Amazon's API in PHP to search for books?

I'm working on a Facebook app for book sharing, reviewing, and recommendations. I've scoured the web, searched Google using every search phrase I could think of, but I could not find any tutorials on how to access the Amazon.com API for book information. I signed up for an AWS account, but even the tutorials on their website didn't help me one bit. They're all geared toward using cloud computing for file storage and processing, but that's not what I want. I just want to access their API to search info on books. Kind of like how http://openlibrary.org/ does it, where it's a simple URL call to get information on a book (but their databases aren't nearly as populated as Amazon's). Why is it so hard to find the information I need on Amazon's AWS site? If anybody could help, I would greatly appreciate it.
