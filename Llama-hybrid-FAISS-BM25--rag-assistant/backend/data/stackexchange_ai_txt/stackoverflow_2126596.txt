I don't think there are any any more. In the olden days, internet explorer wouldn't let you zoom a page if sizes were specified in pixels, but would if in em or %. This led to the recommendation to stay away from pixels in order to allow users to view content at a size useful for them. Nowadays, all modern browsers do a full page zoom, irrespective of what units you use to size things in, so basically it's up to you. I often use pixels when things need to be perfectly lined up, and em when sizing fonts and paragraph margins etc to keep a vertical rhythm.
