1 request every 3-6 seconds is quite low so perhaps there is another problem with your crawler. A few ideas: set the User-Agent to something non-suspicious set the Referer header to the same domain try running your crawler from a different IP in case your current IP is blacklisted try maintaining cookies This will all be easier if you use a higher level library like Mechanize .
