Open the file (if you are using multiple tab groups, make sure your file is selected). Menu Window → Split (alternately, there's this tiny nub just above the editor's vertical scroll bar - grab it and drag down) This gives you two (horizontal) views of the same file. Beware that any edit-actions will reflect on both views. Once you are done, grab the splitter and drag it up all the way (or menu Window → Remove Split ).
