I don't believe from your explanation of usage that you need an id for the fruit resource. Similarly no id needed for the second one either. As long as your urls model your object organization then I believe you're good to go. Also, my personal feeling is that if you find a case where you need to depart ever so slightly from any specification to meet your application needs, that's a reasonable thing to do. Do not allow adherence to this sort of 'model' interfere with getting the job done. For example in the RESTful context, sometimes you perform actions related to some objects that just don't fall clearly under the DELETE/PUT/POST/GET verbs. Do you smoosh those things into there in order to maintain perfect RESTfulness? I am now hiding behind my desk so as not to be knocked unconscious by the RESTful gurus/religionists that will inevitably beat up on me now :)
