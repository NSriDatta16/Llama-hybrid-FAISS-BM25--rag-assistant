mysql determine storage size of a field

i would like to know if there is a mysql command to determine the currently used actual storage size of a mysql field. Maybe something like "show used_storage myfield FROM ... WHERE ..." Oddly I couln'd find anything like this. (The same for postgresql would be interessting too) Thanks a lot!
