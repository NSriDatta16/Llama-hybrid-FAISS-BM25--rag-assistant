You can definitely use line charts to communicate change. You should not use pie charts. As the great John Tukey said "there is no data that can be displayed in a pie chart that cannot better be displayed in some other type of chart". Line charts do seem to me to imply connectedness - but your data are moving averages! They are connected. However, you might prefer to use individual years and a different smoother (e.g. loess). If you think there are too many lines on the graph, I suggest separating them by some factor, either, as @Andreas suggests, geographic region or by initial level.
