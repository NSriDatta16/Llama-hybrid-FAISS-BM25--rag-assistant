I can change the frame by overriding the frame property in viewDidAppear of my custom navigation controller. I also add the navigation controller view to another view that is a subview of the window and make same clipping. Pay attention because in this way you're going to loose the standard calls to every view controllers that will be attached to the navigation controllers. I don't remember if I also used a custom view for my view controllers: maybe yes and with didMoveToSuperview or didMoveToWindow overrided just to emulate the default behaviour. Hope it helps and forgive my english.
