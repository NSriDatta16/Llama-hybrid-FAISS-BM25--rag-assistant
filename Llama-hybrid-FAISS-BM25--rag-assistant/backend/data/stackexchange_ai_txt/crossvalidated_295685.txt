Why Measurement Models versus Interactions?

I am trying to understand the difference between a model where a latent variable is regressed on some outcome versus an interaction of the measures of the latent variable being regress on the same outcome. Factor analysis assumes we have a latent factor X that produces several measures Z. We can factor analyze a set of variables and calculate or estimate each person's score on on the latent X. We can jointly model this in a structural equation model or a Bayesian framework. Either way, we regress a latent variable on an outcome. How is this different from estimating a model where you include the base terms and multiplicative interactions of all of the measures of the latent variable in the model? Can't we back out the effect of a person's score on the latent variable by using their observed responses on the measures and predicting their outcomes using the fitted interaction model?
