jQuery UI's Sortable - how do I style my 'li.ui-state-highlight' ?, always comes up white bg color

$("#sortable").sortable({ placeholder: '.ui-state-highlight' }); Above that I have in my stylesheet, .ui-state-highlight { background-color: #F6F698; height: 1.5em; line-height: 1.2em; border: dashed 1px gray; }, and whenever I drag an li, the placeholder has just a black border, looks exactly like the normal li's, #sortable li { overflow: auto; margin: 0 0 5px 0; padding: 5px; border: solid 1px black; }. Am I doing something wrong? Or missing anything?? Thanks! When I drag an li, I notice a shows up, and maybe it's a problem that there's no inner html in that li? It's closed off immediately (" />" at the end), so maybe it needs an in there?
