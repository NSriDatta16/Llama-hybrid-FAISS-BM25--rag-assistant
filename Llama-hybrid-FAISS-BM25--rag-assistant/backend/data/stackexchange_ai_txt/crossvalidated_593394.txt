Fitting an AR1 process to a sparse time series

Say I have a sparse time series, i.e., containing many zeros. Furthermore, the values in the time series can only be positive or zero. I want to test for the autocorrelation, i.e., fit an AR1 process to the data. Can I do so in a meaningful way without doing any transformation to the data? Or does it not make sense to fit such a process to this kind of sparse data?
