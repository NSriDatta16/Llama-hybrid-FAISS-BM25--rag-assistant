You can put the database files in your project's directory (where sln file is) and access them through their bare filenames (without D:...., only filename). In case of the installation you have to set the installer to put it in the installation folder (where the exe file is) This is a good way to carry everything in one folder and be organized. Probably here you have a problem because the "My Document" directory has a different path in every PC.
