I'm always wwary of making last-minute changes to an application before release. If you decide to switch to SQL 2008 will your team have time to fully regression test your application? I wouldn't just assume that everything will work fine. If you have the time for full regression testing then the question is, what does SQL 2008 offer to you? Obviously there's no critical technical reason - no function that is in SQL 2008 that isn't in 2005 but which you absolutely must have. Do you think that your customers will care one way or another? Do you have customer that already have 2008 servers and want to leverage that? Will it help your sales to be on the "latest and greatest" version? Those are just some of the questions to ask. You can always save the switch to 2008 for a future upgrade.
