I believe the limitations are that it doesnt use multiple processors and that it has ram limitations - only 1 gig. there is no SQL Server Agent and the max database size is 4gig. there is also no sql profiler - which will make work harder when you want to figure out why your db is getting thrashed. I have no idea how anyone can say 30-40 users will be fine without looking at the data and queries alongside the application. the big way that a lot of people speed sql up is to give it enough ram so that it never has to write to disk - this will probably be your bottleneck in the end. All you need is one bad query and you can bring any database to its knees. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_Server_Express
