Depends, like stated, but in addition consider this: with a one second execution time, you will be able to serve (under ideal conditions) only one request per second on a server machine with one CPU and where there is nothing else happening on that machine. If you have more requests than one per second coming in, you will get a long queue, and your server will run flat out, causing incoming requests to take even longer to process. If you get less requests you still need to pay attention to your CPU utilization. If the server is heavily loaded already before, you may have a problem that need to be attended to. There are mathematical methods (queueing theory) that can be used to analyze capacity requirements, see for example PDQ ( http://www.perfdynamics.com/Tools/PDQ.html ) for more. Comparing to Google may not hence be fair, since they must have massive amounts of incoming requests, and with 3 times longer execution time they would need several times more servers than they already have...
