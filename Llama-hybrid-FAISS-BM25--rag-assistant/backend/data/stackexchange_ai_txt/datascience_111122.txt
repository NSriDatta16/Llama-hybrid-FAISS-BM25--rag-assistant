How to verify if the behavior of CNN model is correct?

I am exploring using CNNs for multi-class classification. My model details are: and the training/testing accuracy/loss: As you can see from the image, the accuracy jumped from 0.08 to 0.39 to 0.77 to 0.96 in few epochs. I have tried changing the details of the model (number of filters, kernel size) but I still note the same behavior and I am not experienced in deep learning. Is this behavior acceptable? Am I doing something wrong? To give some context. My dataset contains power traces for a side channel attack on EdDSA implementation. Each trace has 1000 power readings.
