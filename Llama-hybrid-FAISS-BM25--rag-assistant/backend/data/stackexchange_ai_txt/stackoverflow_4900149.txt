VB: Filtering data on excel table

In python, using libs to work with excel files, I could do what I want. But now, because I'm trying to learn VBA, I need to ask this question. I'm working on a worksheet that has around 12 columns, and 50000 rows. This data represents Requests sent to the company. The 5# column represents its code, 10# the time took to finish it. But, for example, rows 5, 10 and 12 could belong to the same Request, and was just divided for organizational purposes. I need to treat these data, so that I can: Column 6# represent the person who answered the request. So, I need to put each request on the "person's worksheet". Also, create this worksheet for him before starting to add requests to it. For each person (worksheet), contabilize request types (Column 2#) attended by him. I.e., create another table on its worksheet showing: Type_Of_Request | Number_of_ocurrences Create a final Report Worksheet, showing the same table above, but accounting all requests (without person filter) Obs: I know that most questions on stackoverflow are to solve a specific question, but I'm asking for start routes here. Or even solutions, if possible. For explanation purposes, I think that explaining the algorithm used in python will help persons who know a little of python and VBA to help me here. So, for each issue: Create a dict that manages the 6# column data. This dict will have the person's unique name as the key, and for each request that him answered, it will be added to a list pointed to his name (the dict key). Something like: {person1: [request1, request2, request3, ...], ... } Another dict that manages the 2# column data (the request type). Now, I will have a dict where each entry will have a list showing requests that are of that type. After positioning all requests, I did a simple sum on the list, and filled a table with (key, sum(dict[key])) where dict[key] is the list of requests of same type, and a sum on it returns the total of requests of that type. Something like: {request_type1: [request1, request2, request3, ...], ... } Well, same of 2, but applying the algorithm on the initial complete table. I don't know if VB has a dict type like python has (and helps a lot!), even because I'm new on VB. Thanks, a lot, for any help.
