I think not. The Fisher Information is a function of $\theta$, so it specifies what the what kind of performance you can expected of your estimator given a value of $\theta$. In some cases the FI depends on $\theta$, in some cases it does not. I don't think having a constraint on $\theta$ changes that. What I would recommend however, is to look into Bayesian MMSE estimators. The advantage of the Bayesian approach is that they allow you to use any prior knowledge about the parameter (in your case $g(\theta) = 0$) to improve the estimator. There is a good explanation with an example of a constrained estimator for a DC level in noise in this lecture from the Estimation and Detection course of the TU Delft. . In know it's quite a different approach from solving the Lanrange dual problem as you are trying now, but might be worth having a look!
