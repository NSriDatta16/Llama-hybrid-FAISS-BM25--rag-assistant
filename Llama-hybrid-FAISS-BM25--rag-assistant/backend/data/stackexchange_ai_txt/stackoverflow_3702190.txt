Yes, it looks like an "interesting" hack of some sort. Common sense would suggest using 8, but maybe there's some Windows version related reason why 8 couldn't be used, and so the author used -2147483645 (-0x80000000) instead. It's not that unusual a number - whoever wrote it is just starting with a binary '1' from the high significant end rather than the low significant end. Perhaps scrolling was regarded in some other group of drag/drop effects to copy/move/link, and so the author wanted to place it at the other end of the word, along with any other future similarly different effects. Maybe there's some awful piece of logic somewhere to test to see if a DragDropEffects variable is greater than zero (intending to mean "anything that isn't none"), and Scroll should not fall in that range? Bit of a mystery. At the very least you'd think they would put the constant in as hex, to show it's not just some totally random number.
