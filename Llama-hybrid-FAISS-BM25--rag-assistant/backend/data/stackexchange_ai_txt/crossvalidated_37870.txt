Probability of visiting all other states before return

Question (a) Random walk on a clock. Consider the numbers $1, 2, \dots, 12$ written around a clock. Consider a Markov chain that jumps with equal probability to one of the two adjacent numbers each step. What is the expected number of steps that $X_n$ will will take to return to its starting position? ( My Work ) From a result in class, we know that a doubly stochastic transition matrix $p$ for a Markov Chain with $12$ states has the uniform distribution $\pi(x) = 1/12$ for all $x$ as a stationary distribution. We also know that if the chain is irreducible and there exists a stationary distribution (both hypotheses are satisfied) $\pi(y) = {1\over E_yT_y}$, so the expected time of first return ($E_yT_y$) is 12. Question (b) What is the probability that $X_n$ will visit all of the other states before returning to its starting position? My Question I am not sure how to compute this probability. My first intuition was to consider $P(T_y > 12)$, but further considering the problem, this seems incorrect because the chain does not have to visit all states before move 12.
