If you only need to perform a non-blocking read on the socket, one of the simplests ways is to use available() . Call available and if there is data to read (bytes pending > 0), perform the read, any way, wait using Thread.sleep() and try to read again. This allow the thread to do while waiting for input data and cat react to external signals. The use of selectors is encouraged when you need to perform high-performance non-blocking read using one thread and several sockets ( java.nio.channels.Selector ).
