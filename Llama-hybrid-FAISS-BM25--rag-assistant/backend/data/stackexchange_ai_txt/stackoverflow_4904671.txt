This is going to be unnecessarily difficult with Java, I believe. You'd have to write some native code to do the job for you, at which point you may as well write your whole program in C# or C++ anyway. But, since you asked for a Java approach, you might want to look at the Robot class. It lets you move the mouse to a specific location on the screen, click, and otherwise automate the manual actions that you are doing. It's a very fragile solution. Alternatively, if you can figure out what command the network connection shortcut is invoking, you can directly invoke it from Java using Runtime.exec . (I don't really see why Java is good for this task, though.)
