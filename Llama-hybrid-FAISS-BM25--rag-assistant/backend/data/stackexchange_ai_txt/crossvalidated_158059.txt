Can neural network classify large images?

I'm considering using ReLU or convolutional deep learning network to classify black and white 8.5"x11" images (with some fine details). Most examples of DNN I saw tested on the MNIST images which are 28x28 pixels. I figured I could probably reduce the images to 320x414 pixels and still be recognizable for my classification needs; further reduction may be risky as even human being may have hard time telling the details. But even at this resolution, there will be 132480 pixels and so the network input would be a vector of 32-bit floats of that many element. Will ReLU or convolutional network handle such large inputs? What are the method to reduce the input size?
