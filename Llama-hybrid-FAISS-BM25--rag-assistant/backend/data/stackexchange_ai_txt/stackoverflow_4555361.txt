Before trying to find out what's happening in here you should notice following: All Magento modules and extensions are loaded in such an order that they meet their declaration section requirements (xmls in app/etc/modules/). So that modules that depend on other modules are loaded only after them. If modules are equal by their needs, then priority goes to 'Mage' namespace, then to custom modules namespaces. Inside namespaces priority is given by alphabetical order. Module layout configuration is created during module load. So result of "before" and "after" instructions depends on blocks already added by previously loaded modules. I.e. when some block has 'before="-"' instruction - it places block first, but later other blocks from next modules can use their instructions to be attached before this block. Now let's return to your case. Your problem can have multiple reasons heavily depending on your Magento configuration. First of all I recommend to Turn off whole cache - so that you'll see all changes instantly Turn off all your extensions and test things only with one of them Turn on default Magento CE theme and skin ("default" package) Then check following cases: Maybe your layout scheme is modified and your extension not referencing correct block (same as "cart_sidebar" uses) to put self in. Maybe some extension deletes original cart_sidebar block and then puts it last in queue of blocks. Maybe some CSS or JS rules place block only visually before other blocks (check blocks order in original html source) Maybe some extension is modifying layout composition rules. Try to turn only one of them. Then try to turn only other one and check result.
