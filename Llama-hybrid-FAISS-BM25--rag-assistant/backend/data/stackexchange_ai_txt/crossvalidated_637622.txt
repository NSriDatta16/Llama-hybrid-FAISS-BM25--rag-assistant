Is it possible to Discretize a Continuous Time Markov Chain?

In a Continuous Time Markov Chain (CTMC), the following properties are said to hold: Discrete (Embedded Jump Process): $$P_{ij} = \frac{q_{ij}}{\sum_{i} q_{ij}}$$ $$q_{ij} = \lim_{{h \to 0}} \frac{P_{ij}(h)}{h}$$ Continuous Part (Kolmogorov): $$\frac{dP(t)}{dt} = P(t)Q$$ $$P(t) = e^{tQ}$$ $$\exp(Qt) = I + Qt + \frac{1}{2!} Q^2t^2 + \frac{1}{3!} Q^3t^3 + \ldots$$ I always wondered if in a CTMC, you can skip the Kolmogorov Equation and analyze the continuous part using the discrete approximation. For some very small $h$ , remove the limit and write: $$ h \cdot q_{ij} = P_{ij} (h)$$ Rearranging the first equation: $$q_{ij} = P_{ij} \cdot \sum_{i} q_{ij}$$ Thus: $$ P_{ij} (h) = P_{ij} \cdot h \cdot {\sum_{i} q_{ij}} $$ Now, I could ask the question: Given that I am currently in state $i$ , what is the probability that after 10 seconds I will be in state $j$ ? In a CTMC, this kind of question is traditionally answered using the relationships derived from the Kolmogorov Equations. However in my case, I could break 10 seconds into 1000 small intervals of 0.001: $$10 = 0.001 + 0.001 + .... + 0.001$$ So very crudely, I could take the embedded discrete chain and say: $$ P_{ij} (10) = P ^ {1000} $$ That is, identify the $p_{ij}$ element in the discrete chain raised to the power of 1000. I understand that is a very inefficient and computationally expensive way to deal with a CTMC, but I was just wondering is this approach statistically logical?
