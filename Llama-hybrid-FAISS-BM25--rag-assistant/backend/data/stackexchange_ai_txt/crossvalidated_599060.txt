Do I remove outliers within training set or duplicate of original?

I want to predict on a test set. I have created a binary logistic regression using my current training set and have predicted on the test set. The dataset I used to split has 299 observations. What if I want to remove outliers? Do I only remove them within the training set or from the entire dataset and split it once again? If it's the latter, isn't there a chance that I would end up predicting on the observations that were previously within the training set? Would I get around this by setting a seed in the programming software set.seed(123) ?
