What does n means in neural network neuron output?

I've found this equation that explains the output of a neuron in a MLP network: $y(n) = f(\mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{x}(n) + b)$ I can understand the general context, but since i have no background with mathematical notation, i don't understand what the $(n)$ parameter means (e.g. $y(n)$ , $x(n)$ ). Is it sort of a temporal or sample index? I've seen this notation in other machine learning subjects, but didn't find an explanation.
