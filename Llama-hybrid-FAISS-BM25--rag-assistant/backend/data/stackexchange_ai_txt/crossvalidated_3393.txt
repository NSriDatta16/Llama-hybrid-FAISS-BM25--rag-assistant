There is also a really good book by Oliver Cappe et. al: Inference in Hidden Markov Models . However, it is fairly theoretical and very light on the applications. There is another book with examples in R, but I couldn't stand it - Hidden Markov Models for Time Series . P.s. The speech recognition community also has a ton of literature on this subject.
