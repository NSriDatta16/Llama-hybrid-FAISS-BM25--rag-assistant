How to convert daily total rain, recorded at daily intervals, to daily average rain?

I am seeking some assistance in how to take into account difference in trials periods when calculating average rainfall. I am investigating the effect of rain on plant disease severity. My trials have been conducted in different years, and the length of the trial varied in different year. I have been asked to use average rain instead of total rain to take into account difference in trial periods. Our weather station recorded total rain per day (at daily intervals), I need to calculate average rain per day. To achieve this, I have been asked to divide total rain in the trial period by number of days rain occurred (rainy days). Is it the right way to calculate average rain per day? Or we are misleading the results by calculating total rain per day instead (maybe in an incorrect way)? Please see blue column to see what I'm talking about. Thanks very much.
