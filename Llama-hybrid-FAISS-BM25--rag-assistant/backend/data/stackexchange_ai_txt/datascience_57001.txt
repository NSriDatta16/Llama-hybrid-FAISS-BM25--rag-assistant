Why should I know C++ ,if I am a machine learning engineer?

I see there's a lot of machine learning job openings with skills requirements, python ,R, keras,tensorflow,pytorch,spark, etc.which are completely fine & reasonable, but why many of the recruiters include C++ ,like what is use of C++ in ML research, or even creating ML pipelines ? How much C++ should I know if I'm good at rest of ML skills ?
