Answer for your questions: 1) Is that the correct way to perform LTS for regression? -> I would say yes, But if you want to know method behind model, then you can refer following(from help page): "In lqs The first three methods minimize some function of the sorted squared residuals. For methods "lqs" and "lms" is the quantile squared residual, and for "lts" it is the sum of the quantile smallest squared residuals. "lqs" and "lms" differ in the defaults for quantile, which are floor((n+p+1)/2) and floor((n+1)/2) respectively. For "lts" the default is floor(n/2) + floor((p+1)/2). The "S" estimation method solves for the scale s such that the average of a function chi of the residuals divided by s is equal to a given constant. 2) In some of R example, i saw that they are using 'ltsReg'. what is the difference with the above method then? -> Both are developed by different developers and based on different packages, but ltsReg will give you more information in returned object.
