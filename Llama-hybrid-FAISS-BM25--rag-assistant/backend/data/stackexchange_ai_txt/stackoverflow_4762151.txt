There are additional non caching declarations that sometimes help: Response.Expires = 0 Response.AddHeader "pragma","no-cache" Response.AddHeader "cache-control","private" Response.CacheControl = "no-cache" I did read some time ago (hence inability to find link) that setting an expires to -1 can cause some browser to ignore it rather than have it expire immediately. Even adding these extra cache controls won't stop some browsers from caching some things some of the time. FF quite often ignores a forced cache reload by the user, so you are in the browser makes hands to a certain extent. Regarding your "Web page expired" message, this is (as mentioned) the result of the browser trying to stop you from resubmitting POST data (and potentially duplicating what you last did). The best way to get around this, and solve a number of other common UI issues on forms is to POST back to the same page, then if/when the action is completed, using a response.redirect to the same page, maybe with a URL encoded message to say "all done successfully". This allows your users to refresh and helps with the back button issue as most browsers now don't store properly redirected pages in their history.
