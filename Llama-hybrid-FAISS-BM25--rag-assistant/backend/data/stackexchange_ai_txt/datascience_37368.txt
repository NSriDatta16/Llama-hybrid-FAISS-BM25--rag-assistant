Character Level Embeddings

I am working on a problem that current depends on word level embeddings created using Word2Vec. I am researching new methods to apply to this model and one was a character level embedding. I have not found much information on it, and I don't imagine Word2Vec but at a character level would be effective. Is there any insight on giving vector representations to characters for an overall classification model?
