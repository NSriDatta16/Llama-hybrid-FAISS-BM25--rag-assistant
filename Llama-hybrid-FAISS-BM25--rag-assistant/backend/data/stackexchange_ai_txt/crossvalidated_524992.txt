How can I recognizing the reduced features after applying PCA?

I am working on the "global index of economic freedom" data which has 26 exploratory variables. I am trying to reduce the features using PCA and I am able to recognize that the first 5 PCs show maximum variance. I want to further apply a multiple linear regression algorithm but I cannot really recognize the features that have the maximum variance from the PCs. How can I recognize the original features with the maximum variance in python?
