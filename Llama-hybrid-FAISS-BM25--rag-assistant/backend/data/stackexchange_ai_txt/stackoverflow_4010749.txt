How do I implement multitouch on iOS

I'd like to implement multitouch, and I was hoping to get some sanity checks from the brilliant folks here. :) From what I can tell, my strategy to detect and track multitouch is going to be to use the touchesBegan _Moved and _Ended methods and use the allTouches method of the event parameter to get visibility on all relevant touches at any particular time. I was thinking I'd essentially use the previousLocationInView as a way of linking touches that come in with my new events with the currently active touches, i.e. if there is a touchBegan for one that is at x,y = 10,14, then I can use the previous location of a touch in the next message to know which one this new touch is tied to as a way of keeping track of one finger's continuous motion etc. Does this make sense? If it does make sense, is there a better way to do it? I cannot hold onto UITouch or UIEvent pointers as a way of identifying touches with previous touches, so I cannot go that route. All I can think to do is tie them together via their previouslocationInView value (and to know which are 'new' touches).
