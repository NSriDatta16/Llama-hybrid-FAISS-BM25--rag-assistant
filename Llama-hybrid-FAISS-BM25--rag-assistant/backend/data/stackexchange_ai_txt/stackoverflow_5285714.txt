how to pass as parameter to JS function from HTML large chunk of HTML code?

I want to pass as argument a large (maybe 2-3 paragraphs of html formatted code) chunk of HTML code to a Javascript function call from HTML. The problem is, the formatted HTML keeps appearing in the page itself, which shouldnt be the case ! I am assuming theres some problem with single/double quotes ! And, I am working on Facebook tab page. Can anyone please help me ? Thanks. - ahsan
