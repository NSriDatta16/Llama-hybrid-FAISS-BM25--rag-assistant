Can convolutional neural network learn integral operator?

Given a function $$ u(x), x\in [0,1] $$ Say 1D convolutional neural network, we all know it can learn the differential operator. $$ \partial u/ \partial x \approx D u $$ But what about the integral operator $$ \int_0^{x} u(s)ds $$ My guess is, since CNN operator is homogeneous, so it cannot learn that. Note that although CNN operator is local, by going deep, it can learns the global interactions.
