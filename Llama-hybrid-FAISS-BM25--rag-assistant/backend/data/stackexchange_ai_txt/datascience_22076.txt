As mentioned it can be a good idea to repeat CV a few times and average the results to obtain a more reliable estimate If you find many parameter constellations that are within one standard deviation (or in that neighborhood) of the best performing model, it can make sense to choose a model with a slightly worse CV performance, but with a simpler decision boundary (e.g. shallower decision trees, smaller gammas in an RBF-kernel SVM, stronger regularization parameters etc.) - something that was suggested for example here .
