One way of stating the goal of PCA is to find the linear projection $W$ that gives you the "best" representation of your data for a given dimensionality. It defines "best" by the representation with the minimal squared reconstruction error. When looking at PCA from 2 dimensions to 1 dimension, as you do there, you are not actually trying to find the line that best predicts $y$ from $x$. Rather, you're trying to find the combination of $y$ and $x$ such that the new, combined value "best" represents all your initial 2-D points. Essentially, the reason PCA considers the perpendicular distance is because it doesn't actually try to model $y$ as a function of $x$.
