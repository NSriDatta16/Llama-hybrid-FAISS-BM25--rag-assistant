While the above answer works as an example of how to use R's built-in functions to do PCA, if you want a mathematically based answer (i.e. deriving principle components as ordered eigenvectors), please see my presentation (also in R). Slide 50 begins the part on PCA. The most important code in calculating PCA is on slide 97 - 102, including the check that the manual calculations equal what R's built in prcomp() function would give. This, along with a high level understanding should be helpful.
