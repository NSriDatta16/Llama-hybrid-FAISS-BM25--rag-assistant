Generally when this happens it is indicative of the changes going to the incorrect database. Check your connection settings in your dbml. To test out the theory, try adding a record or two programmatically and if you have an identity field in that database, after context.SubmitChanges() check what the value of b.Id is (where Id is equal to your IDENTITY column). If it has a value, then you most definitely have a connection issue & you should check for another database. Pay particular attention to your bin/debug directory.
