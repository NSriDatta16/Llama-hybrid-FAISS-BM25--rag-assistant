What language should I use to create a simple text-formatting application online?

I want to make a page for a website that will let the user create a blog post, and want them to be able to graphically edit the formatting, like paragraphs and styles, then convert this to html. Is there a way to do it in PHP? Do I need to use Javascript or Ajax or something?
