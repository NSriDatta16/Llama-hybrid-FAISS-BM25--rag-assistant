To compare two time series simply estimate the COMMON appropriate arima model for each time series separately AND then estimate it globally ( putting the second series behind the first ) . Make sure that your software recognizes the beginning of the scond series and doesn't forecast it from the latter values of the first series. Perform an F test ala G. Chow to test the hypothesis of a common set of parameters. AUTOBOX , a program that I am involved with allows this test to be performed. SPSS may not.
