Without this, the parameter to the method foo could not be bound to type E . If you have an implementation B of this abstract class, you can now enforce that method foo also requires its parameter to be of type B . class B extends A { void foo (B x){} } Without that, foo would have to take any kind of A . I agree that the syntax for this is less than elegant.
