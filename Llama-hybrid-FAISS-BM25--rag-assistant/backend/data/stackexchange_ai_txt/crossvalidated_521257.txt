Poor results with auto.arima in R

I have the below time series with 361 daily observations (180 observations for year 1 and 181 for year 2). I created the series like this: arrivals . Seasonal decompostion looks like this after arrivals : After auto , I got this forecast: Shouldn't the forecast be a little more accurate at least (show hints of seasonality) or my time series analysis is just that trivial? What can I try to get better results?
