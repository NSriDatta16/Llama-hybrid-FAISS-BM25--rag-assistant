If you set up code profiling in Visual Studio, you can configure it to provide code coverage information which will give some of the information you are looking for, but it won't help solve the problem. The approach I would take would be to reduce the count of the loop to a manageable number (say 10) and step through the code. If you know what you expect to happen, I have found that stepping through code and verifying that it's performing the operations you expect for a small test set clarifies any strange behavior. In my experience, nothing beats predicting what the computer will do and then verifying you both agree. The most common causes would be: Your condition is LESS THAN OR EQUAL instead of LESS THAN You test for one more than you expect your array is one smaller than you expect you start counting at 1 and loop through the number of elements Off-by-one (the last three) is just about the most common mistake in algorithms.
