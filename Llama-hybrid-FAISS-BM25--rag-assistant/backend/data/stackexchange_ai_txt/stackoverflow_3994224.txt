Get a list of attribute options from Magento

I've been grabbing attribute options from Magento like so: usesSource()) { $options = $attribute->getSource()->getAllOptions(false); } ?> It's been working fine until I tried to get the options for the built in 'color' attribute -- I got the following error: PHP Fatal error: Call to a member function setAttribute() on a non-object in app/code/core/Mage/Eav/Model/Entity/Attribute/Abstract.php on line 374 It would appear that the getSource() call fails and causes this error. Does anyone know why this happens and how I can get color options out? Thanks!
