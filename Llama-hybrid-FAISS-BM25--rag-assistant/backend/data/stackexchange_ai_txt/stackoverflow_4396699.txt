jqGrid wait for HTML code fragment (a valid HTML element with the desired : One â€¦ ) as the data returned from the dataUrl: "/MyEntity/GetMyEntitys" . Because you return the data in JSON format you have to convert the data returned from the server with respect of the editoptions buildSelect . You can see the corresponding code example in my old answer . One more small remark. Look at the jqGrid documentation and verify which parameters which you use are default. For example multiselect: false is default parameter. If you remove the default parameters from the grid definition the code wil be easier to read and it will work a litle bit quickly. In more complex parameters like jsonReader you could include only the properties which you want to change . For example you can use jsonReader in the form jsonReader : { repeatitems: true} because repeatitems is the only property of jsonReader which you want to change from the default settings. In the same way you can reduce { view: true, del: true, add: true, edit: true } to { view: true } .
