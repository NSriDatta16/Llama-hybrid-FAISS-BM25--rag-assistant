MySQL - Find MIN but not zero

I am trying to fetch the minimum value of a column in MySQL using the MIN function. But is it possible to tell MySQL to ignore the zero values? Problem is that I am storing 0 as default value instead of NULL for a tinyint column. What I want is to get the minimum value that is greater than 0. SELECT a.baseloc_id, a.baseloc_latitude, a.baseloc_longitude, a.baseloc_distance, MIN(b.basecost_ton2_cost) as minTon2, MIN(b.basecost_ton3_cost) as minTon3, MIN(b.basecost_ton10_cost) as minTon10 FROM bbox_logi_base_locations a LEFT JOIN bbox_logi_base_cost b USING (baseloc_id) GROUP BY a.baseloc_id; Thank you for any help. EDIT 01: Sorry that I forgot to mention this. The bbox_logi_base_cost table has rows that contain fragmented values. For example, one row can have basecost_ton2_cost as 0 but other columns filled with values. And the other row can have every column but one as 0 . So no row can be filtered using a WHERE condition.
