Find or Create Multiple Records in Ruby on Rails - "find_or_create_all"

What is an efficient and elegant way of performing a "find_or_create_all" in rails? Given: names = ["Bob","John","Jack","Sid"], Users table Needed: users = ["#User:0x3ae3a00", "#User:0x3ae3938", "#User:0x3ae3898", "#User:0x3ae37f8"] where a user is created only if it doesn't exist. An intermediate solution - ["#User:0x3ae3a00", nil, nil, "#User:0x3ae37f8"] will also do, if for example only the first and fourth entries exist in the Users table. One way is to use a find_all_by_name and use a hash to map back to the entries in the names array but I wonder if there is an elegant yet efficient way in rails.
