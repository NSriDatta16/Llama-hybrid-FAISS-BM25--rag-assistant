Essentially what I would love to do is create an A.I. app that will be fed the same data that the "experts" had and see if I can create something more accurate and beat them at it. Is this a viable approach? In theory yes, but not in practice. Plesae consider that a zillion of uber-skilled people already tried to do it, and NOBODY have ever been able to beat the stock market. I applied RNNs to cryptocurrency trading and the results were mediocre. The inventor of Keras François Chollet, at the end of his RNN forecast chapter in Deep Learning with Python , Manning, p. 224, wrote: Markets have very different statistical characteristics than natural phenomena such as weather patterns. Trying to use machine learning to beat markets, when you only have access to publicly available data, is a difficult endeavor, and you’re likely to waste your time and resources with nothing to show for it. Always remember that when it comes to markets, past performance is not a good predictor of future returns—looking in the rear-view mirror is a bad way to drive. Machine learning, on the other hand, is applicable to datasets where the past is a good predictor of the future. I'm sorry to be so negative about this, but I think he's 100% right.
