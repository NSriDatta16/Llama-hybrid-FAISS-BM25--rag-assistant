I know this is only a project for you to learn in but I personally wouldn't make my whole website a silverlight application. Instantly you are alienating users that don't have silverlight (a big enough section of users). Instead I would create a HTML/CSS (Could use a server side technology such as asp.net) website that contains silverlight parts for fancy functionality that would be difficult to implement using other web technologies. In terms of a blog it is rarely worth writing your own when there are so many available to use often for free. haha a guestbook certainly does seem very 1999 but don't let that discourage you if you think it adds value to your site. As you say there are many frameworks available to use and it largely comes down to personal preference. I have used MVVM light for Windows phone 7 silverlight applications and found it to be pretty useful but it is not for every situation.
