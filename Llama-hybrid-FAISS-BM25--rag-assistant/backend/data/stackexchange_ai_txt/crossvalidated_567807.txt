Feature Selection + Unpenalized Logistic Regression AUC

I am building a predictive model using a highly-dimensional dataset. To reduce dimensionality and reduce overfitting, I used LASSO regression to select features. ##Train LASSO model xdata I used the predictors from the LASSO regression to construct an unpenalized logistic regression model. glm.formula My question is, how should I calculate the AUC of my final unpenalized logistic regression model? 1 - Run k-fold cross-validation using the formula of the unpenalized logistic regression and use that to calculate the mean AUC and 95% CI 2- Calculate the AUC of the penalized logistic regression model directly using the training dataset Thank you
