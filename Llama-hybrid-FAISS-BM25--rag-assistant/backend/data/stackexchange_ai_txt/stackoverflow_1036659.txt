UML: modeling an activity that creates/changes other activities

Let's say I am to build a behavioral model of some organization: in particular, I am to build a bunch of activity diagrams that describe all those activities that take place in the organization (activities like "bidding", "order fulfillment", "shipping", etc.). Now, one of the key activities in the organization is the one that includes establishing and maintaining all the activities themselves. If you wanted to show the object flows while modeling that activity, how exactly would you depict such inputs/outputs as activities? For example, would it be semantically correct to use objects that are instances of the Activity class from UML meta-model? (The UML modeling tool that I'm using does not give me such an option. Is it because the tool is ignorant or because I am not supposed to include instances of classes from meta-model into my model?)
