User sarnold already provides a good answer , I'd like to drag attention to the following. Challenge-response solves two problems - makes sending the secret in plaintext unnecessary (hash-like product is sent) and prevents replay attacks (since challenges change every time). It doesn't do anything beyond that - it doesn't authenticate anyone to anyone on its own, it is only an improvement of a plaintext protocol where the client sends his username and password (the secret) and the server decides whether those are correct. So if there's some party in the middle it won't help detect it or prevent it from impersonating as the client for that specific session, yet that party will not gain access the the secret, since the secret is never sent in plaintext, and that party will be unable to impersonate again by doing a replay - it can only work impersonated during that very session.
