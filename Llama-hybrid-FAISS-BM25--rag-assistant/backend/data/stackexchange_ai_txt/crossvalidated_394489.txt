Mixed effects random forest (MERF) in Python: random slope or just intercept?

Does the MERF implementation in python allow for random slope effects? If so, how? I assume yes, and that it is achieved using the Z matrix. With a column of ones for the intercept and a column for the independent variable? However, if that is the case, as the $b_i$ is drawn from a $N(0,\sigma_b)$ distribution, do these $b_i$ adjust an average slope? How is this information accessed in this implementation?
