Flattening a deeply nested structure in XSLT

I'm trying to learn XSLT (for some holiday coding fun). I think I now have a pretty good understanding of the basics (grabbing subtrees, filtering-out elements, and renaming elements). Where I'm having trouble is when it comes to drastically reorganizing XML structures. If you had a deeply nested structure and wanted to flatten it, how would you go about doing so? For example, let's say I'm trying to transform a docbook snippet into html... input (docbook): Title A foo bar Title B baz biz Title C bing Title D fizzle output (html): Title A foo bar Title B baz biz Title C bing Title D fizzle Is this where xsl:param and xsl:call-template come into play? Thanks!
