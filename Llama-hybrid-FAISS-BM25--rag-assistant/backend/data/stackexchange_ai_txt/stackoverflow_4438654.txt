Best way to communicate between forms?

I almost never used (advanced, or at all) graphical interfaces, or one simple form with simple controls... but this time I've got something a little more complex, and I don't have much experience with GUI. I have one main form (and possibly more in the future) from which other sub-forms open (and they might have sub-forms of themselves) and I wonder what is, in your opinion, the best way to communicate between them? I thought of passing the main form as a parameter to the constructors of the sub-forms, but it doesn't seem like a good way, especially if I'm going to need to communicate between other, distinct, sub-forms, not to mention I have to double check the input, or make a few methods, but it seems more like functional programming than object oriented programming... Perhaps I can: Create a static class (or Properties.Settings) for global settings. Cons: every change of data is needed to be copied to the class, I'm looking for something a bit more comfortable and elegant. Use the ugly way of accessing the controls from Application.OpenForms - fixes the problem of passing the main form as parameter. Cons: not very stable. Do something else I haven't thought of. Suggestions? Cons: don't know what it is yet.
