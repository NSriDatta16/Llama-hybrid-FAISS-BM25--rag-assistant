Approach to classify blocks of time series

I am wondering if there exists an approach to classify blocks of time series, and not specifically individual time series. If so, can you point me out papers/articles/tutorials where these type of data are classified ? For example : We would extract time series for each country that depict these information : Human Development Index evolution, urbanization, financial situation, investments, etc. If we group all these time series we would make a block of economical information for each country. The countries are already pre-classified to developed, underdeveloped, or semi-developed countries.
