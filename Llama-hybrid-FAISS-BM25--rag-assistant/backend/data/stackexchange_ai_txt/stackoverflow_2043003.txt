Help With Intra-Application Drag and Drop -- Cocoa

Okay, I've got a custom class called "Task", which represents a task to be done. I've got an NSMatrix which acts as a calendar. I want the user to be able to drag an icon from an nscollectionview (I've had no trouble setting up the nscollectionview) onto a cell in the nsmatrix, thereby assigning that task to that day. I just can't seem to get the nsmatrix to respond to the drag or the drop at all. I've implemented the method: - (BOOL)collectionView:(NSCollectionView *)cv writeItemsAtIndexes:(NSIndexSet *)indexes toPasteboard:(NSPasteboard *)pasteboard { [pasteboard declareTypes:[NSArray arrayWithObject:TASK_UTI] owner:self]; NSUInteger index=[indexes firstIndex]; Task* task=[[cv content] objectAtIndex:index]; NSData* taskData=[NSKeyedArchiver archivedDataWithRootObject:task]; [taskData retain]; BOOL success=[pasteboard setData:taskData forType:TASK_UTI]; return success; } in my nscollectionview delegate as shown above. I've sent [self registerForDraggedTypes:[NSArray arrayWithObjects:TASK_UTI, nil]] in my NSMatrix subclass (called "Calendar"). I've implemented the methods: - (NSDragOperation)draggingEntered:(id )sender - (BOOL)prepareForDragOperation:(id )sender - (BOOL)performDragOperation:(id )sender in my Calendar (NSMatrix subclass) class. Some debugging shows that the NSMatrix/Calendar object is not even running the dragging methods above. What gives?
