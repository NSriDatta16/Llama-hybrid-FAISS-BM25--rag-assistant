What causes memory fragmentation in .NET

I am using Red Gates ANTS memory profiler to debug a memory leak. It keeps warning me that: Memory Fragmentation may be causing .NET to reserver too much free memory. or Memory Fragmentation is affecting the size of the largest object that can be allocated Because I have OCD, this problem must be resolved. What are some standard coding practices that help avoid memory fragmentation. Can you defragment it through some .NET methods? Would it even help?
