Page caching using delayed job

Hey all, if you've ever posted on [craigslist], this question should make sense to you. Whenever you post a listing (to sell furniture or an apartment, for example), your listing is not immediately thrown up on the site. Rather, listings will appear in batches (numbers vary) about every 10-15 minutes. At first I was really over-thinking this behavior, trying to hold records and then do mass inserts, but I realized it was much simpler. After talking with some colleagues, it made sense that Craigslist is caching their pages and then emptying that cache every 10-15 minutes. This severely decreases the load on their database. Now, to my question. How do I accomplish the same thing in Rails? I know how to implement caching - I've read the [caching with Rails guide]. I will be using action caching and fragment caching (because I can't cache the whole page). I still need to do validations and access controls, so I can't fully cache the page...
