PCA on Identity Matrix

Just for fun, I did a PCA on Identity Matrix with Python and got the following output: Python 2.7.10 (default, Oct 6 2017, 22:29:07) [GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 9.0.0 (clang-900.0.31)] on darwin Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information. >>> from sklearn.decomposition import PCA #PCA Package >>> ls=[[1,0],[0,1]] >>> pca=PCA() >>> res=pca.fit(ls) >>> res.explained_variance_ array([ 1.00000000e+00, 2.81351049e-34]) >>> pca.explained_variance_ratio_ array([ 1.00000000e+00, 2.81351049e-34]) >>> pca.components_ array([[-0.70710678, 0.70710678], [-0.70710678, -0.70710678]]) I understand that Identity Matrix has 1 as eigenvalue and any vector as eigenvectors. I just don't get why the python returned a eigenvalue of 2.81351049e-34 there with a eigenvector [-0.70710678, -0.70710678] . What does it mean?
