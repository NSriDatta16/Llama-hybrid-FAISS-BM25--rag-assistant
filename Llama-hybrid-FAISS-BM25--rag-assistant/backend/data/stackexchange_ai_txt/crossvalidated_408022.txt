Computationally verifying the equivalence of ridge regression estimates and Bayesian regression estimates

I'm trying to show that the numerical estimates of ridge regression's parameter estimates are the same as the MAP parameter estimates of a Bayesian regression model with normal prior distributions. So far I have not been able to achieve numerical agreement. I'm just toying with the mtcars data. Ridge estimates: > library(MASS) > fit_ridge fit_ridge cyl hp disp wt 39.133455180 -1.070747007 -0.019314307 0.003855685 -3.255577449 Bayesian model fit: > library(rstanarm) > fit_bayes summary(fit_bayes) Model Info: function: stan_glm family: gaussian [identity] formula: mpg ~ cyl + hp + disp + wt algorithm: optimizing priors: see help('prior_summary') observations: 32 predictors: 5 Estimates: Median MAD_SD 2.5% 97.5% (Intercept) 40.3 2.5 35.5 45.2 cyl -1.2 0.6 -2.3 -0.1 hp 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 disp 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 wt -3.7 0.9 -5.5 -2.0 sigma 2.3 0.3 1.8 3.0 Clearly there is some disagreement between the parameter estimates. Is my model specification incorrect? Or my understanding that these distinct estimators ought to be numerically the same?
