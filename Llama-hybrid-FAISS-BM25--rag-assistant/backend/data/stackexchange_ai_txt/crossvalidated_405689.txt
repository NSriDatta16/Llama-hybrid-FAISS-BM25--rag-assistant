Convolution is a mathematical operation where you "summarize" a tensor or a matrix or a vector into a smaller one. If your input matrix is one dimensional then you summarize along that on dimensions, and if a tensor has n dimensions then you could summarize along all n dimensions. Conv1D and Conv2D summarize (convolve) along one or two dimensions. For instance, you could convolve a vector into a shorter vector as followss. Get a "long" vector A with n elements and convolve it using the a weight vector W with m elements into a "short" (summary) vector B with n-m+1 elements: $$b_i=\sum_{j=m-1}^0 a_{i+j}*w_j$$ where $i=[1,n-m+1]$ So, if you have vector of length n, and your weight matrix is also length n $w_i=1/n$ , then the convolution will produce a scalar or a vector of length 1 equal to the average value of all values in the input matrix. It's a sort of degenerate convolution if you wish. If the same weight matrix is one shorter than the input matrix, then you get a moving average in the output of length 2 etc. $$\begin{bmatrix} a:&a_1 & a_2 & a_3\\ w:&1/2 & 1/2&\\ w:&&1/2 & 1/2\\ \end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix} b:&\frac{a_1+a_2} 2 & \frac{a_2+a_3} 2 \end{bmatrix} $$ You could do the same to 3 dimensional tensor (matrix) the same way: $$b_{ikl}=\sum_{j_1=m_1-1\\j_2=m_2-1\\j_3=m_4-1}^{0} a_{i+j_1,k+j_2,l+j_3}*w_{j_1j_2j_3}$$ where $i=[1,n_1-m_1+1],k=[1,n_2-m_2+1],l=[1,n_3-m_3+1]$
