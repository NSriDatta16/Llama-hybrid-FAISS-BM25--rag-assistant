random forest have 0 training error?

For a dataset $(X, y)$ , where $X \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ . where $X$ is from some $i.i.d$ with $m \ll n$ , i can easily fit a linear regression model with $0$ training error. Now my question is, can i fit a random forest regressor achieve 0 training error?
