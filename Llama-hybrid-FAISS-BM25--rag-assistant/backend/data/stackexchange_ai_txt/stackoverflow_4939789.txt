Why can't jQuery UI sortable elements be dragged from a handle?

I have a page that add fields to a fake form so that the user can look at it before generating the source. I'm trying to give the user the ability to sort and order the fields inside the form. I use jQuery for my ajax and animations, so I decided to use jquery UI to do the sorting. My fields are added dinamicly, so I delegate all my events, and I use the sortable('refresh'); every time a new field is added. My GUI has icons for fields options, so I added the handle option to the sortable() method, but it doesn't recognize it at all! Here is a demo of the GUI with the problem (it's in arabic and still in alpha so no IE7-6 support, but it uses icons so it will be easy to use ^^): http://mahersalam.co.cc/projects/namodgMaker/ Just add any field from the red buttons, and try to drag from the drag button, it doesn't work. If I remove the handle it works perfectly! You can see that I log the handle value to the console, but it always logs the sortable object... There is a global object NamodgMaker is you want to experiment with it. Here is the part that adds the fields and attach the sortable() method: addField: function( type ) { var $html = $(this.fields[type]); // 'this' here is NamodgMaker, and `fields` is from an ajax request if (type == 'select') { $html .find('select') .styleNamodgSelects({ optionsRight: -6, optionsTop: 38 }); } $html.appendTo(this.formHolder); if ( this.formHolder.data('sortable') ) { this.formHolder.sortable('refresh'); console.log( this.formHolder.sortable( "option", "handle" ) ); return } this.formHolder .sortable({ containment: 'parent', handle: '.drag-field-option' }) .data('sortable', true) console.log( this.formHolder.sortable( "option", "handle" ) ); } This is my first time with jQuery UI, So what am I doing wrong? Update: I found out that the $.data() was causing sortable to return the wrong options. I modified the code to use sortable() 's own checking method: addField: function( type ) { var $html = $(this.fields[type]); if (type == 'select') { $html .find('select') .styleNamodgSelects({ optionsRight: -6, optionsTop: 38 }); } $html.appendTo(this.formHolder); if ( ! this.formHolder.sortable( "option", "disabled") ) { this.formHolder.sortable('refresh'); console.log( 'refreshed :' + this.formHolder.sortable( "option", "handle" ) ); return } this.formHolder .sortable({ containment: 'parent', handle: '.drag-field-option' }) console.log( this.formHolder.sortable( "option", "handle" ) ); } Now the console logs the right selector but still the sorting functionality is not working. Update 2 : I was able to solve the problem by changing the handle element from a button to a a .
