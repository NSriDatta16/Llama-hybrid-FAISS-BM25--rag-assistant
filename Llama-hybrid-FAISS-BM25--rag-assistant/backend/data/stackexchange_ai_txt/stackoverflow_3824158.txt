ASP.NET MVC Workshop

I am an MVC developer since ASP.NET MVC Preview 1 and my company chose me as an instructor for an MVC 2 workshop. The session will last for 3 hours and I have not yet decided about the contents of the workshop. What would you tell about MVC 2 in 3 hours to grab and keep the people's attention? Thanks.
