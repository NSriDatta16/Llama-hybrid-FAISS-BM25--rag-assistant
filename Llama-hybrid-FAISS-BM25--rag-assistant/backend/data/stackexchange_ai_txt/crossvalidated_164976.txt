95% confidence interval for an estimate average

I have a single dataset - from that dataset I have used four methods ($i=1, 2, 3, 4$) to estimate a parameter ($u_i$) and to generate a 95% confidence interval. In other words, I know $V[u_i]$ but not $Cov[u_1, u_2]$ (or any of the other covariances). The four estimates are therefore not independent (because they rely on the same data source). I need to average my four estimates. How do I generate a 95% confidence interval for the average estimate based on what I have (four estimates and four variances)? Edit: Consider the following. A researcher goes out and collects data, but they know that there were some errors involved. There are a few different methods the researcher can use to correct for potential errors, but they don't know which method is correct. They want to use an average of the four correction methods. The raw data is summarized into two values, $p_1$ and $p_2$, which is used to calculate $u$ ($u=\frac{p_1-p_2}{1-p_2}$). They know the variance of $p_1$ and $p_2$ and thus can use the delta method to calculate the variance of $u$. Here's an example of the data and the resulting corrections (Sorry for picture format, I saw no way to create a table...):
