Neural networks: Learn from data and create an internal model. Don't easily give you reasons why they made those particular predictions. There are ways to figure out why it did by ranking input features. Work for any type of seasonal data, provided it is in the same format and the pre-processing is the same in all accounts. The more variety in your data, the better it will be at generalizing over other geographical areas (predicting everywhere). I believe in your case the optimal choice would be an ensemble of several networks. Stochastic gradient descent is an online training method that causes the model to adapt to new data, without having to repeat the training from the start. It adapts to new data. Anything that the model hasn't seen before, it can't predict. Similar things can be predicted, not completely unknown.
