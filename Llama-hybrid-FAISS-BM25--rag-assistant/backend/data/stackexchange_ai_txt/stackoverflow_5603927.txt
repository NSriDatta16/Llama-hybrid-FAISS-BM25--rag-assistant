James and Holger's answers are very good. Besides organizing CSS in my projects, I also had to change colour schemes a couple of times.. Trying to do consistent changes throughout many CSS files can be pretty painful (results may vary). I ended up extending the Rails start-up procedure a little, to include a custom module "site_settings.rb" through which I can define variable for colors and other CSS attributes, which I can then use throughout my CSS input files. Whenever Rails starts up, and one of the input files has changed, it auto-generates the CSS files. http://unixgods.org/~tilo/Ruby/Using_Variables_in_CSS_Files_with_Ruby_on_Rails.html
