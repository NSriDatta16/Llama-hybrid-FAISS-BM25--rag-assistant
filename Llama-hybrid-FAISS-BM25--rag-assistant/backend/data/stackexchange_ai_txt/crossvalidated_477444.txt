Testing multi-collinearity of ordinal independent variables in R

I am trying to conduct an ordinal logistic regression, but I first want to test if I fulfill the assumption of no multicollinearity. All of my 8 independent variables are ordinal with up to 5 levels. Am I correct in thinking these need to be converted into dummy variables, modelled, and then the VIF calculated? How can I do this, I've been searching for a while, but cannot find a clear answer online.
