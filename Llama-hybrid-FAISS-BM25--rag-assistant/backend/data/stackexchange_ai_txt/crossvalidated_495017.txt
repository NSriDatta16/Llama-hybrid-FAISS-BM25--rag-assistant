Correct interpretation of confidence interval for logistic regression?

In trying to understand logistic regression, I find it easiest to transform the coefficients into predicted probabilities. So, for a particular predictor value (x): precicted probability = 1 / (1 + exp(-(intercept + slope * x))) Using the 'predict' function, I'll exemplify as: # Generate data set.seed(42) n $fitted.values, ylim = c(0, 1)) lines(new$ x, pred) My question, then, is if I can interpret the confidence intervals around the coefficients for logistic regression in terms of predicted probability too. That is, like: ############ Interpreting confidence intervals ########## confs $x))) ul x))) lines(new $x, ll, col = "red") lines(new$ x, ul, col = "green") I believe the two colored lines (are not prediction intervals but) illustrate the limits of the relationship between the predictor and outcome variable we can be 95% confident in based on this data. Is this so?
