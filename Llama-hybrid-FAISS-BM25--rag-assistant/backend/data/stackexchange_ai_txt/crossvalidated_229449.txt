My fertility simulation is not matching reality

Using data from US vital statistics I created a simulation that was based on the number of children a woman has over her lifetime as follows (out of 10000): 0 4100 1 5800 2 8200 3 9380 4 9780 5 9900 6 9960 7 9985 8 9995 9 9998 10 10000 So for example, out of 10000 women 4100 will have no children, 1700 will have 1 child, 2400 will have 2 children and so on. However, when I run the simulation, the average number of children per woman is 1.28, a lot lower than expected. According to real demographic data, women in the US have an average of 1.87 children over their lifetime. To make the value come out as it should (around 1.87) I had to use radically different values: { 3600, 4800, 6400, 7680, 8780, 9900, 9960, 9985, 9995, 9998, 10000 } Where am I going wrong? In this table why is the 15-50 rate 1.29, but when broken out, the aggregated rate is 1.9?
