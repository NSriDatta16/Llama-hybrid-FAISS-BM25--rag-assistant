My thought on the easiest way to do this is to have two image submit buttons in the same place. Button A is the one you already have button B is a new one that whose submit handler runs UpdatepaymentInfo and redirects. Button B starts off invisible while button A is visible. When Button A is clicked in addition to the visibility changes you hide button a and show button B. Then when they click button B the right stuff happens. Its not that elegant though. Another solution might be storing values in the page to indicate the current page state that you can then check on button click.
