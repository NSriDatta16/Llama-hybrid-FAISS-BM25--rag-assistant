Apache Wicket, commonly referred to as Wicket, is a lightweight component-based web application framework for the Java programming language conceptually similar to JavaServer Faces and Tapestry. It uses no XML configuration, and POJO Java components are bound to HTML fragments by tags and naming convention. Only configuration needs to be done is in the web.xml to map the Wicket servlet.
