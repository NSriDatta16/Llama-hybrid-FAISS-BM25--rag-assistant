When you're making an AJAX request like this, all you have access too in the return is the result returned from the View producted by the action method, not the full data storage associated with the controller. If you wanted to display the "Hello world" text then you'd have to either write it out to the page as part of your view or include it in the output response. Response.Write("Hello World"); You don't have access to the ViewData or TempData collections after your view has returned. It sounds like that's what you're expecting.
