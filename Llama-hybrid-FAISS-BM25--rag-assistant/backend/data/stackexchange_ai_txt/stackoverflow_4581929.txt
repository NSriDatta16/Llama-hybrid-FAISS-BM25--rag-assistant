Simple Drag and Drop Implementation

I was playing around with jQuery's draggable and droppable functions. I thought it would be good practice to try and implement drag-and-drop functionality to an existing program. This is the program I wanted to use. The implementation I was thinking of was being able to drag the game pieces into the board, but I'm not sure how to get started. Can anyone help me out a bit?
