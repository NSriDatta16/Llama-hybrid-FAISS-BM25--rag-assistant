Difference between exogenous and endogenous spatial autocorrelation

I was reading a paper recently and came across the following paragraph: Autocorrelated distribution patterns may arise in two non-mutually exclusive ways; endogenous autocorrelation is caused by contagious population processes such as local dispersal, while exogenous autocorrelation (or spatial dependence) results from independent responses to autocorrelated environmental gradients Could anyone be able to provide a detailed and preferably simple (laymen's term) explanation to the difference between exogenous and endogenous spatial autocorrelation?
