How to combine Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression?

I am working on an NLP binary classification problem. I trained a model with linear regression and a naive Bayes classifier. I found out that I am getting a good recall value in linear regression but not that good precision but this is opposite in Naive Bayes classifier. I wanted to if there is a way to combine these two models and I wanted to understand why this is happening?
