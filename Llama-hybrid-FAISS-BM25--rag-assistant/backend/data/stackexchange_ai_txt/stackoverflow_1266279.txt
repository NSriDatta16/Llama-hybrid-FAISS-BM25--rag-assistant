How to organize large R programs?

When I undertake an R project of any complexity, my scripts quickly get long and confusing. What are some practices I can adopt so that my code will always be a pleasure to work with? I'm thinking about things like Placement of functions in source files When to break something out to another source file What should be in the master file Using functions as organizational units (whether this is worthwhile given that R makes it hard to access global state) Indentation / line break practices. Treat ( like {? Put things like )} on 1 or 2 lines? Basically, what are your rules of thumb for organizing large R scripts?
