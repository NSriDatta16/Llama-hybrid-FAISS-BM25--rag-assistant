Getting the amplitude(or rms voltage) of audio signal captured in C++ by wavin lib.?

I am working on a very basic robotics project, and wish to implement voice recognition in it. i know its a complex thing but i wish to do it for only 3 or 4 commands(or words). i know that using wavin i can record audio. but i wish to do real-time amplitude analysis on the audio signal, how can that be done, the wave will be inputed as 8-bit, mono. i have thought of divinding the signal into a set of some specific time, further diving it into smaller subsets, getting the average rms value over the subset and then summing them up and then see how much different they are from the actual stored signal.If the error is below accepted value for all(or most) of the sets, then print the word. How can this be implemented? if you can provide me any other suggestion also, it would be great. Thanks, in advance.
