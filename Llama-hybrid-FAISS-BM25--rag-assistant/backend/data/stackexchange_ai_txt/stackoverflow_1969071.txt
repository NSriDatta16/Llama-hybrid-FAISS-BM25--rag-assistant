I'm not sure about sql-server, but most DBMS don't use an index for retrieval if it can retrieve all of the table rows in a single I/O. You will see this on PLAN explanations, some tables are always tablespace scanned. IMHO, any table with less than 5000 rows is not worth analysing for cardinality if the DBMS is running on a server.
