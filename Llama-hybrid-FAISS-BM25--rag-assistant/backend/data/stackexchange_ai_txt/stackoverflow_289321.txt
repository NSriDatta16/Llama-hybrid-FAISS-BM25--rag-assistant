Does C1 code coverage analysis exist for Ruby?

I'm currently using Rcov to get C0 code coverage analysis for a rails project that I'm working on. However, those results are practically meaningless- I have 100% coverage according to rcov (as it only covers C0 analysis) and I've barely written half the test cases for the functionality that exists thus far. I'm used to the useful results from the code coverage in Visual Studio 2008 Team, which has C1 coverage. Are there any tools that provide similar coverage for ruby?
