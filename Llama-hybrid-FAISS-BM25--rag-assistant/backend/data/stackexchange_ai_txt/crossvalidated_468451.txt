Nomimal predictors are no problem for regression. In most software, the nominal predictors are transformed to dummy variables and their effects are estimated individually. Provided you have good reason to believe that your data conditioned on your variables is normal, then Bayesian regression sounds fine to me. Here is an example of how you might perform a Bayesian linear regression on nominal variables using rstanarm . library(rstanarm) library(tidyverse) model_data = mtcars %>% select(cyl, mpg) %>% mutate(cyl = as.factor(cyl)) model = stan_glm(mpg~cyl, data = model_data) You can determine the strength of each predictor by looking at the summary of the model.
