JQuery draggable within an overflow: auto div is confined within the div

I have a draggable UL with a set height/width. This draggable list can be dragged to a sortable list. My code: $(".serviceMembersAvailable li").draggable({ helper: 'clone', connectToSortable: '.serviceMembersAssigned' }); $(".serviceMembersAssigned").sortable({ connectWith: '.serviceMembersAssigned', placeholder: 'servicePlaceHolder', update: function(event, ui) { Services.memberAssigned($(ui.item)); } }); My CSS: ul.serviceMembersAvailable { height: 160px; overflow: auto; } It worked fine until I gave the draggable list a scroll by setting "overflow: auto" in the CSS. When I drag a LI, it is contained within the overflow so I can't actually move it to the sortable. I found the following answer but it is for dragging a draggable item into a droppable item... But I want to drag a draggable item into a sortable. I think that's why their fix didn't work for me. jquery ui draggable elements not 'draggable' outside of scrolling div I got the appendTo part working from the above link but it wouldn't drop into the sortable. Any ideas how I can get this working?
