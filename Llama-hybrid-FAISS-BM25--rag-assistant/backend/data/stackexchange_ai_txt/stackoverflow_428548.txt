While I see how there is a point of view that LINQ might make a statement harder to read, I think it is far outweighed by the fact that my methods are now strictly related to the problems that they are solving and not spending time either including lookup loops or cluttering classes with dedicated lookup functions. It took a little while to get used to doing things with LINQ, since looping lookups, and the like, have been the main option for so long. I look at LINQ as just being another type of syntactic sugar that can do the same task in a more elegant way. Right now, I am still avoiding it in processing-heavy mission critical code - but that is just until the performance improves as LINQ evolves.
