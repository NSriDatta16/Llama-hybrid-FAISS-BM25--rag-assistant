Multiple queries to avoid joins?

I've noticed as soon as I added joins to some of my queries the time it took to execute these was more than just completing multiple queries. Times include page load and averaged over 20 page loads. 7-9 queries with no joins 159ms 3 queries with 2 joins 235ms Should I just go ahead with multiple queries instead of the joins considering they seem to have such a significant impact on performance? I can probably even optimize the multiple query method since I was even lazy loading during those tests. EDIT I'll create some false information for sake of the question. Table Objects ID (int, identity, PK, clustered index) UserID (int, nonclustered index) CategoryID (int, nonclustered index) Table Users ID (int, identity, PK, clustered index) Table Categories ID (int, identity, PK, clustered index) Pretty simple. It's a double inner-join query onto the Objects table. Querying all 3 separately seems to be faster than the join. The query plan for the join shows 42% done for 2 clustered index seeks and 23% is a clustered index scan and the rest is a Top N Sort.
