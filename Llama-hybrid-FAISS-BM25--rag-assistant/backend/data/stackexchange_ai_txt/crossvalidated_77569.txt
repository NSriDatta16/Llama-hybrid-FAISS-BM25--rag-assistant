Your dashed line doesn't look like it's least squares (minimizing the sum of squares of the vertical distances) to me, but more like a line that attempts to minimize the orthogonal distances. To get an idea where the LS line should go, divide the range of x's into vertical strips and find the average of y in each strip. If a straight line is appropriate those averages should lie relatively close to a straight line... the regression line. Below I have taken your plot and marked two such strips (delimited by two red lines on the strip on the left and two purple lines for the strip on the right): I've also marked a rough (by eye) guess at where the mean y in each strip is, and indicated it with a "+" of the corresponding color. As you see they both lie close to the regression line, and nowhere near your line. So the regression line R gave you looks just about exactly right to me. Now, if your data are bounded by 0 and 1 ... why on earth would you fit a straight line? How can that be right?
