The problem is that there is no standard for name-mangling in C++, and even if there was, linking C++ code from different compilers would be problematic. This is actually an issue on Linux too, except that most people there use the same compiler. Libraries produced with MinGW g++ (get it at http://tdragon.net/recentgcc , not the MinGW SF page) are compatible with Microsoft code, but you will need to provide a C interface.
