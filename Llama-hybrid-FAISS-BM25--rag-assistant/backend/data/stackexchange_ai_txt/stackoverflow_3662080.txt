Is there a jQuery plugin with functionality of CSS3 flexible box model?

I want an element organization in my UI equivalent to the results of following CSS: #wall { width: 100%; display: box; box-orient: horizontal; box-align: stretch; box-lines: multiple; } Unfortunately browsers do not seem to support box-lines: multiple; , and some widely used browsers do not yet support flexible box model at all. Is there an existing jQuery plugin that provides this functionality?
