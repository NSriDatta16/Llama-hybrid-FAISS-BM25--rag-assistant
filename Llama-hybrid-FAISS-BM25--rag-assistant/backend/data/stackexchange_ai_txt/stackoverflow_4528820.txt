cvRetrieveFrame intricacies - openCV

The Documentation of OpenCV mentions that "the returned image (by cvRetrieveFrame) should not be released or modified by the user" ... Link: http://opencv.willowgarage.com/documentation/c/highgui_reading_and_writing_images_and_video.html#retrieveframe I am trying to debug my code, which involves the following steps: Retrieve frame from video using cvRetrieveFrame() Do some processing on the frame output results My instinct says that something is wrong with cvRetrieveFrame() because if I manually input frames using cvLoadImage, the program works fine. But I am not getting same results while using cvRetrieveFrame(). Since the documentation mentions such a restriction, any reason for such a restriction ? And, any alternatives ? Have a great day
