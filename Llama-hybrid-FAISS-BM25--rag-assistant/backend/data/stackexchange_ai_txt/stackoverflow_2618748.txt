When you use header , you can't output anything in the document's body, making any alert() ing impossible. A often used trick to achieve this is to delegate the alert() ing to the target page: header( 'Location: http://localhost/assignment/WebForm.htm?alert='. urlencode("Hello!")) ; and then in WebForm.htm: alert(" "); just remember to htmlentities() the output when outputting the message. If you are already using sessions, for 100% security and elegant URLs, you could also generate a random key in PHP using rand , store the message in $_SESSION["message_$randomKey"] and pass the key in the GET request. That way, the only thing the user sees in the URL is the key, and not the message.
