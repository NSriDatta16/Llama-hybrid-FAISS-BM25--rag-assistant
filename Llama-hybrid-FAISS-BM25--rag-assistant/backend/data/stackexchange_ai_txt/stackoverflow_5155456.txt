EXTJS Drag&Drop Images inside Panel

i was trying to drag and drop an image inside a panel of extjs. but it didnt work. Just want to drag and drop elements like in the draggable demos of jquery. Is there an easy solution cause i didn't found. thanks in advance, cheers, Thomas I am sorry ChrisR, forgot the code. Well i tried it in that way: panel(with html code of an image) inside a panel. dreagable = true. But i cant drag an drop it like to position XY. Ext.createWidget('panel', { renderTo: 'panel1', width: 500, height: 500, items: [ { xtype: 'panel', title: 'My Panel', width: 150, height: 150, draggable: true, html: ' ' }]
