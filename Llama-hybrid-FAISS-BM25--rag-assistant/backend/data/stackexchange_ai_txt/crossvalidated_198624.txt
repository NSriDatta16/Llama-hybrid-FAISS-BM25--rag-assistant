Without any information on whether they choose $C$ or $D$ and a multinomial likelihood, the parameters for choosing $C$ or $D$ are non-identifiable. But you can get around this with a Bayesian model and a strong prior on whether $C$ or $D$ is preferred given that $E$ was selected. Alternatively, you may consider an ordered probit model if there is some natural ordering such that $D$ can always be considered "higher" in some sense than $C$. Your 10 repeated samples and censoring is reminiscent of a multi-state mark-recapture model from ecology. Here you would be estimating the parameters for a transition matrix for each time period (probability a person first picks $A$, then switches to $B$, back to $A$, etc.) In ecology these might be states such as "nesting" and "foraging", with each state having an associated probability of observing an animal if it present during (this is the censoring bit). Check out Bayesian Population Analysis Using WinBUGS for some very good practical examples of how to fit such models. Many of the examples models in that book were recently translated into Stan, if you'd like to go that route.
