Thanks everyone for your answers. I made the case for using a Framework or Drupal, but it was decided that we should go with Wordpress, or at least start building on Wordpress and see how it goes. FWIW here are the notes I came up with: WORDPRESS / MU http://wordpress.org/ http://mu.wordpress.org/ A personal publishing tool, blogging platform PHP + Many available widgets + Multi-author support / workflow + Social features (BuddyPress) + Integration (BBPress etc) + Easy, common + Simple UI + Able to manage multiple blogs (with WordPress MU) + Only 2 content types (post or page) - Not a real "CMS" / blog mentality - Inflexible heirachy (no sections) - Limited semantics - Limited template choices for authors - Messy code - Security / exploits - DRUPAL http://drupal.org/ A content management framework, CMS construction kit, tools to build sites. For 'non programmers' to build websites, building blocks PHP + Made for big sites / portals + Social features built in (each user has own profile/log, extensible) + Page type selection/config by authors (block system) + Scope for structured data / semantics + Multiple content types (press releases, news articles, blog posts, etc.) + Good community / tools + Blank canvas + Many features + Good image handling + Complex UI - "Black box", very abstract code, learning curve! - Customizing / theming is difficult - FRAMEWORK It allows you to design the exact web app you need from the ground up Extensible + Control of semantics, data storage + APIs / Data / REST / Web services + Current, modern tools, cutting edge + Separation of logic/presentation (MVC design pattern) + Convention - structured code, workflow + Reuse/combine content + Allows development of multiple UIs without touching business logic codebase + Robust API / standards / patterns + DRY (don't repeat yourself) + Learning curve - Need to design a custom UI - Overkill? (depending on goals) -
