Confusion matrix for events in a time series

I'm not big on statistics, so please excuse my ignorance. I have a video recording that I want to evaluate, I have an algorithm that can transform this video into a time series where I have 0 everywhere except for a couple of frames where an event (A) occurs. Then I have manual annotations of another event (B) that I think is related to the 1st event (A) (i.e. event B appears shortly after event A). I want to construct a confusion matrix like this: Event A is condition, event B is "test" True positive value is when there is an event A and within 50 frames there is also event B False positive is when A is not present, but B is False negative is when A is present, but B is not Now my problem is about True Negatives. If you do vaccine testing, you have a total number of tests, and you can quantify True Negatives without issue. But what about my case? I either have event A or B but True Negative is by definition everything else in the time series? Does it make sense to even use confusion matrix?
