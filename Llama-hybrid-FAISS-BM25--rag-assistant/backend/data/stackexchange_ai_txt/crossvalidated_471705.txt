Yes, you can use a normal prior. Conjugacy is great because the posterior can be written down pen and paper. But there is nothing stopping you from specifying a normal as the prior for the probability (given you constrain it to be between 0 and 1). The catch is that you now have to use numerical methods to get the posterior. Would you like an example using Stan, the popular open source language for fitting Bayesian models?
