Distribution Shift vs Transfer Learning

Transfer learning (TL) is a research problem in machine learning (ML) that focuses on storing knowledge gained while solving one problem and applying it to a different but related problem [ 1 ] Distribution Shift The conditions under which the system was developed will differ from those in which we use the system. [ 2 ] I consider there is no difference between distribution shift and dataset shift. But between transfer learning and distribution shift? What are the differences? Can we say that transfer learning is an intended distribution shift?
