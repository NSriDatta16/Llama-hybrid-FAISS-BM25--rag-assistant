There is no universal truth to that question. There is always a tradeoff made with any threshold and the ROC visualizes all possible thresholds for you to pick the best. Is it better to err on one side or better to err on the other? That will heavily depend on the topic at hand. A screening test for a disease with the implication to not send your kid to school for a week is less critical with a false positive then a diagnostic test with the implication of removing a limb or an organ. If that is not good enough you may want to look into Youden's J or the Youden Index and the threshold that maximizes it.
