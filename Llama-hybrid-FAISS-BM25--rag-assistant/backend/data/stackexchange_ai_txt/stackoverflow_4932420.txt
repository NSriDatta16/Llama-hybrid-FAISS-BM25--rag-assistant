You can also use CROSS APPLY for this as in this tip by Itzik Ben Gan . SELECT SalesOrderID, OrderDate, Week_Day FROM Sales.SalesOrderHeader CROSS APPLY (SELECT DATEPART(weekday, DATEADD(day, @@DATEFIRST - 7, OrderDate)) AS Week_Day) AS A WHERE Week_Day NOT IN (1, 7); You should be aware that reusing aliases in a where clause will render the predicate unsargable however so should be used with caution (this applies regardless of whether you use APPLY or a CTE)
