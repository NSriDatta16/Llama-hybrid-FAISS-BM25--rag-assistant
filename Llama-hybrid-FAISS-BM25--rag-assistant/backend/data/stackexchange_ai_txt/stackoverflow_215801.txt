The key part of your question is the ability for the backup solution to be managed by a non-DBA. Any native SQL Server answer like backup scripts isn't going to meet that need, because backup scripts require T-SQL knowledge. Because of that, you want to look toward third-party solutions like the ones Mitch Wheat mentioned. I work for Quest (the makers of LiteSpeed) so of course I'm partial to that one - it's easy to show to non-DBAs. Before I left my last company, I had a ten minute session to show the sysadmins and developers how the LiteSpeed console worked, and that was that. They haven't called since. Another approach is using the same backup software that the rest of your shop uses. TSM, Veritas, Backup Exec and Microsoft DPM all have SQL Server agents that let your Windows admins manage the backup process with varying degrees of ease-of-use. If you really want a non-DBA to manage it, this is probably the most dead-easy way to do it, although you sacrifice a lot of performance that the SQL-specific backup tools give you.
