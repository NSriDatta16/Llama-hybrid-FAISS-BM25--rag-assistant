Have a look at the AntiXSS library. The current release (3.1) has a method called GetSafeHtmlFragment , which can be used to do the kind of parsing you're talking about. A Literal is probably the correct control for outputting this HTML, as the Literal just outputs what's put into it and lets the browser render any HTML. Labels will output all the markup including tags. The AJax Control Toolkit has a text editor .
