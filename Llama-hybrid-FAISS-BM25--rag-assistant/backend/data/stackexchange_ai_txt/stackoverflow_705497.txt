How to make a search engine for my apps

Duplicate of: What is a good search engine for embedding in a web site. I mainly build apps in asp.net using a ms sql backend. Does anyone have a dummy guide for making a good search engine? I've been told not to you like statements in my stored procedures. If I don't use like, how do I search for terms with in all my columns containing text?
