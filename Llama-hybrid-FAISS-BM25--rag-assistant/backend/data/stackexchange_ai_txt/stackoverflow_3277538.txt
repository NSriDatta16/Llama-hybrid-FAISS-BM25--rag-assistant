Can I select a specific block of text in a UITextField?

I have a UITextField in my iPhone app. I know how to make the text field select all of its text, but how can change the selection? Say I wanted to select the last 5 characters, or a specific range of characters, is that possible? if not, can I move the lines marking the beginning and end of the selection, as if the user is dragging them?
