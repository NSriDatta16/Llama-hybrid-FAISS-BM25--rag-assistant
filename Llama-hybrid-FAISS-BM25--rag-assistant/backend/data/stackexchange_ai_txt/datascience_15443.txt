That is a rather broad question. If you are on a document level, you could (after removing stop words) determine the most important words in your corpus by calculating the tf/idf measure https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf â€“idf Then you could define a vector over the top n words and represent every document as a vector of the relative frequencies of the top n words in that document and work on these vectors. On a sentence level that could work as well, on a word level obviously not. Anyway, information retrieval and computational linguistics are a rather large research area. Maybe the best way would be to start with a book that provides a good overview. Since you asked for some more specific recommendations: If you can get access to (or actually want to buy it), definitely this one: Speech and Language Processing: An Introduction to Natural Language Processing, Computational Linguistics, and Speech Recognition . You can also take a shot this: Sentiment Analysis and Opinion Mining this is probably not your focus, but it covers feature representation to some extent and is for free. More like a handbook with practical approaches is: Programming Collective Intelligence , look for it at Google, it is also available for free. Otherwise if you want to look for yourself for books at a library or so, your keywords are "Computational Linguistics" and "Natural Language Processing". Hope this helps
