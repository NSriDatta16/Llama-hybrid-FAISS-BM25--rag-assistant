Ideas to identify cutoff points for tumor classification?

My lab models breast cancer in mice. I am using a 36-gene signature (derived from one of our mouse models). In the signature, all genes are elevated. I have 997 human samples and would like to apply the gene signature. All genes are weighted equally. I was thinking of ranking the samples (by adding all the gene values together), so that I could rank the samples based on this sum. The problem is: how could I establish a cut-off point for classification (i.e. after a certain rank, the human samples are not classified as "mouse-like")? This is important because I would use these "mouse-like" human samples to do further analyses. I was wondering if someone could please suggest ideas? Bootstrap resampling? Percentile analysis? Machine Learning? Or any paper doing something similar... Thank you very much for your time!
