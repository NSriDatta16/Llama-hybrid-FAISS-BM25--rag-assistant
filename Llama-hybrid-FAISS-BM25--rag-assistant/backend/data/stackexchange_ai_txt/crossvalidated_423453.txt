Very interesting question. I doubt there is a definite answer to this, but let me give an extended comment. Imagine that you've done an experiment on some phenomenon that was never studied by anyone before. During your analysis, as a Bayesian, you would choose some prior for analyzing this data. Since you have no prior knowledge, you choose some "uninformative" prior. Next, given the results, you are planning a follow-up experiment, to study some further aspects of the problem. The design of the follow-up experiment would depend on the previous results (they are not exchangeable!), so should you ignore the previous results and again use "uninformative" prior, or rather consider them when choosing your prior? I would say that ignoring the results does not sound as a good idea.
