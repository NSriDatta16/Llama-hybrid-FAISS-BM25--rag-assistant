Taste may have something useful. It's moved to the Mahout project: http://taste.sourceforge.net/ In general, the idea is that given a user's past preferences, you want to predict what they'll select next and recommend it. You build a machine-learning model in which the inputs are what a user has picked in the past and the attributes of each pick. The output is the item(s) they'll pick. You create training data by holding back some of their choices, and using their history to predict the data you held back. Lots of different machine learning models you can use. Decision trees are common.
