Stopping the Magento indexing process

How can I stop the indexing process? I had imported 15,000 products and started the indexing, but now it's stuck on processing for "Category search index". It has been stuck on processing for two days now, how can I stop the indexing process? Any help would be appreciated, thank you in advance.
