exponential RV til bus arrives

Suppose that you are waiting at a bus stop. The waiting time until a bus arrives is $T$ where $T$ is an exponentially distributed random variable with parameter $λ$ i.e. $P(T≤t)=1−e^{−λt}, ∀t≥0$ . (a) Given that you have already waited $r$ seconds, what is the probability that the bus will not arrive within $d$ more seconds? (b) What is the average waiting time for the bus i.e. the expected value of $T$ ? Hint: Recall that one way to solve $\int u \, dv$ is by integration by parts. My attempt: (a) If we've waited $r$ seconds and seeing if the bus will not arrive in $d$ more seconds, then we're calculating $1-P(T≤r+d)$ which is $1-(1−e^{−λ(r+d)}) = e^{−λ(r+d)}$ (b) The PDF of an exponential RV is $f(x)=λe^{-λx}$ . The average waiting time would be $\int_0^\infty xλe^{-λx} \, dx$ which, after integration, equals $\frac{1}{λ}$ . Is this correct?
