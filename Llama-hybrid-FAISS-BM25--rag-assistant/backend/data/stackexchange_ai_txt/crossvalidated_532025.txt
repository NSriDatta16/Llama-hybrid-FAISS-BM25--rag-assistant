What filter should I use for non gaussian distribution?

I have a process that measureing distance between 10-100mm and I currently measuring at 11-18mm with a fixed distance. I want to improve this measurement by adding a filter. Here is the distribution of the complete measurement. Take account that this is a non gaussian distrbution because the average changes over time. Here is the average and deviation that changes over time. In this case, I have taken 50 measurements and then compute the average and deviation of it, then next 50 measurements and repeated the process. The smaller number I use to compute the average, the more nosy it becomes. Larger number gives better measurement results, but slower measurement. Question: What type of filter should I use for a measurement that has a non gaussian distribution? In this case, the average changes over time. Should I use a particle filter? I have read about it, but I did not understand how I should estimate the distribution by just having 10 measurements samples. The raw values are integer values between 10-18mm. To reproduce this example Download VL6180X_Distribution.m and log.txt from here. Run the .m file with MATLAB or GNU Octave. Then you have the plots. https://github.com/DanielMartensson/STM32-Libraries/tree/master/VL6180X/Distribution
