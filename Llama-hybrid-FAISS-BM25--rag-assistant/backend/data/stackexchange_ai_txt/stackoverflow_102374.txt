How to add a version number to an Access file in a .msi

I'm building an install using VS 2003. The install has an Excel workbook and two Access databases. I need to force the Access files to load regardless of the create/mod date of the existing databases on the user's computer. I currently use ORCA to force in a Version number on the two files, but would like to find a simpler, more elegant solution (hand editing a .msi file is not something I see as "best practice". Is there a way to add a version number to the databases using Access that would then be used in the install? Is there a better way for me to do this?
