Through playing with some dummy data in R and thinking more about the answers/comments here, I think I've figured out the answer to my question. I just need to look at the value of the intercept. I should use a logistic regression with only the intercept. So, when coding it in R, and with choice as the binary dependent variable: my.model = glmm(choice ~ 1 + (1|subjectID), data = data, family = binomial(link = "logit")) The coefficient for the intercept informs me whether the number of "correct choices" is significantly above 50%. If I want to include fixed effects and test whether covariates affect choice , I would have to compare a model with these with this intercept-only model with anova() or similar.
