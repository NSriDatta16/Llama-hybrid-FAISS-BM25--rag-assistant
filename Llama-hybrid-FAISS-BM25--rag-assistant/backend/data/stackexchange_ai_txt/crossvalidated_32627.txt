Performance comparison between reduction techniques

If I want to compare the performance of PCA and PLS with nonlinear data, what do I have to measure ? I know that I can use the MSE (but if I do not use a linear profile, I can't estimate the parameters of the linear regression, so how do I calculate it? For the PLS, the data should follow a normal ditribution or it is an unsupervised method. Which other methods would you propose to me for dimension reduction techniques?
