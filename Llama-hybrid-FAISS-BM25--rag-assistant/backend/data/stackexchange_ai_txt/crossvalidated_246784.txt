When you ask "Did you go to the gym today?" going to the gym is an outcome with multiple causes, if these causes manage to pass some threshold you went, otherwise you didn't. So I think it's fine to consider this to be a latent variable. In addition, your model looks like this: F1 =~ V1 + V2 + V3 F2 =~ V4 + V5 + V6 F1 ~~ F2 But say that V6 was your nominal variable, and you are not comfortable treating it as an indicator of a latent variable, so instead you regress it on the latent, essentially doing a logistic regression. F1 =~ V1 + V2 + V3 F2 =~ V4 + V5 F1 ~~ F2 V6 ~ F1 It turns out that these models are equivalent - they are the same model. In short, I don't think you need to worry.
