I would suggest looking for GIS data. www.geodata.gov has many free datasets. Most States will have a GIS organization that probably has free data sets as well. If the GIS data is stored in a shapefile (.shp) format, look for the corresponding database file (.dbf). You should be able to just open that up in Excel and extract the required data. Good luck! Edit I forgot to add that since this data is probably stored in a format suitable for a relational database, perhaps you write a script that converts this into a suitable schema?
