If by 'support' you mean does the RAM in a machine have a native storage unit matching each size, the answer is 'it depends on the machine and the compiler'. Modern machines typically have minimum addressable storage sizes that are multiples of 8-bits (8/16/32/64 bits). Compilers can use any of those sizes to store and manipulate data. A compiler may optimize storage and register usage, but they do not have to.
