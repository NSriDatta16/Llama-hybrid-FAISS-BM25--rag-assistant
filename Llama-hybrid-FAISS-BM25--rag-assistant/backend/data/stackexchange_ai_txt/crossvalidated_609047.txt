Fixed Effects regression, but different slopes within each group. How does regression estimate the slope?

If I am running a regression of the following form: $y_{i,t} = \mu_i + \beta_1x_{i,t} + \epsilon_{i,t}$ Where i indicates group, t time, and $\mu_i$ are a set of fixed effects for each group, and x is my independent variable of interest. Say I estimate this model to control for time invariant characteristics. Now, if within each i, the slopes of x and y are different, what exactly does regression (Ordinary Least Squares) estimate when not accounting for different slopes within groups? Does it somehow take an average of the group specific slopes? Just as a very simplified example if it helps to explain my confusion, I drew fake datapoints for two groups (one in red, one in blue). Fitting the fixed effects allows for the groups to have their own intercepts, but what line will regression ultimately draw?
