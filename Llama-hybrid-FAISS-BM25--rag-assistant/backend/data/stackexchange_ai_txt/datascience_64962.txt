How to get vectors of memory cell & the last output of $LSTM$ in keras?

In this research paper the following paragraph appears, The state of every LSTM model is stored in two fixed-size vectors of real numbers called the memory cells and the last output. Since our LSTM model is trained to predict userâ€™s behavior, elements of these vectors are the natural candidates for the user-dependent features. They can be extended by the resulting predictions (answers to the questions). This way 218 new features are obtained from the memory cells (100) and the last output (100) of the second LSTM layer and from the final output (18). I am aware of getting weights of each layer. But how to get these two vectors?
