Combining text and non-text features

I am working on a binary classification problem using SVM. I am currently using ksvm in R (kernlab package). The input is a combination of text and scores. I would like to be able to use substring counts (as in using a string kernel in SVM) and in addition, use the score. Is there a way to combine a string kernel for the text feature and a linear kernel for the numeric score? Should I build the kernel matrix externally and pass it in to the ksvm function in R?
