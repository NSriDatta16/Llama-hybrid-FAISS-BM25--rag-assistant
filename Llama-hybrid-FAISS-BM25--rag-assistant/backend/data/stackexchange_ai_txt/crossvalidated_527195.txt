I found these notes by Larry Wasserman really helpful for learning the basic theory. I used these lecture notes by Yihong Wu in a class also. Wainwright also has a good chapter on minimax theory. There is still definitely a rift between these resources and some modern papers. I tend to notice Tsybakov (2009) being cited in modern papers. Edit: I was recently reminded of this book by Gine and Nickl it is very similar to Tsbakov (2009) although slightly more modern. I think it really stands out for the chapter on empirical processes theory which is extensive (like not far off from Van der Vaart and Wellner level extensive). However, it also has a chapter devoted to studying the minimax properties of infinite-dimensional estimators. The nice thing is that a lot of the minimax results for nonparametric tests and estimators rely on the empirical process and functional approximation results covered earlier so it is nice to have all that together like in Tsybakov (2009).
