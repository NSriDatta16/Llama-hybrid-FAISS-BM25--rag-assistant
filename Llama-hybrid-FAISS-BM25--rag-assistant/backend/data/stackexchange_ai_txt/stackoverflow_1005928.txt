Yes, that wiki page wasn't very helpful in that it tries to make it sound very elegant. The truth is that Hudson doesn't support job chains very elegantly yet if you have to pass stuff from one job to another. I'm also doing the zip-up-and-copy-workspace method to transfer workspaces from one job to another. I have a quick build, full analysis build, and then distribution builds. In between, I use Ant to generate timestamps and "build-stamps" to mark which job's number built which other job's number. The fingerprinting feature helps keep track of files, but since I'm not going to archive the workspace zips, fingerprinting is useless to the users because they can't actually see the workspace zips.
