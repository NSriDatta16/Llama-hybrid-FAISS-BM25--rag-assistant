Android Eclipse emulator problem: Runs WVGA(hdpi) as a mdpi screen

The problem I am having is that when I run a FWVGA or WVGA sized emulator it sometimes runs at a MDPI size instead of HDPI. Here is an example with pictures http://wonton-games.blogspot.com/2010/06/emulator-problems.html I create the AVD with the proper hw.lcd.density setting and screen size and it randomly does this. There doesn't seem to be a pattern. I used to be able to just delete the AVD and create it over again and it would fix itself for a while but now it's getting worse. Does anyone have any ideas cause I posted on the Android Developer forum but all I got was other people saying they get the same problem.
