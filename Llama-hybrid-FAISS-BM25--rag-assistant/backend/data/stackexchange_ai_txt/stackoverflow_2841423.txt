Where Java really is at its element is web applications. And thanks to the development of JIT compilers, nowadays its speed is often comparable to that of C++. I believe that standard C++ is quite portable across platforms, the trouble comes when you want to use things which have never been standardized. The biggest of these which comes to my mind is threads. Also, to make an efficient, fast and elegant C/C++ program, you need a lot of skills and experience. Lacking these, you can easily make inefficient, buggy and ugly C/C++ programs. Which is not to say you can't do this in Java (or any programming language), but making basic mistakes in C and C++ is much more deadly than in Java. C is used in places close to the metal, and/or where performance and efficiency is an utmost requirement, including operating system kernels and device drivers.
