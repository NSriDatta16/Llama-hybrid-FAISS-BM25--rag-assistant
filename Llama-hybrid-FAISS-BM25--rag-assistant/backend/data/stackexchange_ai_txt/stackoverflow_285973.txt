Reginald Braithwaite (aka Raganwald) has been writing a great series on combinators in Ruby over at his new blog, homoiconic . While he doesn't (to my knowledge) look at the Y-combinator itself, he does look at other combinators, for instance: the Kestrel the Thrush the Cardinal the Obdurate Kestrel other Quirky Birds and a few posts on how you can use them.
