Cannot find boost library

This is a very basic question, I only post because I've spent already some time into it. This is what I've done so far: Downloaded and compiled the boost library: sudo ./bootstrap.sh and sudo ./bjam install This way it was installed into /usr/local/lib . In my source code I've added only: #include using boost::asio::ip::tcp I compile it with: g++ -I/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk/include -L/usr/local/lib -fPIC -lboost_system -shared -o libagent.so agent.cpp However, ldd -d ./libagent.so gives me: libboost_system.so.1.46.1 => not found But there is no error thrown, when using the -lboost_system and ls /usr/local/lib gets me among other things: libboost_system.so libboost_system.a What am I missing?
