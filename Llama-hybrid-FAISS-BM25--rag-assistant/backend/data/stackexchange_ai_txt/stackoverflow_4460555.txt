Because a is a block-level container, with no semantic context. It's literally just a container, a "dividing block" if you will. The problem with using , is that it should be used for tabular data. This is both from both the purist perspective (i.e. it's Just Wrong to use it for other things), as well as a pragmatic perspective (browsers will probably assume this is some sort of 2D table and try to render it accordingly). So if you really want to present some sort of table it's fine, but the frameworks offer functionality that's applicable in a general sense, so they can't assume this. Divs avoid both of these issues, by not giving any particular meaning to their contents. Thus browsers will not apply any special rendering, making them the perfect "transparent wrapper" to apply appropriate CSS styles/Javascript to. Webapps aren't perfect, and often a desktop application will be faster and more powerful, but webapps offer a very low barrier to entry. So long as you already have a browser (and who doesn't), you don't need to install anything. Additionally, since all the logic is performed on the central server, it's easier to monitor/log/patch/upgrade. Basically, if you just want to present information and respond to simple commands, it's arguably better to roll something out as a webapp, with the client-server model, than desktop apps - simply because it's much easier to maintain, all things being equal.
