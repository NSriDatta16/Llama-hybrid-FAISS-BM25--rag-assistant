Conditional expectation, conditional on sum of weighted average of two iid RVs

I have an arbitrary distribution $F$ , and two variables $z, x \sim F$ . I only observe the weighted average $y = \alpha z + (1 - \alpha) x$ . Conditional on $y$ , what is the expected value of $z$ ? I know I can use Baye's rule for this, but we only wish to know $\mathbb{E}(z \mid y)$ , so calculating the full distribution of $f(z \mid y)$ seems excessive, and potentially intractable. Plus if I can write something in terms of the moments of $F$ , then that's a nicer solution. I have made progress in (I think) a clever direction. Given that $y = \alpha z + (1 - \alpha) x$ , we can apply the conditional expectation operator and know $\alpha\mathbb{E}(z \mid y) = y - (1 - \alpha)\mathbb{E}(x \mid y)$ Assume that the conditional expectation is of the form $\mathbb{E}(z \mid y) = f(y, \alpha)$ . Then we also know that $\mathbb{E}(x \mid y) = f(y, 1 - \alpha)$ . This gives us the relationship $$ \alpha f(y, \alpha) = y - (1 - \alpha) f(y, 1 - \alpha) $$ We also know that $$ f(y, 0) = \mathbb{E}(z) $$ That is, when $\alpha = 0$ , knowing $y$ tells us nothing about $z$ . Similarly, we also know $f(y, 1) = y$ . Given the three conditions $$ \alpha f(y, \alpha) = y - (1 - \alpha) f(y, 1 - \alpha) \\ f(y, 0) = \mathbb{E}(z) \\ f(y, 1) = y $$ Can we figure out all of $f$ ?
