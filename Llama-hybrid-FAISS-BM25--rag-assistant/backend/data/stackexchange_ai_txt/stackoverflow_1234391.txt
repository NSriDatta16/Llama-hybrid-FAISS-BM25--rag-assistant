How do you set up N2 CMS in an "enterprise" environment?

I've been playing around with the N2 CMS and I've been impressed so far. But it seems like a big jump to move from the examples to an "enterprise" grade solution. What I really need are robust permissions and roles integrated with Active Directory. So far I've played with the membership and role providers and got things sort of rolling. But I'd really like to compare what I've done with how people are actually using the thing. How have you customized and deployed N2 CMS in your largish organization? Update: This question has sort of become a moot point for us. We decided to use Umbraco instead since a lot of the features that we needed were included out of the box. N2 still seems like a nice system for certain things though.
