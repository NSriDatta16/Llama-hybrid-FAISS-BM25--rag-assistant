Understanding correlation on clearly correlated but not reversible data

My question is how reversibility effects correlation. I am effectively a statistics noob, so forgive my lack of proper terminology. I will use the following example to illustrate the question. I have created a list of random numbers ranging from 0 to 30, and a second list indicating the first order of the number. Clearly, there is strong correlation between the two columns, yet going from num to dec is 100% certain, whereas going from dec to num is a guess (10% chance of guessing the correct number). How is this phenomenon called statistically? A correlation plot would look as follows. It is symmetric along its diagonal, but would it make sense to have a correlation 'from' num to dec in one half (corr = 1), and 'from' dec to num in the other half (corr = 0.1). (probably the relation I am referring to is not actually correlation, but useful for data science nonetheless)
