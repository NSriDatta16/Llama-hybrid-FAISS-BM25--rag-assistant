Statistical power of an experiment calculation

As titled,I had some confusion related to statistical power calculation. The calculation is done using from statsmodels.stats.power import tt_ind_solve_power as SolPower np.round((SolPower(effect_size=None, # normalized difference between Group 1 & 2: min effect size / standard deviation nobs1=None, # size of Group 1 (i.e. Treatment) alpha=0.05, # significance: prob. of Type I error ratio=1, # ratio: Group 2 size/Group 1 size alternative='two-sided'))*100 ,2) this function in python. The question given to us is as follows: There are 60 stores in an area and divided into treatment & control group equivalently. The Average Treatment Effect is \$4000. Each store has the same standard deviation of \$30000 and mean of \$200000. The first part needs us to calculate statistical power.I plugged in effect size = \$4000/30000 $,nobs = $ 30 and got 14.39% as a result(which is the same answer from instructor.) The next question assumes the previous experiment was done in one week.Now if we want statistical power to reach 50%,how many weeks do we need to run the experiment. The answer given by instructor simply assumes number of observations = 30*n ,where n= number of weeks and effect size doesn't change. I don't think this is rigorous, as I would assume the observations to be i.i.d, but apparently they are not(because they are dynamic data from the same store).I think this question should be done by calculating the new effect size, holding number of observations fixed. Or maybe this question doesn't make any sense in a statistical way.If anyone could help me verify how should I solve this problem,I would really appreciate it!
