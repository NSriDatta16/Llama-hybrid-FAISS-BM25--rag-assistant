I honestly believe that there is no right answer to this question. Judging from the given answers, the consensus is that parametric tests are more powerful than nonparametric equivalents. I won't contest this view but I see it more as a hypothetical rather than factual viewpoint since it is not something explicitly taught in schools and no peer reviewer will ever tell you "your paper was rejected because you used non-parametric tests". This question is about something that the world of statistics is unable to clearly answer but has taken for granted. My personal opinion is that the preference of either parametric or nonparametric has more to do with tradition than anything else (for lack of a better term). Parametric techniques for testing and prediction were there first and have a long history, so it's not easy to completely ignore them. Prediction in particular, has some impressive nonparametric solutions which are widely in use as a first choice tool nowadays. I think this is one of the reasons that Machine Learning techniques such as neural networks and decision trees, which are nonparametric by nature, have gained widespread popularity over the recent years.
