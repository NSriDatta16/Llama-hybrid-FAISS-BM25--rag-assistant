Visual C++ Testing problem

I have installed VisualAssert and cFix. I have been using Visual Studio C++ and programming in CLI/C++. I have a working Chess Game Program that works perfectly by itself.....and I have been studying testing and have many examples(with tutorials) I have found on the net, that compile and run in Visual Studio..... But as soon as I try and implement those tests on my chess game......I get this problem.... This is what its telling me 1>------ Build started: Project: ChessRound1, Configuration: Debug Win32 ------ 1>Compiling... 1>stdafx.cpp 1>C:\Program Files\VisualAssert\include\cfixpe.h(137) : error C3641: 'CfixpCrtInitEmbedding' : invalid calling convention '__cdecl ' for function compiled with /clr:pure or /clr:safe 1>C:\Program Files\VisualAssert\include\cfixpe.h(235) : error C4394: 'CfixpCrtInitEmbeddingRegistration' : per-appdomain symbol should not be marked with __declspec(allocate) 1>C:\Program Files\VisualAssert\include\cfixpe.h(235) : error C2393: 'CfixpCrtInitEmbeddingRegistration' : per-appdomain symbol cannot be allocated in segment '.CRT$XCX' 1>C:\Program Files\VisualAssert\include\cfixpe.h(244) : error C2440: 'initializing' : cannot convert from 'void (__cdecl *)(void)' to 'const CFIX_CRT_INIT_ROUTINE' 1> Address of a function yields __clrcall calling convention in /clr:pure and /clr:safe; consider using __clrcall in target type 1>C:\Program Files\VisualAssert\include\cfixpe.h(137) : error C3641: 'CfixpCrtInitEmbedding' : invalid calling convention '__cdecl ' for function compiled with /clr:pure or /clr:safe 1>Build log was saved at "file://c:\Users\james\Documents\Visual Studio 2008\Projects\ChessRound1\ChessRound1\Debug\BuildLog.htm" 1>ChessRound1 - 4 error(s), 0 warning(s) ========== Build: 0 succeeded, 1 failed, 0 up-to-date, 0 skipped ========== Any ideas what I'm doing wrong?
