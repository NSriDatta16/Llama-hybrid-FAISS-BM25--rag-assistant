Question about using a multiplicative dummy variable

In many econometrics model, the changes in the response variables in certain intervals are more difficult than other intervals. But I believe this is often not considered when estimating the model. For example, suppose $Y_{st}$ represents the proportion of students in a certain school $s$, passing a standardized test in year $t$. Let $R_{st}$ be the academic resources students (ex. books in library), and $I_{st}$ represent average parental income of the students. In this case $Y_{st} \in [0,1],$ and we would like to estimate effect of $R_{st}$ on $Y_{st}.$ We could model this is as follows, $Y_{st} = \alpha_{0} +\alpha_{1}R_{st} + \alpha_{2}I_{st} + \delta_{t}+ u_{st}$, where $u_{st}$ is additive error term, and $\delta_{t}$ are time dummies. In this context of pass rates, intuitively it is more difficult for a school to increase the pass rates from 95% to 100%, then it is for them to go from 45% student passing, to 50% student passing. Consequently, the effect of $R_{st}$ on $Y_{st}$ should be given less weight on the latter situation (45% to 50%), than the former (95% to 100%). Suppose we were comparing two schools in which the same $R_{st}$ increase lead to these results, clearly the 95% to 100% school invested more efficiently. My idea is to use a multiplicative dummy variable with $R_{st}$, $\beta_{t}$, where $\beta_{t}$ takes on different values depending on the initial value of $Y_{st}.$ Is there a standard way to take this into consideration in the model? Are there other additional factors that could improve this model?
