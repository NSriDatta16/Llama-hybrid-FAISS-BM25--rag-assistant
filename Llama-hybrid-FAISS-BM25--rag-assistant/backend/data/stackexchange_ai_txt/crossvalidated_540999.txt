In choosing best GLM model, what is the significance of the p-value in the model with the lowest AIC?

I am running a glm model in R, with a dataset with a large number of variables (around 25). I have checked for collinearity, and there is quite some between some of groups of variables, so I have run the tests both with all and with a selected number of variables. I want to have an explanatory model for an outcome, possibly might progress to have a predictive model later on. I also have a significant portion of NA's, so although I have 200 rows, I only get 90 observations. Below is the model with least AIC, chosen with stepAIC. I have chosen a poisson GLM, since the outcome is bound from 0 to 96. Gamma GLM was not possible as I have a number of 0's. MODEL INFO: Observations: 90 Dependent Variable: postWOMACpain_6 Type: Linear regression MODEL FIT: χ²(8) = 166.64, p = 0.00 Pseudo-R² (Cragg-Uhler) = 0.29 Pseudo-R² (McFadden) = 0.07 AIC = 411.52, BIC = 436.51 Standard errors: MLE --------------------------------------------------- Est. S.E. t val. p -------------------- ------- ------ -------- ------ (Intercept) -1.66 1.07 -1.55 0.12 anaesthesia.FG 0.94 0.53 1.78 0.08 preWOMACpain 0.26 0.07 3.57 0.00 rs6746030TRUE -0.83 0.56 -1.48 0.14 rs11898284TRUE 1.33 0.57 2.34 0.02 rs533586TRUE -2.44 0.70 -3.48 0.00 rs2075572TRUE 1.04 0.64 1.63 0.11 rs609148TRUE 1.77 0.68 2.61 0.01 rs6985606TRUE 0.81 0.55 1.48 0.14 --------------------------------------------------- Estimated dispersion parameter = 5.04 My query would be: If the AIC increases when I remove every variable with a p-value > 0.05 in a stepwise manner, then I will end up with only a couple of factors. For instance, removing anaesthesia.FG, rs6746030, rs6985606 yields: MODEL INFO: Observations: 90 Dependent Variable: postWOMACpain_6 Type: Linear regression MODEL FIT: χ²(5) = 138.56, p = 0.00 Pseudo-R² (Cragg-Uhler) = 0.24 Pseudo-R² (McFadden) = 0.06 AIC = 411.50, BIC = 429.00 Standard errors: MLE --------------------------------------------------- Est.

Your help is much appreciated. All courses I have done do not seem to address this issue, so am not sure how to tackle it properly. Thanks
