magento - error after changing catalogsearch.xml

Was attempting to remove the Search Terms and Advanced Search from the footer links. I am now getting the following message: Warning: simplexml_load_string() [function.simplexml-load-string]: Entity: line 103: parser error : XML declaration allowed only at the start of the document in /home/viviscal/domains/viviscal.ca/public_html/app/code/core/Mage/Core/Model/Layout/Update.php on line 294 When I changed the file back, I'm still getting this message. Anyone know what might be causing it? Regards, Fiona
