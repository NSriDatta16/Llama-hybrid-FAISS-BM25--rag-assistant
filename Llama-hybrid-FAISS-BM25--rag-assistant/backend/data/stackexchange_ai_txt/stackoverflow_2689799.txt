Why does a subTable break a4j:commandLink's reRender?

Here is a minimal rich:dataTable example with an a4j:commandLink inside. When clicked, it sends an AJAX request to my bean and reRenders the dataTable. name action The exmaple obove works fine so far. But when I add a rich:subTable (grouping the cars by garage for example) to the table, reRendering fails... name action Now the rich:dataTable is not rerendered but the item gets deleted since the item does not show up after a manual page refresh. Why does subTable break support for reRender-ing here? Tanks Tom
