Why is accuracy not a useful measure for information retrieval problems?

I have been studying about information retrieval and recommender systems. While reading about it I found that accuracy not a useful measure in information retrieval. I understand that, accuracy might not be good because if data imabalance, which is pretty common in information retrieval where we can have few data of our interest compared to the whole data. But is there any other reason besides data imabalance for which we don't want to use accuracy for information retrieval problems? Thanks!
