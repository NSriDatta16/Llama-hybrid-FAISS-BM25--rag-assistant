MSBuild: set a specific preprocessor #define in the command line

In a C++ file, I have code like this: #if ACTIVATE # pragma message( "Activated" ) #else # pragma message( "Not Activated") #endif I want to set this ACTIVE define to 1 with the MSBuild command line. It tried this, but it doesn't work: msbuild /p:DefineConstants="ACTIVATE=1" How can I do it?
