Using C++ and scripting together

I am developing simple games as a hobby. For my new project, I want some parts to be scriptable. I am familiar with python but don't mind learning new languages. Here is the question: I am planning to implement path-finding, field-of-vision, collision detection etc. in C++ but want to use scripts for AI state machines, scripted events. What type of structure is used for this kind of job? I imagine I can make a C++ program run a python process which in turn calls C++ methods, but it seems inefficient. Another idea is to develop a library to be called from python, which doesn't sound very attractive either. What is the regular way of doing this(except for writing my own language and parser?) I heard lua is popular for embedding into C programs.
