Interpret Dickey Fuller and KPSS tests

I have a time-series with the following profile (electricity generation): My series returns the following, when using both Dickey Fuller and KPSS tests: > adf.test(dataset) Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test data: dataset Dickey-Fuller = -8.0272, Lag order = 5, p-value = 0.01 alternative hypothesis: stationary Warning message: In adf.test(dataset) : p-value smaller than printed p-value > kpss.test(dataset) KPSS Test for Level Stationarity data: dataset KPSS Level = 0.69247, Truncation lag parameter = 4, p-value = 0.01423 and > ndiffs(dataset) [1] 1 With Dickey-Fuller, shouldn't a p-value After that, in order to make this time series stationary, the correct procedure should be: Remove the seasonal component from the dataset via subtraction: components To this new dataset_adjusted , apply diff(dataset_adjusted, differences=ndiffs(dataset_adjusted)) Apply the difference directly to the dataset via: dataset_diff Apply the difference based on the frequency via: dataset_diff3 All three approaches give different results.
