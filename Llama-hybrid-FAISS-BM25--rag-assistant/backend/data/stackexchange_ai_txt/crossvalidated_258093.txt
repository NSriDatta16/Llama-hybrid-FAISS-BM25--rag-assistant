Are you teaching for fun and insight or for practical use? If it's about teaching and understanding, I'd go Bayes. If for practical purposes, I'd definitely go Frequentist. In many fields -and I suppose most fields- of natural sciences, people are used to publish their papers with a p-value. Your "boys" will have to read other people's papers before they come to writing their own. To read other people's papers, at least in my field, they need to understand null hypotheses an p-values, no matter how stupid they may appear after Bayesian studies. And even when they are ready to publish their first paper, they will probably have some senior scientist leading the team and chances are, they prefer Frequentism. That being said, I would like to concur with @Wayne , in that Statistical rethinking shows a very clear way towards Bayesian statistics as a first approach and not based on existing knowledge about Frequentism. It is great how this book does not try to convince you in a fight of the better or worse statistics. The stated argument of the author for Bayes is (IIRC) that he has been teaching both kinds and Bayes was easier to teach.
