Two-way ANOVA but normality and homogeneity violated

I have a 2x3 between-subjects design. I want to run two-way ANOVA but have no normality and no homogeneity. I have 3 variables and 103 observations in total. Factor 1 - attentional bias (CFT): G0 n.38; G1 n.31; G2 n.34 Factor 2 - body dissatisfaction (EDI): G0 n.61; G1 n.42 Dependent Variable - Disgust Regarding the violation of normality, I found that ANOVA is considered a robust test even in the case of a deviation from normality. Regarding the violation of homogeneity, is there any method to run Anova anyway?
