The random effects in mixed-effects models are used to account for correlations in grouped/cluster data. The two main settings of such data are multilevel and longitudinal designs or combinations of these two. In multilevel designs, the study participants are organized in a number of nested or non-nested clusters. For example, students in schools, and schools in districts (nested design), or students in schools and students in sports clubs (non-nested). The premise is that measurements from participants in the same cluster are more correlated than measurements from participants in different clusters. In longitudinal designs, the cluster is the participant, and we collect repeated measurements over time for a number of variables. Measurements from the same participant will be serially correlated. The design of your study, multilevel, longitudinal, or a mix of the two, will dictate an initial assumption for the random-effects design matrix. In multilevel designs, you typically start with a random intercept per level, and in longitudinal data, you want to include functions of time in the random effects design matrix to account for the serial correlations. In many cases, the random effects structure that is implied from the design of the study is not supported by the data you have, leading to overly complex models and convergence problems. Hence, the general advice is to start with a simple random effects structure and build it up, evaluating each step using likelihood ratio tests.
