Approaches to average forecast in machine learning?

I have researched some approaches so far. My situation is: I have 9 different models, all targeting on the same time-series variable. Now I want to combine these 9 forecasts to estimate a better, combined forecast. Approaches I have researched so far: Equally weighted averaging, very naive, but unfortunately also very hard to beat... Regression approaches, minimizing R^2 Weighting according the historical MSE, MAE, RMSE.. Bayesian model averaging Do you know more references / methods for this setup?
