Neural network in MATLAB

I have trained xor neural network in MATLAB and got these weights: iw: [-2.162 2.1706; 2.1565 -2.1688] lw: [-3.9174 -3.9183] b{1} [2.001; 2.0033] b{2} [3.8093] Just from curiosity I have tried to write MATLAB code which computes the output of this network (two neurons in the hidden layer, and one in the output, TANSIG activation function). Code that I got: l1w = [-2.162 2.1706; 2.1565 -2.1688]; l2w = [-3.9174 -3.9183]; b1w = [2.001 2.0033]; b2w = [3.8093]; input = [1, 0]; out1 = tansig (input(1)*l1w(1,1) + input(2)*l1w(1,2) + b1w(1)); out2 = tansig (input(1)*l1w(2,1) + input(2)*l1w(2,2) + b1w(2)); out3 = tansig (out1*l2w(1) + out2*l2w(2) + b2w(1)) The problem is when input is lets say [1,1], it outputs -0.9989 , when [0,1] 0.4902 . While simulating network generated with MATLAB outputs adequately are 0.00055875 and 0.99943 . What am I doing wrong?
