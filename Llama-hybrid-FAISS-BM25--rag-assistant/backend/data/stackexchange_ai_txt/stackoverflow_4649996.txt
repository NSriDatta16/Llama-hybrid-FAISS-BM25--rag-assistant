Your second attempt, with embedding the characters directly into the string, was the right approach. However, you've used the wrong character numbers. The numbers for return/linefeed in ASCII are 13 and 10 (decimal), which is 0x0d and 0x0a (hex). You've used 0x13 and 0x10, which are different characters. See the table at Code page 437 for the character numbers. The characters 19 and 16 (decimal) are indeed a right pointing triangle and a double exclamation mark.
