You don't want to use "overall popularity" unless you have no information about the user. Instead, you want to align this user with similar users and weight accordingly. This is exactly what Bayesian Inference does. In English, it means adjusting the overall probability you'll like something (the average rating) with ratings from other people who generally vote your way as well . Another piece of advice, but this time ad hoc: I find that there are people where if they like something I will almost assuredly not like it. I don't know if this effect is real or imagined, but it might be fun to build in a kind of "negative effect" instead of just clumping people by similarity. Finally there's a company specializing in exactly this called SenseArray . The owner ( Ian Clarke of freenet fame ) is very approachable. You can use my name if you call him up.
