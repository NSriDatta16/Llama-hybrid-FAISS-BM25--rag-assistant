I think the most important thing with (and actually one of the great outcomes of, in a somewhat recursive manner) TDD is successful management of dependencies. You have to make sure that modules are tested in isolation with no elaborate setup needed. For example, if you're testing a component that eventually sends an email, make the email sender a dependency so that you can mock it in your tests. This leads to a second point - mocks are your friends. Get familiarized with mocking frameworks and the style of tests they promote (behavioral, as opposed to the classic state based), and the design choices they encourage (The "Tell, don't ask" principle).
