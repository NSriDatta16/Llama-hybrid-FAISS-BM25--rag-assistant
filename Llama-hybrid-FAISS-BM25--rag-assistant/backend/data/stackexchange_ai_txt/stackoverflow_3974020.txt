One way to do this is to split the original value into its integer and decimal parts, multiply the decimal part by 100 (since you want only 2 digits) and then split that again to get only the 'integer' portion of that number. Its not terribly elegant, but it does work: #include #include #include using namespace std; int main(int argc, char** argv) { const double numberToDisplay = 0.999; double origInteger; double origDecimal; modf(numberToDisplay, &origInteger); double decimal = numberToDisplay - origInteger; //prints .999 even if the number is 12.999 cout Edit: casting to (int) is far simpler as described in another answer.
