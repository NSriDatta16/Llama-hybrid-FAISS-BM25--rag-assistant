It seems that your data are measured with resolution 0.1 and that the range is at least 18.7. My guess given the mention of "weather" is that they are Celsius temperatures. Let's guess that the variable has a range 50 in those units: the tails beyond the quartiles are often longer than the difference between the quartiles. That would mean of the order of 500 distinct values. It seems that your sample size is of the order of 500000, so on average each distinct value occurs about 1000 times, and ties are everywhere. It's also entirely possible that your data are quirkier than that if human readings are involved. Many observers use some final digits rather than others, although the quirks can vary, including preferences for 0 and 5 as final digits or for even digits. Ties are likely to be the issue, together with a rule that the same values must be assigned to the same bin.
