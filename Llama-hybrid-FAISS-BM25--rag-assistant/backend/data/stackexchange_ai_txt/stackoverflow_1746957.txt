I would say that method 2 is better. I think speed will not be greatly affected either way, and there are no strict standards about this, but excessive branching in template files is discouraged. However I would be interested to see what the homepage specific code is. Drupal will give the front page a "front" css class so it can be styled differently and blocks can be created to display only on the front page. So there may not be a need for a specific front page template.
