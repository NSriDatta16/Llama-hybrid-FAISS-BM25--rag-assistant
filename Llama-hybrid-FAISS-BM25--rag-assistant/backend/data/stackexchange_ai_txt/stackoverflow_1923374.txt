I assume that by "bad data issues" you mean "issues of data that does not satisfy all applicable business constraints". They can only be a consequence of two things : bad database design by the database designer (that is : either unintentional or -even worse- intentional omission of integrity constraints in the database definition), or else the inability of the DBMS to support the more complex types of database constraint, combined with a flawed program written by the programmer to enforce the dbms-unsupported integrity constraint. Given how poor SQL databases are at integrity constraints, and given the poor level of knowledge of data management among the average "modern programmer", yes such issues are everywhere.
