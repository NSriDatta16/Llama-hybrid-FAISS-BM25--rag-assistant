Update multiple rows with known keys without inserting new rows if nonexistent keys are found

Let's imagine that we have table items ... table: items item_id INT PRIMARY AUTO_INCREMENT title VARCHAR(255) views INT Let's imagine that it is filled with something like (1, item-1, 10), (2, item-2, 10), (3, item-3, 15) I want to make multi update view for this items from data taken from this array [item_id] => [views] '1' => '50', '2' => '60', '3' => '70', '5' => '10' IMPORTANT! Please note that we have item_id=5 in array, but we don't have item_id=5 in database. I can use INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE , but this way image_id=5 will be inserted into talbe items. How to avoid inserting new key? I just want item_id=5 be skipped because it is not in table. Of course, before execution I can select existing keys from items table; then compare with keys in array; delete nonexistent keys and perform INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE . But maybe there is some more elegant solutions? Thank you.
