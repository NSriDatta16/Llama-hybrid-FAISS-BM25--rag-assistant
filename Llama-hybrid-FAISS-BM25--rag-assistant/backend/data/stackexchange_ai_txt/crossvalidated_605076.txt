At first sight I don't think the second formula is "derived" from the first. The formulae look like just constructed to have the desirable property that "high similarities $\Rightarrow$ large $c_i$ , and "large $c_i$ overall $\Rightarrow$ large $C$ ", and then calibrating numbers to be in the desired $[0,1]$ range. The use of squares will just give low values of $c_i$ (or $\phi(i,j)$ in the first equation) more weight - whether this makes sense depends on the exact definition of $\phi(i,j)$ and the intended interpretation of the outcomes. It isn't so obvious how variance comes in (actually it makes sense, see last paragraph) , but I'd think that this is inspired by the variance formula Var $(X)=\frac{1}{n^2}\sum_i\sum_{j>i}(x_i-x_j)^2$ in the sense that $\sum_i (1-c_i)^2(N-1)$ involves $N(N-1)$ terms, with $(1-\phi(i,j))^2$ occurring twice for every pair $(i, j)$ in $\sum_i (1-c_i)^2$ , whereas $\sum_{j>i}(x_i-x_j)^2$ has every distance between $x_i$ and $x_j$ once. That thing is divided by $n^2$ in the variance formula, so here it is divided by $2N^2$ to account for the fact that it's twice the terms, and the squares may make one think of a variance-like thing (for sure it's a measure of within-cluster variation, as is the variance). Thinking about it more, in fact this seems to be directly based on the variance formula if $(1-\phi(i,j))^2=(x_i-x_j)^2$ in a Euclidean setting. Then we have $$ C=1-\sqrt{\frac{(N-1)\sum_i\sum_j(x_i-x_j)^2}{2N^2(N-1)}}=1-\sqrt{V}, $$ with $V$ being the within-cluster variance, so the formula is a generalisation (to more general choices of $\phi(i,j)$ ) of a "natural" variance-based measure of compactness in case that $(x_i-x_j)^2\in[0,1]$ . I hadn't seen this before and it's certainly not a standard in cluster analysis. The only thing I can imagine is that in applications in a specific field this is used, maybe together with a specific choice of $\phi(i,j)$ (on which it will depend whether this way of generalising from the Euclidean case makes sense).
