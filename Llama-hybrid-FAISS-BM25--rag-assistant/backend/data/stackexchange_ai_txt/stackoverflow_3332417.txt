Unfortunately I know the feeling. I recently got told that we WOULD be using the Entity Framework at our organisation, where as I had been using LINQ-to-SQL with great success. It's sometimes the lot of a programmer, people who don't know what the consequences are, making the decisions. My only suggestion is to provide your management with as much clear and unbiased options & arguments as you can. If you haven't already, try the Entity Framework 4 and then provide a series of concise comparisons in the areas that will affect your business. I would point out that the EF4 is significantly better than the previous version, so if your memory is from that version, take another look. Good Luck!
