You may want to check out the Blackboard design pattern: http://chat.carleton.ca/~narthorn/project/patterns/BlackboardPattern-display.html . That pattern sets up a common data store and then lets agents (who know nothing about one another -- in this case, your async calls) report their results in that common location. Your blackboard's 'supervisor' would then be aware of which call finished first and could direct your program accordingly.
