Time-series regression using the dependent variable as an independent one

Suppose I have a well-performing time-series regression such as: $$ x_{2020} = \beta_0 + \beta_{2019}x_{2019} + \beta_{2018}x_{2018} + \beta_{2017}x_{2017} $$ Having fit this regression to $x_{2020}$ , I'd now like to use it to predict $x_{2021}$ . How could I now use $x_{2020}$ as an independent variable? My initial thought was to shift the variables so that $x_{2019}$ would get $\beta_{2018}$ 's weight, but I don't think it's that simple since my predictions for $x_{2021}$ look a bit odd. Thanks. P.S: Sorry if this is a duplicate; the closest I could find are Time series regression coefficient interpretation with differenced independent variable and How to account for the recency of the observations in a regression problem? but I'm not sure they're what I'm looking for.
