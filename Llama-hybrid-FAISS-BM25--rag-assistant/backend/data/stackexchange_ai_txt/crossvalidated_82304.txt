How can I get a summary of data (mean, min, max, range--I'm working with weather data logged every 10 minutes) for each day of a time series?

So basically my data is the following: Data point # , Date , Time , Temp and Salinity . Loggers logged over 9 months, and I need to summarize each day by minimum temperature and salinity, as well as max, range, and mean. The number of data points are not consistent each day, because some data needed to be pulled out because the loggers became exposed in the intertidal. Any suggestions on code for this? Very new to R, but would like to use it as much as possible. # Date Time TempÂ°C Salinity,ppt 8 5/12/13 9:52 15.13 28.2187 9 5/12/13 10:02 15.21 28.0135 10 5/12/13 10:12 15.38 27.7348 11 5/12/13 10:22 15.51 27.5082
