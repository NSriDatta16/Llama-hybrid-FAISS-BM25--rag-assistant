Depending on whether your two data sources are linked, you have 2 options to model this. When your 2 data sources are linked. This means for every child murder cases, you know whether it was reported or not. In this case, create a response variable $y_i$ and let $y_i =1$ if the $i$th murdered child was reported in the news and $y_i =0$ if unreported. You then use logistic regression with $y$ as response variable and race as your covariate. The odds ratio of race would be what you need. When your 2 data sources are NOT linked. This means you only know the total number of child murders cases and child murder reports by race . You then calculate 2 proportions: probability of a murder case being reported for black and white children. You can then do a 2-sample binomial test i.e test a difference between 2 proportions. Hope this helps. Peter
