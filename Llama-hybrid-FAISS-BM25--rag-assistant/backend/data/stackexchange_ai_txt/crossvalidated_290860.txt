Sensitivity Analysis of Statistical Model

Suppose I had built a model that predicts the likelihood of whether a sales agent will make a sale during an interaction with any given customer. The model is based on many variables, one of which is the 'friendliness' of the sales agent. I run my model over my sales team of 100 staff, 50 of which have been considered 'friendly' staff (and 50 unfriendly), and I can predict the number of sales for the month. If I were to fire the 50 'unfriendly' staff and hire 50 'friendly' staff (making a total team of 100 friendly staff), how I can I use my sales model to predict the uplift in my sales for the month with 100% friendly sales staff? Would it be a matter of understanding (quantifying) the impact of the friendliness of staff and using that in a way to approximate the uplift in sales?
