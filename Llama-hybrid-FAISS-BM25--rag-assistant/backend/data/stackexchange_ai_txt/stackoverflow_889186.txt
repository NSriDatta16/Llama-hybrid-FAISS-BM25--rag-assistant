Instead of a full-blown CI server, why not just build the customized pieces you need? Reuse as much as you can rather than have EVERYTHING custom, you can at least make some parts off-the shelf. (By the way, I wouldn't characterize this as "NIH") Note that even if you spend as much time configuring your builds to work with an existing CI server as you would building your own (probably being generous here) you then only need to maintain each custom bit - not the whole framework. See what you can leverage, and work with it. Also see what tool seems to have promise for moving in the direction you are going. No CI server is going to work perfectly in your environment right out of the box. They all have to be tweaked and "met halfway".
