what does regularization mean in xgboost (tree)

In xgboost ( xgbtree ), gamma is the tunning parameter to control the regularization. I understand what regularization means in xgblinear and logistic regression, but in the context of tree-based methods, I'm not sure how regularization works. Can someone explain how regularization works in xgbtree ?
