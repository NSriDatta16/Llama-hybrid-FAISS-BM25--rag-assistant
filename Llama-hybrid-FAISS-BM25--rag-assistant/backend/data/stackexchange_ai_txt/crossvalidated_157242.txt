Let the time start at time 0. Let's say that the bus arrives at time T minutes. Then T is uniformly distributed on the interval [0, 60]. Let X be the total time elapsed for the guy (including the task and travel). In the first case, where the man does the task first (and risks missing the bus), the man's total time elapsed is in two cases: Case A: If bus arrives in first 10 minutes and he misses it X = T + 60 + 60 = T + 120 Case B: If bus arrives after the first 10 minutes and he catches it X = T + 60 By the law of total expectation , E(X) = E(X | Case A) P(Case A) + E(X | Case B) P(Case B) = E(T + 120) 10/60 + E(T + 60) 50/60 = 150 * 10/60 + 90 * 50/60 = 100 Now, using the other strategy, the calculation is simpler. The man will definitely catch the bus in the first hour. X = T + 60 + 10 = T + 70 E(X) = E(T + 60) = 100 So the second strategy is equal in expectation to the first strategy . Let's think about this in an intuitive way. With the first strategy, the man will save 10 minutes 5 times out of 6 compared to the second strategy. He will lose 50 minutes 1 time out of 6 (because he will have already done the task). So on average, the 10 minutes he saves 5 times will balance the 50 minutes he loses 1 time.
