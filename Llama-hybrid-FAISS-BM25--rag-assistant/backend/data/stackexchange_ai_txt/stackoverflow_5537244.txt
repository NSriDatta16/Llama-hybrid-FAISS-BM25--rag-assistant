Should i create folder drawable-hdpi-de-rDE similarly drawable-mdpi-de-rDE & drawable-ldpi-de-rDE If you want to make your pictures (at the right sizes) yourself, yes, you'll have to create directories that are specific to both the culture and pixel density. However, the culture should come before the dpi, or the project will not compile. For example, the following would compile correctly: drawable-de-rDE-hdpi drawable-de-rDE-mdpi drawable-de-rDE-ldpi should drawable-de-rDE will be sufficient? If you don't feel the need to draw your pictures at the right scale yourself, that should work : android will scale the images to the right size, as needed. But note that you might get better graphics doing that scaling yourself -- and, instead of just scale up/down, you could re-think your images a little bit, so they fit better in different sizes.
