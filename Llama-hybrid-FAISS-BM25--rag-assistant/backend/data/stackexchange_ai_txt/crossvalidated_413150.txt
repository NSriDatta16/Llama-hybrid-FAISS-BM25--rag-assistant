Apart from endorsing Frank's comment that binning is seldom a good idea and certainly not to this extent the most likely explanation, as mentioned by Kjetil in a comment is that the model suffers from separation. For some combination of levels the outcome variable is all zero or all one. A typical symptom of this is the coefficients trying got go off to infinity until the software calls a halt and very large standard errors. Assuming it is separation then advice is available How to deal with perfect separation in logistic regression? where in my opinion the answer by scortchi is the best advice.
