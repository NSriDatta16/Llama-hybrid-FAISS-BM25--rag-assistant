Ios UILabel update performance

in my application i have an UILabel showing a time updated every second. I have also draggable objects in the screen. When I hide the label or i stop the timer everything is perfect but when i start the timer the animation performance of dragging objects go down. I put the UILabel updating in a separate thread but no luck. I need help friends :)
