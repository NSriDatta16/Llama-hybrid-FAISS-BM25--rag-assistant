Yes, the author is in full legal right to sue you as most (if not all) open source license agreements specify that the software is provided to you under certain conditions, one of which is that the licensing arrangement isn't altered. By distributing without the license, you basically alter the licensing arrangement where the previous license cannot be accepted. The author explicitly reserves the right to alter the licensing agreement, under open source they do not grant you the right to re-license their software under other agreements. Should you have already distributed the software without distributing the license, then you are using software without agreeing to the license, which means you copied the software without permission to do so. Technically you are in copyright violation. When in doubt, contact a lawyer. To reduce damages and show good will, fix the problem as soon as humanly possible. Some organizations don't press the matter if you quickly comply, even though it is still in their right to sue.
