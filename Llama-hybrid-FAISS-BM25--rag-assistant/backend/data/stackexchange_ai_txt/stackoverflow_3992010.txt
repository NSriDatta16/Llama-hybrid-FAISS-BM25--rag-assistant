Creating a single file from multiple notes in Outlook VBA

Currently, my VBA code creates a single file for each note. Here's some simplified sample code: Sub saveNotes() Set myNote = Application.GetNamespace("MAPI").GetDefaultFolder(olFolderNotes) For ibi = 1 To myNote.Items.Count fname = myNote.Items(ibi).Subject myNote.Items(ibi).SaveAs "C:\Temp\" & fname & ".txt", 0 Next End Sub Instead of creating a single file for each note, I want to create a single file for all the notes. I'm looking for the most efficient method to concatenate these note's content and write them to a single file. To give you an idea of the amount of data and how efficient it should be, there are hundreds of notes with an average size of 1024 chars.
