model.predict will output a matrix in which each row is the probability of that input to be in class 1. If you print it, it should look like this: [[ 0.7310586 ] [ 0.26896983]] You just need to loop through those values. for i, predicted in enumerate(predictions): if predicted[0] > 0.25: print "bigger than 0.25" #assign i to class 1 else: print "smaller than 0.25" #assign i to class 0 EDIT: It might be worth to play with the weight of the classes. If you weight the 1 class 3 times more, you might get something close to what you want, in a more elegant way. Here is an example.
