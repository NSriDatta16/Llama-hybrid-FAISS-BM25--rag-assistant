Bayesian estimation of the parameter of a distribution with censored data

I am trying to understand the effect of censored data on parameter estimation, in particular with respect to Bayesian modeling. Here is an illustrating example with some code: Assume you have $N = n+m$ i.i.d observations from an exponential distribution with parameter $\lambda=3$ . We will also define a value $L$ such that any observation less than $L$ is censored. With this in mind, the following is the likelihood for the data \begin{align} \ell(x|\lambda) &= \prod_{i=1}^mF(x)\prod_{i=1}^nf(x)\\ &=\prod_{i=1}^m(1-e^{-\lambda L})\prod_{i=1}^n\lambda e^{-\lambda x_i} \end{align} where $m$ and $n$ are the number of censored and noncensored observations. We also place a prior such that $\lambda\sim\text{Gamma}(0.01,0.01)$ . Now, no matter what the level of censoring is, as long as I have a single uncensored data point my models seems to do well recovering the true $\lambda$ . However, as soon as I make the entire data set censored, I cannot estimate $\lambda$ well. This doesn't seem too shocking to me given that you don't have any information other than the censoring point, however, I would have thought that the estimate of $\lambda$ would be whatever the prior mean is, which is not the case. Should you be recovering the prior if you have all censored data? Here is come code that estimates $\lambda$ in an MCMC. To change the percent of censoring you just need to change the value for prob in the quantile() function. likelihood
