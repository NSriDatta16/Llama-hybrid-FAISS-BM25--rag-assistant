jQuery UI Dialogue - IE 7 Error

I have some jQuery code contributed by another member of the stack overflow community - it works fine in Crome and Firefox but errors and wont work in IE 7. The code is as follows: $(function() { $("#MyDialog").dialog( { autoOpen: false, width:600, height:500, resizable:false, draggable: false, modal:true, }); The error is: Expected Identifier, String or Number. Many Thanks, JPH
