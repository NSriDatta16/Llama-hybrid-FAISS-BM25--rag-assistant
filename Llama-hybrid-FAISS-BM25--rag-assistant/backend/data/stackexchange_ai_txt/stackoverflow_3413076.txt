On an MSSQL-Table (MSSQL 2000) with 13.000.000 entries and indexes on Col1 and Col2 i get the following results: select top 1000000 * from Table1 with(nolock) where isnull(Col1,Col2) > '0' -- Compile-Time: 4ms -- CPU-Time: 18265ms -- Elapsed-Time: 24882ms = ~25s select top 1000000 * from Table1 with(nolock) where Col1 > '0' or (Col1 is null and Col2 > '0') -- Compile-Time: 9ms -- CPU-Time: 7781ms -- Elapsed-Time: 25734 = ~26s The measured values are subject to strong fluctuations base on the workload of the server. The first statment need lesser time to compile but takes more cpu-time for excecution (culstered index scan). Its important to know that many storage-engines have an optimizer who reorganize the statment for better results und executiontimes. Ultimately, both statements will rebuild to mostly the same statement by the optimizer.
