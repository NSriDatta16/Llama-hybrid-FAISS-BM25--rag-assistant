Try checking the state of the SD card before you attempt to write to it. It may be used as a shared drive, corrupted, full, etc. A list of states can be found here: http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Environment.html Here's an example of getting the states: String state = Environment.getExternalStorageState(); if (Environment.MEDIA_MOUNTED.equals(state)) { mExternalStorageAvailable = mExternalStorageWriteable = true; } else if (Environment.MEDIA_MOUNTED_READ_ONLY.equals(state)) { mExternalStorageAvailable = true; mExternalStorageWriteable = false; } else { mExternalStorageAvailable = mExternalStorageWriteable = false; }
