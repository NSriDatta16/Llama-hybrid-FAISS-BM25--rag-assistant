Generating text using LSTM given condition vector

I know that you can use an RNN to generate text given the first few letters ex) "The ca" => (passed into RNN) => "The cat is walking down the street." I would like to know if you can generate text by passing in a condition ex) condition = "ocean" embed condition into some distributed vector => [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5] pass embedded condition vector into LSTM to generate text => "The fish are swimming away." Would something like this be possible?
