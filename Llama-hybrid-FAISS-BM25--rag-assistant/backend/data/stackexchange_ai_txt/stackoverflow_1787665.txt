There are a lot of ways you could do this. The most straightforward would be to just put a checkbox next to each paragraph. The user can check the boxes next to the paragraphs of his choosing. If you have a smoother interface in mind, you can extend that idea by hiding the checkboxes with CSS, then using JavaScript to make the checkboxes selected when the corresponding paragraph is clicked and highlight the paragraph (by applying a CSS class) to show it as selected. A framework like jQuery will streamline this process nicely. Edit: Now that I think of it, as long as you put each paragraph in a element you don't even need JavaScript to check/uncheck the hidden checkboxes; that will happen automatically as long as the label's for attribute is set correctly. All you need JavaScript for is to highlight/unhighlight the labels. Here's a naive implementation using jQuery: input.hidden-checkbox { display: none; } label.multi-select { display: block; cursor: pointer; } label.checked { background-color: #ddd; } $(document).ready(function() { $('input.hidden-checkbox').bind('change', function(e) { var checkBox = $(e.target), label = $('label[for=' + checkBox.attr('id') + ']'); if(label) { if(checkBox.attr('checked')) { label.addClass('checked'); } else { label.removeClass('checked'); } } }); }); Text of paragraph 1. As long as you want. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet... Paragraph 2's text. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...
