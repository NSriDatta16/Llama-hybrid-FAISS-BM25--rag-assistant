The splitting algorithm for XgBoost is pre-sorted and histogram (which is what Joel described in his answer). If you search with these keywords, you will understand them better. Also, my understanding is that to figure out the best split, Xgboost scores the split candidates by using the equation obtained from the derivative of objective function.
