Have you looked into using the strata and sampsize parameters from the R package 'random forest'? You could indicate household in the strata parameter. This is copied from the R documentation on the randomForest package: strata: A (factor) variable that is used for stratified sampling. sampsize: Size(s) of sample to draw. For classification, if sampsize is a vector of the length the number of strata, then sampling is stratified by strata, and the elements of sampsize indicate the numbers to be drawn from the strata.
