Resampling for imbalaced datasets: should testing set also be resampled?

Apologies for what is probably a basic question but I have not been able to find a definitive answer either in the literature or in the Internet. When dealing with an imbalanced dataset one possible strategy is to resample either the minority or the majority class to artificially generate a balanced training set that can be used to train a machine learning model. My doubt stems from the fact that a testing set is supposed to be a representation of what real-world data is going to look like. Under this assumption, my understanding is that the testing set is not to be resampled, unlike the training set, since the imbalance we are trying to deal with is present in the live data in the first place. Could someone please clarify if this intuition is right?
