Zend Framework & PHPunit path issues?

When I extend a ZF class, I get path errors. Here is my test: acl = new Model_Acl(2, 'sims'); } public function testHasUsername() { echo $this->acl->username; $this->assert($this->acl->username); } } Here is the Model_Acl class: class Model_Acl extends Zend_Acl { private $username; private $userid; private $userroles; private $allroles; public function __construct($userid, $username) { if (method_exists(parent, '__construct')) parent::__construct(); $this->username = $username; $this->userid = $userid; $this->setRoles(); $this->setResources(); $this->setPrivilages(); return $this; } ... } I get this error, unless I require 'Zend/Acl.php'. PHP Fatal error: Class 'Zend_Acl' not found in /mnt/dev/mragent/application/models/Acl.php on line 6 So I figure maybe something is not quite up to snuff yet, and continue with this slight inconvenience. Then I get the following error from phpunit itself: 1) Model_AclTest::testHasUsername Use of undefined constant parent - assumed 'parent' /mnt/dev/mragent/application/models/Acl.php:14 /mnt/dev/mragent/tests/application/models/AclTest.php:18 So something is really wrong I think. Or I'm doing something really wrong. How do I set up my path(s) correctly?
