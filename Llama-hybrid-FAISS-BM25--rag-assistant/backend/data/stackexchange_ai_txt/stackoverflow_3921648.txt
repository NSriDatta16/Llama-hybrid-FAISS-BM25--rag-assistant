Create a new file in Android emulator path /data/

I want to create a file in emulator android storage path /data/... but it seems I can't create a new file by programs, I should upload an empty file to /data/... and then write the file, Can anyone help here? openFileOutput("file.txt", MODE_PRIVATE) seems can create a new file in /data/data/Package/files/... but it can't create in path /data/... Thank you so much !
