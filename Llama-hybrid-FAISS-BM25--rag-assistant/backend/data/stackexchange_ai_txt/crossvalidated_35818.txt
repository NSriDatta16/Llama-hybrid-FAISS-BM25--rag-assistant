Accuracy of prediction depends on the variance of the estimate. For averages of iid observations that variance goes down by 1/√n. So in general for iid observations the accuracy of an estimate improves as the sample size increases (not necessarily exactly by 1/√n). Now in you case you have a point process and events may be correlated, certainly aftershocks from the same quake will be highly correlated. When observations are positively correlated the variance does not decrease as rapidly with increasing sample size as it does for iid observations. So small sample size and correlation make it difficult to make accurate predictions. However, if the individual observations have a very low variance, imrovement may not be necessary. So the short and sweet of it is small sample size along with correlation and a large variance for the individual observstions leads to poor prediction. But if the variance of the individual observations is small, the small sample size and correlation may not be important and accurate prediction is possible.
