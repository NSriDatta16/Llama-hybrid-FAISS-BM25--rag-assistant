Why do I need multivariate normality tests?

I am new to time series analysis and would like to test a multivariate time series (12 components) for normality. I found several straightforward normality tests and some multivariate normality tests . My problem is that I do not understand the need for multivariate normality tests in the first place. Can't I just test each of the 12 components for normality separately and conclude that the multivariate time series is normal if all of its components are normal?
