C# setting property values through reflection with attributes

I am trying to build an object through an attribute on a classes property that specifies a column in a supplied data row that is the value of the property, as below: [StoredDataValue("guid")] public string Guid { get; protected set; } [StoredDataValue("PrograGuid")] public string ProgramGuid { get; protected set; } In a Build() method on a base object, I am getting the attribute values set on these properties as MemberInfo info = GetType(); object[] properties = info.GetCustomAttributes(true); However, at this point I am realising the limitation in my knowledge. For a start, I don't appear to be getting back the correct attributes. And how do I set these properties through reflection, now that I have the attributes? Am I doing / thinking something fundamentally incorrect?
