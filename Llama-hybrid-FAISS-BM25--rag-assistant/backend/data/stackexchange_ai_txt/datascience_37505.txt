The k mean clustering is a non surpervised algorithm and classification is a type of supervised Machine learning. The major difference is that in the k-mean clustering you don't know what characterizes your different class in term of inputs, you just specify a number of class for the algorithm to find out (by itself at some point), whereas in classification, you train a ML to recognize a class according to examples where inputs are associated with class. So to answer your question, choosing the k depends of how many things you want to know from your data without knowing how it will be done. In classification you have to have a prior knowledge on your data. Take an exemple : iris dataset with the two situations : consider you don't have the class label but just raw data. You can use k-mean ask it a number of clusters. You will find that you can regroup them into 3 distinct classes (its an ideal case). But if you have access to the label then you will see that you have only three classes because it's how th data is done. One supplementary thing is to use first k-mean clustering to find the optimal number of classes and after that label them to switch from unsupervised to supervised problem. Hope it helps !
