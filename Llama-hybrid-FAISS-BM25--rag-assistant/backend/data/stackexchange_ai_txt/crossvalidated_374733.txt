According to " Time is of the Essence: Machine Learning-based Intrusion Detection in Industrial Time Series Data " by Anton et al. Matrix Profile does indeed require less training time/data and parameter tuning than Deep Learning. Additionally, the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) they compared to, performed worse than Matrix Profile. Comparison Methodology Matrix Profile Matrix Profile is basically a dimension reduction approach, anomalies are quantified by their distance from existing data. Consequently, a threshold needs to be set. If an ideal threshold is set, the Matrix Profile performs perfectly. LSTM The LSTM is used as a predictor, wherein the difference between the predicted next value and the actual value is used for anomaly detection. Even if an ideal threshold is set for this prediction value, the LSTM does still makes mistakes.
