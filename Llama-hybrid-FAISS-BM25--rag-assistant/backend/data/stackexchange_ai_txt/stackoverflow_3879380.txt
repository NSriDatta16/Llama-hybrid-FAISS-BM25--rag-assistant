With MAKKAM's words: Yes, you can. I guess you're actually uncertain about whether you can add a dynamic number of controls to a form, because in the designer you cannot define any arrays, you just drag and drop a certain number of controls on the form. However, in fact Visual Studio simply generates some code in background that adds these controls to a collection. You can just as well write your own code to add an arbitrary number of UserControls to the collection dynamically. Just look at the forms' .designer.cs file to see how it works. Taking MAKKAM's array controls it could look like this, e.g.: public MyForm() { InitializeComponent(); // this is the call to the auto-generated code // Here you could add you own code: foreach (Control control in controls) { this.Controls.Add(control); // this is how to add a control to the form. } }
