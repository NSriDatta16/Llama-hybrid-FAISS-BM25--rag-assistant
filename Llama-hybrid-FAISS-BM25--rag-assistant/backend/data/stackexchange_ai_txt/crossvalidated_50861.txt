Is there any reason to prefer a bayesian model with few variables?

I have two alternative hierachical bayesian models that were designed to the describe the same process (from a high-level point-of-view). Both model provides comparable (but not identical) inferences on test data-sets and both exhibits satisfactory behaviours. So from a practical point-of-view, I have no reason to prefer one model over the other (while they rely on different views). One important difference between them consists in the number of auxiliary latent rv composing the model: one model is composed $N+1$ (scalar) latent rv whereas the other is composed of (scalar) $2N+1$ latent rvs($N$ being the nber of observed sample). Is there any reason to prefer a model with less auxiliary variables (regarless of the computational time)?
