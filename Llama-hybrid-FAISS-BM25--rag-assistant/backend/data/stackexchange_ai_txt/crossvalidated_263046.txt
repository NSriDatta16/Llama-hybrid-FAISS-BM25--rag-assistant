Is it random to split ordered data on every ith entry?

I have an ordered set of data, X, that I want to split into a 10 random groups to do 10-fold cross validation. The data set is very simple with one feature per row. I am wondering if it is random/accepted practice in Machine Learning to split the data into the ten groups by iterating over the data placing the data into the groups every ten entries. So, for example, I start at X[0] and that would go into a group called "group0", X[1] would go into "group1". Once I reach X[10], I would place that in "group0" again. I would repeat this until all data is in one of the ten groups. First of all is this random? Secondly, if it isn't random, does it matter? Will the averaging of the ten folds counteract any "non-randomness" with a sufficiently large data-set?
