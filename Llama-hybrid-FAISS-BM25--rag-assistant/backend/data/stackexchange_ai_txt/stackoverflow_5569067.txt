It sounds like you are using Yoxos 5. In that case, the answer to your question is "Upgrade to the latest version and use a place". In Yoxos 5 you can set up a place, which is the Yoxos distribution enhanced with 3rd party sites. You find the UI in the Yoxos Launcher at top center. I encourage you to not follow that description from 2006. Since then many many things changed in both Eclipse and Yoxos and that installation description is just another way of asking for trouble.
