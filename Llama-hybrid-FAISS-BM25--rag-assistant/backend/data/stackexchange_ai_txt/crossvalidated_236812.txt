In case of RNN order matters. hence your architecture will not work well when you shuffle the images and then tries to predict a sample. For this problem, RNN is not required at all and they are not even a better choice for such kind of problems. The best architecture for your problem is the use of CNNs only. It will give you an exceptional accuracy if you implement it correctly. In order to get an overview how it works, you can take a look at the example of CIFAR10 small images classification: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with realtime data augmentation given here
