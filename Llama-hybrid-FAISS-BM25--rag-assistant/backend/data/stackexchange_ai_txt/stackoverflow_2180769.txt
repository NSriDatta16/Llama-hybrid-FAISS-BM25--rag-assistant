From the C++ Standard, section 6.7: A local object of POD type (3.9) with static storage duration initialized with constant-expressions is initialized before its block is first entered. This means that a function-level static object must be initialised by the first time the function is entered, not necessarily when the process as a whole is initialised. At this point, multiple threads may well be running.
