Conditional Breakpoint Error - Type does not implement selector max and signature

I am trying to debug a piece of code of mine where ( Integer ) values in a map sometimes get surprisingly high. When I do this Collection vals = newState.values(); int max = Collections.max(vals); return newState; // breakpoint here I can set a conditional breakpoint at the line of the return statement with a condition involving max, e.g. max > 10 . When I leave out the middle line and set the breakpoint condition to Collections.max(vals) > 10 , I get a runtime exception in debug mode. "Reason: Type does not implement selector max and signature (Ljava/util/Collection;)Ljava/lang/Comparable;" I can get what I want with the code fragment above, but I still wonder what is going on here. Guessing it could be the Collections method failing to realize that Integer is indeed comparable, I tried Collections. max(v) and some (bad syntax) variations, without success.
