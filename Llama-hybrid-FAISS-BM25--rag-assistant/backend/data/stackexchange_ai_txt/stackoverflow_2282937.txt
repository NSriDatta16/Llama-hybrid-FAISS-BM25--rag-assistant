No, unfortunately, there's no easy way to do this :-( I've been trying to get this up and running myself, but in the end what I did was basically pass all the labels I want to have displayed on the report from the calling app (an ASP.NET app, in my case). Another approach might be to store the text fragments in a SQL Server table, and add a datasource to your report which retrieves those text labels, and then bind them to the appropriate controls. I tried something like that but haven't been able to make it work for myself. It's a pain that ASP.NET is so nicely internationalized with resources, but SSRS is still quite a messy affair when trying to make it multi-language aware :-(
