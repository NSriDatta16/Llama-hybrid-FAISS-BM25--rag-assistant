About the expose-event handling, check out the first paragraph on Animations with Cairo + Gtk:P Multi-threaded Animation with Cairo and GTK+ Complex animations with cairo and GTK+ can result in a laggy interface. This is because the gtk_main() thread runs in a single loop. So, if your do_draw() function implements a complicated drawing command, and it is called from the gtk_main() thread (say by an on_window_expose_event() function), the rest of your gtk code will be blocked until the do_draw() function finishes. Consequentially, menu items, mouse clicks, and even close button events will be slow to be processed and your interface will feel laggy. One solution is to hand off all the processor-intensive drawing to a separate thread, thus freeing the gtk_main() thread to respond to events. http://cairographics.org/threaded_animation_with_cairo/
