don't think it's great idea to block all other request for SUCH long operation, much better approach is to have it to run asynchronously. You can take a look here http://achorniy.wordpress.com/2009/07/14/avoid-concurrent-call-to-conversation/ but this is the solution to allow you to block other requests during the short period of time (of course it can block them for a long time but that's not good approach in general to make user to wait for such requests) You can take a look here for a good example of how UI can be organized to work with async on backend (see richfaces livedemo "Ajax Support" Push/Pull examples)
