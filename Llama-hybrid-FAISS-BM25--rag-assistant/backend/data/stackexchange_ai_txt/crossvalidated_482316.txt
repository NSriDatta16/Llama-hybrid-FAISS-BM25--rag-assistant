Rounding up the comments that has value of an answer, several methods can be used here. 1. Trimmed mean (by @Bernhard) Calculates the average of data that lies between the 5th and 95th percentile effectively discarding the extreme values. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truncated_mean 2. Winsorized mean (by @kjetil b halvorsen) Sets the bottom 5% to 5th percentile, sets the top 5% to 95th percentile, then calculates the average of all that. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winsorizing 3. M-estimator (by @Michael M) I'm sorry I can't provide concise explanation. Better see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-estimator 4. E-M algorithm (by @Tim) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expectation%E2%80%93maximization_algorithm 5. Median (by @Tim) Median is less affected by outlier and is more robust than mean. Consider the set of numbers ${1, 2, 3, 4, 5}$ , with mean 3 and median 3. If I were to change 5 to 50, the mean changes to be 12, but the median stays 3. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median
