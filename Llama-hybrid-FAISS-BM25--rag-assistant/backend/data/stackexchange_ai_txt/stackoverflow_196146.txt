Generally, the C library handles the implementation of malloc , requesting memory from the OS (either via anonymous mmap or, in older systems, sbrk ) as necessary. So your kernel side of things should handle allocating whole pages via something like one of those means. Then it's up to malloc to dole out memory in a way that doesn't fragment the free memory too much. I'm not too au fait with the details of this, though; however, the term arena comes to mind. If I can hunt down a reference, I'll update this post.
