Suggestions for a computer vision teaching module in R

I'm teaching an undergrad seminar in machine learning. It's quite basic: kNN, tree-based models, neural nets, etc. For the last module I ask the students what they'd like to cover and they voted for a computer vision application. Any ideas? I've done eigenfaces before which was fun but I used the Olivetti faces data and it was a little dated.
