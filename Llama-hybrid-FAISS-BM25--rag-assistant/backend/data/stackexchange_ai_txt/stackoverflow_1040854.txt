Customizing Trac: remove standard footer

We use hosted Trac. It uses Genshi templates. I think we can submit our own site.html. We want to get rid of Trac standard footer. What is the most elegant way of doing that? I suspect that the answer is in some nice Genshi trick. I don't know Genshi nor Trac's additions to it. I tried couple of things on a hunch, none worked. I tried css #footer { visibility:hidden; } That is ok, unless you want to use your own footer (called "#sitefooter"). This one comes after "#footer", and hiding footer leaves an ugly white space. Then I tried jquery: jQuery(document).ready(function($) { $("#footer").text(''); }); This is fine yet I am not sure how wide support for jquery really is.
