You could use a "weighted random" ordering, such as: SELECT title, body FROM posts ORDER BY (score+1) * RAND() DESC LIMIT 5 The +1 is there to allow posts with 0 score to be selected. Depending on the average score of your post you may have to multiply the score by another constant factor (e.g. 0.5*score+1 ) . Depending on the distribution of your scores you may want to transform your score, for instance with LOG(score) or SQRT(score) .
