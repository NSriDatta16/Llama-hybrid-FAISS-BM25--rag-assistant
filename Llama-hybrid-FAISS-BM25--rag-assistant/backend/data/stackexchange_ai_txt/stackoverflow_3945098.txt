You should use magento catalog/product methods for this, not a raw sql query. so start at the Mage::getModel('catalog/product')->getCollection() and add joins until you get the data you want; the catalog_flat tables and any other table are only meant to use internally by magento. the flat tables are created by magento from the EAV schema performance purposes.
