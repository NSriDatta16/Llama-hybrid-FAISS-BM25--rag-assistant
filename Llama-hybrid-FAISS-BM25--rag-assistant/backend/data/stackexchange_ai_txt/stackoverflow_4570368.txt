Shipping address in Magento

I have created a website in Magento. When I place an order there are two options when inserting billing information. "Ship to this address" "Ship to different address" There, the second method is selected by default. I want to select the first method by default. Is there any method for this or do I have to make the adjustment in code. Please guide me.
