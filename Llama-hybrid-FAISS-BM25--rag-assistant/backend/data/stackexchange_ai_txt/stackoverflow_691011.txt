.NET Solution Setup Advice when considering updates

I've written a winforms application that is deployed as a setup/msi install. The main reasons for not using ClickOnce deployment are: Need persistent data storage in the directory of the app Need to be able to install for "all users" At the moment, the application uses "one .exe to rule them all". Essentially, the "program files" directory after installation has the .exe, a .ico, and a .config file. I'm trying to follow this advice/tutorial on MSDN so that I can have an update mechanism: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa367564.aspx I get the impression that having a single .exe isn't necessarily the best approach. I'm wondering if there's a "rule of thumb" when it comes to creating .dll libraries vs. putting my application classes in .cs files within the project? Can an update be as easy as replacing some .dll files rather than the .exe?
