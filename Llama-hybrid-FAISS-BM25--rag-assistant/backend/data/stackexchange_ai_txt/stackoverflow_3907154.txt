Qt allows you to provide a user agent based on the URL rather than a single user agent no matter what the URL is. The idea then is to return the user agent any time a new webpage is created: class UserAgentWebPage : public QWebPage { QString userAgentForUrl(const QUrl &url ) const { return QString("My User Agent"); } }; In order to use that page instead of the standard page that is created, you can set that page on the browser control object before making the request: yourWebView->setPage(new UserAgentWebPage(parent)); I would actually expect a factory to be present somewhere that will guarantee that the webpage created is always of a certain type, but I didn't see one. Yet another option should be to set the user agent header within the QNetworkRequest : QNetworkRequest request = new QNetworkRequest(); request->setRawHeader( QString("User-Agent").toAscii(), QString("Your User Agent").toAscii() ); // ... set the URL, etc. yourWebView->load(request); You would actually want to check whether it's toAscii() or toUtf8() or one of the other variants as I'm not sure exactly what the HTTP standard allows.
