Calling initialize when loading an object serialized with YAML

Is it possible to force Ruby to call an initialize method when using YAML.load_file? I want to call the method in order to provide values for instance variables I do not serialize. I know I can factor the code into a separate method and call that method after calling YAML.load_file, but I was wondering if there was a more elegant way to handle this issue.
