You might want to consider SWFObject - it makes embedding Flash and doing dynamic things with it like resizing a lot simpler. Their docs also explain how best to fill the whole browser window , and there is a good example here of dynamic resizing .

If possible, try setting wmode="opaque" on the banner, this will make it respect z-indexes and other styling.
