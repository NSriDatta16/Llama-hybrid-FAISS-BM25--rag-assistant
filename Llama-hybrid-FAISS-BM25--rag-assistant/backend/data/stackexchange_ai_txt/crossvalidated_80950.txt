What you're talking about is a "Vector Space Model" of information retrieval. Wikipedia lists some programs which help with this - the one I'm most familiar with is Lucene. This page describes their algorithm. The major points are that 1) you can invert your index, 2) you can look through indices in parallel and 3) you can limit to just the top $k$. All of these things give you a pretty nice speedup.
