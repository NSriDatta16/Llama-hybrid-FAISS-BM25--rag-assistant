Although there aren't duplicates as such, you can have multiple addresses for a single customer ID - this is what appears to be happening in the example, as a single purchase (1535) is returning multiple billing addresses (both 123 Park Avenue and 500 North Michigan Avenue). Normally, a customer could have many billing addresses (over time), although there is normally only one billing address per transaction. I therefore suggest adding a BillAddrID field to arrc_PurchaseActivity (if it doesn't already have one), and changing the linkage to jos_customers_addresses alias a1 to be p.BillAddrID = a2.id . Alternatively, you may want (or already have) only one billing address per customer, in which case you should add a billing address ID field to your customer table (users, in the question), and then change the query to link from the purchase table to the customer table, and then from the customer's billing address ID to the address table, to return a single billing address for the transaction. EDIT, following comments: The following query should resolve the issue of multiple addresses being returned on the billing alias: SELECT p.PurchActvtyID, a1.name AS billName, a1.address1 AS billAddress1, a2.name AS shipName, a2.address1 AS shipAddress1 FROM arrc_PurchaseActivity p LEFT OUTER JOIN jos_customers_addresses a1 ON p.AcctID = a1.customer_id and a1.billing = 1 LEFT OUTER JOIN jos_customers_addresses a2 ON p.ShipAddrID = a2.id ORDER BY p.PurchActvtyID ASC
