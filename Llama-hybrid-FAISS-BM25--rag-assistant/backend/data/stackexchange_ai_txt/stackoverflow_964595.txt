I generally prefer to call the parameter @account_category_code and make it a CHAR(3), if there are only a few enum values and they can all be expressed cleanly with three letters. Then the domain is enforced with a check constraint. If there are more than a handful of values (more than around 4 or 5) then I would generally switch to a tinyint/smallint called @account_category_type_id and have a domain table to reference for it. We don't have a hard and fast rule in my organization, but I find this works well.
