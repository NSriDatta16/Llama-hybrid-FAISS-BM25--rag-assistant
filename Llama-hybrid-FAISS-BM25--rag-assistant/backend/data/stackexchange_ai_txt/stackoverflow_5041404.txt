HREF being modified beyond my control...?

I'm not sure if this is a jquery, javascript or simply a quirk in the browser but consider this code: for(rowIdx=0;rowIdx The goal of the code above is to clone a list item ( , embedded below) HTML fragment, modify it to address an anchor elsewhere on the page and then insert it into an unordered list ( ). All that works using the wonders of jquery. The problem is that once it's been modified, the anchor doesn't seem to work. Moreover after I mod the HREF programattically, it returns a full URL, not just an anchor reference. Example: EXERCISELABEL EXERCISENAME So, two things are happening. One, the modified anchor is simply not working and two, what should modify from " href='#pageExercise_EXERCISENUMBER' " to " href='#pageExercise_0' " (or whatever the current row index ('rowIdx') is modifies it to: " href='http://www.mydomain.com/themainpage.php#pageExercise_0' ". I need a way to tell javascript to stop "helping" me on the href. As for issue #1, I think it's related to #2. Thanks in advance, Scott.
