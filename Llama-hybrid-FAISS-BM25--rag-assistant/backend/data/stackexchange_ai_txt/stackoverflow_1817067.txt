You'll probably need to give more information as your question is rather vague. Based on what you posted, however, I have two comments: First, the question you asked. Why not use C arrays and ints, rather than (what appear to be) dictionaries? It's much faster. Second, you're creating autoreleased NSNumber instances (+numberWithInt: gives you an autoreleased number), then over-releasing them with your calls to -release. Things that need clarification for a better, more specific answer: What is BoxCache and how does it work? Where is the computation you mentioned in your first paragraph? What is "cache", where does it come from, and how does it work?
