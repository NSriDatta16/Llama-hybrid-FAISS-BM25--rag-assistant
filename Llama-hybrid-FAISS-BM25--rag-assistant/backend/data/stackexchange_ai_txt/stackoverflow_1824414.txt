Activate based on User Agent

I need to activate a "div" based on the user agent string. For example, (and this is my actual use for this,) A user with Firefox comes to my site. I want to tell them something along the lines of "Welcome Firefox User! Thank you for supporting Open Source Software, etc;". That message is inside a Div. I would like to just show it for firefox users. It has to be compatible with most modern (mainstream) browsers. I am using PHP. Thank you in advance. Artur
