I think that you are looking at this the wrong way. Red is often chosen for several reasons. It is (in western culture among others) commonly used to depict that something is wrong or danger. But red is also a colour that usually stands out. However, when trying to direct a users attention to something on the page, there are two infallible methods. 1) Animated gifs or videos (annoying as f***) or 2) Clashing colours Usually red stands out, but in your situation where a user may have a red themed style, your best bet is to go with a colour that will clash. It is possible to have clashing colours that go together (if that makes sense). Here are a few websites that I have used in the past to help me find colour schemes that may help you as well: Kuler , Color Combos and Color scheme designer This may not have been the answer you were looking for but i hope it helps
