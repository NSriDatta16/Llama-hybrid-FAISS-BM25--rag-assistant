In case you're storing really a lot of elements in listDataArray, you might want to consider replacing the convenience constructor [NSURL URLWithString:...] by an explicit memory allocation with subsequent deallocation. Something along the lines of NSURL* URL = [[NSURL alloc] initWithString:...]; rld.URL = URL; [URL release]; The convenience constructor returns an auto-released object and the use of auto-released objects is discouraged in situations where many objects are created.
