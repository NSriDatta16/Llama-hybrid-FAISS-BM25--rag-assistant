You can find the module on CPAN . To install it on strawberry perl interactively, do perl -MCPAN -e shell install Spreadsheet::WriteExcel or (non-interactive) cpan Spreadsheet::WriteExcel Edit: If you get any errors about unfulfilled dependencies (missing modules like OLE::Storage_Lite ), install these dependencies using cpan and then continue installation of your package. If you don't need to stick on Strawberry Perl, you could switch over to ActiveState Perl which comes with an integrated package manager (PPM) that installs the required modules (including dependencies). ActiveState provides a repository with pre-built modules, so they don't need to be compiled. Is @INC really empty? If so, you have to set @INC in order to specify the include directories for perl to search for modules. Furthermore, I'd expect that the error message would read can't locate Spreadsheet::WriteExcel.pm ... if you specified the dependency correctly with use Spreadsheet::WriteExcel; .
