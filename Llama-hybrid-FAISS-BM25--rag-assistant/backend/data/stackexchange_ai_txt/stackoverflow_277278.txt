You typically use the User-Agent header to detect the browser. Here's JavaScript code that does basically that (only for mainstream browsers though, you'd have to add the Mobile User-Agents) http://www.quirksmode.org/js/detect.html And here's a list of mobile browser identifiers http://www.zytrax.com/tech/web/mobile_ids.html The list is not complete and will never be, given the rate new mobiles appear on the market, but what I did back when I did it is to store all received user agents in a database, and then look for them to classify them as mobile and which brand/model. What you can't rely on though is JavaScript, it's better done in server code (not all mobile browsers execute JavaScript). There is a related question here on SO but I couldn't find it.
