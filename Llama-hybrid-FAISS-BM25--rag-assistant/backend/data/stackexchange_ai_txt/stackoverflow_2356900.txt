There are two ways to address your issue: Connection pooling Pass the work off to a background process Honestly, there's almost never a reason to send email directly from a PHP web request -- email isn't guaranteed to be low latency anyway, so if it takes a little longer to send email in the background, it's not a big deal. As such, the best and simplest approach is simply to store the email to fast, local storage (maybe a job queue like beanstalkd), and then have a completely separate process checking that queue for work, and handling the task of the actual SMTP request. That long-running script can even hold a single SMTP connection open, if you please.
