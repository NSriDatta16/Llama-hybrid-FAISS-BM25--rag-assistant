A player's yardage is unlikely to be anywhere near normally distributed. If it were, your guy averaging 5.3 give or take 1.7 yards would almost never lose yards or gain more than 11 yards on any play in the entire season. Gone is the excitement of the game, to be replaced by some statistical mediocrity. If football were played like this, a team's chances of making a set of downs would be almost certain; there would almost never be a loss of downs; and the game would simply be determined by who won the initial coin flip and got on the field first. Why not just draw a value at random from a list of the player's recent gains (and losses)? It's fairly easy to program: you just have to generate a uniformly distributed integer to index into an array of the gains. It doesn't require any kind of statistical model--no need to fit anything. It can account for change in the player's ability over time (just by selecting which time period you will use to draw the data from). And it's obviously driven by "real-live data."
