How to solve for conditional expectations with binary random variables?

Suppose you have a binary random variable X with a probability of 50% 1, and a probability of 50% 0. Another random variable Y has the conditional expectation E[Y|X]=5. Another random variable W=XY-X. Is the binary random variable X counted as .5 or 1/2 in the equation because that is the average value? So W=(.5)*5-(.5)? Also, is E[W|X]=2?
