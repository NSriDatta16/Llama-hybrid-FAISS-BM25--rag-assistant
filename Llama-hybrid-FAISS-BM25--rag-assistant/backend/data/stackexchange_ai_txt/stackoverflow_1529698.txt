If you are using an IoC container or some mocking framework or NHibernate, then having an interface for just about everything can be really beneficial. Also, the use of interfaces encourages a loosely coupled and generally better maintainable style of software development. But if it's not appropriate/required in a concrete situation, you easily can go overboard with duplicated inheritance hierarchies. You have to ask yourself this question for every single project: Does the use of an interface over a simple class add value or is it likely to provide value somewhere in the foreseeable future. If you're not sure, don't use interfaces - they can be easily extracted afterwards with modern refactoring tools, if this should become necessary.
