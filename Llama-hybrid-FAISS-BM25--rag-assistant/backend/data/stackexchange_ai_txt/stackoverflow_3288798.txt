The best way to do that simply is to get your data in your php code, and then "write" the javascript code to generate the array in php. A short example would be : echo "a = new Array();"; foreach($row in $results) { echo "a[$row[0]] = $row[1];"; } My code could be quite incorrect, it's juste to give you a quick example. You could also do that in a more elegant way, using json.
