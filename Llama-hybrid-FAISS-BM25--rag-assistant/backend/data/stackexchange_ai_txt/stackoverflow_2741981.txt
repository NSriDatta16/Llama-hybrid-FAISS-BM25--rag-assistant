That can be everything . You need to look a bit further in the stacktrace, peek to the caused by or root cause part and the trace which comes thereafter. It can be caused by many things. The JSP basically get compiled into one large try block and any catched Throwable will be wrapped into a servletcontainer specific exception like JasperException in Tomcat and clones. It boils down to this: try { // All translated JSP code comes here. Max 64K. } catch (Throwable t) { throw new JasperException(t); } Check the .java filename in the 1st line of the stacktrace, locate this in the work directory of the servletcontainer and open the file in an editor. Do you see it? That said, using scriptlets is a bad practice . Use Servlets to control/preprocess/postprocess requests, use Javabeans to represent data models, use Taglibs in JSP to control the page flow and output, use Expression Language (EL) in JSP to access backend data. In your specific case, you can loop over an array or List using JSTL's c:forEach tag. Agent: ${agent.name}
