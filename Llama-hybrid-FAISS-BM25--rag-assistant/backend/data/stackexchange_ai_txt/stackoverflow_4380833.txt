oracle metrics monitoring and reporting in real time

I am stress testing a database table I am looking for any software that can connect to my database and show me some metrics like no of rows in a table, time for inserts , inserts/time, table fragmentation[logical/physical] etc . It would be great if the reporting tool can do the following: 1] Report in real time or atleast after some interval so that I do not have to wait for test to finish to get first look at the data 2] Ability to do stuff with the data later, like get 99.99 percentile, avg etc. Is mostly freely available :) Does anyone have any suggestion of something I can use with my Oracle table. Any pointers would be great. I can actually write scripts to logg stuff like select count(*) etc .. but then I will have to spend a lot of time parsing and changing the data reporting rather than the tests. I think some intelligent thing might already be out there ?? Thanks Edit: I am looking at a piece of design for a new architecture The tests are "comparison" tests for different designs and hence as far as I do it on same hardware and same schema etc they are comparable to some granularity. I want to monitor index fragmentation, and response times etc. If you think there are other things that can change please let me know. I am trying to roll back the table to particular state[basically truncate] for each new iteration of the test
