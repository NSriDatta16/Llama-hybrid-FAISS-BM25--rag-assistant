You could use a Blocking Queue (a collection whose size you can bound and will block on storage if there's no space) to store running processes, deleting processes from the queue when they're no longer in use. Keep the waiting processes in a pool or a queue and inject them into the (running) queue with a separate thread as space becomes available.
