Javascript Pseudoclass handling in php

I am working with javascript pseudoclasses in the sense of: class Foo ---->getName() ---->setName() ---->.... So i can have collections of them to operate with in client calculations. But, there is some way to handle them "as is" in php? in other words, pass it like an object where I could do a call to getName, for example. Thanks in advance, Ragnagard :D
