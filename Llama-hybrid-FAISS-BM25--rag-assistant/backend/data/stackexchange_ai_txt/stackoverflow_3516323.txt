Passing a javascript variable to Ruby in a combo box nav

Updated Example I am using a Select Box as a nav. When I select an item, I would like to be redirected to that page. = select (@organization, "tabs", @organization.tabs.collect { |t| t.title }, {} { :onchange => "escape_javascript(#{ render edit_organization_tab_path(@organization, this.value)})"} ) So this example does not work because I am not sure how to pass a Javascript variable to Ruby Is it possible to do this entirely in Ruby? Or do I have to use jQuery?
