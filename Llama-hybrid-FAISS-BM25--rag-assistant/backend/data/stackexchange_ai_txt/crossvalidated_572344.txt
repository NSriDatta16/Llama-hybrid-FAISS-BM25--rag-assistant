Ranking probabilities of logistic regression models M1 and M2 taking confidence intervals in account

I have two models M1 and M2 and each models the probability of having cancer with logistic regression. M1 is based on independent variables IV1 measured on a given sample of individuals and M2 is based on another set of independent variables IV2 measured on another sample of individuals. Suppose now I want to rank all the individuals by the descending probability of having cancer. What could be a good method that takes into account the confidence intervals of each probability outputted by M1 or M2? Intuitively I tend to think that I should rank higher an individual that has a probability of 0.39 with a small CI than another that has 0.40 with a very large CI but I don't know how to make this intuitive idea operational and objective.
