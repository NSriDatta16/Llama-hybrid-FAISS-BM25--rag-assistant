Drag and drop between two user controls

I have a user control which has a TreeView control in it as flowing... I am using this usercontrol from my main window as flowing.... I am trying to draging a leaf Node from 'srcDevices' and droping on a leaf Node of 'destDevices' using DragDrop.DoDragDrop. Draging is initiating but no dragdrop event is firing (i.e. DragEnter/DragLeave/DragOver/Drop). How I can fix this problem? Saquia
