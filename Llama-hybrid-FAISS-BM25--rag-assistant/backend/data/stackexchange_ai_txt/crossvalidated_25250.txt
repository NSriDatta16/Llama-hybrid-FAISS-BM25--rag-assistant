Are there popular dimensionality reduction tools for classification type supervised learning?

I am familiar with PCA as a linear transformation in order to align the axis of the IV space with the directions of maximal variance in order to possibly be able to reduce the dimensionality of the problem. Are there similar techniques (or can one use PCA itself) when facing a binary classification problem? Like a logistic regression? I.E. Suppose we have a dependent variable we want to predict which only takes values 0 and 1 and we have a lot of features from which to predict, but maybe there are "principal components" in the high dimensional feature space which carry the most explanatory power.
