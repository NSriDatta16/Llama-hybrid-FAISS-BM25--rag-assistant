Convolutional neural network fast fourier transform

I've read that some convolution implementations use FFT to calculate the output feature/activation maps and I'm wondering how they're related. I'm familiar with applying CNNs, and (mildly) familiar with the use of FFT in signal processing, but I'm not sure how the 2 work together When I think of convolutions, I imagine taking a kernel, flipping it, multiplying (and adding) the elements of the kernel with the overlapping input, shifting the kernel and repeating the process. How does a FFT fit into this process?
