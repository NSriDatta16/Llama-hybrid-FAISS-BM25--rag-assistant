Macro- or micro-average for imbalanced class problems

The question of whether to use macro- or micro-averages when the data is imbalanced comes up all the time. Some googling shows that many bloggers tend to say that micro-average is the preferred way to go, e.g.: Micro-average is preferable if there is a class imbalance problem. On the other hand, micro-average can be a useful measure when your dataset varies in size. A similar question in this forum suggests a similar answer. However, this seems quite counter-intuitive. For example if we have a data set with 90%-10% class distribution then a baseline classifier can achieve 90% mico-averaged accuracy by assigning the majority class label. This is corroborated by books, e.g. An Introduction to Information Retrieval says (page 282) "Microaveraged results are therefore really a measure of effectiveness on the large classes in a test collection. To get a sense of effectiveness on small classes, you should compute macroaveraged results." In the end the real decision about which measure to use should be based on the relative mis-classification costs for the classes. But a quick look at the internet seems to suggest use of micro-averaging. Is this correct or misleading?
