How to include clj-time and clojure.contrib under clojure 1.2?

I tried to migrate a project from clojure 1.1 to 1.2 because of the new protocols introduced in 1.2. But when I try to :use clojure-contrib.duck-streams I get a warning about 'spit' which already exists in clojure.core. The same problem with clj-time.core and 'extend' which also exists in clojure.core. Can anyone explain what would be the most elegant way around these stupid errors? BTW: from my project.clj : :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.2.0"] [org.clojure/clojure-contrib "1.2.0"] [clojure-csv/clojure-csv "1.1.0"] [org.shxiao/clojureql "1.0.0"] [clj-time "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]]
