It is true in general that statistical quantities pertaining to a single individual have more variance than those that average over a larger group subsuming that individual. This holds for any set of quantities that are not perfectly positively correlated. In this sense, it is reasonable to say that statistics predicts individual outcomes much less well than aggregate outcomes for larger groups. It is an exaggeration to say that statistics "means nothing" to the individual, but it does predict individual outcomes with less accuracy than aggregate outcomes over larger groups.
