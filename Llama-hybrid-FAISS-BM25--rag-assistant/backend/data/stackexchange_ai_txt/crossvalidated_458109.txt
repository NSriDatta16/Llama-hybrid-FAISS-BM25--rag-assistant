When I mentioned the graph of Fourier coefficients, I meant a graph where you have the harmonic on the x-axis and the coefficient (real and imaginary, or--better--amplitude and phase) on the y-axis. Never mind, I'll make some guesses based on what you've provided and try to give a meaningful answer. From your figures it looks like the current is trailing the voltage by a more-or-less constant time delay (is it some kind of an inductive circuit?). If the time delay were perfectly constant, your curve would be an ellipse. If it were exactly 1/4 of the period, the curve would be a circle. In the frequency domain, that means that the spectra of your voltage and current are shifted by an angle $\varphi$ relative to each other. If you represent your complex coefficients in polar notation: $$ Z_n = A_n \cdot e^{i \varphi_n} $$ then you can model the noise separately for the amplitude ( $A$ ) and phase ( $\varphi$ ). In the first approximation, both noises can be probably well modelled as Gaussian. If you want to be more exact, the amplitude noise is maybe better modelled as log-normal (since the amplitude cannot be von Mises distribution . Now, in contrast to ordinary time series, where you'd probably assume constant variance over time (your "independent variable"), this assumption seems to be severely violated in the frequency domain. It looks like your noise is much more pronounced in the 3rd and the 7th harmonic than in the remaining ones. If you have enough data, you can try to model the noise for each harmonic separately. If, not, try modelling it only for the 7th harmonic (the one with the largest variance.
