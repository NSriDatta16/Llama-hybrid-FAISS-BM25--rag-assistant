Is it [a] correct assumption that no single server will hold that amount of load so it must scale horizontally? Yes. It depends on how much work the server has to do per person, but I'd say 1 million concurrent users would require more than one server. Will Windows Azure do the job? Windows Azure will provide the computers and the storage for a fee. You have to provide the software and make sure the software can scale horizontally.
