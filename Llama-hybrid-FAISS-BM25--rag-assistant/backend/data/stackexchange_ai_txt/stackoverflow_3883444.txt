Silverlight 4's drag and drop feature was targeted at a single scenario: dragging a file from your computer onto a Silverlight application. Anything beyond that at you need to use the Toolkit's DragDropTarget controls. The description of the drag/drop feature from Tim Heuer: http://timheuer.com/blog/archive/2009/11/18/whats-new-in-silverlight-4-complete-guide-new-features.aspx For some scenarios, you may have wanted to be able to drag a file from your desktop or file explorer on to your Silverlight application. By enabling the AllowDrop attribute on UIElement in this release, you can now accommodate those scenarios. In other words, they did not plan on giving you the ability to actually create your own drag operations in code. Most, if not all, of the "Limitations" section from this URL still apply to SL4 RTW: http://www.ningzhang.org/2009/11/28/silverlight-drag-and-drop-api/ there is no drop source support (QueryContinueDrag & GiveFeedback). there is no DragDropEffects or DragDropKeyStates in DragEventArgs. there is no visual for the dragged object or DragDropEffects. only file drag and drop is supported: all drop target events fire only when files are being dragged and dropped. IDataObject, DataObject and DragEventArgs.Data support only one format: “FileDrop”, and the data is of type FileInfo[]. most of IDataObject methods throw NotImplementedException.
