I've actually figure this one out. Steve's answer colours the editor part and the drop down part as well. You need to apply other Appearance properties as well. // This is a copy from Steve's answer // Directly via the BackColor property ultraCalendarCombo1.BackColor = Color.Blue; // Using an Appearance object ultraCalendarCombo1.Appearance = new Infragistics.Win.Appearance { BackColor = Color.Blue }; // Now we set the drop down part to a different colour (Let's say white) ultraCalendarCombo1.DropDownApperance = new Infragistics.Win.Appearance { BackColor = Color.White }; I believe you can do it by creating .isl (Infragistics Style Library) files but I wasn't quite sure how to swap these in and out programmatically.
