What are these threads which are spwaned when a Java application begins its execution?

I have created a simple Java application which has a JFrame and few JButtons. When I tried to inspect the java application using JVMTI I found that though I did not create any explicit threads there were lot of them spawned. I could find the following threads: DestroyJavaVM AWT-EventQueue-0 AWT-Shutdown AWT-XAWT- Daemon Thread Java2D Disposer- Daemon Thread Thread-0- Daemon Thread [Created by the JVMTI Agent] Signal Dispatcher- Daemon Thread Finalize- Daemon Thread Reference Handler- Daemon Thread Most of them were in Runnable state. Can someone tell me the function of these threads?
