This is totally confused. First, a better link for the cited paper is https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c60b/2f66cddfc9ce871318ab17b2d619467815fc.pdf There, the author argues against some of his critics which have argued (really!) that computing a correlation is a "type error". That is wrong, and the paper argues clearly why. Calculating the mean of oil price in dollars/barrel and wheat price in euros/ton is meaningless, we cannot sum (or average) measurements with different units. But we can correlate them, correlation is unitless. Details in linked paper.
