Time Series (White Noise) Question

Suppose {$W_t$} and {$Y_t$} are two independent normal white noise series with $Var(W_t)=2Var(Y_t)=4$. Let $X_t = W_t-0.5W_{t-1}$ and $Z_t=Y_t+0.4Y_{t-1}-0.4Y_{t-2}$. Put $V_t=X_t-Z_t$. Find the $Cov(V_t,V_{t-k})$, $k=0,1,2,3,..$ So I tried doing this: $Cov(V_t,V_{t-1})$=$E[(W_t-0.5W_{t-1}-Y_t-0.4Y_{t-1}+0.4Y_{t-2})(W_{t-1}-0.5W_{t-2}-Y_{t-1}-0.4Y_{t-2}+0.4Y_{t-3})]$ k is time lag For k=0, $Cov(V_t,V_{t-k})$=1 For k=1, $Cov(V_t,V_{t-k})$=-4.8 For k=2, $Cov(V_t,V_{t-k})$=-0.8 For k>2, $Cov(V_t,V_{t-k})$=0 Is this correct? Any help/contribution will be greatly appreciated. Thank you.
