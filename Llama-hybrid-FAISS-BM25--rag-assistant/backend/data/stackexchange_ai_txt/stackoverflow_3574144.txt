Try setting android:exported="false" to all activities defined at AndroidManifest.xml That's from activity element description: android:exported Whether or not the activity can be launched by components of other applications â€” "true" if it can be, and "false" if not. If "false", the activity can be launched only by components of the same application or applications with the same user ID. The default value depends on whether the activity contains intent filters. The absence of any filters means that the activity can be invoked only by specifying its exact class name. This implies that the activity is intended only for application-internal use (since others would not know the class name). So in this case, the default value is "false". On the other hand, the presence of at least one filter implies that the activity is intended for external use, so the default value is "true". This attribute is not the only way to limit an activity's exposure to other applications. You can also use a permission to limit the external entities that can invoke the activity (see the permission attribute). Also here are good paragraphs about application permissions https://developer.android.com/training/articles/security-tips.html I guess you can use that to restrict access to your app.
