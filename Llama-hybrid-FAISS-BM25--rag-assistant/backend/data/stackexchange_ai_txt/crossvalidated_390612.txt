Unless you have a compelling reason to prefer probit (*), I would reach for a logistic regression in this situation. This will estimate the conditional probability that an auction is successful, given the explanatory variables you have measured: $$ P(\text{Auction is Successful} \mid X) $$ In general, regression models do not make strong assumptions on the explanatory variables themselves, certainly not that they are independent or even uncorrelated. Strong correlation between variables does make it more difficult to interpret the results of the models, as the effect of two strongly correlated variables on the conditional probability that the auction is a success are hard to disentangle, but this is not a statistical assumption, instead a constraint on the scientific interpretability of the results. It is much more important to capture accurately the relationships between the independent variables and the target, and for this tools such as splines are useful. (*) There may be such compelling reasons, but I do not know of them in practice. Logistic regression differ only very slightly in results from logistic regressions, and there is much better technological support (both computational and mathematical) available for logistic regression.
