I was able to figure out the answer with the help of the folks at Mathematics Stack Exchange. Consider the random vector $[X_{sum}$, $Y_{sum}]^\top$. Since this vector is the sum of $n$ i.i.d. random vectors, the multidimensional CLT applies and we can ensure that $$\sqrt{n} \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{n} X_{sum} - \mathbb{E} X \\ \frac{1}{n} Y_{sum} - \mathbb{E} Y \end{bmatrix} \overset{\mathcal{D}}{\rightarrow} \mathcal{N}_2(0,\Sigma)$$ where the covariance matrix $\Sigma$ is: $$\Sigma=\begin{bmatrix}\text{Var}(X) & \text{Cov}(X,Y) \\ \text{Cov}(X,Y) & \text{Var}(Y)\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}\text{Var}(X) & 0 \\ 0 & \text{Var}(Y)\end{bmatrix}$$ since $X$ and $Y$ are uncorrelated. So we have a bivariate normal with diagonal corvariance , and because of this its two variables have no option but to be independent [1]. Also note that we are interested in $[X_{sum}$, $Y_{sum}]^\top$; but this is the same as the above vector multiplied by a constant and translated, so the independence of the variables that form it is not affected.
