I would say your question is a qualified question not only in cross validated but also in stack overflow , where you will be told how to implement dimension reduction in R(..etc.) to effectively help you identify which column/variable contribute the better to the variance of the whole dataset. The PCA(Principal Component Analysis) has the same functionality as SVD(Singular Value Decomposition), and they are actually the exact same process after applying scale /the z-transformation to the dataset. Here are some resources that you can go through in half an hour to get much better understanding. I am not capable to give a vivid coding solution to help you understand how to implement svd and what each component does, but people are awesome, here are some very informative posts that I used to catch up with the application side of SVD even if I know how to hand calculate a 3by3 SVD problem.. :) Coursera Data Analysis Class by Jeff Leek: Video Lecture / Class Notes A Very Informative student post A post from American Mathematical Society.
