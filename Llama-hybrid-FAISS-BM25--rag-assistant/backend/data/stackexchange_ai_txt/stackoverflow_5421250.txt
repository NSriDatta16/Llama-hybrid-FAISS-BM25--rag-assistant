Is it possible - clear input field on focus with CakePHP (as opposed to just writing some js)

I realize this seems like an obvious JS type thing - but I'm new to CakePHP, and just wondering if there's some elegant solution to clearing a text input when clicking on it.... like maybe an attribute for the field's array 'clearOnFocus'=>'true' or something?
