This question is very subjective, there's things you can do or can not do, depending on the already existing data / framework around it. The solution you've provided should work, but it depends on the unique combat/loot/user data you have available. I take it this is what you think is best? It's what I think is best :) Get the userID, along with a unique piece of data from that fight. Something like combat start time, combat end time, etc Store it in a Database, or what ever storage system you have Once you collect the loot, delete that record That way if the that userID, and that unique fight data exists, they haven't got their loot. And you are right; tracking each piece of loot is too much, you're better off temporarily storing the data.
