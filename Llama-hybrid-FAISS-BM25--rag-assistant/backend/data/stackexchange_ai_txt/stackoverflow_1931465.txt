You can use the WMI library by Magenta Systems which takes most of the pain of using WMI queries. The free download includes source and an example project that allows you to play with the API and queries to your hearts content. You will want to keep a link to the official Microsoft API documentation which will help you with what query to execute to get what information...your interested in querying the classes using SQL like syntax queries. For example, executing the query SELECT * FROM Win32_DiskDrive Where InterfaceType = 'USB' returns a wealth of information about all of the USB devices currently connected to the machine. You can then use the PNPDeviceID as a unique identifier. EDIT checking the only USB device I had handy returned a hardware serial number of "u" but a very long and valid looking PNPDeviceID which appeared to include a serial number, which is why I suggested that field. EDIT You can get the drive letter by performing a query against Win32_LogicalDisk you can also query Win32_DiskDriveToDiskPartition which contains a mapping between Win32_DiskDrive and Win32_DiskPartition . Finally Win32_LogicalDiskToPartition then maps a logical disk to a partition which in turn gives you the ability to link a physical USB drive to a specific drive letter.
