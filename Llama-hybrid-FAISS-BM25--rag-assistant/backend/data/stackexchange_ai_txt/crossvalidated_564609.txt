Correspondence analysis is a multivariate technique that does not (as with PCA, principal component analysis) bother about target or predictor variables, but treats all variables symmetrically. But you have 20 binary variables, which, as you say, makes for a lot of ( $20\cdot 19/2$ ) contingency tables. Correspondence analysis (CA) is for a single contingency table, so you are really asking about Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA). There are functions for both in R, in many different packages! But you seem to want to give special prominence to your target variable, so only some version of MCA for only the 19 contingency tables involving that. Such an analysis ought to be possible, but I doubt you will find a specific R function for it. What you really should do is tell us more about your problem and data (as an edit to your post, not only as comments!) and then maybe we can give some more useful answer. But there are many variants of correspondence analysis, and maybe some will serve you. This paper by Michael Greenacre seems to be interesting and may be of help!
