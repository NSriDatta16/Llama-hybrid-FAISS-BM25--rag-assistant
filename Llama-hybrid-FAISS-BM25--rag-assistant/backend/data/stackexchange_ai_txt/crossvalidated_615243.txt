Weighting linear / logistic regression data points by explanatory variable sample size

[EDIT: had fundamental misunderstanding, rephrasing question - thanks to @whuber for catching that] I have some pretty simple regressions (linear & logistic) predicting a rate (continuous response var, linear regression) & direction (binary response var, logistic regression) from certain features of the distribution of some measured value. The distribution features are the predictor/explanatory variables. The measured values are from a sample taken every day, but with different (and quite widely varying) sample sizes on different days, from dozens to thousands (total sample size of ~300k, average ~400/day). The theory is that a combination of features of the distribution each day (e.g. mean, s.d., skew, possibly quantiles) will relate to the relevant rate / direction on that day, so e.g. rate ~ mean_x + skew_x . Note that the rate / direction are not calculated from the same sample as the explanatory variables - they are observed separately on each day. Given the range in sample sizes for each day, it seems there should be some way to weight the datapoints based on the sample size for the explanatory variables that day. I thought weighted regression based on sample sizes (similar to this previous question and this post ) was appropriate but it seems that's based on sample size of response variables, not explanatory variables, which is the reverse of what I have. My revised question is thus: Is it appropriate to include some weighting of datapoints to reflect the differing sample sizes from which the explanatory variables for each datapoint are calculated? and if so, how?
