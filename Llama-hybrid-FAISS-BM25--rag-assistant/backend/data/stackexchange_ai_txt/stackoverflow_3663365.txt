GridView tutorial: insufficient storage issue

I'm was trying with GridView tutorial with 14 of my own JPEGs. The first time I ran it worked but had an issue when I clicked on an image. I figured it might be because I left and extra comma at the end of my mThumbIds list. But when I tried to run again I get: [2010-09-07 15:59:36 - HelloGridView] Installing HelloGridView.apk... [2010-09-07 15:59:44 - HelloGridView] Installation error: INSTALL_FAILED_INSUFFICIENT_STORAGE [2010-09-07 15:59:44 - HelloGridView] Please check logcat output for more details. These files do not take up much space (~20Mb). I restarted the AVD but keep getting the same issue. (Not sure what "logcat" refers to but Error Log had nothing.) Can anyone tell me what is going on and how to fix this?
