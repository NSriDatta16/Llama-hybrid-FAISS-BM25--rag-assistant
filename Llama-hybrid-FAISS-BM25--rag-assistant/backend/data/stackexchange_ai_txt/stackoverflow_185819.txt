Just for the sake of completeness, I invite you to think about it like this: There are lots of block elements (linebreaks before and after) defined in HTML, and lots of inline tags (no linebreaks). But in modern HTML all elements are supposed to have meanings : a is a paragraph, an is a list item, etc., and we're supposed to use the right tag for the right purpose -- not like in the old days when we indented using whether the content was a quote or not. So, what do you do when there is no meaning to the thing you're trying to do? There's no meaning to a 400px-wide column, is there? You just want your column of text to be 400px wide because that suits your design. For this reason, they added two more elements to HTML: the generic, or meaningless elements and , because otherwise, people would go back to abusing the elements which do have meanings.
