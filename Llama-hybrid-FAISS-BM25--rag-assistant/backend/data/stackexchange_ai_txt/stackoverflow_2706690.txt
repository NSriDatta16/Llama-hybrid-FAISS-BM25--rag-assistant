Can't find my.cnf file so I can enable InnoDB - is there another way?

I am trying to Magento running on a share server, and am having difficulty. When I look at the engines in PHPmyAdmin, I get InnoDB DISABLED . So I look in /etc/, and there is no my.cnf file. There is a ftpquota and a .boxtrapper file, but nothing else. I know I can probably create a new one, but this is a server that hosts a lot of sites. I'm afraid I will mess someone up. So is there a way to maybe create a my.cnf file that only enable InnoDB and doesn't effect anything else? Or is there another way to enable it?
