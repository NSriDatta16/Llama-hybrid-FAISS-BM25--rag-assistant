There are two problems that arise from separation. First, you cannot estimate the slope of the relationship between the explanatory variables and the response (see the thread you linked). If you have some outside information you can use to constrain the possible slopes, or if you have a prior belief, you can use a Bayesian approach. (Firth logistic regression is a form of Bayesian logistic regression.) Similarly, you could use a regularization approach, say with a ridge penalty, if you had some sense of what value to use for lambda. All of these are a little tricky. Fortunately, you don't seem too concerned about estimating these relationships. The second problem is that the Wald tests won't work. This problem is simpler. There are three possible kinds of tests (Wald, likelihood ratio, and score tests, see here ); use one of the others. The score test is probably the best for this case. The chi-squared test is a score test, but it isn't for cases where you have two explanatory variables, as you do (or for continuous variables, which you don't have). So use your model, but get p-values for it based on one of the other tests. Here is an example, coded in R: d # parasite.pres parasite.abs location species # 169 0 1 species.1 # ... # 61 0 1 species.6 # 45 1 2 species.1 # ... # 124 32 2 species.6 m = glm(cbind(parasite.pres, parasite.abs)~location+species, d, family=binomial) summary(m) # ... # Coefficients: # Estimate Std.
