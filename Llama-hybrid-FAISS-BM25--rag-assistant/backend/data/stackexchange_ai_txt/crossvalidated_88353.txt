interpreting the coefficient on a logged independent variable from a probit model

I am using a double model with log transformed independent variables and have calculated average partial effects. Now I am now not sure how to interpret the coefficients; particularly those from the first stage which is supposed to be capturing the probability of participation using a probit model.
