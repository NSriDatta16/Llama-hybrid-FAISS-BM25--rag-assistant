What courses / subjects are most important to the field of Data Science?

I've taken it upon myself to begin a career change. I have a decent background in mathematics, but lack in programming or data science specific skills (such as data munging). I have been looking through data science curricula and already feel overwhelmed by the amount of subjects a proper data science curriculum contains. Just to name a few: natural language processing, machine learning, R, Python, SQL, NoSQL, probability, statistics, numerical methods, algorithms, and the list goes on. I can't afford to go back to school, but if my goal is to get into data science, what subjects should I focus my attention on ? I fully understand "data science" is a very big field, but certainly there must be several subjects that are important to all, if not the vast majority, of these sub-fields. I suppose this is essentially what my question is asking. I have not yet obtained the amount of exposure to determine what I want to specialize in, so at this point, my concern is obtaining a foundation that wouldn't restrict me from entering any particular sub-field, or in other words, studying the subjects that benefit all sub-fields. Note: Math isn't as much a concern for me compared to the other subjects.
