Set overflow: hidden; on the body tag like this: body { overflow: hidden; } The code above "hides" both the horizontal and vertical scrollbars. If you want to hide only the vertical scrollbar , use overflow-y : body { overflow-y: hidden; } And if you want to hide only the horizontal scrollbar , use overflow-x : body { overflow-x: hidden; } Content is clipped if necessary to fit the padding box. No scrollbars are provided, and no support for allowing the user to scroll (such as by dragging or using a scroll wheel) is allowed. The content can be scrolled programmatically (for example, by setting the value of a property such as offsetLeft ), so the element is still a scroll container . ( source )
