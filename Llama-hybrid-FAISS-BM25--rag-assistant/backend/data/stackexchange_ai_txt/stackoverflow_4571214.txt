gcc library confusion

I hav been spending some time these days going through gcc internals. I found the collection of libraries that gcc provides for support to our programs. What is the use of libgcc (The GCC runtime library.) I mean which are the most commonly used functions of that library?? :-/ And I found that there was a library libiberty . I found the library incorporates many of the commonly used functions(i mean the routines i use) including alloca , concat ,and calloc . But I couldnt find functions similar to theem like malloc and other string routines. So when we include or is it that the header file is linked with two different libraries?? My concepts arent good enogh. :( please help..
