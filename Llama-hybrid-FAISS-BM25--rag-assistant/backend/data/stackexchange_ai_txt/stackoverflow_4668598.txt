You've got three problems. You can't change the stylesheet based on the window size (without some fancy javascript). Safari for windows will still use the desktop.css file because it has the potential to scale larger. Changing your Useragent to Mobile Safari doesn't really do much. It is not a replacement for testing on a device. A useragent is simply an identification string, so you'd need some javascript to get that useragent and test if it's an iOS useragent and then pick the proper screen size. You might want to see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent . What about the retina display?
