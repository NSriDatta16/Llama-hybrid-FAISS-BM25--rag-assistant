I did some research on this very topic recently, as we had an issue with memory fragmentation. In the end we decided to stay with GNU libc's implementation, and add some application-level memory pools where necessary. There were other allocators which had better fragmentation behavior, but we weren't comfortable enough with them replace malloc globally. GNU's has the benefit of a long history behind it. In your case it seems justified; assuming you can't fix the VM, those tiny allocations are very wasteful. I don't know what your whole environment is, but you might consider wrapping the calls to malloc/realloc/free on just the VM so that you can pass it off to a handler designed for small pools.
