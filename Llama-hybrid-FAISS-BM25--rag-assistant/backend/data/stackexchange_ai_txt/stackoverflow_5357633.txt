RegEx Replace with Javascript

I'm struggling with an issue of Javascript RegEx replacement. What I need to do is run a replacement over a paragraph of text looking for "[card]lorem ipsum[/card]" I found jQuery plugins which allow for regex matching on selectors, such as ids or paragraphs containing text but I didn't find one which would get down to the actual regex text. So then I went back to the original javascript level of RegEx and kept running into walls. So can anyone help me? I need to turn [card]lorem ipsum[/card] into lorem ipsum Thanks!
