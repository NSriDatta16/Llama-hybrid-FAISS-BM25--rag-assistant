A classical method is NSB. It is a mature and efficient Bayesian method to estimate the entropy with a sample size around $2^{H/2}$ instead of $2^H$. There is a nice introductory text in this site: http://www.nowozin.net/sebastian/blog/estimating-discrete-entropy-part-3.html . There are a few comments by the inventor of NSB, that points out that NSB actually relies on counting the number of coincidences. More general cases of entropy estimation is covered in the answer to this very similar question : https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/604654/estimating-the-entropy
