How to organize libraries of utility functions?

I need to come up with a better way to manage my utility functions. Currently, functions are pasted from other projects into the solution where they are needed, as they are needed. Definitely not the way to go. It's a huge PITA! Especially painful when these functions change over time due to a variety of reasons. I'm think I want to create a project "GenFunc" and place all my general purpose utilities in that project. Then when I need to use the functions, reference the output of GenFunc from my other projects. This would require me to be disciplined and make an effort to create all general functions in GenFunc but it would save me from copying and pasting code all the time. What are the drawbacks of my proposed function class? I imagine having multiple libraries - math, string manipulation, data stuff, engineering stuff, etc. How do you handle this situation? We all have utility libraries that are not dev project specific, right?
