This short remark is far from complete answer, just some suggestions: if you have two periods of time where the behaviour is different, by different I mean either differences in model parameters (not relevant in this particular situation), mean or variance or any other expected characteristic of time-series object ($x_t$ in your case), you can try any methods that do estimate the time (interval) of structural (or epidemic) change . In R there is a strucchange library for structural changes in linear regression models. Though it is primarily used for testing and monitoring changes in linear regression's parameters, some statistics could be used for general structural changes in time series.
