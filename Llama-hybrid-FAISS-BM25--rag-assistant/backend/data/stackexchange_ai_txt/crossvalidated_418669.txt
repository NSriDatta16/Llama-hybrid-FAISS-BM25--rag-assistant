Convolution of a multivariate Gaussian and multivariate exponential distribution

I have derived the convolution for a multivariate Gaussian distribution with a multivariate exponential distribution. The aim is to get a multivariate extension to the univariate exponentially-modified Gaussian . Given data $\pmb X \in \mathrm{R}^{n \times d}$ , the likelihood for this convolution would be $\pmb X|\theta, \Sigma, \lambda \sim \mathsf{multivariateEMG}\, (\theta, \Sigma, \lambda)$ where parameters $\theta$ is mean of the convolution including means from both the Gaussian and the Exponential, $\Sigma$ is the covariance of the convolution and $\lambda$ is the skew component coming from the Exponential distribution. The prior over the parameters are $\pmb \theta \sim \mathcal{N}(\theta^\prime,\Sigma^\prime), \quad \Sigma^{-1} \sim \mathit{Wish}( H^{\prime -1},\sigma^\prime),\quad \lambda \sim \mathit{Jeffrey}(\lambda)$ . By having such a distribution in place, one can have the best of both worlds: retain skewness given by the exponential distribution whilst working alongside a Gaussian (i.e. using the mean and covariance). This will be a very helpful distribution provided we can estimate distributional parameters 'nicely'. The joint posterior of this convolution is non conjugate making its integral intractable. Therefore, for inference, I plan to use the ‘ noise contrastive estimation ’ for parameter estimation used for unnormalised distributions. My query would be is this the right approach or since this is a convolution, one could just include the extra terms coming from the Exponential distribution into the Bayesian inference thereby not needing to work out the convolution (sum) in $P(\pmb X|\theta, \Sigma, \lambda)$ necessary to determine the likelihood. Any advice on this matter would be highly appreciated.
