Can you include the same customer in both the training and test sets?

Is it reasonable to include the same customer in both train and test samples? I'm working in panel data logistic regression. I'm actually trying to calculate a probability of default for each customer, so logit model is used to predict the pd of customers, I couldn't be so sure whether I need to include the same customer in both train and test sample.
