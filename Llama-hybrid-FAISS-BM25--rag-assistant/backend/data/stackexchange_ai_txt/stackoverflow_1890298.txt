I couldn't see a definitive answer in the jquery docs. But I'm thinking the data for the 302 response (or whatever) IS valid XML data (thus could be parsed) even if HTML isn't always. HTTP/1.1 302 Found Cache-Control: no-cache Keep-Alive: timeout=3, max=993 Pragma: no-cache Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8 Expires: -1 Location: /Login.aspx Server: Microsoft-IIS/7.0 X-AspNet-Version: 2.0.50727 X-Powered-By: ASP.NET Date: Fri, 11 Dec 2009 19:17:27 GMT Content-Length: 139 Object moved Object moved to here .
