Ecommerce application and solution

Here's my predicament. I'm working with a designer who has a very unique layout for his ecommerce site. It's kinda like a table/tier based system where you buy a certain amount of points. I need the ability to have user accounts etc and it will all be in joomla. There's many options such as magento, virtuamart etc. but basically what I'm saying is... will it be possible with any particular platform to transform the products so much so that can still use the platform? here's a screen shot... http://www.one2designs.com/images/screen.png Basically It needs to some way integrate into joomla, allow for user profiles etc, and I guess be so customizable that it can be transformed into that look.
