Excuse my previous post. I now see that you are not referring to 9000 different covariates. What I have written does not apply to your situation. Sincerest apologies. Paul There is a lot of discussion about matching and dimensionality reduction on pre-treatment covariates that may be worthwhile examining - i.e. propensity weighting via logistic regression and establishing balance on the pre-treatment covariates vis a vis different matching approaches. Please refer to the following ............... http://gking.harvard.edu/matchit This approach is easily executed in r, but the number of variables you have would be looking to use would be very unlikely to work. Cheers Paul
