What is the difference between baseline and benchmark in terms of machine learning

While reading machine learning related papers, I came across these two terms: baseline and benchmark. Although I thought them to be the same thing, there seem to be some differences between them as mentioned here . However, I am still confused in terms of machine learning models, which model to call benchmark and which one to call baseline?
