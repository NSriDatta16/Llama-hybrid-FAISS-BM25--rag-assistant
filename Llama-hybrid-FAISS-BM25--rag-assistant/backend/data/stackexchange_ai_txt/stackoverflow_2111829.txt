If it's for personal use and training, just make something up and go with it. Design it yourself based on your needs and what you want to do. There's a lot of value in seeing the design through start to finish without trying to leverage someone elses view on your application. For a CMS I did, I simply had pages, page templates, stories, and properties (effectively components of a story/page). But navigation wasn't a big deal in my system, rather updating static pages was more important. I punted on the navigation because the sites had very static navigation demands that were simply not worth abstracting. But, anyway, simply do what YOU think is right for your case, then see how it works out. If it works good, great! If not, you know better for next time, so it's all good.
