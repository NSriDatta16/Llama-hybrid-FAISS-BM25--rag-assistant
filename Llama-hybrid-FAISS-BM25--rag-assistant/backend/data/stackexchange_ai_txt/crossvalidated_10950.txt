The naive way to calculate the auto correlation (and possibly what Excel uses) is to create 2 copies of the vector then remove the 1st n elements from the first copy and the last n elements from the second copy (where n is the lag that you are computing from). Then pass those 2 vectors to the function to calculate the correlation. This method is OK and will give a reasonable answer, but it ignores the fact that the 2 vectors being compared are really measures of the same thing. The improved version (as shown by Wolfgang) is a similar function to the regular correlation, except that it uses the entire vector for computing the mean and variance.
