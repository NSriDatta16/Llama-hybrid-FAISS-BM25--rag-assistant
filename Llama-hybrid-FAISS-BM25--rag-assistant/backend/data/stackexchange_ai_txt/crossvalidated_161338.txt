Getting a specific X from a logistic curve

I have data that can be fit, more or less, by logistic growth functions. Hence I used this tutorial to do this. Now I want to get an x value for a specific y value from the model. Maybe this is too trivial, but I could not find anything on the forums...or perhaps I was looking in the wrong way. For the below example, I would want to get the age at which Menarche is 0.5. In Excel I'd get the formula of the fit, solve it for x and put in y=0.5 ... but in R with logistic fit? library("MASS") data(menarche) str(menarche) summary(menarche) plot(Menarche/Total ~ Age, data=menarche) glm.out = glm(cbind(Menarche, Total-Menarche)~Age, family=binomial(logit), data=menarche) plot(Menarche/Total ~ Age, data=menarche) lines(menarche$Age, glm.out$fitted, type="l", col="red") title(main="Menarche Data with Fitted Logistic Regression Line")
