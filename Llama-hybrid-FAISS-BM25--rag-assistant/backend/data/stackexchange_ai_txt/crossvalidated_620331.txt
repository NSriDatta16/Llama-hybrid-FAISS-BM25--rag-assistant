Linear mixed model beta coefficient larger than one

My question is related to the linear mixed model. I have data on the built land area for three sampling sites from which we collected samples for 11 consecutive days. We collected the community of bacteria, algae, and protists using a DNA-based method. Our goal is to examine the relationships among all variables. Since all of these data have high dimensionality, we used principal component analysis to reduce the dimensionality of each group of data. Subsequently, we used the first axis of each variable to represent the changes in bacteria, algae, and protists. Based on ordination analyses, I observed that the data collected from each site were clustered closer together. Therefore, I believe that a mixed model, taking into account the sampling site as a random effect, would be appropriate. Additionally, the diagnostic plot for the independence of samples suggested a pseudo-replication problem arising from the same sampling site. For these reasons, I constructed several linear mixed models using the lmer function from the lme4 package. However, while diagnosing each individual model, I noticed something that seemed a bit off. The code below illustrates my confusion. So, I built three models as follows: library(lme4) library(dplyr) library(piecewiseSEM) lme4::lmer(protist1 ~ pro1 + (1 | Site) , data = data1) %>% coefs the estimate of pro1 was 0.4483 while the standardized estimate was 1.3535 *** lme4::lmer(protist1 ~ algae1 + (1 | Site) , data = data1) %>% coefs the estimate of algae1 was 0.65 while the standardized estimate was 0.899 *** But when I run the following model: lme4::lmer(protist1 ~ pro1 + algae1 + (1 | Site) , data = data1) %>% coefs the estimate of pro1 was 0.137 while the standardized estimate was 0.415; the estimate of algae1 was 0.48 and the standardized estimate was 0.668*** lme4::lmer(protist1 ~ pro1 + algae1 + (1 | Site) , data = data1)%>% VIF the VIF value for pro1 and algae1 was 2.79. which I assumed was okay. I understood that the standardized estimate can sometimes be larger than one when a model includes multiple predictors, which could be attributed to high collinearity among the predictors, especially in a linear model. However, in this case, the situation was reversed. In the first example, the standardized estimate of pro1 was larger than one, even exceeding the non-standardized estimate, which has left me confused. From what I understand, the standardized estimate is obtained from scaled data in R, and it is not expected to be larger than +1 or smaller than -1. I might be missing something in the concept of the mixed model, or perhaps using PCA components has an impact on the scaling function and subsequently on the estimates and standard estimates. How can I explain the findings in these models? dataset data1 here is the figure of the relationship between pro1 and protist1 and here is the figure of the relationship between algae1 and protist1
