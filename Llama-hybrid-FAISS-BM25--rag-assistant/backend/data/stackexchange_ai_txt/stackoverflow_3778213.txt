Using Vim to edit Microsoft Word files

I've found ViEmu , a vi emulator for microsoft word. However, I wanted to use vim to edit DOC or even rtf files. Is this possible ? Are they any other formats that preserve page/paragraph layout compatible with both Microsoft Word and Vim? I am also open to OpenOffice formats.
