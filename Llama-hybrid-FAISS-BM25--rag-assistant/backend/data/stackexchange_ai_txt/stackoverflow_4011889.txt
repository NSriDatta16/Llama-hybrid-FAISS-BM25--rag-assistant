If your C code just needs to pass the pointers around, and eventually pass it back to some C++ that'll actually deal with the object it points to, you should be able to use a void * in the C code, and cast back to T * when it goes back into C++. If you plan on the C code actually using the pointer, you're pretty much stuck with reverse engineering what your compiler happens to do, and trying to emulate it closely enough to make things work. Even at best, this is going to be ugly and fragile.
