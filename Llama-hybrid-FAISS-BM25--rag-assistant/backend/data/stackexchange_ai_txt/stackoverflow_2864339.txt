JQuery Hover li Show div which sits outside li structure

I'm currently trying to create a "mega" dropout menu using JQuery but have encountered an issue I'm yet to be able to resolve. At the moment I have the following HTML structure: Home Key Sectors Global Brands News &amp; Features Videos Events Key Cities Doing Business in Yorkshire How We Can Help Contact Us Advanced Engineering &amp; Materials - Nuclear - Logistics &amp; Infrastructure Chemicals Environmental Technologies - Offshore Wind - Carbon Capture &amp; Storage - Tidal Power - Biomass Digital &amp; New Media Food &amp; Drink Healthcare Technologies - Biotechnology - Pharmaceuticals - Medical Devices Financial &amp; Professional In normal circumstances the div containing the "mega" menu options would sit inside the li item that fires the show/hide but this is currently not possible as the ul list of navigation links is rendered using a 3rd party piece of software which does not provide an equivalent of an OnItemDataBound event for me to be able to inject the div into the item Does anyone know of a way, using JQuery, of showing the div but maintain the display of the div as the mouse focus leaves the li that originaly displayed the div and actually enters the div? I'm currently using the following JQuery which displays the div correctly but as the mouse focus enters the div the div then disappears as the mouse focus from the li has now moved: $(document).ready(function() { function addMega(){ $(".sectorsDropped").toggle("fast"); } function removeMega(){ $(".sectorsDropped").toggle("fast"); } var megaConfig = { interval: 500, sensitivity: 4, over: addMega, timeout: 500, out: removeMega }; $("#TopNavMenu_0_1").hoverIntent(megaConfig) }); Thanks Dave
