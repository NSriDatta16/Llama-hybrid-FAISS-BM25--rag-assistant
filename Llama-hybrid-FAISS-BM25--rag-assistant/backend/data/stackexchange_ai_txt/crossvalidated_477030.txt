I imagine the 95% confidence intervals come from some assumptions on normality of data. Otherwise, please state how you got these CI. This implies you believe the mean of each slope (viewed as a RV) is $m_i$ with some variance $\sigma_i$ In this case you can average the slopes as you did and get the new variance of the averaged estimator (assuming independent errors). From said variance you can get 95% CI (using 1.96 standard deviations). So, to summarize (assuming $m_i$ are independent is crucial): Let $m := \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \sigma_i^{-2}}{\sum_{i=1}^N \sigma_i^{-2}}$ Let $\sigma^2 := Var(m) = Var(\frac{ \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \sigma_i^{-2}}{\sum_{i=1}^N \sigma_i^{-2}}) = (\frac{1}{\sum_{i=1}^N \sigma_i^{-2}})^2 \sum_{i=1}^N \sigma^{-4}Var(m_i) = \frac{1}{\sum_{i=1}^N \sigma_i^{-2}}$ . Note that this is the harmonic mean! Finally you see it in the wild after learning that inequality in your first calculus class!! A 95% CI for the true value of the slope is $[m- 1.96\sigma, m+ 1.96\sigma]$ (see 1.96 )
