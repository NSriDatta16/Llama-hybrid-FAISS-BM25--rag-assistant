I should add a shout-out for Sho, the numerical computing environment built on IronPython. I'm using it right now for the Stanford machine learning class and it's been really helpful. It's got built in linear algebra packages and charting capabilities. Being .Net it's easy to extend with C# or any other .Net language. I've found it much easier to get started with, being a windows user, than straight Python and NumPy.
