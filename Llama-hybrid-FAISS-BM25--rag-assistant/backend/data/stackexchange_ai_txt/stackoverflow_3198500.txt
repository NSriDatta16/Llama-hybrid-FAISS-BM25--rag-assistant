How to use nose with IronPython?

I installed nose using the 'setup.py install' on the command line , I am able to run 'nosetests' and any python file matching testMatch regular expression is picked up and tests are automated in the %python home%\Scripts directory. Now I want nose to work with my iron Python files , how do I install nose on the %Iron Python home% directory ? i noticed my Iron Python Home directory does not even have a Scripts folder. If i try running 'nosetests' with iron python code , it throws all sorts of exception for eg. no module named clr. Is anybody using nose with iron python ? if yes , please guide me. I have been struggling with this since an entire day, currently my only workaround has been adding the following in my IronPython code: import nose nose.main(argv=[' ']) is this is the only way to go about using nose in iron python files ? if there is no other way , then I wanted to know how to use the several plugins that nose has ? especially the coverage plugin ? i installed it for python2.6 , but how to make it work for ironpython ? The reason I am asking is because with python , it gets easy to use the plugins just by calling the command line , but with IronPython I don't know how to make it work.
