BizTalk Map Incorrectly Parsing Input XML

I've got a situation where my BizTalk map is not extracting data from input XML correctly. The input schema looks like this: Sequence A B All 3 of those nodes on the XSD have min 0, max unbounded. So here's a sample input file fragment: 1 hi 2 there Now my map takes this data and calls stored procs to insert data into a table. I'm getting "hi" for field B for both A of 1 and A of 2. That's incorrect. I traced the problem to the map. The XSLT generated does a foreach on A, and then goes to grab value B but always grabs the first B. So anyone have any tips for modifying either the input schema or the map to get this to work correctly?
