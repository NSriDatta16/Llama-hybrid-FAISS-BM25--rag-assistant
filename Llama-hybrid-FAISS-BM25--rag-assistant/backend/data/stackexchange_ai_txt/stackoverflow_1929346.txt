Suggestions on how to organize Core Data visual layout?

Core Data is pretty amazing, and I've really enjoyed using the visual layout Xcode provides for it to organize things and get a quick sample of what data I've placed where. At times I've started to wonder if I'm making the best use of it, however, as after a while there tends to be such a mass of arrows that it becomes difficult to tell what's going where. I try to keep this to a minimum by grouping like objects together, abstract objects/parents in trees with their children, etc. but the clutter seems inevitable. What are some ways you employ to keep it optimally organized and readable?
