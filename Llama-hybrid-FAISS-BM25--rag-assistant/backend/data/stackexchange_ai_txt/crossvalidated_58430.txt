First, you are making several assumptions here, not necessarily bad assumptions, you should just be honest about the assumptions and consider how you might expand things to deal with more general cases where some of the assumptions might not be true. These assumptions include that you only have 2 possible candidates, that the sample that is polled represents those who will actually vote, that people do not lie in the poll (or change their minds, etc.) I think that I would approach this using Bayesian statistics. The unknown piece of information that you want is the proportion of voters who will vote for candidate A (if that is over 0.5 then A wins). Start with a prior distribution on this proportion, probably fairly disperse such as a uniform, or a beta that is symmetric about 0.5 and does not concentrate too much too close to 0.5. Then assuming that the poll represents a random sample from the population of people who will vote (and they don't lie, change their minds, say "undecided", etc.) we can consider the results from the poll to be a binomial. Combine this with the prior to get a posterior distribution and you will be able to calculate the information of interest. The probability of A winning is the area under the posterior distribution to the right of 0.5. The sharpness of the posterior will depend on the sample size of the poll like you want.
