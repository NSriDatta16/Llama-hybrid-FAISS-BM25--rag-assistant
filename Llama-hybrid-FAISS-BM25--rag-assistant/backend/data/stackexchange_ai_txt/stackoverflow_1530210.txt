Temporary Storing data entered in steps in class in asp.net

how can i store different data enetered using multiple steps? Its 4-5 step procedure, user can go through each step & at the final submission i want to store it in database. I want to create class to store this data & store the data in object of that class & use it from session. I just want to know what type should i use to store multiple data. i.e. array,ienumrable,list,etc.. Any suggestion or example to implement class like this. Thanks Pragnesh
