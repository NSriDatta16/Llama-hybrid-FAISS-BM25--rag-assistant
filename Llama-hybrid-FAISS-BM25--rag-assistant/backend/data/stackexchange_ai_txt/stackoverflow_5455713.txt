Instead of storing it in memory as a Dictionary you can store it in a Database ( wp7sqlite ) and fetch only the data required.In this way you can store whatever amount of data. Edit No nothing is required in extra from user end.you can create the database using sqlite manager ,attach this to the project.Copy DB to Isolated storage on first usage.and you can access the DB whenever you want .Check this Link DB helper .This link uses sqlitewindowsphone instead of WP7Sqlite.I prefer wp7sqlite Since i got an error using sqlitewindowsphone.
