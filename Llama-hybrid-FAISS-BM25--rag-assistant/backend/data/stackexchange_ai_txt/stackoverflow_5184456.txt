In Scrum however, it is advised for requirements to be in the form of user stories. What is the best way to approach this? The two options that you have mentioned are not really options, they are sequential stages, IMHO. During Agile Requirements Gathering or Product Planning the first step is to create EPIC stories. After you have those Epics, you need to break them down into smaller chunks. Without the EPICs you will most likely to run into the issue of creating random stories without getting a grasp on the sense of belonging of a story. You can in a way create a hierarchy in User Stories. Without understanding that, everything is just random, hence it makes it tougher to wrap your head around or manage the stories as a PO. Offcourse there is much more to all this than what I mentioned in the above paragraph. That's why probably you need an experienced Scrum Coach or do a lot of diligent reading/implementing on Agile Planning and User Story writing. Hope this makes sense. I would suggest reading Agile Estimating and Planning by Mike Cohn for anyone who even remotely thinks of taking up a PO role. Best of Luck!
