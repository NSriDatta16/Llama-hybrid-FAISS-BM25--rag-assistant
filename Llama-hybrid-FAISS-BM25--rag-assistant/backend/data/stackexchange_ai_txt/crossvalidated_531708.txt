It depends on what you want to do. If you are interested in performing null hypothesis significance testing (NHST), and you would like to know how big of a sample you will need to be able to identify a significant effect, you should do a power analysis. To me (a statistician) its kind of a strange question. Its like if you were going on a vacation road trip to the coast and you asked me if you will need to save enough money for a boat paddle. I would say: "I don't know, are you going canoeing?" If on the other hand you just want to fit a model to describe the data, or make predictions etc, you may not be interested in NHST and you won't need to do a power analysis. For this (and all power analyses) you need to pick the model/statistical tests which you will fit to the data. Given an effect size for a particular parameter you can then calculate power to detect such an effect size. This sounds like a longitudinal ordered logistic regression.
