Don't use sys.systypes . Use sys.types instead. Catalog views like sys.sys% are for backward compatibility and there is always a newer, better explained catalog view. In this case, sys.types no longer exposes the internal physical storage type (the type ) column, since that is an internal, undocumented, type id.
