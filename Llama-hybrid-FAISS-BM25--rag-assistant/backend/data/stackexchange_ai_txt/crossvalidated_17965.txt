I think it may depend on the values of C and the number of patterns you have. The SVM tries to find the maximum margin discriminant, so if you have sparse data then it is possible that the SVM might find the hard-margin solution without any of the Lagrange multipliers reaching their upper bounds (in which case the ratio of penalties for each class is essntially irrelevant as the slack-valiables are small or zero. Try increasing the number of training patterns and see if that has an effect (as that makes it less likely that the hard-margin solution can be found within the box-constraints). More importantly, the optimal values of C are data-dependent, you can't just set them to some pre-determined values, but instead optimise them by minimising the leave-one-out error or some generalisation bound. If you have imbalanced classes, you can fix the ratio of values for each class, and optimise the average penalty over all patterns.
