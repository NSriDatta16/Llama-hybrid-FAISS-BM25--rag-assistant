Deploy as Jenkins User or Allow Jenkins To Run As Different User?

I'm just getting started with Jenkins CI, and had a question which I'm struggling to find answers for in the docs or online. Wonder if someone might be able to offer some advice? I'm attempting to use it to automatically deploy my dev and stage branches of my Django projects which are hosted on a Github organisation repository (ie, private). At the moment I have a user "django" who can access the Github repo via a Github deploy key. My Jenkins user can't access the repo. What's the best practice way of dealing with this - should I be creating an ssh deploy key for the "jenkins" user, or should I be getting Jenkins to run as my "django" user? I've seen mention if a HUDSON_USER in a newsgroup post, but I can't find reference to this in the docs. Many thanks! Ludo.
