How do you define color? If you define color as an image file, there will be strong signals separating one color from another. If you do not have access to that sort of information, you can use a multinomial logistic regression, LDA like model or any of the other zillion classification models. Remember that, brute force is never the way to go (unless problem size is extremely small). Combinatorial problems go out of hand very fast.
