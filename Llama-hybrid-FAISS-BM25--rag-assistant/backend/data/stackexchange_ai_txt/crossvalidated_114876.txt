Based on your explanations, your data looks something like the following: Age Consciousness Option Count So in fact you could reconstruct the actual data for each respondent, but the repetitions are collapsed to save space. There are two possible approaches for analyzing data like this, and they are actually equivalent deep inside: Log-linear modeling, in which the counts are modeled using Poisson distribution with three predictors (age, consciousness, option). Multinomial logistic regression, in which the chosen option is the outcome, age and consciousness are the predictors, and the count is a weighing variable. The precise implementation would depend on the software you have available.
