If you always have such a small standard deviation as $\sigma=\sqrt{5},$ then there are relatively few likely integers even with $n$ larger than 10 samples. Maybe a dozen or so within $3\sigma$ of $\mu.$ So the expected number $E(U)$ of unique values will be relatively small. Trivial simulations gave $E(U) \approx 6.05$ with $n = 10$, $E(U) \approx 8.19$ with 20, and $E(U) \approx 10.34$ with 50; all with $SD(U)$ a little over $1.$ Sample simulation in R: u = replicate( 10^6, length(unique(round(rnorm(10, 450, sqrt(5))))) ) mean(u); sd(u) ## 6.052771 ## 1.058554 With very much larger standard deviations, you might be able to view ties as rare events and get a serviceable Poisson model for $U.$ Note: This is vaguely reminiscent of the famous birthday problem except that there are fewer possible values (than 365) and not all values are equally likely (more ties near $\mu$). Also, discussions of the birthday problem usually center on probability of a match, not average numbers of matches.
