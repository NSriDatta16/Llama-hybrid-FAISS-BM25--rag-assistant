iPhone, modify UIImage to a target average color

I need for a project to modify UIImage. Here are steps I have to follow - I extract the average color of the image by taking several points in the image and calculating the average R, G and B - The next step is to modify the image in order to have a new average R, G and B for the modified image. This new R, G and B is given, the thing I do not know how to do is: how to modify an UIImage in order to pass from an existing average RGB value to a given RGB value. I am not sure to be very clear. Do not hesitate to ask me if this is not the case. Thanks in advance for your help! Regards,
