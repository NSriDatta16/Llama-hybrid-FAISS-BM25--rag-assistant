There are a number of ways to keep the L2S model in sync with the underlying database: 1) Delete the table(s)/classes involved from the designer surface and drag them back from the 'server explorer' thing. ...or... 2) Update the classes involved manually in the L2S designer. ...or... 3) Use third party tools with update capability (one such tool is my add-in: http://www.huagati.com/dbmltools/ , also mentioned in the Dec 2009 issue of MSDN magazine http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/ee819138.aspx ) ...or... 4) Regenerate the entire DBML file using either the designer or sqlmetal.exe.
