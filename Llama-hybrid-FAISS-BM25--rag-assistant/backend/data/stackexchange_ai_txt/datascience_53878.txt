Recommender systems and Machine Learning

According to Mitchell: “A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T , as measured by P , improves with experience E” (Mitchell, 1997) . If we put this in terms of recommender systems: Task : recommend products Experience : includes the experience of observing a set of examples encoded in a ratings matrix Performance : metric i.e. rmse between real and predicted ratings Is my approach okay? Any suggestions are welcomed!
