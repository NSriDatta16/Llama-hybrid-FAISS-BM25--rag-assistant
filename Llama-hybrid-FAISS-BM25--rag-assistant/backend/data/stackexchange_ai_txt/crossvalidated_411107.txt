I think you have a missunderstanding of the interpretation of a statistical test. In detail, you cannot conclude anything if the null hypothesis is not rejected. Especially you never accept $H_0$ . You are just only able to "fail to reject $H_0$ ". In your case I would recommend an (augmented) Dickey-Fuller test. This test has a (trend) stationary time series as alternative hypothesis. If you can reject the null hypothesis of a unit-root this gives inference about the stationarity properties of your time series
