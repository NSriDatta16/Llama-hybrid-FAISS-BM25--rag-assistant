Output first two paragraphs from html stored as string

I have html stored in a string variable within my c# .net 2.0 code. Below is an example: • Tens of thousands lose homes in 7.0 magnitude quake • UN headquarters, schools and hospitals collapse René Préval, the president of Haiti, has described the devastation after last night's earthquake as "unimaginable" as governments and aid agencies around the world rushed into action. Préval described how he had been forced to step over dead bodies and heard the cries of those trapped under the rubble of the national parliament. "Parliament has collapsed. The tax office has collapsed. Schools have collapsed. Hospitals have collapsed," he told the Miami Herald . "There are a lot of schools that have a lot of dead people in them." Préval said he thought thousands of people had died in the quake. I only want to output the first two paragraphs as a substring of the orginal. Can someone help?
