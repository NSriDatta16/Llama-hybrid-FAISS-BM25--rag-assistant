What is the best practice for naming database tables to provide natural organization?

We put common prefixes on related tables to assure they display next to each other in our DB management software (Toad, Enterprise Manager, etc). So for example, all user tables start with the word User: User UserEvent UserPurchase Ideally, in honor of the three great virtues of a programmer these tables should be named User, Event, Purchase respectively to save some typing, agreed? Is this naming convention the best (only?) practice for grouping related tables together naturally?
