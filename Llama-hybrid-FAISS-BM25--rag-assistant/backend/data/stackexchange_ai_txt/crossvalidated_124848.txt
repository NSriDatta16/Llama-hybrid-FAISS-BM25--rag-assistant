SPSS: How to split distribution evenly to analyze subgroups

I have a normally distributed SPSS dataset with 1400+ cases. I want to create sub-groups based on "age in months" that are distributed evenly. The dataset ranges from 12 to 60 "age in months". Weighted average percentiles are 20 mos (5%), 23 mos (10%), 30 mos (25%), 36 mos (50%), 44 mos (75%), 52 mos (90%), and 56 mos (95%). SD is 10.4. What's the best approach to splitting this dataset into age subgroups for pairwise analysis?
