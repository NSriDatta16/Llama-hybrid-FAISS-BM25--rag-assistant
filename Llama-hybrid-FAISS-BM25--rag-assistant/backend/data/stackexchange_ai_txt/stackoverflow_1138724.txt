How to set a range of elements in an stl vector to a particular value?

I have a vector of booleans. I need to set its elements from n-th to m-th to true . Is there an elegant way to do this without using a loop? Edit: Tanks to all those who pointed out the problems with using vector . However, I was looking for a more general solution, like the one given by jalf.
