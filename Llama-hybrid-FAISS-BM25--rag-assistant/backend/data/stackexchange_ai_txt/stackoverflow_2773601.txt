While it is true that the compound key solution seems to be more elegant from a design perspective and less space-consuming at first glance, there are circumstances in which I'd personnaly go for an auto incremented numeric id instead. If the friendship is referenced elsewhere, it will save more space on the long run to have a single numeric ID as a foreign key in the referencing table than a compound ID. Plus, an index on a single id will be (slightly) shorter and faster than a composite index if you query often on the friendship ID.
