Parsing structured documents in Java

I would like to parse some legal documents with a Java library into pieces of text that represent headers, paragraphs etc. Legal documents are usually well-structured, so I would like to use something a bit easier than JavaCC (or other parser generators). Are there any which would allow to (nearly) automatically detect such a structure? Thanks.
