For what it's worth, in C#, SortedDictionary is implemented as a red-black tree, and in many implementations of the STL in C++, std::map is implemented as a red-black tree. Also, from Wikipedia on AVL vs. red-black trees: The AVL tree is another structure supporting O(log n) search, insertion, and removal. It is more rigidly balanced than red-black trees, leading to slower insertion and removal but faster retrieval. This makes it attractive for data structures that may be built once and loaded without reconstruction, such as language dictionaries (or program dictionaries, such as the order codes of an assembler or interpreter).
