Can imbalance data create overfitting?

I am doing human activity recognition project. I have total of 12 classes. The class distribution look like this: $\color{red}{If \ you \ watch \ carefully, you \ can \ see \ that \ I \ have \ no \ data \ points \ for \ class \ 11 \ and \ class \ 8.}$ Also, the dataset is highly imbalanced. So, I took minimum data points (in this case 2028) for all of the classes. Now my balanced data look like this: After doing this it looks like a balance data. $\color{red}{But \ still, \ I \ think \ it \ not, \ because \ I \ have \ zero \ datapoints \ for \ class \ 11 \ and \ class \ 8}$ . In my opinion the classes are still imbalance. I am using CNN model to solve this activity project. My model summary is following: The main problem is, my model starts overfitting heavily when I train it. Is it due to my imbalance data( class 8 and 11 has zero data points) or something else? $\textbf{Hyperperameter:}$ $\textbf{features:}$ X, Y, Z of mobile accelerometer $\textbf{frame size:}$ 80 $\textbf{optimizer:}$ Adam, $\textbf{Learning rate:}$ 0.001 $\textbf{Loss:}$ Sparse categorical cross-entropy
