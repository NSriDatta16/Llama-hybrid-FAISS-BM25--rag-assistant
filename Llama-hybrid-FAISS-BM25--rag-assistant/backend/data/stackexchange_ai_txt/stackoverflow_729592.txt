Eclipse MyLyn with BugZilla: Will the BugZilla installation need to be modified/configured?

I'm interested in MyLyn. I'm using Eclipse Ganymede and I have access to a BugZilla installation for the project I'm working on. I wonder if the BugZilla installation will have to be changed/configured in any way or if I'm able to use MyLyn against it "out of the box"? Will I have to setup some special kind of MyLyn server or could I simply install it on the client only? And if configuration of BugZilla or a a special MyLyn service is needed on a server. Is it a difficult setup and will it take a long time to do?
