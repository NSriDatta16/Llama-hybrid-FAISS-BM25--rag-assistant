I use unobtrusive javascript, so, outside of the script tags I don't keep any javascript in the html. The two are completely separated. A javascript function will start when the DOM tree is completed, which will go through the html and add the javascript events, and whatever else needs to be changed. In order to organize, I tend to have some javascript files that are named similar to the html pages that they use, and then for common functions I tend to group them by what they do, and pick a name that explains that. So, for example, if I have UI functions then I may call them: myapp_ui_functions.js I try to put the name of the application in the filename, unless there is some javascript that is common to several projects, such as strings.js.
