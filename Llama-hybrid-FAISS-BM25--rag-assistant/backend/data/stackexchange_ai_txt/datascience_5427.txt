How to generate synthetic dataset using machine learning model learnt with original dataset?

Generally, the machine learning model is built on datasets. I'd like to know if there is any way to generate synthetic dataset using such trained machine learning model preserving original dataset characteristics? [original data --> build machine learning model --> use ml model to generate synthetic data....!!!] Is it possible? Please point me to related resource if possible.
