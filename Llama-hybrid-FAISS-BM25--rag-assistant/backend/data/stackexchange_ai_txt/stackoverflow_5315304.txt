save content from header?

I'm looking for help in something that I can't figure out.... I'm receiving in a PHP some data sent by a .swf... var requestHeader:* = new URLRequestHeader("Content-type", "application/octet-stream"); var request:* = new URLRequest(url); new URLRequest(url).requestHeaders.push(requestHeader); request.method = URLRequestMethod.POST; request.data = this.getByteArray(o, a, l, a2, l2); navigateToURL(request, "_blank");` I can't modify that code... that's a swf... but it works... now... the php i'm using receives this as its header Host: localhost Connection: keep-alive Referer: http://localhost/archivo.swf Content-Length: 135782 Cache-Control: max-age=0 Origin: null User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/534.16 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/10.0.648.133 Safari/534.16 Content-Type: application/octet-stream Accept: application/xml,application/xhtml+xml,text/html;q=0.9,text/plain;q=0.8,image/png,*/*;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate,sdch Accept-Language: es-ES,es;q=0.8,en-US;q=0.6 Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.3 looking at the content-length. I can see that some data was received. but debugging or printing the PHP. the POST has 0 items. the GET has the session id. and the REQUEST also has the session id appending to the header header("Content-disposition: attachment; filename=archivo.png"); only downloads the content of the printed php (in this case the headers, a 1.something kB file) is there anyway to retrieve the content that has a size of 135782? Thanks!
