I'd say your main problem here is that you are using the TextBox as your primary storage for your text. Everytime you call TextBox.Lines, the string is split on Environment.NewLine . Try turning it around: Store the text in a new List (maxLines) In your AddLine method, check the length of your text buffer and use RemoveRange (0, excessCount) Update your display TextBox by calling String.Join(Environment.NewLine, textBuffer.ToArray()) That last call is a bit expensive, but it should stop your slowdowns. To get it any faster you'd need to use a statically sized string array and move the references around yourself.
