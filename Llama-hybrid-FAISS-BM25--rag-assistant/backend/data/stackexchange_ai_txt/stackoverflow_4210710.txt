Cast pointer to member function to normal pointer

Currently I have a class of this kind, shortened for simplicity: class MyClass { public: MyClass(); void* someFunc(void* param); } Now I need to call a function of this kind (not member of any class and which I unfortunately cannot change ) but which I need to call anyway: void secondFunc(int a, int b, void *(*pCallback)(void*)); Now I need to pass the address of someFunc of an instance. A not working sample: MyClass demoInstance; // some other calls secondFunc( 1, 2, demoInstance::someFunc() ); I've tried also with casts like: (void* (*)(void*)) demoInstance::someFunc; reinterpret_cast (demoInstance::someFunc); How can I call this function with a class' member function as parameter so that this one can use it as callback? Any idea or remark is appreciated. Thanks and regards tobias
