I would segment the users on the site by their overall activity measure until the point of test, and train a model using these segments as a categorical variable(or train a different model for each). My thoughts are that in the case of two users: a) A very active user who was on a long vacation. b) A new user - who had one action(only on sign up day) Might have the same sustained-participation metric - if measured as a function of time passed since last action. But we expect the community to react differently to their actions. A model might look like: attention = M(segment_type, time_since_last_activity). segment_type = G(activity_signals_until_now) Where activity_signal_until_now may consist: - total action - time since first action - average time between actions M can be a simple Regressor. G could be supervised(if you have prior on what segments you have) or unsupervised using some kind of clustering algorithm.
