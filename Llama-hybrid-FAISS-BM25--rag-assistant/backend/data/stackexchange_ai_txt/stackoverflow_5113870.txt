As far as I know, there is no way to have all three of these requirements. Base64 encoding it and loading it into the image tag directly is probably your best bet if you don't want to write it to storage, although you can still write it to internal storage and show it in a webview. private static final String HTML_FORMAT = " "; private static void openJpeg(WebView web, byte[] image) { String b64Image = Base64.encode(image, Base64.DEFAULT); String html = String.format(HTML_FORMAT, b64Image); web.loadData(html, "text/html", "utf-8"); }
