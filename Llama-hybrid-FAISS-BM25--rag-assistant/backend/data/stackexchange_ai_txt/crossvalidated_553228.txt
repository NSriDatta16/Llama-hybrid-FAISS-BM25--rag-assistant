Is a logistic regression relevant to my problem?

Hi so for my proposal I plan on conducting a logistic regression but I'm not sure if it is the right method. My independent variable is a composite variable made up of 8 items, 4 reverse coded but all summed together to create a new variable representing need fulfillment. These items are 5 point Likert scale (strongly disagree... neutral... Strongly agree) half the items represent satisfaction and the other frustration hence why I plan to reverse code the latter. My outcome variable is a dichotomized item representing substance misuse or no misuse. I would like to see if lower scores or frustration are related to misuse and vice versa. Since the independent variable is Likert but a composite I'm not sure if a logistic regression would still be appropriate if not what other analysis could I use? edit: I didn't mean sum I meant average of the 8 items will be used as the new variable sorry for the confusion.
