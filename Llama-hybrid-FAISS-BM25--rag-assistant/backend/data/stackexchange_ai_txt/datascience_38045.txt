What is the best way to visualize 10 Fold Cross Validation Scores?

I have trained a CNN model and I have applied 10 Fold Cross Validation because I don't have much data to train the classifier. Now I am unsure about how to visulize fold wise results. Please suggest some visualization charts or techniques to display fold wise results.
