Thanks for adding the table Given this, I think the OR is fine. The logistic regression you posted also included another variable, but, in the table, the OR for L1 = 4 vs. L1 = 0 is $\frac{17537*1328}{1284*44} = 412.23$ which is actually a little larger than the one from the regression. It's a very strong relationship.
