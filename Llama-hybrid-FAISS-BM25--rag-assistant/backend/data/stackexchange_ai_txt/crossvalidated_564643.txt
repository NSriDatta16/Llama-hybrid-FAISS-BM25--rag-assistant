Transforming only y variable with Yeo-Johnson in Python

I have 4500 values in my dependent variable and 75% of values are zeros (no negative ones) The distribution looks like this. In multiple sources I read that Yeo-Johnson transformation can be a solution here. I want to transform only y variable. When I am doing a basic transformation with y = df[['y']] X = df.drop(columns=['y']) from sklearn.preprocessing import PowerTransformer pt = PowerTransformer(method='yeo-johnson') y = pt.fit_transform(y) Now my distribution looks like this one with only two values. array([[-0.3557652 ], [ 2.81469728], [-0.3557652 ], ..., [-0.3557652 ], [-0.3557652 ], [-0.3557652 ]]) print(pt.lambdas_) [-3.78267763] What am I doing wrong here? If I am doing it right, why is it like this? Should not it be close to normal? Any ideas how to proceed further?
