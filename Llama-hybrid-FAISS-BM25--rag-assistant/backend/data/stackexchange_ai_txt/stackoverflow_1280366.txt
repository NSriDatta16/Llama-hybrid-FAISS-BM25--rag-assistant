A List is a IEnumerable , but a IEnumerable is not a IEnumerable . The two interfaces are unrelated (except for their structure). C# 4.0 introduces covariance and contravariance, which can solve this kind of problem Meanwhile, In C# 3.0, you can do : deck.Deal(players.Cast ()); It should have no significant performance impact, since the collection is only enumerated once, and the upcast to ICardHolder is a no-op in MSIL
