Principal Components for dependent variable in a regression

My question is related to PCA. I want to estimate the effect of agriculture variability on the welfare measures for financialy included people against the excluded. For this purpose I am trying to generate an index of welfare measure through PCA by having it as a function of four sets of households expenses; food consumption, non-food consumption, household expenditure and expenditure on durable goods. Can PCA be used to create an index which can then be used as a dependent variable (Household welfare index through PCA in the present case)? If yes, then what is the way to make interpretation of betas on the independent variables used in regression. Say for example Age of the Household head.
