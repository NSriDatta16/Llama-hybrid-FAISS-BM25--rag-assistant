How to deal with training data after cross validation?

I have imbalanced data and used undersampling to construct several logistic regression models, using the way very similar to EasyEnsemble . The parameters, like regularization, number of models were tuned using cross validation. I used sklearn's logistic regression and predict_proba to obtain the posterior probabilities. The final output for each unseen sample was the average probabilities from those models. I have two questions: In the case that I don't want to waste any data, I want to predict training data as well. What should I do? If I still want to use posterior probabilities, how can I concatenate probabilities from training and unseen data for final decision? If I was right, I think the probabilities for training and unseen data were from different models.
