Running NUnit Tests from Team city

I've successfully managed to get MSTests running for each of the builds on our TeamCity Server. I've got a couple of projects that use NUnit, so was hoping that getting TeamCity to run NUnit tests would be as simple as running MSTests: So when I try to do the same for my NUnit Tests the Testing Tab doesn't show up when the Build finishes, so I'm guessing it hasn't run my tests. Does anyone know what I'm doing wrong? Not sure if this will help, but this is from the build log: [Project "AssemblyName.proj.teamcity.patch.tcprojx" (Build;TeamCity_Generated_NUnitTests target(s)):] C:\Program Files\TeamCity\buildAgent\plugins\dotnetPlugin\bin\JetBrains.BuildServer.NUnitLauncher.exe "@@" "C:\Program Files\TeamCity\buildAgent\temp\buildTmp\tmp2867.tmp" [13:22:57]: Start TeamCity NUnit Test Runner [13:22:59]: Build finished It's like it starts the nunit build runner, then just stops? Thanks Dave
