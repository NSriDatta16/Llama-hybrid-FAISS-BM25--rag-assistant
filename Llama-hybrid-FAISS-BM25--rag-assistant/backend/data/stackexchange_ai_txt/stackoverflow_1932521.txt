Dragging 1 of 52 cards in UIView. Which is a better method?

Currently I have 52 cards UIImageViews in IB UIView. And my objective is to drag 1 of this 52 cards into a Square, and if the the card is dropped into the Square, it will stay there. Otherwise, it will snap back it's original position. MY question is which is a better method? Creating a custom class NSObject and changing every card in IB into this class and using this code in the .m file. `- (void)touchesMoved:(NSSet*)touches withEvent:(UIEvent*)event { UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; CGPoint location = [touch locationInView:self.superview]; self.center = location; } Declaring 52 IBOutlets and make them respond to the same action i)Subsidiary question: Is there a way i do not need to declare all 52 IBOutlets? ` Thank you in advance!
