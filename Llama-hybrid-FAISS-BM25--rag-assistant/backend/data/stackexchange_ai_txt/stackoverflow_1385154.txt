I too recommend HTML Tidy, whilst its not maintained by Dave Ragett anymore the tool is definitely being updated frequently with tweaks. I use HTML Trim which is a win32 app to cleanup some awful autogenerated blobs of code that some of our devs knock up. You can also grab the command line version which you may able to integrate into Dreamweaver. Sorry i cant post more than one hyperlink - still a n00b here.
