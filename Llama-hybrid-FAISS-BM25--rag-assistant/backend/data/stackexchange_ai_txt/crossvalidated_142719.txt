The Wikipedia article Degrees of freedom (statistics) is pretty good at explaining it (see the first few paragraphs). Imagine you have some system or a black box which behavior is defined by a number of values (or parameters). The concrete values of the parameters set one particular mode of operation. Another set of parameters will define another mode of operation. The catch here is that even for a simple system (say with one parameter only) you can "create" many versions of that parameter (e.g. multiple, added constant etc). Here the degrees of freedom is minimal number of parameters that are independent and are free to vary (under some constraints if any).
