Regarless of the use of Scrum, what you were seeing was a change from a code ownership approach to a communal code approach. In order for that to work, there has to be a process change which supports it. One such possibility is TDD. There are others (Automated unit testing even if doesn't drive design coupled with Code Reviews, strong design communication, greater design up front, not developing on code without first pairing with the original author on the code, and more I'm sure you could think of). Communal approaches work in smaller communities (in large ones it can degenerate into a tragedy of the commons) with a high sense of cohesion between the members.
