Where can I find pre-trained fully convolutional neural networks?

I know that fully convolutional neural networks can be used for classifying images of arbitrary sizes. I would like to use some pre-trained fully-convolution neural networks for extracting features in a dataset with images of different sizes. Where can I find such a network? Best regards
