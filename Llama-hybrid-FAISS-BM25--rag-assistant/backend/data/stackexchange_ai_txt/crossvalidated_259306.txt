using mixed effect logistic regression properly

I am new to data analysis and now working on a Mixed Effects Logistic Regression Model.Currently I have a data frame ( model_data ) that looks like the following: Vehicle_id entry_time exit_time last_veh_time vehicle_type __________ ___________ __________ ____________ ____________ 1 2017-01-31 00:00:00 2017-01-31 00:00:00 300 4 wheel status _______ 0 Likewise, I have information(nearly a million rows) on all vehicles entering a place and exiting the same place. status can be either 1 or 0 for all of these. last_veh_time is the last vehicle passed the same place before how much time. I want to know the probability of a getting status 0 for a vehicle based on entry_time and last_veh_time . So here my response is status and which will be my dependent variable?Is it entry_time and last_veh_time?Any help is appreciated
