This is what I always use (haven't tested it on SL though, just on WPF): /// /// This method registers a callback on a dependency object to be called /// when the value of the DP changes. /// /// The owning object. /// The DependencyProperty to watch. /// The action to call out when the DP changes. public static void RegisterDepPropCallback(object owner, DependencyProperty property, EventHandler handler) { // FIXME: We could implement this as an extension, but let's not get // too Ruby-like var dpd = DependencyPropertyDescriptor.FromProperty(property, owner.GetType()); dpd.AddValueChanged(owner, handler); }
