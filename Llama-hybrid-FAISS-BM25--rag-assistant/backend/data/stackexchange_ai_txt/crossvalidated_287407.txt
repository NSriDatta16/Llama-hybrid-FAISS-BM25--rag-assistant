t test p value vs randomization-inference p value: What can we learn from comparison?

How can we interpret differences between t test p values and randomization-inference p values? Let’s say we have a randomized experiment with a binary treatment, denoted $Z_i = 1$ if unit $i$ is assigned to treatment, and outcomes, denoted $Y_i$. We want test for a treatment effect. We test both the sharp null hypothesis of no effect and the null hypothesis of no average effect. Definition $H_{0,sharp}$: Sharp null hypothesis of no effect The treatment effect is zero for all subjects. Formally, $Y_i(1) = Y_i(0)$ for all $i$. Definition $H_{0,weak}$: Null hypothesis of no average effect (sometimes called the weak null hypothesis ) The average treatment effect is zero. Formally, $\mu_{Y(1)} = \mu_{Y(0)}$. We test $H_{0,sharp}$ using randomization inference (RI) and we test $H_{0,weak}$ with a t test. If we run these two tests and get different answers, what are useful ways to interpret differences between the t test p value and the RI p value? Strictly speaking, the two procedures test different hypotheses and they cannot be meaningfully compared, but this is not very useful, and will not satisfy non-specialists (people with substantive rather than technical interest in your research) who want to understand why your results look different when using RI or a t test. Furthermore, the two tests are alternative approaches to answer the same substantive question, “was there a treatment effect?” We should have a guidelines for thinking about different answers to the same substantive question. A good answer would have a general enough discussion of differences to encompass differences in p values that would lead us to different statistical conclusions (e.g., one test p 0.05) and those that would lead to make the same conclusion from both tests (e.g., both tests p 0.05). Notes on RI For those unfamiliar with RI: The RI p value is calculated by, first, computing the distribution of the test statistic across all (or many) treatment assignments, which is called the null or randomization distribution. The RI p value denotes the proportion of the randomization distribution that is larger than our observed test statistic. ( More discussion here, particularly page 5. ) We can conduct RI by calculate the test statistic for all possible permuted treatment assignment vectors (to calculate an exact RI p value) or using a large sample of permuted treatment assignment vectors (to calculate an asymptotic RI p value). As Gerber and Green (2012) write, “Whether one uses all possible randomizations or a large sample of them, the calculation of p values based on an inventory of possible randomizations is called randomization inference .
