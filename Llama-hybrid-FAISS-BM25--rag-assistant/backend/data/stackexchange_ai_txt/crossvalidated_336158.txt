Q. Am I applying these steps in the correct way / correct order? In other words, when I scale the features, should I apply scaling to the whole data set rather than splitting the normal and anomalous observations then scaling each independently? Your Step 1 is incorrect. Other than scaling the normal and faulty data separately, you should scale the normal data, and use the mean and variance of the normal set to scale the faulty data. For anomaly detection with PCA, you do want to see if the test data has the same mean and variance with your nominal data. Your approach now is incorrect because imagine that you have normal and fautly data set with same variance but different mean, if you scale them separately your will get the same standard normal distribution and the difference in mean will be discarded. Q. Should I apply PCA to only the normal data set, then apply the learned mapping to the anomalous data set? Or alternatively, apply PCA to the entire data set? What you did now is correct. You should apply PCA to only the nromal data set and use that model for the faulty data set. Side Question: Does PCA generally perform better / worse with categorical features? Will attempting to fit multivariate normal distributions to such categorical data (after performing PCA) generally perform well or poorly - is there any intuition behind this? Normally PCA can be applied for any kind of data set, but the intrinsic assumption behind PCA is that the data follow Gaussian distribution. So it might not be appropriate to use PCA for mixed type of data. But for anomaly detection performance, PCA might still give a reasonable results depends on your data. Please see the link Can principal component analysis be applied to datasets containing a mix of continuous and categorical variables? for more discussions.
