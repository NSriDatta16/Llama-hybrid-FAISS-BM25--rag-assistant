This is a vertical bar chart . The bars probably indicate averages within each group (and the numbers above each bar seem to give the same information). The length of the whiskers usually gives the standard error of the mean (although it could also give the standard deviation - this should ideally be noted in the figure caption). If this is so, you can back-calculate the standard deviation by multiplying the length of the whisker by the square root of the group size. For instance, the whisker of the first bar looks like it is about 25% long, so the SD would be $25\times \sqrt{27}\%\approx 130\%$ . Note that then the mean minus one SD would be negative, which may be meaningless. So keep the context in mind.
