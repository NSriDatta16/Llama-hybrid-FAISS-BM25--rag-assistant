Group is a factor. So, so called 'reference level' is chosen for it (by default this would be its first level: Group1 ). All the coefficients of the model can be interpreted as a difference between 'modelled' and 'reference' level. So, in you case: (Intercept) is parameter for Group1 , so Y is on average equal 0.30604 for subject in Group1 in TP =0 Y is larger by, on average, 0.05211 in Group2 than in Group1 given TP is equal in both groups (= in the same timepoint) Y is samller by, on average, 0.06066 in Group3 than in Group1 given TP is equal in both groups
