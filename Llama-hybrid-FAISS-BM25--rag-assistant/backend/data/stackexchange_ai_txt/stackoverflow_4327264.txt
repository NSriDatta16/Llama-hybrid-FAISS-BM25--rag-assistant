Anujprashar, there is no easy answer to your question. The different densities specifications (hdpi, mdpi, ldpi) just refer to an average range of densities (i.e. hdpi is around 240 ppi). However, hdpi could refer to a large number of different resolutions (e.g. Motorola Droid is hdpi, resolution 480x854; Nexus One is hdpi, resolution 480x800). So there is no fixed size image you can use to fit perfectly all devices full screen. My suggestion is if at all possible, either avoid using a layout that requires the images to be the exact size of the screen, or instead provide an image larger than the majority of the resolutions for that target density (e.g. 500x900) leaving extra margins that may be cropped off (think of it as a bleed, if you're familiar with that concept for print). Or more simply, if you do not require them to be displayed 1:1 at their original pixel resolution, you can simply set the scaleType of an ImageView to centerCrop , and its width and height to fill_parent . This will expand (or condense) the image to fit the container, cropping off pixels if the aspect ratio is not correct. The more difficult (and far less efficient) method would be to have a different image for each screen resolution, and a method in your onCreate() to retrieve the screen dimensions and set the image according to the values you get back.
