MDP in OpenAI Gym?

I'm reading through reinforcement learning literature; anything 2016 or more recent makes heavy usage of the library OpenAI Gym. The tutorials and content with most visibility is centered around robotics, Atari games, and other flashy applications of RL. I'm simply trying to use OpenAI Gym to leverage RL to solve a Markov Decision Process. Is there tutorial on how to implement an MDP in OpenAI Gym? As some examples of the sort of MDPs I'll be working with: Optimal per channel marketing budget, traveling salesman problem, etc.
