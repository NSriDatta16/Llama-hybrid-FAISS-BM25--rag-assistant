Best practices for TDD and reporting

I am trying to become more familiar with test driven approaches. One drawback for me is that a major part of my code is generated context for reporting (PDF documents, chart images). There is always a complex designer involved and there is no easy test of correctness. No chance to test just fragments! Do you know TDD practices for this situation?
