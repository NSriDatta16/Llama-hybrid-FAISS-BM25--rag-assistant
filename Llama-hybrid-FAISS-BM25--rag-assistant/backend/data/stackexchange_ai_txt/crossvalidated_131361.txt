A paper that proves using the latent features of RBM as input to logistic regression?

I'm looking for a paper that includes a proof that simply training a Restricted Boltzmann Machine and then using the latent features as input to a logistic regression classifier is a correct thing and makes sense. The thing is that I know that training deep belief networks is done in a different way than the described procedure I mentioned above. Since the training involves pretraining, fine-tuning and then using a Softmax function. However, this tutorial from scikit-learn is merely using the procedure I described: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/plot_rbm_logistic_classification.html I'm looking for a paper that justifies the procedure in the tutorial. Or at least that justifies that the latent features of a Restricted Boltzmann Machine are better than the original features.
