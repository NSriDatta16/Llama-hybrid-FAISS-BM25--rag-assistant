I'm not familiar with all the methods you mention, but what you choose should depend primarily on the nature of your input data. Are you analysing pure tones, or does your input source have multiple notes? Is speech a feature of your input? Are there any limitations on the length of time you have to sample the input? Are you able to trade off some accuracy for speed? To some extent what you choose also depends on whether you would like to perform your calculations in time or in frequency space . Converting a time series to a frequency representation takes time, but in my experience tends to give better results. Autocorrelation compares two signals in the time domain. A naive implementation is simple but relatively expensive to compute, as it requires pair-wise differencing between all points in the original and time-shifted signals, followed by differentiation to identify turning points in the autocorrelation function, and then selection of the minimum corresponding to the fundamental frequency. There are alternative methods. For example, Average Magnitude Differencing is a very cheap form of autocorrelation, but accuracy suffers. All autocorrelation techniques run the risk of octave errors, since peaks other than the fundamental exist in the function. Measuring zero-crossing points is simple and straightforward, but will run into problems if you have multiple waveforms present in the signal. In frequency-space, techniques based on FFT may be efficient enough for your purposes. One example is the harmonic product spectrum technique, which compares the power spectrum of the signal with downsampled versions at each harmonic, and identifies the pitch by multiplying the spectra together to produce a clear peak. As ever, there is no substitute for testing and profiling several techniques, to empirically determine what will work best for your problem and constraints. An answer like this can only scratch the surface of this topic. As well as the earlier links, here are some relevant references for further reading.
