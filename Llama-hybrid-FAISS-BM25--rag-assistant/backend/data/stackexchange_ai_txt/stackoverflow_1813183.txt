It will not be possible to move the development database into production. Once a database file has been upgraded to the SQL 2008 format, it is impossible to downgrade to SQL 2000 format. You should focus your development on creating T-SQL scripts instead of creating database objects. This includes initial database creation and any subsequent schema changes. Perhaps you can use a version based approach for your schema and catalog data. As long as you don't use any SQL 2008 specific functionality, the scripts will run fine on SQL 2000. Setting the db compatibility level to 80 on development will help making the behavior of the 2008 server closer to the 2000 server, but it does not mean the 2008 specific features will not be usable. You have to pay attention and make sure every functionality and feature you use in development will also be available in SQL 2000.
