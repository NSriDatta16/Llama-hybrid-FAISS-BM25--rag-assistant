Impulse responses - Mean, Median or Point estimate?

Im thinking about what is the most reasonable way to plot impulse responses in a simple OLS VAR model independent of the identification strategy. ${Y}_t = A_1{Y}_{t-1}+ U_t$ I have learned that the response of $y_1$ in period 1 is the shock in $u_1t$ . In the following periods the reaction is a combination of the one time shock $u$ and how it interact with the Variables $Y_t$ : Reaction of $y_1$ in Period 2 is $u_1$ * $a_1$ etc. (see LÃ¼tkepohl 2007 p.52). For the construction of the confidence intervalls a bootstrap is used. This procedure would be a "point estimate". Diving deeper in Econometrics I found different VAR libraries which use a slighly different procedure: Calculate a IRF as mentioned above. Calculate the confidence intervalls with the bootstrap Use the mean or median over all bootstrap samples to calculate the impulse responses. It reminds me a little of a Bayesian approach. This could have the advantage that the irf is always within the confidence interval. This could be avoided. The drawback is that I am no longer able to test the point estimator? Can anyone confirm my thoughts? Are there significant differences between the methods or are both approaches acceptable? Mean response Point Estimator
