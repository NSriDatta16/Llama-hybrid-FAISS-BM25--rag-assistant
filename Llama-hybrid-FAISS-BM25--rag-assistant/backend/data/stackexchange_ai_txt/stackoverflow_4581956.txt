MSChart with 2 data series - solve in SQL query?

I have an MSChart control bound to a SQL query (single series). All good. What I need now is to show two separate data series' as separate lines on the chart. I can write separate queries to each return one of the data sets but I don't believe I can bind the chart control to two separate sqldatasources. What I can do currently is write the following query. The two data series are for the average rating of products in two different price bands - 4 and 5 ($0-$10 and >=$10). SELECT band, AVG(L.rating) as Avg_Rating, date FROM PriceBand P join ListItem L on L.price >= P.loprice and L.price 3 group by band, loprice, hiprice, date order by date, band which returns data in this form: 2010-12-01 | 4 | 3.1 2010-12-01 | 5 | 3.6 2010-12-02 | 4 | 3.3 2010-12-02 | 5 | 3.9 Date, series, Value I believe I may need to get it to look like the following. Date, Value[4], Value[5]. Question 1: Am I correct in the best way to organize the data in order to create the 2-value line chart? Question 2: If so, how can I rework the query to create that output? Thanks to all for taking the time to read this and/or assist. -Dan
