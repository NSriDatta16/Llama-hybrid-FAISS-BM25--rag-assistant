I recommend you don't store any info for this - it should work from a priori info, such as the system time as suggested by Jeffrey Kemp. This will make it much more stable and work across more user agents. Getting a unix time stamp for instance, will allow you to change the background on a per second basis. Remember that some users have slower connections, and may not load the background image immediately. A simple way would be to use a setInterval that iterates through an array of images every 30 minutes, and resets after the last image is chosen.
