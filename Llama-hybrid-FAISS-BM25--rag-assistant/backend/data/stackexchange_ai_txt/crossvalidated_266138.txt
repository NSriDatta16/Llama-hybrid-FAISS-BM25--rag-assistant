You can incorporate cost sensitivity using the sampsize function in the randomForest package. model1=randomForest(DependentVariable~., data=my_data, sampsize=c(100,20)) Vary the figures (100,20) based on the data you have and the assumptions/business rules you are working with. It takes a bit of a trial and error approach to get a confusion matrix that reflects the costs of classification error. Have a look at Richard Berk's Criminal Forecasts of Risk: A Machine Learning Approach , p. 82.
