As for .NET vs something else, it really doesn't matter on the web as you should never require users to install a framework to use your website. The users should see only standard HTML/CSS/Javascript that any modern browser can render. Flash is ubiquitous enough that you're somewhat safe in using it, but you still should not require it. You can have your pretty Flash front end, but you should provide a fully functional HTML version available. Same goes for Silverlight, but know that it enjoys much less coverage than Flash. If your site design is going to encourage users to have a particular bit of software, why not have it encourage the use of an HTML5 compliant browser instead?
