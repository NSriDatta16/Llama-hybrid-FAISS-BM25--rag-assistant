In Spring Roo : what is a dynamic finder?

I am getting a look at the Spring Web framework with Roo. And, I am looking at the vote.roo supplied in the sample directory. This line called my attention: finder list --class com.springsource.vote.domain.Vote --depth 2 --filter reg,betw,IpEq In Spring Roo : what is a dynamic finder ? What does mean this line? Thanks
