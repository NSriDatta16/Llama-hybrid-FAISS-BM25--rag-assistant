Bayesian posterior for Geometric Distribution

I have the following homework problem I am trying to solve for but am stuck with the posterior part. Note the the geometric distribution is a discrete distribution that has a probability mass function of the form $$\text{Pr}(X = k) = (1 - p)^k \cdot p;\quad k = 0,1,2,...;\, 0 Perform a Bayesian analysis for the parameter $p$ . For the prior distribution, I use a beta distribution with hyperparameters $a = 9$ and $b = 3$ . Part a) What is E[p], the prior expected value of p? Part b) Now suppose that I obtain 5 observations with values {6, 9, 8, 12, 7} Calculate the posterior hyperparameters a* and b*. Part c) What is E[ p | Data ], the posterior expectation of p? Part d) Is the beta distribution a conjugate prior for the geometric distribution? Essentially I am trying to do a beta-geometric model with the following information... I figured out part A simply by using the beta to solve for E[p] = a/(a+b) = 9/(9+3) = .75. "Hope that's right"... now just need help with part b-d.
