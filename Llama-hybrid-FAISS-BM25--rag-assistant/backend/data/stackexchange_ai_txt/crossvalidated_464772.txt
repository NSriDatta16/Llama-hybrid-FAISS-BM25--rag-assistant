Comparing weights between significant predictors in GLM with binomial outcome

I need to compare the explanatory power of several predictor variables $\{x_1,x_2,x_3\} \in \mathbb{R}$ for a response variable $y$ . For this problem, we can use logistic regression as a generalized linear model: $$logit(p_i) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1,i + \beta_2 x_2,i + \beta_3 x_3,i + \beta_4 x_4,i$$ $\forall i \in [1,N]$ , where $N$ is the number of observations. Any statistical software can fit the model and provide weights and p-values for each predictor in the model. What is the simplest method to compare the resulting weights that are significant? From my reading, it appears one method of making the weights comparable in standard GLM approaches is to scale $\beta_j$ by the standard deviation of the predictor variable: $$\beta_j' = \beta_j \sigma_j$$ However, is this approach still valid for a GLM with binomial response variable? If not, is there another straightforward way to do this?
