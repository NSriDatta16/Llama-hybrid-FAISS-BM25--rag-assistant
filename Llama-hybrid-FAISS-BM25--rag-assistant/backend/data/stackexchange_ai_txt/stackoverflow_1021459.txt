I don't know if this will help you, but you could get information about the state of a Java thread on your machine using local attach. 1) Add the tools.jar to your classpath and use VirtualMachine.list() to get a list of the running JVM on you machine. 2) Attach to the JVM processed using VirtualMachine.attach(virtualMachineDescriptor) 3) Get the local connector address, vm.getAgentProperties().get("com.sun.management.jmxremote.localConnectorAddress"); 4) Use JMXConnectorFactory.newJMXConnector(...) to connect to the JVM 5) From the JMX connection lookup up the ThreadMXBean 6) From the ThreadMXBean you get an array of ThreadInfos that describes all threads in the JVM. 7) From TheadInfo#getThreadState() you can check if the state is ThreadState.BLOCKED
