For getting the date from the user, certainly use UIDatePicker. For saving it, first consider using Core Data instead of sqlite directly. But if you insist, the easiest would probably be to convert the NSDate to a double using timeIntervalSinceReferenceDate for storage, and use [NSDate dateWithTimeIntervalSinceReferenceDate:...] to get back the NSDate when loading from the database.
