You have a few options: The .Net settings object. This brings with it additional features such as serialization. Makes sense if this is some kind of application setting that your entire app should have access too. You can store is under Window1's Resource collection. Then use the FindResource(...) in the UserControl to find the object. This makes is so that the dictionary is accessible to all element's in Window1's sub tree. You can leverage UserControl's Tag property. I wouldn't recommend it.
