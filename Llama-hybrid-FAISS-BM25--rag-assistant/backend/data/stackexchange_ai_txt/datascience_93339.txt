I suggest hugging face is a good try although I have little experience using it. If it ultimately does not work well, you can also try NLTK, gensim and SpaCy. They are all widely used in NLP. Here is a demo notebook that I found: https://www.kaggle.com/thebrownviking20/topic-modelling-with-spacy-and-scikit-learn Hope it helps and best luck to your exploration!
