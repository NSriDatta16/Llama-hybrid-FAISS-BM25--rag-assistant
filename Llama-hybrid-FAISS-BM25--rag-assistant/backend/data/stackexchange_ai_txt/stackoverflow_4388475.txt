Extracting an html fragment from an html document

I'm looking for an efficient means of extracting an html "fragment" from an html document. My first implementation of this used the Html Agility Pack. This appeared to be a reasonable way to attack this problem, until I started running the extraction on large html documents - performance was very poor for something so trivial (I'm guessing due to the amount of time it was taking to parse the entire document). Can anyone suggest a more efficient means of achieving my goal? To summarize: For my purposes, an html "fragment" is defined as all content inside of the tags of an html document Ideally, I'd like to return the content unaltered if it didn't contain an or (I'll assume I was passed an html fragment to begin with) I have the entire html document available in memory (as a string), I won't be streaming it on demand - so a potential solution won't need to worry about that. Performance is critical, so a potential solution should account for this. Sample Input: blah My content Desired Output: My content A solution in C# or VB.NET would be welcome.
