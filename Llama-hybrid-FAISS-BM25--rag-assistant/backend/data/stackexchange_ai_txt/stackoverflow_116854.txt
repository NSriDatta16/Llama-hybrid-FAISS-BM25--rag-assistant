Getting started with rails? Must have gems?

I'm starting work on a project using Rails, but I'm waiting for the 3rd edition of the pragmatic rails book to come out before I purchase a book. Anyway, my question is a bit more pointed than how do I get started... What are some of the must have gems that everyone uses? I need basic authentication, so I have the restful authentication gem, but beyond that, I don't know what I don't know. Is there a run down of this information somewhere? Some basic setup that 99% of the people start with when starting a new rails application? Thanks in advance.
