MSBuild task for combining NUnit or MSTest XML results

I have a set of NUnit XML result files (produced by xUnit.NET via the NUnitXml parameter to the Xunit.Runner.MSBuild.xunit msbuild task pretty much as in How do I get Team Build to show test results and coverage for xUnit.net test suite? and http://jonnekats.wordpress.com/2009/05/07/integrate-xunit-tests-into-your-daily-team-build/ ) The script publishes each of the test runs individually, which is slow as it pulls in all the TestResults artifacts each time. Thus I'd like to combine them into a single consolidated set on the client side first prior to submission [to TFS using mstest.exe with the /publish parameter]. xUnit.net has a CombineXunitXml Task which is invoked in xunit.tests.msbuild as follows:- Does anyone know of an equivalent task to merge NUnit result files in a similar way? (I'm guessing this doesnt arise as commonly as the NUnit task takes multiple assemblies in its Assemblies parameter whereas xUnit.net has a singular Assembly parameter).
