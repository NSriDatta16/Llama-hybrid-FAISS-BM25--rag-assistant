Your model seems to be generating a noisy naive forecast i.e.: $\hat{Y}_{t+1} = Y_t + Noise(t)$, I don't think RF is a good approach for this. You might want to try a random walk model which would be a more "intelligent" way of doing a naive forecast. Or better still you might want to use Bayesian Structural Time Series since you data seems to be composed of local trends combined with sudden shifts in direction (i.e. structural breaks).
