Google (not a search, actually them) seems to think that it does cause a performance hit. Also, the Mozilla foundation has an article " Writing Efficient CSS for use in the Mozilla UI " that outlines the possible performance pitfalls of CSS selectors in their browser(s), and how to optimize your style rules for their rendering engine. Their article has tons of examples of what's good and what's bad. Please keep in mind this is only relevant to their browsers, though. There are also some benchmarks publicly available, about CSS selectors affect on rendering speeds: http://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2009/03/10/performance-impact-of-css-selectors/ http://blog.archive.jpsykes.com/153/more-css-performance-testing-pt-3/ I, however, think this is, for the most part, horse manure. You can effect FAR greater change on your page's loading/rendering speed by using some other simple optimizations. I believe that your sanity, and a well-organized code base should come first. If this were as big of a deal as some make it out to be, we'd all be back using HTML
