WPF: FixedDocument in Visual Studio 2008 Designer

It's a well-known bug that Visual Studio shows an error when you try to construct a FixedDocument in XAML. For example, the following snippet Hello World! compiles and runs perfectly fine, but Visual Studio shows an error in the error list ( Property 'Pages' does not support values of type 'PageContent'. ) This is quite annoying. I'm looking for a solution that allows me to construct my documents in a XAML file in Visual Studio without getting that error message. I've found a workaround, which I'd like to share below as an answer, but I'm curious if there's a better (more elegant) solution around.
