This is a horribly formatted question. Please break this massive paragraph down into smaller paragraphs. I really do not get what you are asking. Maybe number the steps you are trying to do and what the issue is at each step. Some possible answers is that you could use the iPhone 3.0 Mapkit which will allow you to embed maps. Or MKReverseGeocoder which will take a latitude and longitude point and convert it to the address of the nearest place mark which is pretty neat. John.
