By IO I assume you mean disk IO... and assuming you can fit everything into memory comfortably . You could: Disable swap on your box† Use mysql MEMORY tables while you are processing, (or perhaps consider using an Sqlite3 in memory store if you are only using the database for the convenience of SQL queries) Also: unless you are using EBS I didn't think Amazon charged for IO on your instance. EBS is much slower than your instance storage so only use it when you need the persistance, ie. not while you are crunching data. †probably bad idea
