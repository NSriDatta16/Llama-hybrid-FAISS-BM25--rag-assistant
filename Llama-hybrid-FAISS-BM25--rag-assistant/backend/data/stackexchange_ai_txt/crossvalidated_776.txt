This may be slightly controversial, but certainly most of the examples that you give are not statistics (some of these would more properly fall under machine learning): Statistics usually covers the scenario where you are making inferences something when you only have a subset of the data (hence the use of things like the p-value ). The goal is to come to a deeper understanding of the underlying process that generates the data. In the examples that you provide, the goal is to perform some kind of action; whether the model itself is an accurate depiction of the underlying process is completely irrelevant so long as the predictions are accurate. See my related question about the difference between machine learning and statistics.
