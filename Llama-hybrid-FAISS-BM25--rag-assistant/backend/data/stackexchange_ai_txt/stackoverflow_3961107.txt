Using Paperclip with files already on Amazon s3

I am building a Rails application that works with videos. I am using an encoding service that encodes my video and places the encoded file along with some thumbnails in a specified location on my s3. I am able to access the video via AWS:S3 like so: AWS::S3::S3Object.find 'videos/36/base/video.mp4', 'my-bucket-name' -- or -- AWS::S3::S3Object.value 'videos/36/base/video.mp4', 'my-bucket-name' What I would like to do is manage these files with Paperclip once I get notified from my encoding service that the encoding is complete. Not sure how to do this. Here is what I have so far: class Encoding ':s3_domain_url', :path => 'videos/:video_id/:encoding_type/basename.:extension', :storage => :s3, :s3_credentials => {:access_key_id => AppConfig.s3.access_key_id, :secret_access_key => AppConfig.s3.secret_access_key, :bucket => AppConfig.s3.bucket }, :s3_permissions => 'authenticated-read', :s3_protocol => 'http' end class Video Thanks! Really appreciate your help -- jonathan
