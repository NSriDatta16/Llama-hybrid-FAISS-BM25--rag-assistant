Is there a muti index container for the harddisk storage rather than memory?

I need a muti index container based on red-black trees (something like boost::multi_index::multi_index_container ) for the case of the harddisk storage. All data must be store on hard disk rather than in memory. Is there an open source container such that described conditions hold? Note. I use C++ .
