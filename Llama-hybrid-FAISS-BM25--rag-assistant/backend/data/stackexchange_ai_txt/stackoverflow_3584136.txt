First, with respect to the product import (product, stock data), make sure to do the real data saving inside of Magento. There have been changes to the catalog implementation in the past, and it's likely with a framework like Magento that there will be more. Keeping it inside the framework will reduce the likelihood of it simply no longer operating and you getting a very unpleasant phone call. Another advantage to this approach is that, in contrast to the API approach, the native code will not try to spin up the entire framework for every request. This is expensive and to be avoided. Depending on how many products there are, you may need to break the script into multiple executions due to memory leaks when saving catalog products. Don't tie the stock checks to a catalog page view. Some web crawler will come eat your lunch. Finally, there's no easy FTP library built into Magento, but throwing that on another cronjob and using system calls to perform the actual (S)FTP call is possibly your easiest option. Hope that helps! Thanks, Joe
