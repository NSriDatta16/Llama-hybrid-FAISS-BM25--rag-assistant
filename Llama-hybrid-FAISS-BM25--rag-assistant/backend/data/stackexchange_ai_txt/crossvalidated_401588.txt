Best book for statistical inference (Self-study)

I want to develop some skills in statistical inference for a career in data science or machine learning. I purchased the book "All of Statistics" which is a good book, but there are not answer keys online, which makes it difficult to check whether or not I am doing things correctly. Can anyone suggest books that are similar, but have exercise answers available.
