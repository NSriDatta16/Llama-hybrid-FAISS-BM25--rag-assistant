I've done some more reading and I believe the explanation is that: indeed if the underlying MDP is assumed stationary, and the episodes have finite horizon because each trajectory is guaranteed (almost surely) to reach some absorbing state, then indeed the returns after the first visit to a state are i.i.d. over different episodes. My confusion came from considering finite-horizon settings where the time horizon $T$ is fixed, rather than dependent on the trajectory of the episode. This case is not what is considered here.
