As a start I would go for a random effects model with districts nested within cities, and then for each district a random intercept. Then the few districts with only one or very few observations should not be a problem. With 39000 observations and only a few covariates I would just use them all, avoid feature selection, see for instance Why is variable selection necessary? . Spline variables such as salary and age, and use relevant interactions! You seem to want some flexible model, like a neural network? I'm not sure what much sense that make with 39000 observations, start first with flexible linear mixed models and evaluate the results. But there is an R package Buddle for neural networks with random effecs, and google gives a lot of hits .
