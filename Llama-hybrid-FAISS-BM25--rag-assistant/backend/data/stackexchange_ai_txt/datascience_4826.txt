Suppose that a forum post has, on average, 2000 characters, which is more or less the equivalent of a page of text, than the total memory needed is 10MB if text is ASCII. Even if the text is Unicode encoded in an Asian language it will take 40MB. This is far too little for modern computers, so a simple text format is the best since it can be parsed in the fastest way, and loaded into RAM all at once.
