Gamma-normal distribution as prior

When I study the Bayesian econometrics, the book firstly introduces Gamma-Normal distribution as (conjugate) prior, then the posterior will have the same distribution as the prior. But my question is, why can't we use other simple distribution as prior for the introduction example, such as normal distribution, why do we have to use a such as strange 'compound' distribution?
