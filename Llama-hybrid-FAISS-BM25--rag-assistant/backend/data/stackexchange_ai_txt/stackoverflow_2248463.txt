The SQLite format is identical between Mac and iPhone applications with the same data model. It's pretty trivial to generate a Mac application to edit your database (I do this for my iPhone application). In fact, you can take your data model and quickly drag and drop an interface for it (from the Core Data Programming Guide FAQ ): In Mac OS X v10.5 and later, in Interface Builder you can drag a Core Data Entity item from the Library onto a window or box. Interface Builder then presents a panel that allows you to select the entity you want from the currently-open Xcode projects. Note that you can also create and configure an NSController instance in Interface Builder. As in the case of creating a user interface, you Option-click an entity in the Data Modeling tool in Xcode (or select the Core Data Entity item from the Library), but you drag it to a the Interface Builder file window. For editing one object, an NSObjectController instance is created; for editing many objects, an NSArrayController instance is created. I'd also check out Core Data Editor , which loads in your compiled managed object model and lets you edit your database from that.
