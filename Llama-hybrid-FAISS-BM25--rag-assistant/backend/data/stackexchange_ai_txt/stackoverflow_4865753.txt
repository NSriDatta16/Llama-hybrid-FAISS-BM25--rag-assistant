mysql - search timestamp by hour of day

I have a column named updatetime that is a timestamp . So, for example, an average looking value could be: 2011-02-01 09:00:51 . I want to be able to search through and return all results for a particular hour of the day regardless of the date. For example if I searched the column for values BETWEEN 09:00:00 AND 09:59:99 it would return: 2011-02-01 09:00:51 2011-01-31 09:20:51 2011-01-11 09:55:44 etc.... SELECT * FROM table WHERE updatetime ...... Thoughts?
