ELI5 version: Consider a neural network having 1M parameters for classifying cat-dog. We can assume each parameter of 1M as a linear line fitting a yes/no question for features like if the img has tail, claws etc. what happens here is we have more than enough questions/parameters to infer if a given img is cat/dog and we learn extra information including background etc which can be in train distribution and may not be in validation distribution.
