var query1 = from a in DB.Table1 select new { Id = a.Id, Average = a.B.Average() }; var query2 = from b in DB.Table2 join c in query1 on b.Id equals c.Id select c; Just freehanded it, so it might not actually work, but is that the kind of thing you're trying to do? That would result in a single SQL query being created when query2 was used.
