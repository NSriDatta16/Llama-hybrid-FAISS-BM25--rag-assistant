Based on your first statement, It's splitting pages in the middle of words and HTML tags it appears that your character count is being done after markup is inserted. That would imply that e.g. long URLs in links would be counted against the page length you're trying to achieve. However, you didn't say how the articles were being created initially. I'd suggest looking for a point in the process of creating the article where you could examine the raw text. By regarding the actual content (without markup) as a set of paragraphs, and estimating the vertical length of each paragraph based on typical number of characters per line, you can come up with a more consistent sizing. I would also consider only breaking between paragraphs, to keep units of thought together on the same page. Speaking as a reader, I really hate going to sites that force me to pause, hit a button or link, and wait for a page reload, all in the middle of a single thought.
