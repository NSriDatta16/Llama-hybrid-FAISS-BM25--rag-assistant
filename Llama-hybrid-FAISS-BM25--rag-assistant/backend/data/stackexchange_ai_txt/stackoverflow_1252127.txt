Shouldn't the contest organizer be telling you how they want everything rated? I would personally count the number of youtube submissions, add the score for each, then divide by the number to get their average score, and then suppliment that somehow by social media mentions, but it is up to them to tell you which should carry more weight. They have to understand that you can design the app to do whatever they want, but they are in charge of letting you know what precisely they want. That sort of decision should not be left up to the designer. Let them wrestle with it in committee for a bit, don't sweat the actual algorithm until they come up with the answer for you.
