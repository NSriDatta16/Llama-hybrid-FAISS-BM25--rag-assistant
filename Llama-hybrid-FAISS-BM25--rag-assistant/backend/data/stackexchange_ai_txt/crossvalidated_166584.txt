A Regression to predict tennis player's service point win percentage - Which of these two models makes more sense?

I am conducting a regression in order to predict a tennis player's service point win % i.e. the percentage of points he wins when he is the server. Model 1 If my DV data lies in the range 0.3-0.9, does it make sense to use a logistic regression? If using logistic I would endeavor to build a model with serve win % as my DV and my IV's as: +average serve win % of last n matches (maybe n=5 or 10) to account for form +surface +player ranking +opposition ranking ..... Would this be a good model to use? Preliminary logistic regressions just involving serve win % regressed on surface + player ranking + opponent ranking ... are showing some strange results so im losing faith in logistic for this data. An alternative I'm considering is to use raw variables in a linear regression type model with interactions.... Along the lines of Aiken & West 1991 My dependent variable will be number of service points won in match, and my independent variables will be: +no. service points played in match +the surface the match played on +the player's ranking points +the opponents ranking points +an interaction between player and opponent ranking points +an interaction between surface and no. points played +average service points won in last n matches +average % of service points won in last m matches Do either of these models stand out as smart or appropriate ways to model this data? For context, for each player I have between 100-350 matches worth of data. I would love to hear what you guys think, or if you have any other suggestions on how to predict serve win % using the stated variables I would really appreciate it. I'm conducting this analysis in R so any code/package suggestions would also be great
