Can we predict sales using time series or Regression

Input : I have a dataset that has sale from the last three years and does not have any missing information along with some other features like Date, Promotion, Store_number, Public_holiday_indicator, Promotion_running, weather etc. The dataset ranges from 1st Jan 2017 to 1st Jan 2020 Output : What I want to predict is, sales for the next two month i.e. 2nd Jan to 2nd March 2020 My question is that is this a regression problem as I have got other features that impacts the sales or is this a time series problem as I have got a time bound data and there are no missing values in the Date column. Or Can I solve this using both the approaches and choose the one which has better results?
