Possible relationship between PHP Mailer and Mailer-Daemon

I am using the PHPMailer Class from a website which sends confirmation of the user ajax upload to my client. This uses the mail.myclient.com SMTP Host. This is the same SMTP Host that my client uses for his outlook to check his emails. This email from the website gets sent without errors although I have received two emails from my client regarding Mail delivery failed: returning message to sender for the same address I have used to send confirmation emails out from. Can these two issues be related? Do I need to provide more info? Thanks a bunch!
