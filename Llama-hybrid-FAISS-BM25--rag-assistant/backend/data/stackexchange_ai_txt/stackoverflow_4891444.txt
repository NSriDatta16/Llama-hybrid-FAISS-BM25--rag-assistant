Detect version of the plugin in Chrome browser

I have NPAPI plugin and I want to detect its version before I embed it into web page. If version is not the latest one I want to show some message that asks users to update the plugin. Now it's implemented in the following way if (navigator.mimeTypes && navigator.mimeTypes["application/myplugin"]) { { // some code here if(navigator.plugins["myplugin"] && navigator.plugins["myplugin"].version >= latest_version) { // we have the latest version (embed the plugin into web page) document.write (" "); } else { document.write ("Show message here"); } // some code } The problem is that navigator.plugins["myplugin"].version works fine in Firefox but not in Chrome. Chrome doesn't expose version property. I can add my own property in NPAPI code, but I don't see the way I can use it before embedding the plugin into page. Is there any workaround? Thanks in advance, Andrew
