Unless the Console view of Eclipse utilizes an appropriate font with the necessary glyphs, it is possible that the Japanese characters appear mangled, for that is the behavior of most applications - any glyph for a Unicode character that is absent in the font, will appear as a question mark. One of the possible solutions is to change the font utilized in the debug console, to one that supports display of most Unicode characters, especially characters in the ISO-8859-1 and the Hiragana or Katagana character sets. In Eclipse, this can be configured from Window -> Preferences -> General -> Apperance -> Colors and Fonts, and by changing the font of the Debug Console (or the Terminal console, I'm not sure which).
