How can we model variable interactions using neural network?

I have 2 independent events as months and tenure and dependent variable 1/0. Does neural network automatically handles interactions, or do we need to tweak it to handle interactions? e.g. I want to model that at certain months and tenure combinations event rates are higher than other combinations. I want such combinations to be modeled. Can neural network approximate this surface?
