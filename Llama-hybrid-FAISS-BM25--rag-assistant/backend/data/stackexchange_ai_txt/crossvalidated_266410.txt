Normally distributed errors and the central limit theorem

In Wooldridge's Introductory Econometrics there's a quote: The argument justifying the normal distribution for the errors usually runs something like this: because $u$ is the sum of many different unobserved factors affecting $y$, we can invoke the central limit theorem to conclude that $u$ has an approximate normal distribution. This quote relates to one of the linear model assumptions, namely: $u \sim N(μ, σ^2)$ where $u$ is the error term in the population model. Now, as far as I know, Central Limit Theorem states that the distribution of $Z_i=(\overline{Y_i}-μ)/(σ/√n)$ (where $\overline{Y_i}$ are averages of random samples drawn from any population with mean $μ$ and variance $σ^2$) approaches that of a standard normal variable as $n \rightarrow \infty$. Question: Help me understand how asymptotic normality of $Z_i$ implies $u \sim N(μ, σ^2)$
