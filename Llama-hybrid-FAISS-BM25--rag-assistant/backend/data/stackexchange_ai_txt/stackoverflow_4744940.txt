Is it possible to move Ruby code from the controller in to a '.js.rjs' file?

I am using Ruby on Rails 3 and for a correct organization of my code I would like to have the whole AJAX code related to an action in a respectively 'action.js.rjs' file. For example, if I have code in a controller like this: def action ... format.js { # BEGIN code to move in to the 'action.js.rjs' file responds_to_parent do ... end # END code to move in to the 'action.js.rjs' file } end is it possible to move in some way the 'responds_to_parent' statement or its content from the controller in to the 'action.js.rjs' file and make it to work?
