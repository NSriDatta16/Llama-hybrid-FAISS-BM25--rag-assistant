If you have written it in javascript, well...that always executes on the client side. If you are calculating date through javascript, its too late, that code is gone. To solve this, you would have to make your js function receive data through parameters, and that data should be calculated on the server side. You could do something like. ');"/> javascript:showDate( ); Or more elegantly, get server date in your java class, and write it to request: //formattedDate is defined above, in the format you like the most. Could be a //java.util.date or a String request.setDate("date",formattedDate); And then, in your jsp, using for example, JSTL Or, EDIT : In response to your comment, you should: I have no idea what your time zone is, but I'm sure you do. Calendar.getInstance() takes an instance of TimeZone as a parameter. That should do it Take a look: http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/TimeZone.html http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Calendar.html Interesting link about JSP
