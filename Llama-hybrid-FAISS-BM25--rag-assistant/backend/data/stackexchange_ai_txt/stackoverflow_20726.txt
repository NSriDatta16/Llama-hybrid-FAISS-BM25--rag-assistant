Use the Microsoft Application Verifier . AppVerifier helps to determine: When the application is using APIs correctly: (Unsafe TerminateThread APIs., Correct use of Thread Local Storage (TLS) APIs., o Correct use of virtual space manipulations (for example, VirtualAlloc, MapViewOfFile). Whether the application is hiding access violations using structured exception handling. Whether the application is attempting to use invalid handles. Whether there are memory corruptions or issues in the heap. Whether the application runs out of memory under low resources. Whether the correct usage of critical sections is occurring. Whether an application running in an administrative environment will run well in an environment with less privilege. Whether there are potential problems when the application is running as a limited user. Whether there are uninitialized variables in future function calls in a thread's context.
