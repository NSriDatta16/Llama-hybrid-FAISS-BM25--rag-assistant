Does a theoretical "perfect (accuracy) score" exists we could target for a given dataset?

My question is the following : You have a dataset, and you want to determine theoretically what accuracy score (or other way to measure performance such as AUC, etc.) a "perfect" model could get on test data (or : what average accuracy score you would get with new data). You don't want to find the model, but just what is the best score you can achieve. It is a bit the same than for computer science where you know an algorithm can have a computational complexity of n but you don't know what algorithm. Or in mathematics where you prove something can be proved but you don't prove the actual theorem. Let's take an example : I struggle with a dataset, having poor results. I'm not sure if my poor results come from the fact that I'm a noob and/or it is not possible to infer more from the dataset. So if I could compute what theoretically I could get (X % accuracy score) then I could see if I'm doing well or not. I know the accuracy score depends on data, which data you took for training and test sets respectively, but maybe we could consider accuracy score as the mean accuracy score. Hope this is not a duplicate nor a (completely) dumb question.
