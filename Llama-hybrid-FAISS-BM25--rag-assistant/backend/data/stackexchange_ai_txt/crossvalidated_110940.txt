Can decision tree be used for fraud detection in this way?

A large dataset with more than 100 variables including a target variable. A small portion of target = 1 cases are fraud or due to other errors. I want to identify these target = 1 cases, i.e. fraud or error. Assuming most cases are good, I intend to use decision tree to classify cases. In one leaf with a high percent of target = 0, e.g. in 95% cases target = 0, and in 5% cases target = 1, then I think the 5% cases with target = 1 in this leaf are classification errors that include random error and the error caused by fraudulent behavior, so they can be consider as suspected fraud cases. Does this make sense? As for the decision tree leaves with close percentages of target = 1 and target = 0, e.g. 43% vs. 57%, what can I do? Based on @Zhubarb's suggestion, I made the following changes to the model and its interpretation: Set leaf size, e.g. at least 100 observations in a leaf My goal is to identify fraud at the organization level instead of the individual observation level. Considering the prior probability problem as Zhubarb mentioned, I interpret the decision tree model in a new way: take a leaf with 30% target = 1 and 70% target = 0 for example, and assume the expected positive percentage should be 30% for the individuals in this leaf. Then look at each organization; if in this leaf one organization's positive percentage is much higher than 30%, it can be considered as a suspect organization. In this way, all leaves regardless of whatever positive percentages are high or low can be used. Any comments are appreciated!
