Magento order import/export

Is there any way to import/export the orders from magento. Since we have magento store on live and another dev. version is ready with greatest change now we only need to import the magento orders alone. Here i can see only export - http://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/slandsbek/extension/1350/simple-order-export But how can i import the order data into new store.
