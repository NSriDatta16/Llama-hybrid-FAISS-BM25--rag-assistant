I have used both JProfiler and YourKit. The advantage of using a profiler is that you can find what parts of your code really cost time by measuring, rather than theorizing. Both work by using a JVM agent and JVMTI (the Java Virtual Machine Tool Interface): http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/platform/jvmti/jvmti.html
