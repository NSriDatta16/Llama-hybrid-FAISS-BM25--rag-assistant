Extracting PCA by variable themes instead of extracting PCA for the whole dataset

I am using a large dataset with more than 4,000 numeric variables and 300,000 observations. I am thinking to use PCA to reduce the dimensionality of it, but I cannot read my dataset into R, because I do not have enough memory for that. These variables are separated by themes, for example Households, People, Reference Person, etc. Would it be theoretically wrong if I extract the PCA by themes for the numeric variables and use it into machine learning models to make predicitions instead of extracting the PCA for the whole dataset?
