Quantifying impact of event/intervention on time series data

Just want to find out if there are some sort of statistical measures to quantify changes in time series data. Particularly in situations where there is some sort of impact that changes the time series data drastically at a certain time t = t1. In this situation, the graph below shows ndvi (greenness of vegetation) which follows a seasonal pattern, which is affected drastically due to volcanic eruption. I want to find out if there is some sort of statistical measure/way to quantify this.
