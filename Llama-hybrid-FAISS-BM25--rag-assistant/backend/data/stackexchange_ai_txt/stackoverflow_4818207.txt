SQL Aggragates, and Alias's

I have a query that needs to return a scalar value if the item is referenced in the table more then once. SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Items WHERE FKID = 2003799 GROUP BY FKID HAVING COUNT(*)>1 ORDER BY COUNT(*) Why can't I assign the aggragate an alias, and reference the alias in in the rest of the query instead of repeating the aggragate function? Something like: SELECT COUNT(*) AS CountById FROM Items WHERE FKID = 2003799 GROUP BY FKID HAVING CountById>1 ORDER BY CountById Edit - Is there an alternative syntax that allows the same idea?
