Infinitely many data and SVMs don't work well with each other. Actually I don't know any classifier that does that... If you work in the dual the size of the Kernel matrix would go to infinity. If you work in primal you have the issues you discuss. If by infinite data you mean an online setup, then there are some adaptations of SVMs for that case. For example in the primal you can work with Hinge loss function .
