I think you have posed two different questions: one which asks about bias in your coefficients and another which talks about variance. Bias As far as I can tell, the general solution to attempting to understand the likely bias in coefficient estimates is to explicitly model the cause of the missing data. However, in most situations that I have come across such information is not available and there is instead a need to do something a little more pragmatic (but imperfect). The following should tell you if you have bias: Recode the missing data on the central predictor by assigning the mean to each observation. Create a new binary variable which has a 1 when respondents are missing data and a 0 otherwise. Re-estimate your models with these two independent variables replacing the central predictor. The coefficient of the binary variable will capture the phenomena of missing group having a different mean on the dependent variables. You can assess bias by comparing the coefficients obtained with the models I have just described with the models you were obtaining with the smaller sample size. Variance A priori , adding in the respondents with the missing data is going to increase your variance. If they were the same as everybody else then your variance wouldn't change, but you know they are not the same as everybody else so your variance should increase. However, I doubt this is so relevant to solving your problem as your interest is the conditional variance (i.e., the relationship between the predictors and your dependent variables) rather than the variance per se.
