Actual problems in Data Science/Machine Learning connected with music

I'm on my $4^{th}$ year now and searching for a theme for my diploma in mathematics & computer science specialization. Is there are interesting problems or fields for researches that i can explore? Probably i'd wanted to work in fields connected to art - music reccomendations e.g. (but we have Spotify sure). I was suggested to take theme "Authorship attribution in classical music", but i think this theme is rather explored.
