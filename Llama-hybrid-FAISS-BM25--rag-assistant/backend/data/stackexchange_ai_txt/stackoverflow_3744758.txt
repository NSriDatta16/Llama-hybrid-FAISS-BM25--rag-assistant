In the fragment shader the vertex coordinates can be seen as a vector that goes from the camera (or the "eye" of the viewer) to the current fragment so by reversing the direction of this vector we then have the "Eye"-vector you are looking for. When calculating the Half-vector you also need to be aware of the direction of the Light-position vector, on the webpage you link they have that on pointing towards the surface, on http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blinn%E2%80%93Phong_shading_model its pointing away from the surface.
