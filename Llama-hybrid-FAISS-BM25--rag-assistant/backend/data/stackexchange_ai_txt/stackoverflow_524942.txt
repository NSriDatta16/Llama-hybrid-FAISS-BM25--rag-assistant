uh ... It depends how you write the garbage collection system for your DSL. Neither C or C++ comes with a garbage collection facility built-in but either could be used to write a very efficient or a very inefficient garbage collector. Writing such a thing, by the way, is a non-trivial task. DSLs are often written in higher level languages such as Ruby or Python specifically because the language writer can leverage the garbage collection and other facilities of the language. C and C++ are great for writing full, industrial strength languages but you certainly need to know what you are doing to use them - knowledge of yacc and lex is especially useful here but a good understanding of dynamic memory management is important also, as you say. You could also check out keykit , an open source music DSL written in C, if you still like the idea of a DSL in C/C++.
