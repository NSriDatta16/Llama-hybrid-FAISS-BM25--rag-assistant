It's not a running average, it's supposed to be the average for the whole trip, right? At least that's what I always assumed mine was doing. I've noticed that effect too. My theory is that both the clock and the distance counter it uses for the average have a fairly low resolution, so sometimes the clock counter ticks up while the distance counter stays steady, and you get the dip. For Example: dist time spd 8.5 40.1 12.72 8.5 40.2 12.69 If they are using an integer processor and fixed point, truncation would make the drop appear even larger
