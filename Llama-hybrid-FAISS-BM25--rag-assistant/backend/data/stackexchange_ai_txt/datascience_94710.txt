For the first part, I guess your matrix should be sparse. You can convert your matrix into sparse and then read it into memory. For the second part, it depends on the sparsity of your matrix is and how many features you want to select. One way is to get the top n variable features, run PCA and get the top m PCs. n and m depend on the sparcity of your matrix. n can be a value between 5000 to 50000 and you can define m by plotting the variance for each PC and finding the inflection point.
