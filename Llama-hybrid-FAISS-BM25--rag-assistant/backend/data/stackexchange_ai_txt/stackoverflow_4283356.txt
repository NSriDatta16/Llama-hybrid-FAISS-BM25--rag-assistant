How to design good looking Web Application

I am a java developer and I am on my way to create a professionally good looking web application, one which has jquery, and fancy menus, well organized css, html etc. I have little knowledge of CSS, html, javascript and other web designing languages. Please let me know how developers create such kind of websites that have good look and feel. I dont want to use GWT/Wicket/or any other java framework. Just the traditional html and javascript as they are way faster than java based web UI frameworks. Also let me know if there is any IDE to easily design the website. I use eclipse. can it be done on eclipse.
