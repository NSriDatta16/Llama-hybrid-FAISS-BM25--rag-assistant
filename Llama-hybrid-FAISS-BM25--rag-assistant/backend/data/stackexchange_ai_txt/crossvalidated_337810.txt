I'm not completely sure but I'm thinking that if any of the pixels are dark in a chunk of max pooling it will output that darkest pixel, no matter what other pixels are. Without max pooling weights can be applied on all the pixels of the previous layer so less data is lost. Even though the network will learn what information is useful to pass to the pooling layer, it still may lose some information. Sometimes it's hard to think about these things and its easier to test them out in an actual CNN.
