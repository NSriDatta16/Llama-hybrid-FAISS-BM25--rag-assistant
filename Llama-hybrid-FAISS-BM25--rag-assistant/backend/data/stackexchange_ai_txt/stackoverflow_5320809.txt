Sparkle Framework problem (not displaying right version)

I am using sparkle framework for the first time. I am trying to test it out and everything works perfectly, except it doesn't display the update version correctly. So for example this is my xml file on server: Your Great App's Changelog http://localhost/test/SampleAppcast.xml Most recent changes with links to updates. en Version 1.5 (2 bugs fixed; 3 new features) http://localhost/test/notes.html Wed, 15 Mar 2011 19:20:11 +0000 notice in the title tag, the name of the version is 1.5, but when I get a prompt for sparkle update, it says "App Name version 2.0 is now available - you have 1.0...." It should say 1.5... Why is this happening? Thanks!
