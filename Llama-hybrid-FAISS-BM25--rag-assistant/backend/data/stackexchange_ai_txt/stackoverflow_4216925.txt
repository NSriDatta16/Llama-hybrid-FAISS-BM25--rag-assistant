How to add large number of event notification reminder via Google Calendar API using PHP?

I've to add one event notification inside of the calendar of my users they all have an account of my Google Apps. The number of my users are for now 200 but it will increase to 1500. How can I add via PHP from Google Calendar API all those notifications? The secondary objective is that all the users that has the mobile configuration will also receive the sms notification. My issue is that if I launch a script now to add 200 notifications to an event that starts in 5 minutes, it will take a lot of time, so some users do not receive in time the notification. thanks in advance!
