Anyone got any tips for organizing/managing a solo development effort?

I've got a project I'm starting to tinker with that is a solo project but I'd like to try to stay organized and have some methodology to work from. Most methodologies that I've seen are aimed at teams. I'm wondering if anyone has any links or thoughts on planning/producing a project with a system as a solo developer. Thanks in advance, John
