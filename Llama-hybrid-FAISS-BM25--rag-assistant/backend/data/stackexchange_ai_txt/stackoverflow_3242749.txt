I'm not sure what is wrong with your format, but can I suggest doing the following: Download and install Fiddler - http://www.fiddler2.com/fiddler2/ Download and install my Fiddler extension - Request to Code - http://www.chadsowald.com/software/fiddler-extension-request-to-code Run Fiddler. Configure Fiddler to decrypt HTTPS - Tools > Fiddler Options > HTTPS and tick the "Decrypt HTTPS Traffic" box. Visit your properly responding URL: https://some.server.com/some/local_dir/abc.cgi?command=ACommand&entitytype=AnEntity Drag that session row from the Fiddler session list into the 'Code' tab. It will generate C# code that you can use to make the same request. Let me know if it's still not working if you try that.
