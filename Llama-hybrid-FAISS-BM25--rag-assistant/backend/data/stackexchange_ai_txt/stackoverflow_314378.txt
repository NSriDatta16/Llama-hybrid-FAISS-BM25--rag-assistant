The AfterUpdate event of the checkbox is what you'll want to use. If you're not able to trigger it, though, try adding this as well: Private Sub YourGridcontrol_MouseDown(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.Windows.Forms.MouseEventArgs) Handles YourGridcontrol.MouseDown YourGridcontrol.PerformAction(Infragistics.Win.UltraWinGrid.UltraGridAction.EnterEditMode) End Sub Private Sub YourGridcontrol_MouseUp(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.Windows.Forms.MouseEventArgs) Handles YourGridcontrol.MouseUp YourGridcontrol.PerformAction(Infragistics.Win.UltraWinGrid.UltraGridAction.ExitEditMode) End Sub By default, just toggling the checkbox doesn't seem to trigger an Update. By making it enter/exit edit mode, the AfterUpdate should work as you want. UPDATE: Or, like Vincent suggested, doing the PerformAction on the CellChange event should work, too. The gist is the same.
