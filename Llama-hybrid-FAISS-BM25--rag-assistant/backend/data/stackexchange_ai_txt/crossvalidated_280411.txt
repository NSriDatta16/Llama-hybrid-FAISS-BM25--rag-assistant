Standardization of variables in Bayesian model

I'm running a model to understand the relationship between children education expenditures and income. I have three variables $y$ the response variable that represents the proportion of income spent with children education $x_1$ represents family income in dollars $x_2$ number of sons I'm running a beta regression model with a bayesian approach. The scatterplot of $y\times x_2$ suggests that a quadratic term should be used. So I'm thinking about fit the following model and then made some variable selection $$y=b_0+b_1x_1+b_2x_2+b_3x_2^2+b_4x_1x_2$$ In some post here, I read that in cases where is polynomial term, standardization should be done. When I do standardization, I should do it with $y$,$x_1$ and $x_2$ or only with $x_2$? The variable $x_2$ have discrete values $(1,2,3,4,5,6,7)$ should it be standardized? The response variable need to be standardized?
