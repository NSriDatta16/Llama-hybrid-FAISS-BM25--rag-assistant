statsmodels SARIMAX simulate generate negative values?

I read the example code here on how to simulate a time series: Sampling with python statsmodels ARIMA package I used myseries data and it simulated a series. However, the values are negative? I noticed when I change anchor from 'start' to 'end' it becomes positive again. My intention is to simulate a time series with the same p,d,q as myseries. Not to project/forecast into the future. That's why I did start and not end. Also how do I also incorporate the seasonal components P,D,Q from SARIMA not just p,d,q? from statsmodels.tsa.api import SARIMAX model = SARIMAX(myseries, order=(0, 1, 0), trend='c') fitted = model.fit() fcast = fitted.get_forecast(30) fc = fcast.predicted_mean se = fcast.se_mean conf_99 = fcast.conf_int(alpha=0.01) fitted.simulate(30, anchor='start')
