How to bootstrap data with unknown correlation structure?

I am interested in how to validly bootstrap data with an unknown correlation structure. Let's say I am bootstrapping in order to obtain inference for some smooth function of the data similar to a sample mean. I found an authoritative review paper ( 1 ) and several papers discussing bootstrap approximations to GEE ( 2 , 3 ), and of course there is a large literature on bootstrapping time series data, etc. However, these approaches seem to assume a known correlation structure or at least that there are known clusters (e.g., subjects each with repeated observations), even though GEE does not require this assumption. How would I bootstrap if I knew nothing about the correlation structure? Basically I want a bootstrap equivalent to, for example, fitting GEE with the assurance that I still have asymptotic consistency even if I misspecify the covariance structure. And what would be the consequences of using the plain-vanilla nonparametric bootstrap (i.e., resampling individual observations with replacement)? Would this approach be conservative, anticonservative, or indeterminate? References 1 . Field, Christopher A., and Alan H. Welsh. Bootstrapping clustered data .
