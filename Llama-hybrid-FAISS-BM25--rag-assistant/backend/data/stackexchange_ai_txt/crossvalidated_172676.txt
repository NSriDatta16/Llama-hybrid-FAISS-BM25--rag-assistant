Should I use IN or OUT degree in Network Diffusion Model of Twitter network using iGraph?

I'm trying to run Independent Cascade Model for my Twitter graph to see who I have to stimulate to get the maximum cascade. This code is inspired by http://php.scripts.psu.edu/hxc249/code_segments/independent_cascade.py which uses Networkx. However, I modified a bit to be able to run with iGraph. I create my network just OUT degree which corresponds to who I follow in Twitter. However, as far as I understand in order for a node to get infected, that node has to see the information. For example, only my followers would see that I tweeted something and if that node decided to retweeted my status that means the node is infected and the followers of that node can keep retweeting. So, should I build my graph based on my followers instead of who I follow? So, if I use G.successors(mynode) that would be all the nodes that potentially might be infected of the tweet I tweeted? Here's my code def independent_cascade_igraph(G, seeds, steps=0): # init activation probabilities for e in G.es(): if 'act_prob' not in e.attributes(): e['act_prob'] = 0.1 elif e['act_prob'] > 1: raise Exception("edge activation probability:", e['act_prob'], "cannot be larger than 1") # perform diffusion A = copy.deepcopy(seeds) # prevent side effect if steps 0 and len(A)
