When to stop an ad campaign?

I have a campaign and I am trying to decide whether to terminate or not, with profit maximization in mind. There is cost associated with every time the ad is shown, and a reward once it converts (viewer clicks on the ad and subsequently performs an action). Let $p_+$ be the conversion rate (conversions over impressions) required to make profits, and let $\theta$ be the unknown true conversion rate of the experiment. I would like to know how to decide that $\theta \leq p_+$. i.e I would like to know how to decide that the ad is never going to make profits given that I know the breakeven conversion rate $p_+$. Edit: This edit is inspired by Adrian's answer. I have not posted it as an answer since I am not yet sure whether it is the correct approach. Attempted solution: Let $Y$ be the total number of conversions, and $N$ be the total number of impressions. Then we assume a prior of $Beta(1, 1)$ of which posterior is $Beta(Y + 1, N - Y + 1)$. At this point we decide to stop the ad once $Pr(x > p_+) p_+) = 1 - \frac{\int_0^{p_+} t^Y(1-t)^{N-Y}dt}{\int_0^1 t^Y(1-t)^{N-Y}dt} $$. Questions: Are there any errors with the described reasoning? Is $Beta(1, 1)$ a good choice for the prior? Is $Pr(x > p_+) What about non bayesian approaches? How do bayesian vs non bayesian approaches compare in this context? Disclaimers: I started to study statistics very recently. So please let me know if I need to clarify anything I mean. I am not sure that I am using standard notation. I am not yet sure about the correct practices for stack exchange. Am I supposed to make separate posts for each of the questions I asked? I am allowed to update the question so often in order to evolve with the answers received? (Answer this questions only if I am not complying with the correct practices).
