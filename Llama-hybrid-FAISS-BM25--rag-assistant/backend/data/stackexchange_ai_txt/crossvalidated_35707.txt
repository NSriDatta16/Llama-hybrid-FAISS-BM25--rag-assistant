Here is some R code to simulate the George Lucas experiment: B Running it, we get pictures like these: where the difference in sold tickets between A and B is on the y-axis. Next, we run $10,000$ such simulated George Lucas experiments. For each experiment, we compute the proportion of time spent $\geq 0$, i.e. the proportion of the lined-up viewers for which the number of tickets sold to A is greater or equal to the number of tickets sold to B. Intuitively, you'd say that this proportion should be roughly $1/2$. Here is a histogram of the results: The proportion is $1/2$ on average in the sense that the expected value is $1/2$, but $1/2$ is an unlikely value compared to values close to $0$ or $1$. For most experiments, the differences are either positive or negative most of the time! The red curve is the density function of the arcsine distribution, also known as the $\mbox{Beta}(1/2,1/2)$ distribution . What is illustrated in the above picture is a theorem known as the first arscine law for random walks , which says that as the number of steps of the simple symmetric random walk approaches infinity, the distribution of the proportion of time spent above $0$ tends to the arcsine distribution. A standard reference for this result is Section III.4 of An introduction to probability theory and its applications , Vol 1 by William Feller. The R code for the simulation study is prop =0)/B } hist(prop,freq=FALSE,xlab="Proportion of time spent above 0",main="George Lucas experiment") curve(dbeta(x,1/2,1/2),0,1,col=2,add=TRUE)
