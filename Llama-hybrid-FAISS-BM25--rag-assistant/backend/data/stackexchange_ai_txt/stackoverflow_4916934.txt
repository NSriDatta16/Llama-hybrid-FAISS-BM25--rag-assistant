Drawing squares in WPF

I want to achieve the following with a WPF application (in a certain area/defined area): When clicking and holding on the app, you can draw a square You can do this as many times, but not overlap any squares You can drag squares around the application What do I need to achieve this, I assume a bunch of onclick/onmove's. Is there an easier way, such as using canvas? Any insight would be great.
