PCA with a distance matrix exists, and it is called Multi-dimensional scaling (MDS). You can learn more on wikipedia or in this book . You can do it in R with mds function cmdscale . For a sample x , you can check that prcomp(x) and cmdscale(dist(x)) give the same result (where prcomp does PCA and dist just computes euclidian distances between elements of x)
