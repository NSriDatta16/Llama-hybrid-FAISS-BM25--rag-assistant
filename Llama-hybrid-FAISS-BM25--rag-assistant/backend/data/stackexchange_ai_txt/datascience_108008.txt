You could try K-Means based on Dynamic Time Warping metric which is much more relevant for time series (see tslearn tuto ). Saying that, there is an interesting discussion about Dynamic Time Warping Clustering that you could read with a lot of references that give time series clustering code examples. Another common approach would be to extract relevant features from your time series and apply clustering techniques to them (see sklearn clustering page ). You could extract a lot of common features for time series using tsfresh python package.
