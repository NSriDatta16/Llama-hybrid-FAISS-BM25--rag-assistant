You can't use the WXSIZEOF macro on dynamically allocated arrays. That's for determining the size of an array, you have a pointer to an array :) You can't use that trick with non-compile-time constant arrays. The parameter wants the number of pairs in the array - and uses a tricky macro to figure it out (using the macro is better for maintainability - there's only one place that uses the size constant). You can probably simply pass 5 to the function (or whatever variable you use to determine the size of your array). (I should add that I'm not familiar with this particular API... and it could be doing something funky that would make this not work... but I doubt it) EDIT. It appears (from some comments) that this function does require contiguous storage. I don't think you need to write your own function to put these elements contiguous in memory. That would be a lot of reallocation and copying. More likely, you should be using a different class. After browsing their very minimal documentation, it looks like you can use XYDynamicSerie to build a dynamic list of points, then adding it to an XYDynamicDataset or something.
