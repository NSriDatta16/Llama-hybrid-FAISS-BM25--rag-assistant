5 to 6 mins is not normal. I use RAD and WAS everyday and get decent startup times. Which version of WAS are you running and how much RAM do you have? If you share several workspaces and projects for a same WAS profile, consider creating a new WAS profile for your workspace. You probably tried that but here's a simple check list of things to try on first hand. Make sure that your server settings in RAD has the following options enabled: Optimize server for testing and developing Run server with resources on the workspace Minimize application files copied to the server Uncheck "Enable universal test client" if you don't need it. In the admin console you can verify some server settings such as Run in development mode Parallel start Start components as needed You can also uninstall the ivt app that comes installed by default when creating a new WAS profile. Then the usual things such as a drive that is not too fragmented and a pagefile size that is properly set. And one last thing that you probably know already, republish to your server instead of restarting it.
