"Investigator intention" and thresholds/p-values

I'm reading John Kruschke's "Doing Bayesian Data Analysis" slides , but actually have a question about his interpretation of t-tests and/or the whole null-hypothesis significance testing framework. He argues that p-values are ill-defined because they depend on the investigator's intentions. In particular, he gives an example (pages 3-6) of two labs that collect identical data sets comparing two treatments. One lab commits to collect data from 12 subjects (6 per condition), while the other collects data for a fixed duration, which also happens to yield 12 subjects. According to the slides, the critical $t$-value for $p A blog post--which I now cannot find--suggested that the fixed-duration scenario has more degrees of freedom since they could have collected data from 11, 13, or any other number of subjects, while the fixed-N scenario, by definition, has $N=12$. Could someone please explain to me: Why the critical value would differ between these conditions? (Assuming it's an issue) How one would go about correcting/comparing for the effects of different stopping criteria? I know that setting the stopping criteria based on significance (e.g., sample until $p
