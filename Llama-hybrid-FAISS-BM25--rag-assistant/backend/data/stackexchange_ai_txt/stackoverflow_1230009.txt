Get Serializable Object from Session in Silverlight

I have a complex, [Serializable] object stored in session. I have Silverlight 3.0 islands in my .aspx pages that need access to this data and its data type. It is my understanding that Silverlight does not support [Serializable], and since it is running on the client, it does not have easy access to session. I am looking for a solid way to access this data in my Page.xaml.cs file. I am open to storing it in ISO Storage once it has been retrieved, but how to retrieve, read it from Silverlight? Hidden fields are not an option as it is a complex data type with dozens of properties, and a few dictionaries, lists of other objects.
