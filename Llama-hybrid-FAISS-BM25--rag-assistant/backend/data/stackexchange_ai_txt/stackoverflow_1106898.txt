If you'd rather use a command line option than #pragmas, a simple answer is that you can use -erroff=%all on your compile line. You can suppress specific warning messages with -erroff=%tag You can print out the tags for the warning messages by adding -errtags to your compile line. You can then define a set of comma-separated values for -erroff that suppress just those tags. See http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19205-01/820-7599/bkapa/index.html for more info. Note that Sun Studio 12 update 1 is now available, and I'm referencing the SS12u1 doc here.
