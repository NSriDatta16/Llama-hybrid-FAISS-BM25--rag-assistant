The other answer by heropup gives a good overview of the Bayesian analysis. That answer shows that the beta conjugate prior leads to the posterior density: $$p(\pi|y) = \text{Beta}(\pi | a+y, b+n-y).$$ Once you have the form of your posterior, you can compute the highest posterior density region using the HDR.beta function in the stat.extend package. With the values in your question you have the following interval: #Set prior parameters a
