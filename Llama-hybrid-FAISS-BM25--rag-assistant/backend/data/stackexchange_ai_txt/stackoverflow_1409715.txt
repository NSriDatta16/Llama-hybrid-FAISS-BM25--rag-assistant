you could also use the "block-quote" property in CSS. That would make it so it doesn't effect your individual lines but allows you to set parameters for just the breaks between paragraphs or "block quotes". UPDATE: I stand corrected. "blockquote" is actually a html property. You use it just like and around your work. You could then set the parameters for your block quote in css like blockquote { margin-top: 20px } Hope this helps. It is similar to setting the parameters on the br and may or may not be cross browser compatible.
