Sorry, read your last comment wrong. Yes, hash_map is not in STL, map is. But unordered_map and hash_map are the same from what I've been reading. map -> log (n) insertion, retrieval, iteration is efficient (and ordered by key comparison) hash_map/unordered_map -> constant time insertion and retrieval, iteration time is not guarantee to be efficient Neither of these will work for you by themselves, since the map orders things based on the key content, and not the insertion sequence (unless your key contains info about the insertion sequence in it). You'll have to do either what you described (list + hash_map), or create a key type that has the insertion sequence number plus an appropriate comparison function.
