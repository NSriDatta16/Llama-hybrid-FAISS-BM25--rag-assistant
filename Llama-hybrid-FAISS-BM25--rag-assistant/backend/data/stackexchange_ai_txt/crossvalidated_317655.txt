What are the differences between two different EWMA estimator?

Someone just showed me a different way of recursively estimating EWMA based on the exponential sum. The estimator has two different recursions: one for the sum and another for the weight. $$ \alpha=e^{-\frac{\Delta t}{\tau}} $$ $$ s_t=x_t+\alpha\cdot s_{t-1} $$ $$ w_t=1+\alpha\cdot w_{t-1} $$ $$ ewma_t=\frac{s_t}{w_t} $$I've always used a more standard definition: $$ ewma_t=(1-\alpha)\cdot x_t+\alpha\cdot ewma_{t-1} $$ The claims was that for irregular time series, where $\Delta t$ could become very small this new estimation technique performs better. I could see that if we get 2 observations with exactly the same timestamp ($\Delta t=0$), the standard definition will "ignore" one. However, his version will estimate the average between the two. I've never seen $ewma$ defined that way and I can't find any references for it. I just want to get some opinions in what situations it should be used and what are the advantages / disadvantages?
