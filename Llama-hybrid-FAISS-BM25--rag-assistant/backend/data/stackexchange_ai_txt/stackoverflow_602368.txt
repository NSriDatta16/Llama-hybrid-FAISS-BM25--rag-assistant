Assuming your test case is in a VS2005 test project, you should be able to use the 'code coverage' feature. On the menu choose Test->Edit Test Run Configuration () From here select CodeCoverage tab to the left, then check the DLLs or EXEs that contain the code you wish profiled. Next run your test, and on completion, you should be able to select Test->Windows->Code Coverage This gives you some metrics on the coverage such as lines executed, and you call also double click entries, to jump in to a file and have onscreen highlighting of the code that was or was note executed
