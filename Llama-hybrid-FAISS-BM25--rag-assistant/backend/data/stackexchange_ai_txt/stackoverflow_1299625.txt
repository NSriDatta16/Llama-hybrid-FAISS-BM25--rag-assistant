One key feature of TCP is "discarding duplicate packets" So to solve your problem with WinPcap you'll have to capture of all packets of one MSN message and resend it in new packets. Hopefully MSN won't accept that. In that case learning how to deal with the MSN protocol could bring a solution to this problem. CodeProject Howto: Connect_To_MSN_Messenger Maybe this C# lib MSNP-Sharp somehow solves your problem or at least gives you a better understanding of Microsoft Notification Protocol
