Normalized statistical measure for agreement of biological replicates

I've conducted an experiment collecting samples from various depths in the ocean. At each depth, I collected 3 samples to act as biological replicates. I now want to show that all of my replicates show good agreement to the mean values. But I don't want to list all of the mean values for each sample with a corresponding standard error. Is there a test I can perform to provide me with one number showing the average normalized variation in my replicates for all of my depths? To be clear, I'm not trying to say anything about the different values I measured at each depth. I just want to show that all of my biological replicates are in good agreement with the mean of their values. Cheers.
