Here is an old article that deals with dragging & dropping pages. It has some logic to obtain the index of a page from an (X, Y) position, perhaps you can use it. Something like this (untested): function TMyPageControl.GetPageIndexAtPos(X, Y: Integer) : Integer; const TCM_GETITEMRECT = $130A; var TabRect: TRect; j: Integer; begin for j := 0 to PageCount - 1 do begin Perform(TCM_GETITEMRECT, j, LParam(@TabRect)) ; if PtInRect(TabRect, Point(X, Y)) then begin Result := j; exit; end; end; Result := -1; end;
