What is best practice for shipping editable XML with your application?

Hi fellow android developers! I am developing an application where I have XML files that contain my data. When doing edits in these data, I save the data to the XML files, thus these must be editable. This I would be able to achieve using the local storage for my application with the openFileOutput method of my Context. But how would I go around shipping my program with these datafiles already there, with some pre-filled data? I can see the option of shipping with some XML files in my res/xml or res/raw, duplicate them to the local data storage, but then I would be unable to remove the files in my resources, and this would take up too much storage. Please tell me what you would do in this case?
