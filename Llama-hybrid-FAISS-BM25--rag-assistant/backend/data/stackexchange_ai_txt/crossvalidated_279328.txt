All books on simulation, like Devroye's Random Variate Generation Fishman's Monte Carlo Rubinstein's and Kroese's Simulation and the Monte Carlo Method and our own book Monte Carlo Statistical Methods contain entries on how to simulate joint distributions. Depending on how the joint distribution is defined, there are several general principles to produce such simulations: if the successive conditionals, $f_1(x_1)$, $f_2(x_2|x_1)$, $f_3(x_3|x_1,x_2)$, &tc., can be simulated, producing a joint simulation means simulating the first, then the second, &tc. univariate distributions; if the joint density $f(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ is available in closed form, then different MCMC methods can be applied to this target as, e.g., the Gibbs sampler; if the joint distribution can be expressed as a copula, then simulation of a joint uniform over $[0,1]^n$ is sufficient, followed by a deterministic transform by the inverse cdf's for each component.
