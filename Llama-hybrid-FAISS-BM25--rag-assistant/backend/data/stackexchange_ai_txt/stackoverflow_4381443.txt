You need to use the setter in the element-drag event-handler. Something like the following should work: $('li.draggable').mousedown(function(){ $( "div.accordion" ).accordion( "option", "event", 'mouseover' ); }).mouseup(function(){ $( "div.accordion" ).accordion( "option", "event", 'click' ); }); You'll need to tailor the selectors to your particular case. The mousedown event-handler will trigger when the user clicks down on the draggable element, changing the accordion's event setting to 'mouseover'; when the click is released, ending the drag, the accordion's event setting gets reverted to 'click'.
