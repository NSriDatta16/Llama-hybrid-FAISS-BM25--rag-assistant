Gandalf has provided the "correct" answer. You can safely use this anywhere. It's all you need. Just a caution. Some people assume that because there are ways to READ data from inside a WAR, that that means it's also OK to WRITE data inside a WAR. In the literal sense, sometimes that's true. But not always. And it's almost NEVER safe. I mention this because I inherited an webapp that did exactly that. Stored a whole directory tree of files inside an exploded WAR directory. First software upgrade that came along, "Poof!" all those carefully uploaded data files were gone. So treat WARs as read-only. If you need to write, designate a directory OUTSIDE the appserver. Preferably as a configurable parameter in your web.xml file so you can use JNDI to look it up and you can override it for testing purposes without having to modify source code.
