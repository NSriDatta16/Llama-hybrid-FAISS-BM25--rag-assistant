Which PCA (or kernel PCA) basis better describes a single test sample?

I have two PCA bases obtained by decomposition of two groups of training data. I also have some samples of test data. How can I decide which PCA basis fits better each test sample? I tried to transform each sample to the PCA basis and measure the energy in the off diagonals in the resulting covariance matrix, but I don't think I can actually discuss covariance matrix derived from a single sample. Edit After helpful comments, I have the following revised question. A good method for estimating which is better is to transform the new sample to each of the PCA spaces, truncate the coefficients, transform back and check the reconstruction error. However, it appears to be more complex in KPCA. I can transform a new sample, $x_{new}$, to the KPCA basis, by introducing a vector $K_{new}=\phi(x_{new})^T\phi(y)$ for all $y$ used for creating the PCA basis and then performing PCA: $p_{new}=K_{new}V$ where $V$ are the eigenvectors for the KPCA. But after truncating $p_{new}$, reverting back is difficult, since it is governed by the equation $p_{new}=K_{new}V$. It obviously cannot be simply inverted, and using pseudo-inverse for $V$ yields an ill-conditioned problem. Can this be done?
