You could URL-encode it, or alternatively base-64 encode it. Both are generally more compact than hex encoding. Note: If the URL is longer than about 200 characters, that 260 character limit will be a problem no matter what. And if the URL is longer than 260 characters... well, you can do the math :-) I don't quite understand why you even need a separate file afterwards, though. You could use a 404 handler, or just parse right ahead for each request. Btw: if you have the option, you're probably better off embedding the URL using a cookie, or as a POST argument. If that's not an option, you can also consider using an URL-shortening service like http://bit.ly/ etc. Those URLs are really short. It all depends on where the URLs come from in the first place. If you have control over the generation of these URLs, why not just give them each a short ID, and store them in a table, and look them up when you "parse" the URL?
