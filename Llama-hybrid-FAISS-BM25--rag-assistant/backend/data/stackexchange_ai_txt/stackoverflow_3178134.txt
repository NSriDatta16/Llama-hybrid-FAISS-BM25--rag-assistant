I have been using WebDAV in PHP directly using XML. I have managed to create emails with attachments and so forth, but when i try to create a contact, I keep getting "400 Bad Request". Here is the webdav query and how i'm executing it: urn:content-classes:person IPM.Contact JoLynn Julie And response: HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request Connection: close Date: Mon, 05 Jul 2010 08:41:43 GMT Server: Microsoft-IIS/6.0 MicrosoftOfficeWebServer: 5.0_Pub X-Powered-By: ASP.NET Content-Type: text/html Content-Length: 1709 MS-WebStorage: 6.5.7638 And sending the data: $h->fetch($url, 0, null, $exchange_username, $exchange_password, "PROPPATCH") Any help greatly appreciated!Â¬ I started with Troy Wolf's example code at http://www.troywolf.com/articles/php/exchange_webdav_examples.php
