What kind of Neural Network should I build to classify each instance of a time series sequence?

Let's say, I have the time-series dataset below-left. I would like to train a model in such a way that if I feed the model with an input like below-right, it should be able to classify each sample with the correct class label. Training Sequence: Test Sequence: Time, Bitrate, Class Time, Bitrate Predicted Class 0, 312, 1 0, 234 -----> 0 0.3, 319, 1 0.2, 261 -----> 0 0.5, 227, 0 0.4, 277 -----> 0 0.6, 229, 0 0.7, 301 -----> 1 0.7, 219, 0 0.8, 305 -----> 1 0.8, 341, 1 0.9, 343 -----> 1 0.9, 281, 0 1.0, 299 -----> 0 ... ... Any help is appreciated. Thanks!
