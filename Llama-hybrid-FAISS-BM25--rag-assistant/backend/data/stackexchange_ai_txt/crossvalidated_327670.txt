Not sure if you are asking a question here. Share some data or how your data actally looks like. As far as i know for predicting the incidents we first need to know how the data is distributed such as poission, exponential, linear or non-linear. If its machine data, they are usually exponential or poisson. In such cases, you can do curve fitting for prediction. If tge data is nonlinear, then Nonlinear regression, SVM or Neural networks can be used. If its linear, linear regression can be used. By the way, if your data is time series, then time series forecasting would be another approach you could use. The functions for the above mentioned models are availabe in R.
