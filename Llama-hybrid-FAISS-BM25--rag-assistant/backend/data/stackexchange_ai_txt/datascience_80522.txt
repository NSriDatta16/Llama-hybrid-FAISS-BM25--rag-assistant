Create new features specifying days of the week. df['Created'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Created']) df['Scheduled'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Scheduled']) df['Scheduled_day_of_week'] = df['Scheduled'].dt.day_name() df['Created_day_of_week'] = df['Created'].dt.day_name() Create a new column day difference which will be the difference between the two days. Then you can visualize for each day what would be the day difference. Similarly you can try for the date. This process is called Feature Engineering .
