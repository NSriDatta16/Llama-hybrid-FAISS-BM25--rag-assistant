Logistic regression is not a classifier. It predicts probabilities of $1$'s. For example, the intercept-only model $$ E(Y) = g^{-1}(\beta_0) $$ where $g^{-1}$ is inverse of the logistic link function, would predict $\Pr(Y=1)=0.7$ for all cases. If you'd use decision rule "if probability is greater then $0.5$ then predict $1$", then you'd end up with classifying all-ones. So indeed the predicted probabilities would be correct, but the proportions of zeros and ones in the confusion matrix would not be the same as in $Y$. The same would be true for more complicated model. Saying it once again, logistic regression does not attempt to make correct classifications, but it estimates the conditional mean of $Y$.
