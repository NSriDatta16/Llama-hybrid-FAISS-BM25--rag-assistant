To maximize REST philosophies I would do the following Do a PUT this to indicate a new structure that would generate a hash, that is not based on the number passed. Just a "random" hash. Then each subsequent post would include the id-hash with returned result hash of the numbers sent. Then when a get is presented on that you can cache the results. 1. PUT /api/average/{number} //return id-hash 2. POST /api/average/{id-hash}/{number} // return average-hash 3. GET /api/average/{average-hash} 4. DELETE /api/average/{id-hash} Then you can cache the get of the average hash, even when you may get to the result in a different way, or different servers get that same average.
