Support Vector Machines: C-parameters and the number of Support Vectors

I have read in the MATLAB documentation, that the number of Support Vectors is connected to the value of the soft-margin parameter C - why is that, and how can we see that with regards to the objective function for SVM? Edit: I understand the overall relevance of C (as discussed in the comments), but have not previously encountered statements regarding C and the number of support vectors. I don't think that the linked post answers my question.
