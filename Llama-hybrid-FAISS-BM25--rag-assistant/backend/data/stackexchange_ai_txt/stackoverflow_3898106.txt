No, you cannot cast one to the other if they belong in different class hierarchies. They are not identical , even if they happen to share the same attributes and methods. Additionally, if they belong to the same class hierarchy, but one is not a superclass of the other, you can't cast across the same class hierarchy either. There's only upcasting and downcasting within a hierarchy. However, you can pass objects of either class to a certain method if They implement the same interface, or extend the same superclass, and That method accepts a parameter that is of the interface's or superclass's type (And that's the basic premise of polymorphism .)
