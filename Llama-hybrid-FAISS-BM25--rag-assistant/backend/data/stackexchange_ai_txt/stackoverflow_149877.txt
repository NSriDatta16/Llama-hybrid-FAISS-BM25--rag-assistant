How Do I Profile the ADO.NET Connection Pool?

I'm profiling a ASP.NET web application. I believe it is very database connection intensive (excessive use of the ADO.NET connection pool). How to I tell w/out debugging how many times it is going to the pool and on average how many connections are available in the pool? Are there counters that will give me this info in PerfMon or some other tool?
