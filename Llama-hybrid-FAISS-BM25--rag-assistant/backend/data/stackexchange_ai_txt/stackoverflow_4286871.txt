InRange: Boolean; ManagerType: TManagerType; ... InRange := ManagerType in [Low(TManagerType)..High(TManagerType)]; As Nickolay O. noted - whilst boolean expression above directly corresponds to: (Low(TManagerType) compiler does not perform optimization on checking membership against immediate set based on single subrange. So, [maturely] optimized code will be less elegant.
