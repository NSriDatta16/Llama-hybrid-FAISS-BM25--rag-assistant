Library/Algorithm to minify URL

I want to display URLs within a limited area: 2 lines and width of ~120px. Obviously most URLs don't fit. So I'm looking for an approach to 'minify' an URL in order to make it smaller yet still recognizable and distinguishable from others. for example: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask http://www.cnn.com/2011/US/03/04/obama.miami.school/index.html http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/04/founder-stories-foursquare-crowley-invent-future/ http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bcp/index.html become stackoverflow | ask cnn | obama.miami.school techcrunch | founder-stories-foursquare cran.r-project.org | packages/bcp So you see this is kind of a creative question. Computing could either be done on server (Java) or client (Javascript). Any feedback very welcome!
