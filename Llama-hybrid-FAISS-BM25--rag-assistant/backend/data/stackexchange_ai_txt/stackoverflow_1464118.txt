I had the same problem, and after a fair bit of mucking around was able to get this working. (They sure don't make it easy.) Here's what I did: Delete any existing eclipse installs, as well as workspaces and the .eclipse folder in your folder. Download and unzip Eclipse 3.4 (Ganymede - last year's version. It won't work with the current version.) I'm using 3.4 SP2, and that seems to work. Place the unzipped directory whereever you like. (Mine's in c:\Program Files.) Next, copy the Blackberry JDE plugin Zip file in an Eclipse extensions folder. Wherever you decide to put this, Eclipse will remember. I created an "Extensions" folder in my Eclipse directory and dropped it in there. Open a command prompt, navigate to your Eclipse directory and run Eclipse.exe with the -clean flag. ("eclipse -clean") Click on the "Help" menu and select "Software Updates..." Click on the "Available Software" tab, then the "Add Site..." button. In the dialog that comes up, click on the "Archive..." button and browse to your extensions folder and select the Blackberry plug-in .zip file and click "Open." Click "Install..." and let it install. When it's done, it will prompt you to restart Eclipse -- Do so. For me, at this point it was working, and my BlackBerry menu was visible. Your mileage may vary, but I hope it works for you too.
