Correlation coefficients when oversampling the extremes of a normal distribution

Running some simulations in which I generated two correlated normal variables (rho=0.3), and then took samples of this population in which the extremes of the population where oversampled (specifically by splitting the X variable into 5 equal-interval groups and sampling an equal N from each group). The average correlation for the simulated samples was ~0.5. I was wondering whether this might be a valid procedure for finding effects that are more pronounced at the extremes (e.g., in the context of psychiatric symptoms where the extremes are most important). Any thoughts?
