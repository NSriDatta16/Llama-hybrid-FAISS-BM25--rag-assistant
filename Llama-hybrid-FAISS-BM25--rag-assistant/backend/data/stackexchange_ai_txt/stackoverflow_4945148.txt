How to make tesseract to give relevant results in the presence of noise?

I am using tesseract 3.0.0 and I bumped into the following problem: When there is something too small for tesseract to recognize it seems it's merged with other fragments. As a result nothing relevant is returned. The image below shows 3 cases. Only the rectangle with the dashed line is passed to tesseract. Over the rectangle is the result (V over T means new line). The last case is the problem one. Is there someway to improve tesseract in situations like this?
