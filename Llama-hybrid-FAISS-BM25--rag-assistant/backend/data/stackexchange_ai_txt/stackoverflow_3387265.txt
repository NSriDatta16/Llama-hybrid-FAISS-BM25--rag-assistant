Dependency property: how to design

I have 2 custom controls that are independent of each other in a wpf application. However, I have some behavior that needs to replicated in both the controls that is similar. For example, when a user does drag drop on either of these 2 controls, i need more or less the same behavior to execute. The same behavior also consists of a dependency property that needs to be shared across the 2 controls. Is this possible and if so how would one go about designing it? So basically, how do I share a dependency property across controls, and also share some behavior as well, when the controls are independent of each other?
