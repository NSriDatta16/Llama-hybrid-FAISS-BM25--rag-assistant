Plotting predicted values in GLM in R

I am trying to find a more aesthetic way to present an interaction with a quadratic term in a logistic regression (categorisation of continuous variable is not appropriate). For a simpler example I use a linear term. set.seed(1) df Questions How can I plot the predicted probability difference between the two levels of var2 (rather than the 2 levels separately) at different values of var1? Is there a way to define contrasts so I can use these in the glm so I can then pass this to predict? - I need a CI for the difference in probabilities
