Term for taking a subset of a time series by selecting one every $n$ values (to get a lower resolution)

What is the technical term for creating a new times series via sub-sequence of the indices? Or by another method like taking the averages over some window? The point would be to get a lower resolution time series, like going from hourly to weekly.
