Rubin's rule from scratch for multiple imputations

I have multiple set of imputations generated from multiple instances of random forest (such that the predictors are all the variables except the one column to impute). I was referred to Rubin's rule to incorporate all the imputations. However, the guides that I've found online are mainly in the use of R to do so. I want to do it from scratch to understand it better. Also, random forest doesn't assume normality. My thinking is that let's say I have 5 of imputation sets. Why don't I just take the mean for each of the imputations?
