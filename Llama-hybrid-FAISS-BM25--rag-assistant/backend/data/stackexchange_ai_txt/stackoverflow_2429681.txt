It seems to be that the simplest workaround is to use /**/UserContent.do (it will also match / 's in the middle). EDIT: More elegant approach, doesn't match / 's: /{foo:(?s:.*)}/UserContent.do (declares a path variable with a custom regexp using {name:regexp} syntax and uses (?s:X) to turn the Pattern.DOTALL flag on)
