Survival Analysis - Right Censoring Data

I am using Survival Analysis to build an attrition model. I have a data set with ~15,000 people that spans the past 5 years. Approx. 2,000 left in the last 5 years. The remaining people stayed at the organization. Technically, are the 13,000 people who stayed observations that should be right centered? If so, is there anything I need to do or does the model understand that they are still there because the left/not left dummy variable distinguishes who left and who stayed?
