How do I implement such template engine?

What I got: I got a textual representation which my program converts to a much more readable format, especcially for forums, websites and so on. Why do I need such templage engine As there are many different forums and blogs, the syntax of each one might be different. Instead of hard-coding the different syntax I would like to generate one class for each of those syntax (preferable extandable with easy modified xml-files) to format my output with the desired syntax. What I did imagine For example I need something like class xyz { private string start_bold = "[B]"; private string end_bold = "[/B]"; public string bold(string s) { return start_bold + s + end_bold; } } How can I do that the most elegant way? Feel free to edit this question as I'm not entirely sure it's a template engine I need. Just don't got a better word for it now. Thanks for any help. Some additional information: Andrew's answer was a great hint, but I don't understand how I could several different styles with this method. Currently I do it the hard way: string s = String.Format("Output of [B]{0}[b] with number [i]{1}[/i]", Data.Type, Data.Number); For this example, I want the output to be designed for a forum. In future I would like to do it like this: Layout l = new Layout("html"); string s = String.Format("Output of {0} with number {1}, l.bold(Data.Type), l.italic(Data.Number); //desired output if style "html" is chosen: "Output of Name with number 5 " //desired output if style "phpbb" is chosen: "Output of [b]Name[/b] with number [i]5[/i]" I just don't know how this can be done in the most elegant way. About the XML: Only the styling conventions should be derived by a xml-document, i.e. adding custom styles without using code.
