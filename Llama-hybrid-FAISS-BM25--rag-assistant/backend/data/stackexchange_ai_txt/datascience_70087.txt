The meaning of γt−t0 in Reinforcement learning with pytorch

When reading pytorch tutorial : Our aim will be to train a policy that tries to maximize the discounted, cumulative reward Rt0=∑∞t=t0γt−t0rt , where Rt0 is also known as the return I know γ is the discount factor, but I am not sure that what t-t0 of γt−t0 mean? Thank you.
