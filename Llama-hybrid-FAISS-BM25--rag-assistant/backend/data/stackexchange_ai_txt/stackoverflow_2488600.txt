How can I distribute a bookmarklet in FBML?

I have a JavaScript bookmarklet that I'd like fans of a certain page to take. Unfortunately, the only way I've found of distributing it is giving them the raw JavaScript source, which is then problematic to add as a bookmark. Ideally, I'd use Drag this to the bookmarks bar But FBML filters out the JavaScript href. Any advice?
