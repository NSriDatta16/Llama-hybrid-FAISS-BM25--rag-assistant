Is the absolute value of a stationary series also stationary?

I know that linear transformations of time series arising from (weakly) stationary processes are also stationary. Is this true, however, for a transformation of a series via taking the absolute value of each element as well? In other words, if $\{x_i,i\in\mathbb{N}\}$ is stationary, then is $\{|x_i|,i\in\mathbb{N}\}$ stationary as well?
