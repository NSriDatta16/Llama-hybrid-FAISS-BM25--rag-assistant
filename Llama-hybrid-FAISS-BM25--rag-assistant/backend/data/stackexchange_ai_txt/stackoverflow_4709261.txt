WebView in Cocoa not accepting keystrokes?

I'm working on embedding a WebView in Cocoa. I have the basic view up and running, but the problem I'm facing is when I type using either the keyboard or the on-screen keyboard, I get a beep from my Mac and none of the characters are actually shown in the Web view's text field. I've been going through the web view's reference guide from Apple, but couldn't find anything related to this. Any help is much appreciated! Thanks, Teja.
