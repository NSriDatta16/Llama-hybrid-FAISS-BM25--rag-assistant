drag and drop problem

I have an Application and want to drop a file in it. I used the COleDropTarget class and derived from it. In my CMainFrame class in the methode OnCreate I register it. This return true. When OnDrop gets called pDataObject->GetFileData(CF_TEXT); or even pDataObject->IsDataAvailable(CF_TEXT) returns 0. Can someone tell me why? Thanks
