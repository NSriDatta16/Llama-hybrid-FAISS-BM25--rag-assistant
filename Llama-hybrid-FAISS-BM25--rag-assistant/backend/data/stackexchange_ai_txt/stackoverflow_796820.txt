Creating an Infragistics Edit Template using code

We currently use Infragistics grid and we don't bind our datasets until run time, and then setup the grid settings in code. This seems a bit long winded, but its the way our senior developer wants it done. I would like to look into using the edit template and I was wondering if there was a way of auto generating an edit template from what is in the grid using c# code. I've seen that if we bind at design time infra does a good job of creating the basic template. Is this possible in code?
