You may try using the touch events manually instead of the gesture recognizers. Always passing the event back to the tableview except when you finally recognize the swipe gesture. Every class that inherits from UIResponder will have the four touch functions (began, ended, canceled, and moved). So the simplest way to "forward" a call is to handle it in your class and then call it explicitly on the next object that you would want to handle it (but you should make sure to check if the object responds to the message first with respondsToSelector: since it is an optional function ). This way, you can detect whatever events you want and also allow the normal touch interaction with whatever other elements need it.
