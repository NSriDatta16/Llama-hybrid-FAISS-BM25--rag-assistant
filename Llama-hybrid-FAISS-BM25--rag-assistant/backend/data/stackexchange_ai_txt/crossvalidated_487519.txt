"The Correct Play is the one that should have won" is a mantra in professional poker. Hearthstone players are probably borrowing it. From the top result of "Poker correct play" I found it expressed as: If you’ve won money, it doesn’t mean you played the hand well. If you’ve lost money, it doesn’t mean that you played the hand badly. A few results down I found a poker forum dedicated to this. The multiple deeply jargony replies to a "was this correct" hits it home how a whole culture thinks that can be determined regardless of actual results or number of hands played later. It's also interesting since they talk about the known probabilities of cards, but also guesses as to what other players were to likely do. Annie Duke's Thinking in Bets is all over this idea. A person flipped one or two houses for a profit and assumes they're good at it, then goes on to lose their shirt. For one thing, too small a sample. For another, if they reviewed things they'd have noticed how much luck they required both times and realized that was proof they were terrible at flipping houses. Poker players actually mock considering a series of hands. If some duffer won with a lucky inside straight two hands ago, you know they're going to go for it now (inside straights are "hot") and you can raise a little higher to take more money from them. But I couldn't say if that's more Bayesian or Frequentist.
