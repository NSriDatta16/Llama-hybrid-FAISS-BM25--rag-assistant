pickle is more generic -- it allows you to dump many different kinds of objects to a file for later use. The downside is that the interim storage is not very human-readable, and not in a standard format. Writing strings to a file, on the other hand, is a much better interface to other activities or code. But it comes at the cost of having to parse the text back into your Python object again. Both are fine for this simple (list?) data; I would use write( firstNames ) simply because there's no need to use pickle. In general, how to persist your data to the filesystem depends on the data! For instance, pickle will happily pickle functions, which you can't do by simply writing the string representations. >>> data = range >>> pickle.dump( data, foo ) # stuff >>> pickle.load( open( ..., "rb" ) )
