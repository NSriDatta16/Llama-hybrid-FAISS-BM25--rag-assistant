What do we mean as Positive or Negative in Sentiment Analysis?

What do we mean in Sentiment Analysis NLP when it is said a sentence is positive or negative? I think I need to specify this regarding any other parameter. For example "iPhone is good" is a positive one respect to Apple Company, however that is negative one in respect to Samsung.
