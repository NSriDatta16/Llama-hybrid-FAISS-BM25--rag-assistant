How to calculate probability percentage for logistic regression with threshold

I am trying to understand how probability works with a threshold for logistic regression. I understand the basics of how to calculate probability. log odds = intercept+value1*coef1 odds = exp(log odds) prob = odds / (1+odds) I understand that a threshold is used to find the optimal mix of correct predictions (precision, f1, etc.). However, how do we interpret a probability in light of a threshold? For example, if a threshold is 0.195 , and a user has a probability of 0.0975 are they: 50% likely to respond (1) since they are 50% towards the threshold? Or are they still 0.0975% likely to respond (1), irrespective of how we consider the fact that anyone who is more then 0.195% likely is going to respond (1)?
