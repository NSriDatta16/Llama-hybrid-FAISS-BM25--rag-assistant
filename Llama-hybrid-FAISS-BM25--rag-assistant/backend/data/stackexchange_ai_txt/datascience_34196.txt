Actually it is possible, to augment a small Dataset with GANs to improve it and it will also increase the Performance of Classification Networks as you can read here . GANs are capable of learning e.g. intermediate shapes which are not involved in the original dateset but still are valid. So synthetic images indeed can improve dataset size and improve CNN classification accuracy.
