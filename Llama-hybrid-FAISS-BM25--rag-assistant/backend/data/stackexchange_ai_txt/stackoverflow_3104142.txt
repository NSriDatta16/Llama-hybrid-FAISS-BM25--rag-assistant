1) It can go anywhere in Groups & Files, but if you only have a few, I'd recommend sticking it into the Resources groups.

Not copying it is often useful when you're linking to shared resources used by different projects. 4) I haven't used CGImageRef myself, but if you just want a UIImage, you can simply call its imageNamed: class method and specify the image name without any additional paths leading up to it. It's assumed the file will be relative to your application's main bundle.
