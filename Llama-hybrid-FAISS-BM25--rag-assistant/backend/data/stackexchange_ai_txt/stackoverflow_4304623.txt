Not sure if my solution is 100% related to your issue - but I had been struggling with a blank page for Magento Connect Manager too (version 1.4.0.1) After a couple hours I discovered that the pear.ini file ( /downloader/pearlib/pear.ini ) needed to be updated. It may happen that the filepath references in your pear.ini are not up to date in the case that you changed servers, installations or Magento directory locations. Therefore you need to do two things: Open your pear.ini in a text editor and update all filepath references with your current Magento directory location. Adjust the number of characters for each string. A bit of a pain, I know but it works. (you can use a word editor to do your character counts) For example: s:59:"/var/www/vhosts/mysite.com/httpdocs/Test/downloader/pearlib"; where "s:59" is the number of characters in the path /var/www/vhosts/mysite.com/httpdocs/Test/downloader/pearlib and "Test" is the old directory. Upon going live (i.e removing "Test" folder) This needed to be updated to: s:54:`/var/www/vhosts/mysite.com/httpdocs/downloader/pearlib`; Let me know if you have luck?
