WebKit or Gecko - which one is better for embedding in C++ app?

Which one would you choose and why ? I'd like to hear opinions from people having experience with embedding a web browser engine in C++ application. I should stress I need all features of web browser engine except rendering i.e. HTTP client, cookie handling, DOM style HTTP parser, JavaScript engine. How can one strip either WebKit or Gecko of rendering code to avoid coding and run-time overhead? This is a follow up to What embedded browser for C++ project?
