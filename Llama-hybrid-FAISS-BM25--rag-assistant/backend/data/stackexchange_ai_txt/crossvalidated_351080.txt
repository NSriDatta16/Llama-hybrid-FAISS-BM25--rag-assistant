I am currently doing a single class segmentation network to detect pixels in microscopy images. What I am doing is like one step more than what you need to do. Basically I am using FCN-8 to do pixel classification, but the first part of the model is a VGG16. I would look online for a generic Keras or other library VGG16 model, and retrain it on your dataset. This implies that you have a large enough dataset to train the model with and some time in front of you as they require a long training to be really accurate. One article that might be of help: https://alexisbcook.github.io/2017/global-average-pooling-layers-for-object-localization/
