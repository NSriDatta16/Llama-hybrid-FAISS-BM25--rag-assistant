QT: Fonts and their width

I have windows that are fixed in size, under which I have textual labels. Although I use the same font, the fonts look different on windows, mac and linux, up to the point where I can't rely on where a label will end, even though the string and the font size are a constant in my application. Is there any solution to that? Someone mentioned embedding TTF fonts and using them, but is that really necessary?
