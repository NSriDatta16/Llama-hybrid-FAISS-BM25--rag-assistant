I don't know about Ruby, but I have a background in PHP and some in Java, and recently discovered Python. Imho Python and Django framework definitely deserve consideration. Here is why: the code is clear, very DRY , and can be quite self-explanatory Djagno has a not-too-steep learning curve documantation is good, community is alive there are solutions for many situations already availible (my latest prob: trees in sql - django-mptt ) and one can allways improve on them or make something completely new If Java and PHP are your only choices, well... How big is the project going to get? Recently I had a look into Magento , and I must say PHP is not the tool for such a big project. Java compiles , PHP doesn't . Don't get too enterprisy with PHP, or secure a good hosting. However, one can get resonabley "enterprisy" with PHP, since PHP has well-developed OOP infrastructure, and there are some good frameworks that are built upon that. And PHP is more "at home" on the web, but I never did any Java for web, so I may be wrong. Let me repeat once again - Django :)
