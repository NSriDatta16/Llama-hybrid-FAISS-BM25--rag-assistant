Holt-Winters seasonal method doesn't work in a small sample

I was following the examples provided by Forecasting: principles and practice . I have modified a little bit the Holt-Winters' example: aust fit1 fit2 aust Qtr1 Qtr2 Qtr3 Qtr4 2009 55.55857 33.85092 42.07638 45.64229 2010 59.76678 35.19188 44.31974 47.91374 Of course I understand that the problem is that the time series is too short. But with two previous periods of time the formula has not enough. Reviewing the formula I don't know why it doesn't work with two periods of time.
