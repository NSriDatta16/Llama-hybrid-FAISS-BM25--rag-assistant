How is SVM related to neural network? How is it a shallow network? The SVM is a single layer neural network with the hinge loss as loss function and exclusively linear activation. The concept has been alluded in previous threads, such as this one: Single layer NeuralNetwork with RelU activation equal to SVM? SVM solves an optimization problem with a well defined objective function, how is it doing template matching? What is the template here to which an input is matched? The Gram Matrix (Kernel Matrix, if you prefer) is a measure of similarity. As the SVM allows sparse solutions, prediction becomes a matter of comparing your sample with the templates, i.e. the support vectors.
