Member functions defined inline are candidates to be inlined by the compiler. If it's never used, and only defined inline inside of a source file, I suspect your compiler is removing the method altogether. That being said, I highly recommend putting your declaration in a header file, and just have the definitions in your .cpp files. Include the header file (with the appropriate guards, such as #pragma once or #idfef/#define guards. You will need to do this as your projects get larger, so it's best to just build the appropriate practices now.
