Dummy coding of linear regression, intercept and constraint

Let the following multilevel problem, where we try to predict the credit card balance of individuals $y_i$ : $$ x_{i 1}= \begin{cases}1 & \text { if } i \text { th person is from the South } \\ 0 & \text { if } i \text { th person is not from the South },\end{cases} $$ and the second should be $$ x_{i 2}= \begin{cases}1 & \text { if } i \text { th person is from the West } \\ 0 & \text { if } i \text { th person is not from the West. }\end{cases} $$ Then both of these variables can be used in the regression equation, in order to obtain the model $$ y_i=\beta_0+\beta_1 x_{i 1}+\beta_2 x_{i 2}+\epsilon_i= \begin{cases}\beta_0+\beta_1+\epsilon_i & \text { if } i \text { th person is from the South } \\ \beta_0+\beta_2+\epsilon_i & \text { if } i \text { th person is from the West } \\ \beta_0+\epsilon_i & \text { if } i \text { th person is from the East. }\end{cases} $$ My problem now is to solve by linear regression under the problem that adding the intercept will add a lot of colinearity between the column vectors. One solution is to add one constraint: $$ \beta_0 + \beta_1 + \beta_2 = 0 $$ And use restricted least square. But what is the interpretation of adding this constraint ? (Outside of the technical reason) I suppose that we cannot say anymore that $\beta_0$ can be interpreted as the average credit card balance for individuals from the east $$ y_i=\beta_0+\beta_1 x_{i 1}+\beta_2 x_{i 2}+\epsilon_i= \begin{cases}-\beta_2+\epsilon_i & \text { if } i \text { th person is from the South } \\ -\beta_1+\epsilon_i & \text { if } i \text { th person is from the West } \\ -\beta_1 - \beta_2+\epsilon_i & \text { if } i \text { th person is from the East. }\end{cases} $$
