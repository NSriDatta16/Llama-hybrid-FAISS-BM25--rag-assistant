Just to recap, here's how I interpret the question: What you want is a list with the most recently started activity for an agent, with the added requirement that the activity must be started within a given date interval. This is one way to do it: // the given date interval DateTime startDate = new DateTime(2010, 1, 24); DateTime endDate = new DateTime(2010, 10, 25); IEnumerable agentActivities = ... original list of AgentActivities ... IEnumerable latestAgentActivitiesByAgent = agentActivities .Where(a => a.StartedAt >= startDate && a.StartedAt a.AgentId) .Select(g => g .OrderByDescending(a => a.StartedAt) .First()); (If the question involves LINQ to SQL, there may be some gotchas. I haven't tried that.)
