I'm learning MySQL and didn't know about the show table status command. Nice One! As I said, I'm just starting, but already my database has over 2 million rows. Does the host computer have to find storage for all rows if you select * from table_name Wouldn't it be simpler to say select count(*) from table_name and get only one row in return?
