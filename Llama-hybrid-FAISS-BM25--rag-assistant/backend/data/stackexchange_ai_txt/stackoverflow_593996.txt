How to suppress Java compiler warnings for specific functions

We are always taught to make sure we use a break in switch statements to avoid fall-through. The Java compiler warns about these situations to help us not make trivial (but drastic) errors. I have, however, used case fall-through as a feature (we don't have to get into it here, but it provides a very elegant solution). However the compiler spits out massive amounts of warnings that may obscure warnings that I need to know about. I know how I can change the compiler to ignore ALL fall-through warnings, but I would like to implement this on a method-by-method basis to avoid missing a place where I did not intend for fall-through to happen. Any Ideas?
