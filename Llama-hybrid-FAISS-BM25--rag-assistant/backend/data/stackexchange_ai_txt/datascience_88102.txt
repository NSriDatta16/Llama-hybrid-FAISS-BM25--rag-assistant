Google Colab is an online browser based python notebook/execution environment similar to Jupyter Notebooks. Some of its benefits are that it requires no configuration (popular packages like numpy, pandas, and matplotlib are already installed), users can leverage Google's GPUs, and notebooks can be easily shared. Access to Google's accelerated hardware (GPUs and TPUs) is one of the main reasons that Colab is so popular among academics and practitioners alike.
