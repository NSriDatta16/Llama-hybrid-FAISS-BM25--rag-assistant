How to lazy load Infragistics UltraWebTree control?

I cannot find any examples of how to lazy load the Infragistics UltraWebTree v6.3 I found that the docs on the Infragistics site tend to be limited to the latest version of their controls, but this is a legacy app which I am unable to upgrade. Has anyone got example code or links which demonstrate how to lazy-load nodes in this control? The current implementation that we have loads 1.35MB of html because it is populating the entire tree!! Yikes!
