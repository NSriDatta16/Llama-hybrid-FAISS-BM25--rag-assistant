As with all things statistics a small sample maybe a problem because (1) you will have too much uncertainty in your estimates or (2) the "statistical machinery" breaks because some asymptotic results do not hold. With all things network it is more complicated because it is not immediately clear what is the sample size? Number of nodes or the number of ties? (hint: it turns out it's both are important but each for a different thing). From the practical point of view if your networks are large enough for the MCMC estimation of an ERGM to work well, then your estimates are valid and the "small sample size" will be reflected in standard errors, p-values etc. If MCMC won't work because of network size you can turn to exact methods (see Vega Yon below) and get valid results too.
