This type of situation with binary outcomes is usually handled by logistic regression , which in your case would use the disease/no-disease states of the 3000 mice to estimate the log of the odds of having disease as a function of predictor variables. Here, you would include the mouse strain and the drug treatment as predictor variables; also, since you are interested in whether the drug is more "effective" in one mouse strain, you would include an interaction term between strain and drug. A significant interaction term would support the hypothesis that drug responses, in terms of influence on log-odds of having disease, differ between mouse strains. The results expressed in terms of log-odds can be translated back to probability scales and thus to fold differences in incidence of disease if you wish. That said, I suggest that you think some more about your definition of "more effective"; I'll translate from mice to people to put this into a public health perspective. Say that there were 1000 people in a high-incidence group and 1000 in a low-incidence group. Say that the drug costs \$1 per dose, and you only had \$1000 dollars to spend. Which group should you spend the money on? You would prevent disease in 150 people by giving it to the high-incidence group, but only in 90 people if you give it to the low-incidence group. From this cost-benefit perspective, the drug is more effective if used on the high-incidence group, even if the fold-change in incidence is greater in the low-incidence group.
