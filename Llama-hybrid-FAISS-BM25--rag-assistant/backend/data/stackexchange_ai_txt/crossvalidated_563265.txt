What is the probability of having all wealth concentrated into one single pocket after n trades?

On Joe Rogan's podcast #1769, Dr. Jordan Peterson said something like this: Take a population of 10 people, each starting with 100 dollars. They will "trade" based on a coin flip. Whoever "loses" has to give the other person one dollar. In the long run, all wealth will be concentrated into one pocket. At first, I couldn't believe this was true because of the equilibrium randomness would bring to this system (compared to an "informed trader" scenario). Each player would win as much as they would lose, resulting in a zero-sum endless game. A player's expected wealth after $ n $ trades: $$ E[w] = w_0 + \sum_{i=0}^n {1 \over 2} \times 1 + \sum_{i=0}^n {1 \over 2} \times -1$$ $$ E[w] = w_0 + {n \over 2} - {n \over 2} $$ $$ E[w] = w_0 $$ I ran a Python simulation, and in the very first run I got this: It took 70431 individual trades for all wealth to be concentrated in one pocket. Am I missing something here? This is the code for the simulation: https://gist.github.com/victorvalentee/1c04b2d16005f7372273b153fe9ece23
