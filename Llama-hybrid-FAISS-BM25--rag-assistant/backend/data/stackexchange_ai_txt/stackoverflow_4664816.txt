Access SQL query to SELECT from one table and INSERT into another

Below is my query. Access does not like it, giving me the error Syntax error (missing operator) in query expression 'answer WHERE question = 1'. Hopefully you can see what I am trying to do. Please pay particular attention to 3rd, 4th, and 5th lines under the SELECT statement. INSERT INTO Table2 (respondent,1,2,3-1,3-2,3-3,4,5) SELECT respondent, answer WHERE question = 1, answer WHERE question = 2, answer WHERE answer = 'text 1' AND question = 3, answer WHERE answer = 'text 2' AND question = 3, answer WHERE answer = 'text 3' AND question = 3, answer WHERE question = 4, longanswer WHERE question 5 FROM Table1 GROUP BY respondent; UPDATE: I have made a little progress with this, but I still cannot get my data in the format I really want. I used several Iif statements to get as far as I am now, but GROUP BY simply isn't working the way I would expect it to. I have also tried variations on my SELECT statement (like SELECT DISTINCT TOP 100 PERCENT and TRANSFORM ) but I guess I am not using them correctly because I always get errors. Here is what my data looks like now: All I need to do now is smash all the similar respondent rows together (that is, respondent rows that have the same number) so all the cells that are empty are removed.
