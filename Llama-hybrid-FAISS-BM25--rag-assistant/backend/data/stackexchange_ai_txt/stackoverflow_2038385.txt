FBConnect and personal upload email address

I am writing an iPhone app that needs to be able to upload photos to Facebook as a side effect of sending them in an email. It seems like a gigantic pain to create the album and upload the photos; is there any way that I can get the user's personal upload email through the API and just add that to the recipients in the email that is sent?
