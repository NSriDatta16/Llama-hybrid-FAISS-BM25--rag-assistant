Binary storage of numbers with overflow bits...how's the format called?

For a serialization/protocol format I have to encode unsigned numbers up to unsigned 64bit integer in a space-saving way that should still be easy to implement (meaning, I'm not looking for a dedicated compression algorithm). I was thinking about the following: if n =128 and n =16384 and n I have two questions about this: How is this format called? Where can I look up implementations? This is for a binary protocol that will be sent over sockets, where small numbers
