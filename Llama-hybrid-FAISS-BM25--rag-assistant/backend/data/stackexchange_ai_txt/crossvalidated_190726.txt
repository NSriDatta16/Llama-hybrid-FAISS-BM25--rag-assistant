Different parameters coming out as important from decision tree and logistic regression

I ran both logistic regression and decision tree model on the same dataset However, the parameters that come out as important in both vary. For example, the most important parameter in the decision tree (the 1st split of the tree) doesnâ€™t even pop out as important in the logistic regression model. The model accuracy from the confusion matrix is very similar in both the cases I wonder which model to go ahead with in this scenario
