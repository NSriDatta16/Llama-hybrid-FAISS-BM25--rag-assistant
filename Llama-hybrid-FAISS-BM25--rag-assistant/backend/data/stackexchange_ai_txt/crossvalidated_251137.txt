Transformation of Variable In the analysis of time series it is common to try some kind of transformation on the variable. The decision on the choice of the transformation can be realized very simply by using the likelihoods of the models. Figure 4 illustrates the sunspot series for the years 1749-1924. For the original series, $y(n)$ , the two transformations $\left\{y(n) + 1\right\}^{1/2}$ and $\log\left\{y(n) + 1\right\}$ were applied. The choice of the additive constant 1 was quite arbitrary and the results were intended only for the purpose of illustration. AIC attains the minimum values at $\text{ARMA}(7,2)$ , for the original $y(n)$ , $\text{ARMA}(7,3)$ for $\left\{y(n) + 1\right\}^{1/2}$ and $\text{ARMA}(5,4)$ for $\log\left\{y(n) + 1\right\}$ . The effect of transforming the variable is represented simply by the multiplication of the likelihood by the corresponding Jacobian and thus by the addition of minus twice the logarithm of the Jacobian to the AIC. For the case of $\left\{y(n) + 1\right\}^{1/2}$ , this last quantity is equal to $\sum \log\left\{y(n) + 1\right\} + 2N\log2$ and, for the case of $\log\left\{y(n) + 1\right\}$ , it is $2\sum \log\left\{y(n) + 1\right\}$ , where the summation extends over $n = 1, 2, \ldots, N$ .
