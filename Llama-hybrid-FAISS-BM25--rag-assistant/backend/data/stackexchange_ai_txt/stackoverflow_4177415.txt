How to simulate a click on a element which also results in invoking attached events?

My test case is @ Gmail, I am trying to simulate a click to open the first e-mail with JavaScript. Actually I did a successful attempt which is done by firing a mousedown event. But I wonder if there is a generic method to generate "organic" clicks instead of me wasting time on investigating attached events ?
