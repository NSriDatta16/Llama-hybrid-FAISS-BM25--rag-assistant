Custom link function for logistic regression model

I am trying to build a generalized linear model with a custom link function. This is a follow up to this question: Understand and specify a generalized logistic model in R In this paper A Generalized Mixed Logistic Model for Predicting Individual Tree Survival Probability with Unequal Measurement Intervals ) by Yuqing Yang and Shongming Huang, the authors provide two models. The first one (Eq. 1 in the paper) is this: $$P = \left( \frac{e^\eta}{1 + e^\eta} \right)^{L}$$ , where $\eta$ is the linear predictor and $L$ the time duration between measurements. For this model the following custom link function by @BenBolker works fine ( https://rpubs.com/bbolker/logregexp ): logexp 30, .Machine$double.eps, exp(eta) / (1 + exp(eta)) ^ 2) } mu.eta However, the authors also provide a second modified logistic function (Eq. 2 in the paper): $$P = \left( \frac{e^\eta}{L + e^\eta} \right)$$ For this I tried to modify the custom link function myself, however, I am (a) not sure if I have done this correctly , and (b) whether this is a statistically sound approach that is presented in the paper . Here's my attempt to adjust the link function based on Eq. 2 in the paper. I think I might have an incorrect specification of the logit_mu_eta() and mu.eta() functions: logexp 30, .Machine$double.eps, exp(eta) / (get_exposure() + exp(eta)) ^ 2) } mu.eta
