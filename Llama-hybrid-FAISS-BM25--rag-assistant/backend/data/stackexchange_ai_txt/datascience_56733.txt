How to handle invalid values like this is an extremely common problem in machine learning, since most datasets contain errors of some kind. There are a few ways to do it. For example, you could set them all to 0: df.loc[df.SoilHumidity Or you could fill them with the avg(SoilHumidity), and create an extra feature to flag to the model that they were missing: import numpy as np df['SoilHumidityInvalid'] = np.where(df.SoilHumidity Or, you can try to impute them somehow. Either by back or forward filling (I.E. taking the value from the next or the previous row in your dataset) or by creating a model that uses the other features of your dataset to predict what these invalid values should be. The right method can depend; sometimes domain knowledge guides you (i.e. if you know the sensor can mistakenly read negatives when it should read 0, then you know to fill with 0). Failing that, I would just try a couple of methods and use cross-validation to see which improves your model the most.
