You are missing this: NameVirtualHost 6x.2x.6x.1x:8080 Perhaps you just didn't copy here since your site is working? If Magento is loading pictures from the wrong site, there's nothing you can do in your Magento's .htaccess file: picture request will never get there. They will go to whatever other web server you have running on port 80. You can only have this problem if Magento is building absolute links that include protocol and host (a terribly pointless bandwidth waste IMHO). My advice is that you look at the application settings and see if there's a place to specify the site base URL (since the app doesn't seem to be able to find it by itself). (I tried to access Magento's demo site but it requires registering.)
