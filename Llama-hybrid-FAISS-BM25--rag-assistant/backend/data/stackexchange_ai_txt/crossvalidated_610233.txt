I get a number for power which is 0.23 which obviously is low. My question is, am I doing this correctly? It is low, but not incorrect. When you have an effect of 0.1 and a sample of size 75, then you don't get very much power and 0.23 is not weird. It may help to do a manual computation. You can compute this easily manually for the case of a z-test. (Your example is an F-test but the relationship between power and effect size is more or less the same) Say you have a distribution $X \sim N(\mu,1)$ and you test the hypothesis that $\mu = 0$ , by using a sample of size $75$ . Then te standard deviation of the statistic $\bar{X}$ , the average of the 75 values, is $\frac{1}{\sqrt{75}} \approx 0.115$ , and the effect size of $0.1$ is only a shift by one standard deviation. In the image below you see what this means the cutoff values are around $\pm 0.226$ and the power is here only $0.139$ , even less than your situation (with a one sided test, like the F-test, the power for a given effect will be higher, and in the case of the z-test it will be approximately $0.218$ ).
