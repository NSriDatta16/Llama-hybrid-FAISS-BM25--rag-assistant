Android is a mobile operating system developed by a consortium of developers known as the Open Handset Alliance , with the main contributor and commercial marketer being Google. It is based on a modified version of the Linux kernel and other open source software and is designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. In addition, Google has further developed Android TV for televisions, Android Auto for cars, and Wear OS for wrist watches, each with a specialized user interface. Variants of Android are also used on game consoles, digital cameras, PCs, and other electronics. Tag Usage When asking about your app force closing or crashing, you have to include an MCVE , which has to include a stacktrace .
