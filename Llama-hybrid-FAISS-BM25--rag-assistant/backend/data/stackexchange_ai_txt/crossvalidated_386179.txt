Machine Failure Prediction through parameter degradation?

The problem that I've in hand is there is a temperature value (time series data) which keeps on increasing linearly during the manufacturing process and after it reaches a threshold, the process should be halted to avoid system breakdown. I have to find Remaining useful life assuming if the temperature grows in the same linear trend. So, far I've tried Holt's model to linearly forecast trend and identified the point at which it is meeting the threshold as first option. Is there any other degradation model available which could help to handle this case?
