For SSRS 2005, there is no way of doing this if you are using the "subtotal" property of the matrix. You could do it if you add new records to your dataset, where you put 'Total' as a month and the corresponding summarized values for revenue type. This way, "Total" will be jus like another month and you can expand or collapse it. In SSRS 2008, you have a lot more liberties when working with matrix (in fact, this version vastly improved a lot of things, and there is no longer a matrix or a table, you have tablix). Here you can add columns inside groups or outside of them, you can add columns and later decide to group by some value, etc. So you can, actually, add a new column outside your groups, name it "Total", and make it so it groups by revenue type, and do your sum of revenue.
