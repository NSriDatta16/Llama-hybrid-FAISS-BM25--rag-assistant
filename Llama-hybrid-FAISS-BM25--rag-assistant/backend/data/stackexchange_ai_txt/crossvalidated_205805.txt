Using low frequency data to calibrate high frequency data

I have a 10 Hz time series measured by a fast instrument and a 1 minute time series measured by a slow reference instrument. The data consists of a fluctuating meteorological parameter. The slow reference instrument is used to calibrate the fast instrument measurements. Both time series are synchronised. My idea: Average the 10 Hz data into 1 minute blocks. Take 5 one minute block from each time series and calculate the linear regression equations. Use the regression equations to calibrate the 10 Hz data in 5 minute blocks (3000 data points). What would be the best way to match (calibrate) the high frequency data using the low frequency data? I use MATLAB. More background: The fast instrument outputs a fluctuating voltage signal while the slow instrument outputs the true value of a trace gas concentration in ppb (parts per billion). The slow instrument samples every ten seconds and outputs the average every one minute. In short I would like to have my fast signal also in ppb but without losing it's integrity, hence the need to use a linear fit.
