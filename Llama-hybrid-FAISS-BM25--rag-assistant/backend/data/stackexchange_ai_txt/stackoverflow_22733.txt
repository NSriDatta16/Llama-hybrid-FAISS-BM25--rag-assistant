I'm not a database expert, and I do not speak from experience. However: MyISAM tables use table-level locking . Based on your traffic estimates, you have close to 200 writes per second. With MyISAM, only one of these could be in progress at any time . You have to make sure that your hardware can keep up with these transaction to avoid being overrun, i.e., a single query can take no more than 5ms. That suggests to me you would need a storage engine which supports row-level locking, i.e., InnoDB. On the other hand, it should be fairly trivial to write a few simple scripts to simulate the load with each storage engine, then compare the results.
