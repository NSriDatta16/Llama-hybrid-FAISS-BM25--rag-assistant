There's a lot of good answers here, so i thought I'd just add one more to the list: I got a book called Project Oberon more than a decade ago, which has some very well written text on the compiler. The book really stands out in the sense that the source and explanations is very hands on and readable. The complete text (the 2005 edition) has been made available in pdf, so you can download right now. The compiler is discussed in chapter 12: http://www.ethoberon.ethz.ch/WirthPubl/ProjectOberon.pdf Niklaus Wirth, JÃ¼rg Gutknecht (The treatment is not as extensive as his book on compilers) I've read several books on compilers, and i can second the dragon book, time spent on this book is very worthwhile.
