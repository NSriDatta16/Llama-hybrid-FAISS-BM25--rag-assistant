How do i make a copy of an object? Javascript

I have a class in json format. I would like to make two instance. Right now (its pretty obvious why) when i 'make' two objects i really have 2 vars pointing to one. (b.blah = 'z' will make a.blah=='z') How do i make a copy of an object? var template = { blah: 0, init: function (storageObj) { blah = storageObj; return this; //problem here }, func2: function (tagElement) { }, } a = template.init($('form [name=data]').eq(0)); b = template.init($('form [name=data2]').eq(0));
