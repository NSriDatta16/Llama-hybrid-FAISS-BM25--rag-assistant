problem in retrieving the rows in case of composite key through hibernate

I have faced this issue many times but couldn't find the solution any where. My question is that how can i retrieve a tuple or a row in the database through hibernate call, For example in the relation Student_course(sid,sname,cid,cname, duration) here sid and cid are considered as the composite key. please let me know the solution. Thanks In Adv, A.Raghavendra
