I got a similar problem solved while using transfer learing for CNNs by changing base_model= VGG16( weights=('imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape = (128,128,3) ) to: base_model= VGG16( weights=('imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape = [128,128,3] ) So seems like the type of bracket is important as well here with the input shape.
