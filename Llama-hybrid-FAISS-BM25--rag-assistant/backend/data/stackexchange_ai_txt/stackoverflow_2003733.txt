If it is a warning as you say, then you should remember that warnings are exactly that: warnings. It means you're okay for now but, if you continue with the behaviour that elicited the warning, you will probably be punished in one form or another. However, it's more likely that this is an error in that it's refused to actually let you add more columns. Even if it does let you add more columns, that's unlikely to last for long. So, regardless of whether it's a warning or error, the right response is to listen to what it's telling you, and fix it. If you need a quick'n'dirty fix while you're thinking about the best way to fix it properly, you can split the row across two tables with a common identifier. This will make your queries rather ugly but will at least allow you to add more columns to the "table" (quoted because it's actually two tables with a common key). Don't use this as a final solution, not least of all because it breaks normalisation rules. But, to be honest, with more than a thousand columns, there's a good chance they're already broken :-) I'm finding it very hard to imagine an item that would have thousands of attributes that couldn't be organised into a better hierarchy.
