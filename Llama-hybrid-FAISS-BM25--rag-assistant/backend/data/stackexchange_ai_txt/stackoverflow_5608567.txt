How does page.php?id=2&a=bonus know that a real admin is the one giving the bonus points? Have you thought about XSRF ? In other words, can a user put something on their site so that if an admin visits it, while logged in, a request gets sent with the admin's cookies that inadvertently racks up points. You shouldn't use GET requests for changing things, like assigning points. From http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html Implementors should be aware that the software represents the user in their interactions over the Internet, and should be careful to allow the user to be aware of any actions they might take which may have an unexpected significance to themselves or others. In particular, the convention has been established that the GET and HEAD methods SHOULD NOT have the significance of taking an action other than retrieval. These methods ought to be considered "safe". This allows user agents to represent other methods, such as POST, PUT and DELETE, in a special way, so that the user is made aware of the fact that a possibly unsafe action is being requested. Anything that causes server state change should use one of the non-idempotent HTTP methods. Probably POST. Btw, an idempotent operation is one that, when re-applied to its output yields the same thing. So f is idempotent if f(x) == f(f(x)) == f(f(f(x)) , etc. And finally url="GetPoints.php?i=2" is setting a global variable. You probably want a var in front.
