The sproc performance argument is moot - the 3 top RDBMs use query plan caching and have been for awhile. Its been documented... Or is 1995 still? However, embedding SQL in your app is a terrible design too - code maintenance seems to be a missing concept for many. If an application can start from scratch with an ORM (greenfield applications are far and few between!) its a great choice as your class model drives your DB model - and saves LOTS of time. If an ORM framework is not available we have taken a hybrid of approach of creating an SQL resource XML file to look up SQL strings as we need them (they are then cached by the resource framework). If the SQL needs any minor manipulation its done in code - if major SQL string manipulation is needed we rethink the approach. This hybrid approach lends to easy management by the developers (maybe we are the minority as my team is bright enough to read a query plan) and deployment is a simple checkout from SVN. Also, it makes switching RDBMs easier - just swap out the SQL resource file (not as easy as an ORM tool of course, but connecting to legacy systems or non-supported database this works)
