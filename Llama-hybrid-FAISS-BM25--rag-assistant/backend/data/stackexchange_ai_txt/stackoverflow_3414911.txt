pretty late for an answer but for people who bump into this problem in future : This is probably a bug with eclipse. At least to me it seems so. The hack: Close eclipse. Delete the metadata file from the workspace folder. Restart the eclipse in same workspace. Load all the existing projects one by one from the "Create project from existing source option" Note: This is a non-elegant, but simple and fast hack for the lazy ones like me. I tried a few of them from above. None of them worked. This one works just fine. Yeah one thing - you will have to reset the Installed JREs to point to the JDK on your machine.
