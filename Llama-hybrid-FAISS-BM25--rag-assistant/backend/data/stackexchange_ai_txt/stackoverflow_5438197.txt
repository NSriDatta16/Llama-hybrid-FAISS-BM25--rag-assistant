Word Automation Multiple Paste Problem

Is there a better way to paste HTML fragments into a Word document than via the clipboard from C#? using Word = Microsoft.Office.Interop.Word; I'm using some code that puts HTML into the clipboard: HtmlFragment.CopyToClipboard(changedText); I have a selection in word (from a formfield) and I do: word.Selection.Paste(); But sometimes it just throws a COM exception. If I add Thread.Sleep(100); I can get it to work, but that's not ideal. The Insert methods look like a better option but there is no Insert from HTML. So what's the best way to insert lots of HTML fragments into Word quickly using the automation interfaces? Edit Some good advice in the responses but the issue turned out to be a simple tag causing word to fail on paste.
