Mixture models arise in attempts to characterize complicated probability distributions, especially those with two or more modes, in terms of distributions with mathematically simple descriptions. Disambiguation Do not confuse a "mixture model" with a " mixed model "! The former concerns distributions, typically multi-modal, that will be analyzed as positive linear combinations of other distributions. The latter occurs in a regression setting where some of the independent variables are viewed as fixed and others are viewed as realizations of random variables. Note that although the density of a mixture is, by definition, a linear combination of densities, it is not in general the same as the density of a linear combination of random variables. For example, the average of two normal random variables is normal (and therefore has a single mode), but a 50:50 mixture of two different normal densities often has two modes and is never normal. Compound distributions are also known as "mixtures". Please use the compound-distributions tag in such cases. See the meta thread on The “mixture” vs. the “compound-distributions” tags for details.
