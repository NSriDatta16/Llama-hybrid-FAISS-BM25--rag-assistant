The CNN in this case does not learn what is a cat but rather what differentiate an image with a cat from one without a cat. If all of your "no-cat" images contain spider(s), the CNN could also converge only by detecting the spider(s) : images with spider(s) belong to "no-cat" and others belong to "cat". That explains why you have such a good confusion matrix on testing data and such poor performance in real-world. You have some options to avoid such a situation: add other images to your "no-cat" label as you said (using public datasets for instance) try one-class classification approaches. If you are familiar with neural networks, you could dig into reconstruction error of autoencoders (see this post: How to use a dataset with only one category of data or this sklearn guide ) Hope it helps
