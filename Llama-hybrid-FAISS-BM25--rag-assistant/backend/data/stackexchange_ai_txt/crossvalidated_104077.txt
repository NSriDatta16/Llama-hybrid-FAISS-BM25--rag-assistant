What is meant by binary images of handwritten digits?

I can understand what a handwritten digit is, but what is meant by "binary image"? Can someone explain it? I am studying machine learning concepts. In doing so, I've come across many types of inputs. For example: binary, continuous, and discrete. The inputs are provided through MNIST handwritten image datasets. In that, I have read about datasets consisting of binary images. I would also like to know about the difference between greyscale and binary images.
