Did you code your own so-called frameworks when discovering JS for yourself? Yes . This is hard road but very useful for personal education. Did you use frameworks like jQuery all the way? Yes . But when it is really necessary . Could you now consider yourself to a master of JS? No . There are so many things to learn, especially in the context of evolving web standards and browser. The reasons to use JavaScript frameworks are simplifying tasks such as: Cross-browser support Work with browser's Document Object Model Implementing rich User interfaces etc So in terms of learning JavaScript Frameworks are not preventing you from beeing a JS gury. But in terms of a real world JS is always used with things like DOM, CSS etc and without understanding it you cannot be real-world JS guru-dev. So you can learn plain JavaScript and use framework, yes, yes, you can. But this will be out of a context and almost useless. As a result, you need to learn not only the JS as a language but JS for the web. And the Frameworks prevent from doing it. So to summarise: avoid using Frameworks unless you cannot do the job without it or the effort of doing the job without a Framework is TOOOO high. In regards to effort. It includes cross-browser support. So, for example , if I need to implement a page that will use AJAX or should allow user to drag&drop items on the page, there is no way for me doing it manually (the effort is way to high). I'll pick jQuery or something else for that. Just pick the right too for the job . No tool is also a tool. ADDED: The main question was: How would I become a master of JavaScript if I always used frameworks and did nothing by myself? You can take the hard way - develop your own framework and keep it up-to date . You will face all the possible issues and will be enforced to understand all the hidden pieces. You probably will not want to reimplement jQuery, but instead create a busines related Framework. Example of such could be a "ProductJS": providing architecture for developers to manage products on your web-site, comment them, compare and so on.
