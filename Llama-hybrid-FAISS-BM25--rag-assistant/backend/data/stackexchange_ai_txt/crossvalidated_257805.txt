Can I do Paired T-test for averaged data

I will make my question more obvious here. My data consists of each students making 5 attempts to say, throw a ball in a hole back to back. My interest is to see, how many times they succeed, whether the average speed of throwing differs between passed and failed attempts. So I will also have the measurement on the speed of throwing. I know I can do a repeated measure ANOVA to test the mean difference of speed between throws, but that's not my intention. I was wondering if I could do a pair T-test to see the mean difference between successful and unsuccessful attempts. Can I take the average of the successful and unsuccessful attempts for each student and run a paired T-test (if normality is satisfied) on these data? Any suggestion is appreciated! Let me know as well if you have any questions. Thanks!
