Help with understanding logistic regression's $R^2$ value

I have a set of ordinal varies (0,1,2,3,4) and I'm trying to do binary logistic regression with a dichotomous variable (0,1). These are the values, where the numerator is = 1 and the denominator is = (0+1): 0: 476 / 2384 (20.0%) 1: 428 / 1908 (22.4%) 2: 368 / 1277 (28.9%) 3: 101 / 376 (26.9%) 4: 23 / 64 (35.9%) When I run these with the binary logistic regression tool in SPSS I get $r^2 = .007$ . However, when I graph them as percents in Excel, the linear trendline looks a lot better, and has $r^2 =.8647$ . From my understanding, you can't use a linear regression for categorical variables because it can be negative, but it looks like the data is better than $r^2=.007$ . Am I doing anything wrong?
