There is a relevant paper: LA Gatus, AS Ecker, M Bethge, 2015, A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style . Quoting from the abstract, Here we introduce an artificial system based on a Deep Neural Network that creates artistic images of high perceptual quality. The system uses neural representations to separate and recombine content and style of arbitrary images, providing a neural algorithm for the creation of artistic images. Here is Figure 2 from this paper: There is also a very popular open-source implementation based on torch here which is quite easy to use. See the link for more examples. Keep in mind, that the computations are heavy and therefore the processing of single images is the scope of this work. Edit: after checking your mentioned DeepArt project, it seems it is using the same techniques. I'm not sure why this is not what you want, because the concept of style-transfer is as general as it gets.
