Time for a more general answer. Your approach should be pragmatic, based on your objectives and time scales. Are you trying to find nuanced links between predictors and response, are you hoping for more of a rough idea of "important" variables? Do you have the time and resources to prepare your data and run more complicated algorithms / processes? Something to bear in mind is that there are often many ways to achieve the same goal. You may find that for your particular data and task , simple ("traditional") tests may perform as well as more complicated techniques. That said, perhaps consider something along the lines of the following - in increasing order of complexity: Chi-square / Cramer's V for categorical predictors ANOVA test for continuous predictors Forward selection (GLM technique) Decision trees / bagged trees / random forest importance. Boosted trees Alternatively, if you're looking for R packages to help you with feature selection, have a look at caret and FSelector .
