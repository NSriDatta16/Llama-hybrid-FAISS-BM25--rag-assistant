Expected value of $R^2$, the coefficient of determination, under the null hypothesis

I am curious about the statement made at the bottom of the first page in this text regarding the $R^2_\mathrm{adjusted}$ adjustment $$R^2_\mathrm{adjusted} =1-(1-R^2)\left({\frac{n-1}{n-m-1}}\right).$$ The text states: The logic of the adjustment is the following: in ordinary multiple regression, a random predictor explains on average a proportion $1/(n – 1)$ of the response’s variation, so that $m$ random predictors explain together, on average, $m/(n – 1)$ of the response’s variation; in other words, the expected value of $R^2$ is $\mathbb{E}(R^2) = m/(n – 1)$. Applying the [$R^2_\mathrm{adjusted}$] formula to that value, where all predictors are random, gives $R^2_\mathrm{adjusted} = 0$." This seems to be a very simple and interpretable motivation for $R^2_\mathrm{adjusted}$. However, I have not been able to work out that $\mathbb{E}(R^2)=1/(n – 1)$ for single random (i.e. uncorrelated) predictor. Could someone point me in the right direction here?
