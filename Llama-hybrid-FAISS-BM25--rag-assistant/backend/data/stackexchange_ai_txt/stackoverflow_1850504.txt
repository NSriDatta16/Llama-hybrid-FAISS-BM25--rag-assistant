How could I modify this template to add buttons that would scroll to the next section?

I am trying to make a horizontally scrolling Web Page. This template uses J Query and CSS to control width, but the User still has to drag the scroll bar across the bottom - how would I add arrows or something that the User could just click on and it would go over to the next section? http://css-tricks.com/how-to-create-a-horizontally-scrolling-site/
