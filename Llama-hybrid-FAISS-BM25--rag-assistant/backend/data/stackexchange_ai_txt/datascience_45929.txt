Have you tried taking the first difference? This amounts to taking the first derivative, and is generally a good way to de-trend a time series. However, if you want to use seasonality, fit a regression model of form $$ X_t = X_{t-k} + \epsilon $$ where $k$ is the number of time periods between seasons. For example, if you have monthly observations, using $k=12$ might make sense, as this removes the annual seasonality.
