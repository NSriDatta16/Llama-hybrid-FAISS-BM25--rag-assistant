How can I link a dynamic library in Xcode?

I am currently developing a program in Qt and it uses the library libqextserialport.1.dylib. I build it and run in x-code and it spits back: dyld: Library not loaded: libqextserialport.1.dylib Referenced from: /Users/samuelreh/Desktop/QtOpenCV/build/Debug/QtOpenCV.app/Contents/MacOS/QtOpenCV Reason: image not found The library is located in /Users/samuelreh/Desktop/QtOpenCV/qextserialport/build/. I can run my program by changing to the executable folder /Users/samuelreh/Desktop/QtOpenCV/build/Debug/QtOpenCV.app/Contents/MacOS/ and entering: install_name_tool -change libqextserialport.1.dylib /Users/samuelreh/Desktop/QtOpenCV/qextserialport/build/libqextserialport.1.dylib QtOpenCV I know there is probably many solutions besides this. Anybody know the best / most-elegant / easiest to do from x-code?
