The Pragma: public header is completely inappropriate for logged-in users and isn't going to help anything. I'm also a bit baffled as to why you're using so many Content-Type headers. Choose one and one only. Finally, those are the headers you're explicitly setting... You don't have any calls to session_destroy or setcookie floating around do you?
