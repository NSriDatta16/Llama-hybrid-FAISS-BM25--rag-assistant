You can certainly make flexible elements with image round corners. See this article . Because CSS3 border-radius is now supported in many of the modern browsers, you could use that as your primary solution and provide a fallback for the ones that don't support it. On a recent project, I created the website with border-radius and used the jQuery .wrap() for browsers that didn't support it. It looks something like this: HTML Hi, I'm a paragraph CSS .round { border: 1px solid red; -moz-border-radius: 10px; -webkit-border-radius: 10px; } jQuery if ($.browser.msie) { $('.round').wrap(' '); } And you can then style the round corner elements as per the article above.
