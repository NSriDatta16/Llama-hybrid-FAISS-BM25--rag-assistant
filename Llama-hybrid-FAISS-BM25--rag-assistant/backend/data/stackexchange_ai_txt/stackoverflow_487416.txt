Making a C++ app scriptable

I have several functions in my program that look like this: void foo(int x, int y) Now I want my program to take a string that looks like: foo(3, 5) And execute the corresponding function. What's the most straightforward way to implement this? When I say straightforward, I mean reasonably extensible and elegant, but it shouldn't take too long to code up. Edit: While using a real scripting language would of course solve my problem, I'd still like to know if there is a quick way to implement this in pure C++.
