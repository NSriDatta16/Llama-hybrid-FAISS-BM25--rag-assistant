100's of fields in a form is too many. Try to aim for max 20 per page. If you can, try to isolate each part of this form into a separate page, and even better, into a wizard of some kind. e.g. (example steps) Step 1: Client Profile (name, age, SSN, etc.) Step 2: Loan Data (Fixed, Variable, Amount, Terms, Special Deals...) Step 3: Credit Check?, Pre-Approval? Step 4: Variations/Calculations... If you organize the data in structured groups, you should be able to make each portion work independently (e.g. you can input basic loan data, and get some preliminary numbers without needing to enter client data (yet). More importantly, if the user enters a value in one of the 100 fields that causes the backend to not store (e.g. value out of range) what happens? does the user lose all the data they entered? - for usability make sure that nothing is lost when the user attempts to save/move to the next step.
