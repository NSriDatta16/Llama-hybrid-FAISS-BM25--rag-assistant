Can an event be semi-dependent?

I learned about dependent events and independent events and how to calculate the probability of two dependent events (such as drawing an ace after having drawn a three from a deck of cards) and independent events (rolling two sixes in a row on a six-sided die.) Can events lie somewhere on a spectrum of dependence? I'm working on a genetics project and I'm wondering about the dependence of two risk alleles. The probability of the average human (worldwide) having risk factor 1 might be 0.03. The probability of the average human (worldwide) having risk factor 2 might be 0.10. As presented, these are independent events. However, in some regions of the world, you might be more likely to have risk factor 2 if you also have risk factor 1. Would this make the events semi-dependent? Or would this 3rd factor (region) be another event?
