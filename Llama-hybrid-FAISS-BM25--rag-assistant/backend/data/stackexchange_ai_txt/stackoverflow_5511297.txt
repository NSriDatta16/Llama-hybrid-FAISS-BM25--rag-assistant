There are few ways you could get the requested url. One is through $_SERVER["REQUEST_URI"] , as you did, but off course ZF has its own ways. Two examples are: // you can call it in a view or a layout $uri = Zend_Controller_Front::getInstance()->getRequest()->getRequestUri(); // or using userAgent view helper in a view or a layout: $uri = $this->userAgent()->getServerValue('request_uri'); Hope this helps.
