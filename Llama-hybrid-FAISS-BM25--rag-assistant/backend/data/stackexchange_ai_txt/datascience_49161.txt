Your code looks incomplete but you can definitely try the following to split your dataset: X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(dataset, y, test_size=0.3, shuffle=False) Note : y will be a series object for your dependent variable. Because of this reason, using train_test_split with shuffle=True is not a good practice and should strictly be avoided. Alternately, for time series you can use TimeSeriesSplit() and look for the implementation here .
