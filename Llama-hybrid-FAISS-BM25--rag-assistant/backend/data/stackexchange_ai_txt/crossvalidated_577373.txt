I think you are doing a questionable statistical test here. What happens on a particular day might be related. E.g. day 1 is a Sunday, so people have a lot of time and click on stuff and convert, day 2 in a Monday and people are more busy and don't. This does not mean that what you did on day 1 is better than what you did on day 2. A sensible analysis here should account for day-to-day variability (i.e. a simple comparison of proportion is probably inappropriate). E.g. a random effects logistic regression with a random day effect on the intercept could be an option. Randomly assigning one strategy for some users and another for others (on the same day) tends to be better. Alternatively, if you have enough days that you are willing to wait for, randomize days (perhaps in blocks to not have excessively long runs with one approach). Alternating assignment might be okay, but can in some circumstances have problems that randomization doesn't have. Finally, the company's approach of keeping on going until you have significance invalidates the hypothesis test and if you only go long enough you will always reach significance with this approach even if there's in truth absolutely no difference. PS: I don't know what you mean by "...upward of 96% significant." PPS: I also have no idea what the company is talking about with "You don't really need a two-sampled test because the sample size itself determines whether it's significant." Perhaps there's some meaningful thing at the bottom of what they are trying to say, but it does not really make any sense as written.
