I think the phenomenon you are experiencing is that the second assembler language is (again) difficult to learn (I assume learning PPC was also difficult when you started, back then). It gets easier the more new architectures you familiarize with - at some point, you'll enjoy finding some architectural (mis)feature that you had never seen before. The problem with the second architecture is that you are not yet clear on what is common practice, and what is specific to the first architecture. So you expect certain things to be done on x86 the same way as they were done on PPC, when in fact x86 has its own (possibly even more elegant) way of doing stuff.
