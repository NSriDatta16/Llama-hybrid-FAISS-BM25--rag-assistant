This is not Xcode question. First read about inheritance in Objective C: http://www.techotopia.com/index.php/Objective-C_Inheritance Second: if you want to use your custom view add the header where this view is declared. Edit: It is probably a good idea to use UIViewController instead of UIView. In this case you can use Interface Builder, that will save you a lot of time and make your code more elegant. Google about that, there are tons of info.
