Would dropping X altogether hurt?

I live in the linux terminal all the time under my slackware GNU/linux system (an EeePC). By default, GNU Emacs won't start if It can't find several Xorg libraries. Assuming I will never use X software at all, would it make sense for me to drop all this Xorg stuff and compile emacs again ? Are you aware of anything that could get me into troubles or making GNU Emacs not working at all ? Are there any advantage for me to keep all these dependencies ? I am asking since as said, my main box is an eeepc with little storage and I am dangerously hitting the limits ;-) At the very least, what would be smallest and minimal Xorg libraries one should keep to launch xterm (with a deported display) ? Regards
