From SourceSafe to Team Foundation Server

Our team would like to move from the Visual SourceSafe (VSS) to the Team Foundation Server (TFS). I know that the TFS is much more than just a version control system, but for the first time I would like to use it this way. Currently our projects are organized within the single solution that consists of the shared part (common library) and many customer projects. Is there some kind of migration guide that would describe such a challenge? Or TFS enforces its own usage scenarios (versioning of projects, releases, etc.)?
