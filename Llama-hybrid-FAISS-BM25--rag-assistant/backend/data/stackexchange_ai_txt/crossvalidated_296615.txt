Preparing for data science interview in R and python

I'm preparing for a data science interview. The main languages the organization uses are Python and R. I am familiar with those languages; I do regressions, t-tests, data visualizations in them. However, I often use Stata as it's usually more convenient for what I want to do. Is there any website that can help me get these two languages at my fingertips (especially advanced functions) for these interviews? (For example, if I were learning SQL, I would go to SQLzoo)
