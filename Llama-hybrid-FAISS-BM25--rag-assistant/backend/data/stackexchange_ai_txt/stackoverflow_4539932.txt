Besides the "accented letters are sorted differently than unaccented ones" in some Western European languages, you must take into account the groups of letters, which sometimes are sorted differently, also. Traditionally, in Spanish, "ch" was considered a letter in its own right, same with "ll" (both of which represent a single phoneme), so a list would get sorted like this: caballo cinco coche charco chocolate chueco dado (...) lámpara luego llanta lluvia madera Notice all the words starting with single c go together, except words starting with ch which go after them, same with ll -starting words which go after all the words starting with a single l . This is the ordering you'll see in old dictionaries and encyclopedias, sometimes even today by very conservative organizations. The Royal Academy of the Language changed this to make it easier for Spanish to be accomodated in the computing world. Nevertheless, ñ is still considered a different letter than n and goes after it, and before o . So this is a correctly ordered list: Namibia número ñandú ñú obra ojo By selecting the correct collation, you get all this done for you, automatically :-)
