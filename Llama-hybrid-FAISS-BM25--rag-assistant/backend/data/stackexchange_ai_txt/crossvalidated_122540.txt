Does N-1 correction for Pearson's Chi-Square apply to r x c tables generally?

Campbell (2007) recommended what he called the "N-1" correction for chi-square tests performed on two-by-two contingency tables. He described the correction as: "the K. Pearson chi-squared test but with N replaced by N âˆ’ 1". The purpose of the correction is to reduce the rate of Type I errors, for contingency tables where the minimum expected frequency is at least 1. Otherwise, he recommended using the Fisher-Irwin test. Campbell's recommendation has been encouraged by posters to CrossValidated (example) . My question is whether the 'N-1' correction should be used for r x c tables generally? For example, would one apply it to a chi-square test for a three-by-five table? Or is it's use limited to two-by-two tables? Campbell, Ian. 2007.
