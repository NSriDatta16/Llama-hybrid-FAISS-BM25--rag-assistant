lme4 is an excellent package that I've used before, but I don't know enough to answer your question. I can suggest an alternative that might make things more straightforward: the Bayesian package rstanarm . Since it's Bayesian, you automatically have samples of your coefficient values that reflect multiple of the uncertainties that you are trying to bake into your simulation. Look at this rstanarm vignette, which has an example similar to yours towards the bottom: Hierarchical Partial Pooling for Repeated Binary Trials , section Posterior Predictive Distribution . Hope this is helpful, and maybe it will open up a new perspective for you. You may need to think about things like priors, but the rstanarm package makes the transition as easy as possible.
