As you said, usually RNN, because their memory mechanism, are good in sequences, but other approaches are also possible. However it depends on what your data represent and it's not too clear to me, how different time series types are related among each other. You could have different approach to try, but I repeat that it's not clear to me what your data represent and how they are related. Here just few of them. 1) Train a RNN for each sequence type to learn to classify them and then use a consensus on the whole input 2) As 1.), but training using a unique RNN for all sequence types 3.) Concatenate your sequences types for each input so build a unique model RNN based to produce an embedding on which you could apply two classifiers (multi-tasking fashion). The first classify each sentence, while the second classify the whole input
