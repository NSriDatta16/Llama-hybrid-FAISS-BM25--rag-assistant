If you have corresponding covariate values from all of the institutions, then one approach would be to build a Cox model with all the cases while including the institutions as a type of random effect. That could be done with a gamma frailty term in the original coxph() modeling in R, or a Gaussian random effect in the coxme package . That allows for a distribution of center-specific hazards beyond those associated with the covariates, providing at least a start at addressing the issues in questions 1 and 3. With respect to question 2, if you expect that most events of interest happen in the first year and you have reasonably complete follow-up through at least 1 year, then you could do a binomial regression with respect to outcomes at 1 year. Note that your expectation does not necessarily invalidate the proportional hazards (PH) assumption; your assumption has to do with the baseline hazard, and it's possible that PH still holds at later times around a lower overall hazard. For further investigation of center-specific bias in terms of treatment selection, you could consider evaluating the propensity of receiving treatment A versus B as a function of covariates, including the institution as a predictor. That's often done with a logistic regression, but the more flexible propensity modeling provided by the twang package can be helpful. You also could then incorporate the propensity of having received treatment A versus B into your survival model to try to correct further. See the many posts on this site about propensity-scores .
