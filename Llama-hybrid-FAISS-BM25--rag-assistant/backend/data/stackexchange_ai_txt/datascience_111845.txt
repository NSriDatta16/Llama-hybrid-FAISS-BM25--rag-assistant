In general evaluation measures don't have any unit. Many of them actually represent proportions of instances (like accuracy, precision, recall). But it's true that error evaluation measures are different, as they represent a value based on the target variable. Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is the average across instances of the absolute difference between the predicted and gold standard value. So this difference has the same unit as the original target value: for example, if the system predicts an income in dollars then the difference between the predicted and true value is also in dollars.
