The quick and easy solution was to add the [RemoteClass] metatag at the top my custom class. I found this solution on Adobe's website, livedocs.adobe.com/flex/3/html/â€¦. It seems that using the native drag and drop capabilities between list-based components causes custom classes to lose their type during copying. Thanks to everyone for the assistance.
