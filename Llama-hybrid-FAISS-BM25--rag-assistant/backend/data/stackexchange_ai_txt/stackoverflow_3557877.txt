porting linux 32 bit app to 64 bit?

i'm about to port very large scale application to 64 Bits, i've noticed in that in the web there some articles which shows many pitfalls of this porting , i wondered if there is any tool which can assist in porting to 64 bit , meaning finding the places in code that needs to be changed.... maybe the gcc with warnnings enabled... is it good enough ? is there anything better ? EDIT: Guys i am searching for a tool if any that might be a complete to the compiler, i know GCC can asist , but i doubt it will find all un portable problems that will be discovered in run-time....maybe static code analysis tool that emphasize porting to 64 bits ? thanks
