They can look but not touch. After all, the residuals are the part of the data that don't carry any information about model parameters, and their prior expresses all uncertainty about those—they can't change their prior based on what they see in the data. For example, suppose you're fitting a Gaussian model, but notice far too much kurtosis in the residuals. Perhaps your prior hypothesis should have been a t-distribution with non-zero probability over low degrees of freedom, but it wasn't—it was effectively a t-distribution with zero probability everywhere except on infinite degrees of freedom. Nothing in the likelihood can result in non-zero probabilities over regions of the posterior density where the prior density is zero. So the notion of continually updating priors based on likelihoods from data doesn't work when the original prior is mis-specified. Of course if you Google "Bayesian model checking", you'll see this is a parody of actual Bayesian practice; still, it does represent something of a difficulty for Logic of Science -type arguments for the superiority of Bayesianism on philosophical grounds. Andrew Gelman's blog is interesting on this topic.
