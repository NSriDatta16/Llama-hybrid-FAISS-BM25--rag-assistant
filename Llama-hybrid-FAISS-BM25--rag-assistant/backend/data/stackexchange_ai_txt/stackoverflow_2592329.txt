Unfortunately, in the general case, the only way you can tell if arrays are equal in this sense is to compare their elements. There's no shortcut or built-in way of doing that. In some special cases you can make your life a bit easier by using Array#join and comparing the resulting strings, e.g.: var a = [1, 2, 3]; var b = [1, 2, 3]; alert(a.join(",") == b.join(",")); // Alerts "true" ...because a.join(",") results in the string "1,2,3", as does b.join(",") . But obviously you can only do that when you know that you can concatenate and compare the values meaningfully like that. Doing this may ( may ) be faster because you can leverage the JavaScript interpreter's internal join and string comparison methods, but again, you can't do this in the general case, only when you know the data in the array is going to be okay with being turned into a string and concatenated like that.
