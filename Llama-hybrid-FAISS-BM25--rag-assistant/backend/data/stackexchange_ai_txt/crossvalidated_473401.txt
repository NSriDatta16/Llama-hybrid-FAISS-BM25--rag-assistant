Do we normalise the dataset before or after performing one hot encoding?

I am working with an imbalanced dataset involving fraud. The aim is to use Logistic regression to predict if new observations are legitimate or fraudulent. I currently plan to perform normalisation, one hot encoding, principle component analysis and then a hybrid of over/under sampling to make my test/train sets more balanced. I'm not sure the order in which to so these, do I normalise before doing one hot encoding or afterwards?
