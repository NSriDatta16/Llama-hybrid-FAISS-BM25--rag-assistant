WordPress may be a good app to the end user, but it would be bad to learn good PHP code from. I agree that the Zend Framework is an excellent place to start. Not only is there code very good, but they have excellent documentation and tutorials. I would start here: http://www.framework.zend.com/manual/en/ Zend Framework provides both MVC and authentication/access control. For auth and access look at Zend_Auth and Zend_Acl. This is a good guide to getting started with MVC in Zend: http://www.framework.zend.com/docs/quickstart Some applications that have been built around the Zend Framework include Magento (an ecommerce engine) and Digitalus (a CMS). Both are open source.
