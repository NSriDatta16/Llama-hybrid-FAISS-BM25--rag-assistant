Explanation of DNNClassifier in TensorFlow

I used tf.estimator.DNNClassifier, a high-level API in tensorflow, to perform a binary classification. It works very well for my purpose, but I am a principiante in Machine Learning and I would like to know better how it works. Considering this example , what kind of neaural network is used? How is it structured? What activation do you use? And so on. I apologize for the trivial question, but I'm a beginner and I would want a simple general guide.
