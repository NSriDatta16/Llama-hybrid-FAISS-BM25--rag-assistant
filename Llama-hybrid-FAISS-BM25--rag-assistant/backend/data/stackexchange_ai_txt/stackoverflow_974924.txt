I think FireFox stores cookies in its own storage, not under the Cookies folder in the profile. This is where IE stores its cookies. On my system (XP Pro with FireFox 3.0.10), cookies seem to be stored unter C:\Documents And Settings\USERNAME\Application Data\Mozilla\FireFox\Profiles... in a SQLite database.
