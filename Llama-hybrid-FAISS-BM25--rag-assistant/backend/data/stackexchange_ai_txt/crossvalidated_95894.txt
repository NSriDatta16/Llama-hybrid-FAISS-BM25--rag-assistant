Going by your plotting the first 2 components, I would definitely say keep the second one, and maybe the third one too. Drawing cumulative information gain graphs also help a lot in deciding about PCA. If you are using R, there are simple methods to do that. You could look up R labs in standard data mining books like the ones by Tibshirani.
