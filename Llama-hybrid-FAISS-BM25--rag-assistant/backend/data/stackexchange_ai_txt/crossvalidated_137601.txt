I don't think odds or probability are involved. The answer is determined by the number of days in a week (7) and the number of days in a year (365 or 366 on leap years), and the interval between leap years (usually 4 but sometimes it is 8, as there is no leap year day on some 00 years). So there is no chance involved. Just some bookkeeping to figure out which day on which year. It also depends on what date range you are looking at. There are four year, 100 year, and 400 year cycles in deciding when a year is a leap year . So the distribution of days of week in your lifetime may not match the true average over few thousand years.
