You're creating a jQuery object when you do $('a') , but you're leaving it behind when you use get(0) and use appendChild to append it to your fragment. So if you use the native .cloneNode(true) on your fragment, jQuery is not aware of it, and therefore is not managing the data for you. As long as you're using jQuery for most of what you're doing, I'd say ditch the documentFragment, and just stuff your a elements into a jQuery object, and clone() that. I don't think you're gaining anything by using a fragment in this case.
