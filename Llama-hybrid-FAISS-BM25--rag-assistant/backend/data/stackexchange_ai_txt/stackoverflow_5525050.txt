What is the order of the run time for an algorithm with this desired output?

There are N sets Ai to An each with string entries. The average size of a set is K. For each Ai we wish to return a list (or a better data structure?) of N-1 sets excluding Ai ordered by how many elements the sets have in common with Ai? Please don't be shy to give a detailed response with nice mathematical arguments...:) Also is this a standard problem and can I read more about it somewhere?
