You might be better off writing two converters, one for the ListBox the other for the TextBlock. The logic of each would be simpler and you wouldn't need to pass a parameter to get the correct result. While it might not be as elegant as a single converter solution it will be far more maintainable. If you really want to pass a parameter then you need to use the ConverterParameter . There's an example here but I'm not 100% sure it'll meet your requirements. The simplified XAML syntax is: Then in your converter (simplified): bool show = (bool)value; bool visible = (bool)parameter; if (visible) { return show ? Visibility.Visible : Visibility.Collapsed; } else { return show ? Visibility.Collapsed : Visibility.Visible; }
