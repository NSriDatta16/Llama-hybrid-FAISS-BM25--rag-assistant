That depends on your definition of "best". FOR loops will do the job just fine. I'm not a PHP programmer, but in .NET, you can use the Repeater, a sort of template that you can use to declare the table HTML. It has templates for the header, the footer and each item. You bind a data source to the repeater, and it will generate the table HTML for you a bit more elegantly than using FOR loops. I imagine there might be some sort of templating equivalent in PHP. In the end, though, even the Repeater uses some sort of loop...
