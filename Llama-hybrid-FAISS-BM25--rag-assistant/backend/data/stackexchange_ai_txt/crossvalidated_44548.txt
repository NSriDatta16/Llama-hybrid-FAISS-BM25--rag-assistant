Modelling longitudinal data

We have longitudinal data on children(n Now, based on these variables (A,B,C,D), I am trying to model individual growth trajectories of each child. Ideally, I want to have a single curve that explains how these variables have evolved with respect to time. For now, I am not concerned if different child have different trajectories. I have been studying multi-level models to model growth curves. These techniques were not helpful particularly because I am not interested in modelling individual variables separately and my time series data is quite long(n>500 for each individual). I want to find a relation between all these variables and time. I have been wandering for quite a time. I am looking for getting started papers or some ideas.
