Understanding R output in Logistic Regression

I am following an example here on using Logistic Regression in R. However, I need some help interpreting the results. They do go over some of the interpretations in the above link, but I need more help with understanding a goodness of fit for Logistic Regression and the output that I am given. For convenience, here is the summary given in the example: ## Call: ## glm(formula = admit ~ gre + gpa + rank, family = "binomial", ## data = mydata) ## ## Deviance Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -1.627 -0.866 -0.639 1.149 2.079 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) ## (Intercept) -3.98998 1.13995 -3.50 0.00047 *** ## gre 0.00226 0.00109 2.07 0.03847 * ## gpa 0.80404 0.33182 2.42 0.01539 * ## rank2 -0.67544 0.31649 -2.13 0.03283 * ## rank3 -1.34020 0.34531 -3.88 0.00010 *** ## rank4 -1.55146 0.41783 -3.71 0.00020 *** ## --- ## Signif. codes: 0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1 ## ## (Dispersion parameter for binomial family taken to be 1) ## ## Null deviance: 499.98 on 399 degrees of freedom ## Residual deviance: 458.52 on 394 degrees of freedom ## AIC: 470.5 ## ## Number of Fisher Scoring iterations: 4 How well did Logistic Regression fit here? What exactly are the Deviance Residuals? I believe they are the average residuals per quartile. How do I determine if they are bad/good/statistically significant? What exactly is the z-value here? Is it the normalized standard deviation from the mean of the Estimate assuming a mean of 0? What exactly are Signif. codes? Any help is greatly appreciated! You do not have to answer them all!
