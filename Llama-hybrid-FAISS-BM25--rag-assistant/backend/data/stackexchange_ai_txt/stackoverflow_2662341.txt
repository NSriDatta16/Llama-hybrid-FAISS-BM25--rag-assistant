sourceDragMask is what's called a bitmask: an integer that represents a a number of boolean flags. It's declared as a variable of type NSDragOperation , which is actually typedef ed from NSUInteger —it really is just that. First off, the & operator is what's known as a "bitwise AND", which simply takes two numbers AND s each of the bits in them to create a new value. For example, 0011 1001 & 0101 1010 == 0001 0001 — 57 & 90 = 17 . Similarly, the | operator does a bitwise OR. Using these operators, we can use each of those 1s and 0s as a boolean flag separately. So, if, for example, sourceDragMask is the value 12 , what does this tell us? In binary, 12 is represented as 0000 1100 , or 8 | 4 , which according to the NSDraggingInfo Protocol Reference , is NSDragOperationPrivate | NSDragOperationGeneric . So if we & this with NSDragOperationGeneric , we get 4 out, which is non-zero and therefore true. In this way, we can check whether a bitmask contains a certain flag.
