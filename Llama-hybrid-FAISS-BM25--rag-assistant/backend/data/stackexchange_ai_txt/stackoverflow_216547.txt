Tomalak's answer is good, but this can get tricky. Given a file named "mydoc.ver1.doc" (a valid Windows file name) which is the filename and which is the extension? What if there is a filepath? You can still leverage the list functions to your advantage, however, even in these scenarios. You can easily parse out the file from the path with fullFileName=listLast(fieldname,"\/") If you assume the filename is everything before the dot, then theFileName=listFirst(fullFileName,".") will work. If you want to ensure that you get everything but what's after the last period, then a little trickery is needed, but not much. There is not a listAllButLast() function (although such a thing might exist on CFLIB.org) but there are two ways I can think of to get what you're after. fileName=reverse(listRest(reverse(fullFileName),".")) or fileName=listDeleteAt(fullFileName,listLen(fullFileName,"."),".") As with Tomalak's suggestion, however, this will break down on a filename that lacks an extension. Wrapping this in a will account for that.
