I like to do as others stated here. Write down in pseudo code what the flow of your app will be. This immediately highlights some detailed areas that may require further attention that where not apparent up front. Pseudo code is also readable to business users who can verify your approach meets their needs. Using pseudo code also creates a nice set of methods that could be put to use as an interface in the final solution. Once the pseudo code is fairly tight, look for patterns and review some common GOF patterns. They do not have to be perfect but using them will sheild you from having to rewrite the code later during the revisions that are bound to come along. Just taking an hour or two write psuedo code, yields some invaluable time saving pieces later on: 1. An object model emerges 2. The program's flow is clearly defined for others 3. It can be used as documentation of your design with some refinement 4. Comments are easier to add and will be clearer for someone else reviewing your code. Best of luck to you!
