Why does the weight vector in a perceptron monotonically tend to the generously feasible region

In a course on Machine Learning, in the chapter about a Perceptron, there is this statement: If a generously feasible region exists, then the distance between the current weight vector and a weight vector in the generously feasible region will monotonically decrease as the learning proceeds. Why is this the case?
