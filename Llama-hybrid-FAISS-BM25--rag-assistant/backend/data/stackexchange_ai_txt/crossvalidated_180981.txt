How can I forecast a time series using Cart models?

I'm using the rpart library to try forecasting the electricity consumption from Australia (example from the book Introductory Time Series with R): CBE : choc beer elec 1451 96.3 1497 .... All the data is separate in months from 1958 til 1970 library(rpart) www It's really simple, the R program does not run , if I try to create a model using the elec data it self . Am I using it wrong? How Can I use this library properly ?
