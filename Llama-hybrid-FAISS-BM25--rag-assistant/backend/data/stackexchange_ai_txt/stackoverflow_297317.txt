As a C programmer, I find it annoying when C++ programmers try to "port" C to C++. While there are many advantages to using the C++ language structures, they don't always improve on the simple function oriented approach of C. Since you can always get at the C functionality via extern "C" , there's little reason to alter working code. In projects I've worked on, creating object wrappers around C code has worked well. That way the core code can be shared among teams working in either language and everyone can use a interface that matches their environment. We've even "back-ported" some C++ code to C to encourage code reuse. I work with several different project teams that use a C++ wrapper around a C core for database access. Some teams use C++ and others are C only, but the core functionality is shared among the teams. We are in the maintenance period, so even if a C team wanted to port to C++ it wouldn't be feasible. The attempts I've seen to convert C to C++ have resulted in longer, more convoluted, but no more expressive code. YMMV, of course.
