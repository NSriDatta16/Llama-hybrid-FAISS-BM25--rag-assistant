Propensity scores and linearity in logistic regression

I know (and have read in other posts) that logistic regression isn't the only way to calculate propensity scores. But if you do want to use logistic regression for that, must you then check the linearity assumption? And since it's the relationship between the independent variables and the log odds that should be linear, you must first run your logistic regression to get the log odds and then for example plot the independent variables one by one against the log odds to check that assumption, right? Finally, when calculating propensity scores in this way, do you need to check for multicollinearity between the x-variables?
