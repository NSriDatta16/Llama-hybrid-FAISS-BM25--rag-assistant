I have a project ( TournamentsApi ) that was made for tracking and rendering tournaments. You should take a look at it. On my site, I'm rendering the brackets to SVG and embedding them in the HTML. I'd be happy to share the code I use for the SVG generation / embedding, if you were inclined to use my implementation. Of course, mine is written in C#, so it may not suit you uses. However, the source code was released under the MIT license, and you are free to use the data structures I have created for your own project
