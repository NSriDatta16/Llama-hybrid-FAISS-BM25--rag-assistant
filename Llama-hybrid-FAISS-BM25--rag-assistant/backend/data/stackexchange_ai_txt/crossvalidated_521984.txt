Calculating expected value for a gacha game

I'm trying to do some sanity check on a gacha game I'm playing as I suspect their calculations are off. I've already done a monte-carlo simulation to verify my hypothesis, but I'm not sure how to do this statistically. The rules of the game are as follows: a player can do a "pull", which gives him a hero that is randomly selected the more pulls a player does, the higher a chance of getting the hero that he wants From pull 1 to 100, there's a 0.5% probability of success per pull (defined by getting the hero he wants) From pull 101 to 199 there is a 1% probability of success per pull If the player fails to get the hero he wants by turn 199, he will always get the hero on turn 200 (pity counter) The probabilities and numbers of pull then reset to 0.5% and 0. I can calculate the probability of a successful pull before turn 200 1 - 0.995 ^ 100 * 0.99 ^ 99 , or around 78%. What I'm not too sure is how to calculate the average number of pulls required to get 1 copy (around 110-120 based on my simulations), as well as the average number of pulls required to get multiple (say 3) copies. Is it possible to model this as some sort of equation, or do I need to use simulations?
