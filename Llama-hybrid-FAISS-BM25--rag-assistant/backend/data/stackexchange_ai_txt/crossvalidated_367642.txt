To add some color to the anomaly detection answer by redhqs, at work I build anomaly detection models for operational metrics like sales and traffic flows. We do the time series analysis to understand what sales ought to be if everything is working as expected, and then compare these to the observed values to see whether the web site is broken. It's important because for every minute the site is down we are losing a lot of money. There are different methods you can use, and different methods try to accomplish different things in many cases. For example the main statistical method I have used for sales anomaly detection is called "STL" (seasonal-trend decomposition using loess). This separates the regular seasonality, trend and random noise. We actually use this to identify both daily and weekly seasonalities. Then we throw out the noise, and combine the trend/seasonalities to estimate expected sales. So in our case we use the approach to understand how sales vary with time of day and time of week, and to exclude random noise from the estimates.
