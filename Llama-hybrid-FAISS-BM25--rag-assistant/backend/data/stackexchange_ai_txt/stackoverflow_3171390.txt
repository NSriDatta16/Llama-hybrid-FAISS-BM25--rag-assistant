HSQLDB has had its own share of database corruption issues but has improved over the years. In the latest versions precautions and fixes have been introduced to prevent all the issues that were reported in the last few years. The new lob storage feature however, turned out to have a logic bug that results in the lobs being "forgotten" after an update. This is being fixed right now, with more extensive tests to support the fix. Users like CarlG have helped a lot over the years in the bug fixing efforts of both Derby and HSQLDB.
