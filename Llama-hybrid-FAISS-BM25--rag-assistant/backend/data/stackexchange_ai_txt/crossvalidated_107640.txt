Is it wrong to refer to results as being "highly significant"?

Why do statisticians discourage us from referring to results as " highly significant" when the $p$-value is well below the conventional $\alpha$-level of $0.05$? Is it really wrong to trust a result that has 99.9% chance of not being a Type I error ($p=0.001$) more than a result that only gives you that chance at 99% ($p=0.01$)?
