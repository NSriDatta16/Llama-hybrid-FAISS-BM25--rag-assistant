Grouping subject data for within-subject analysis in SPSS

I have over 30 subjects who each did the same task about 50 times. Each of these data point can be in condition a1 or a2 of variable A or condition b1, b2, b3 or b4. So for each subject, I have datapoints for a1b1, a2b2, etc. I have three dependent variables (v1, v2, v3) for each data point. I understand that this is a within-subject analysis, done through a repeated measure test. But the way I understand it, if I want to compare a1 to a2, I have to make a column for a1 with each subject's average for a1, the same for a2, and compare those two columns. And I have to do it for each dependent variable, and then again for b1-b4. And if I want to study the interaction, I have to do the same for a1b1, a2b1, a1b2, and so on, again for each dependent variable. This seems quite impractical. As of now, my data is set with a column for subject's ID, a column for A condition, a column for B condition, a column for each dependent variable v1 v2 and v3, and a row for each data point. Is there a way to do the repeated measure analysis as follows? "(average of v1 when A=a1 for each subject) vs (average of v2 when A=a2 for each subjet)"
