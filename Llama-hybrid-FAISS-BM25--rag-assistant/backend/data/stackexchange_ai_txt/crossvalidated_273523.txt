Use of Anova with Likert scales is problematic as explained here and here . My recommendation is to use ordered logistic regression or some other model from Item response theory . In R you can use polr function from MASS package ( here is a nice tutorial) or use MCMC samplers such as rSTAN or rJAGS for more flexibility.
