You really should read the TCPDF fonts documentation . What happens is that the font you specified is embedded within the PDF. This will make sure that people that don't have that font on their computer will still be able to see the document as you intended (ie. with the correct font). You can change the default behaviour using the $subset parameter of AddFont/SetFont. The relevant info from the TCPDF source : @param $subset (mixed) if true embed only a subset of the font (stores only the information related to the used characters); if false embedd full font; if 'default' uses the default value set using setFontSubsetting(). This option is valid only for TrueTypeUnicode fonts. If you want to enable users to change the document, set this parameter to false. If you subset the font, the person who receives your PDF would need to have your same font in order to make changes to your PDF. The file size of the PDF would also be smaller because you are embedding only part of a font. So if you don't want your PDF to become larger : stick to the standard (core) PDF fonts as specified in the docs.
