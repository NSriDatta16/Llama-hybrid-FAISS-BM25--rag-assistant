Controlling start up sequence of a windows service

I have a windows service installed using installutil and set to "Autostart". My problem is that when some servers are rebooted it attempts to start before "Microsoft SQL service" has started- I can see this by looking at the event log during a system restart. What is the best way of making my service "auto start" AFTER Sql server service has started? I am toying with the idea of creating a SQL job set to start when "SQL server agent" starts that in turn starts the windows service. But hopefully, there is an easy, effective way of controlling the order in which automatic services start up.
