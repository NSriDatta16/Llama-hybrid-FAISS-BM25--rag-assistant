Bayesian 'post hoc' testing

I am exploring the world of Bayesian statistics, and am using the BayesFactor package in R. My data is very basic: I have one column (condition) with multiple conditions, my dependent variable is numeric and ranges from 0 to 10. When I run an ANOVA test using a frequentist approach, I follow up with a post hoc test (e.g., Tukey, Bonferroni) to see the effect of the different conditions. My Bayesian Anova reports a very high K value, yet I am unsure how I can follow up this test. I went through the blog post, Multiple comparisons with Bayes factors , but it did not make me much wiser. Any comments on how to approach this problem? (Preferably using R in combination with the BayesFactor package).
