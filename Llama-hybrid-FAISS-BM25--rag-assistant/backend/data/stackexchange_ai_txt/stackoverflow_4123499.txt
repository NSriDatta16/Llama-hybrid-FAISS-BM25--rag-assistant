Is it right to only test my controllers in an MVC web app running in the Microsoft cloud and using table storage?

I'm developing a web app with MVC 2.0. I'm storing my data in Windows Azure table storage. I'm not using any mocking for my test. The test framework is the default Microsoft Unit Testing that comes with Visual Studio. At the moment, I'm only testing my controllers: the view names that are returned, the flow when the code jumps from action to action and the view models that are sometimes returned sent to the views. My approach isn't TDD: I write a bit of code and then I test it to make sure it passes. I'm just unit testing, not driving my development by testing first. Am I doing the right thing with my testing: is it enough to just test the controllers?
