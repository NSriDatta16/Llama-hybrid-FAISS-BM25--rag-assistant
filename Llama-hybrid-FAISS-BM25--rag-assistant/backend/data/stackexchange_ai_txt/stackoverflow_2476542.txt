Ivy/gant include BlazeDS jars that aren`t in a public repo and have no version

I ve been trying to figure out the best way to include the BlazeDS jars in my Gant/Ivy build. I ve been unable to find a public repo for these jars and I m new to ivy. Obviously with Maven you d just do a local maven install to your local repo. Whats the best way to do something similar with Ivy? Do I have to create a separate Ivy.xml file for each jar and then use Ivy Publish or is their another way? Also does anyone know a public repo where the BlazeDS Jars are available
