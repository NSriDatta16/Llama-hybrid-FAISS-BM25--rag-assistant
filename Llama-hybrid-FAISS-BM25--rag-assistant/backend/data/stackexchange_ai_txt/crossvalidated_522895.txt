Suppose opinion in your group is stable with the following respective probabilities for Likert-5 responses, which would give mean score $3.8.$ op.prop = c(1,1,1,3,4)/10 Then let's look at fictitious averages over 1000 months with $n = 20$ responses for your group. set.seed(2021) a = replicate(1000, mean(sample(1:5, 20, rep=T, p = op.prop))) summary(a) Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. 2.750 3.600 3.800 3.786 4.000 4.600 sum(a 4) [1] 482 The lower and upper quartiles are 3.6 and 4.0, respectively, so that in about half of the 1000 months, average scores would lie below 3.6 or above 4.0. With my hypothetical opinion profile for Likert-5 scores in your group it would not be at all surprising to see month-to-month fluctuations as large as what you have observed.
