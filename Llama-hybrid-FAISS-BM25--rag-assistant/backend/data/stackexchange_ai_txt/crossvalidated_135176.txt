I highly recommend to read this survey: Camastra, F. (2003). Data dimensionality estimation methods: a survey. Pattern recognition , 36 (12), 2945-2954 . For performing this estimation, I found very good toolbox in matlab Matlab Toolbox for Dimensionality Reduction . In addition to the techniques for dimensionality reduction, the toolbox contains implementations of 6 techniques for intrinsic dimensionality estimation
