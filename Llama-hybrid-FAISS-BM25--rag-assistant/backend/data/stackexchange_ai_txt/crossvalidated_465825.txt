Is the leptokurtic distribution always time varying and what will the impact be on a weak stationary time series

I hope this alteration will make more sense. A normal distribution is defined by its first and second moment. When these are finite, as in the case of weak stationarity, then the weak stationarity will also imply strict stationarity, as the distribution will be the same for all time periods. However shouldn't this also apply for a leptokurtic distribution, as long as it is symmetric along the mean? Can the leptokurtic distribution only be present in a time varying sequence as the outliers of the distribution are very extreme compared to a normal distribution, and then this naturally imply a time varying distribution?
