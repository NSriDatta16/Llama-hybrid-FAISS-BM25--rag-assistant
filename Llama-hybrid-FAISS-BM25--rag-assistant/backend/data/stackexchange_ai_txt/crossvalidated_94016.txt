Choosing between chi-squared / logistic regression vs difference of mean tests for studying bankruptices

You'd expect more companies to go bankrupt if they have low cash balances. Of course, bankruptcies can also happen even when you have lot of cash on hand (to terminate labor contracts, etc.). The distributions are shown below: A chi-squared test shows an association of bankruptcies with cash-on-hand. I then check the results using logistic regression which actually gives me negative coefficients for low cash balances! (Using LR is fine as I have ~2000 positives for ~150k observations). I'm thinking about a simple difference of means test to show that cash balances for bankruptcies differ than those for healthy companies. Do you suggest any other statistical test that I can use instead?
