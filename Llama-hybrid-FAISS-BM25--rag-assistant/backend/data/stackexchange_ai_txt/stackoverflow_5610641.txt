If you open the Guitar Pro bundle, you should be able to discern whether the app is registered to respond to any custom URL schemes or file types. The information will be found in the Info.plist or equivalent file. For example, Good Reader is registered to open PDFs, so when you get a PDF attachment in Mail.app, it gives you the option to open it in that app. And with the URLs, the YouTube and Maps apps are able to open. The key you're looking for in the plist file is CFBundleURLTypes Apple has a section about communicating with the custom URLs in their Standard Behaviors document. A related excerpt: To communicate with an application using a custom URL, create an NSURL object with some properly formatted content and pass that object to the openURL: method of the shared UIApplication object. The openURL: method launches the application that registered to receive URLs of that type and passes it the URL. At that point, control passes to the new application. The following code fragment illustrates how one application can request the services of another application (“todolist” in this example is a hypothetical custom scheme registered by an application): NSURL *myURL = [NSURL URLWithString:@"todolist://www.acme.com?Quarterly%20Report#200806231300"]; [[UIApplication sharedApplication] openURL:myURL]; http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/iphone/conceptual/iphoneosprogrammingguide/StandardBehaviors/StandardBehaviors.html
