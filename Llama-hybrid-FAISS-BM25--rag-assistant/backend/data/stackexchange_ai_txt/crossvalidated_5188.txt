The object returned by read.bugs is an object of S3 class mcmc.list . You can use the double brackets [[ to access the separate chains, i.e. the different mcmc -objects that make up the larger mcmc.list object, which really is simply a list of mcmc -objects that inherits some information about thinning and chain length from its components. More to the point, s.th. like lapply(codaobject, function(x){ colMeans(x) }) should return the posterior means for each parameter in each chain and lapply(codaobject, function(x){ apply(x, 2, sd) }) should give chain- and parameter-specific posterior sd's, since each chain is essentially just a numeric matrix with rows corresponding to the (saved) iterations and columns corresponding to the different params. EDIT: I think Gelman/Hill's "Bayesian Data Analysis" contains some worked examples using R2WinBUGS.
