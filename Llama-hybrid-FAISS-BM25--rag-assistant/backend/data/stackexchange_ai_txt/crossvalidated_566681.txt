logit GLM or traditional ML logistic regression for the probability of an event ocurring

Sorry if the question is naive. I have a problem where i should predict the probability that someone will make a claim given a bunch of predictors. Let's say that the claim can take a range of values between 0-5 and it's highly skewed (gamma distribution). Could someone tell me what is the benefit of using ML logistic regression over a GLM logit model or vice versa? Thanks
