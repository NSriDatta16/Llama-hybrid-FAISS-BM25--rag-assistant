I would recommend the book "The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction" (2nd ed.) by Trevor Hastie , Robert Tibshirani and Jerome Friedman . Along with the printed edition, this IMHO beautiful (both content-wise and visually) book is available as free download in PDF format at the link on this page: http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn . Section 14.5 of the book is focused on PCA and is, in my humble opinion, theoretically relatively rigorous. The subsequent sections (14.6 and later) are focused on presenting some alternatives to PCA . Also, section 3.5.1 is focused on the related topic of principal components regression . Hope this helps (and I helped you to save some pocket change for a trip to a seminar/course :-).
