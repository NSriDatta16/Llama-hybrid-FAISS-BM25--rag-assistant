Suppose you are making a website for real people, reading real text (and lets assume people are more important than world wide web network, which then is more important than giant searchengines etc etc) Then, when writing a paragraph, it ould be helpfull to include readable text, as opposed to full url, unless you want to just link to the main root of a website, but often you link to a specific page, with a specific content... Example right out of my fantasy. On our vacation we visited the Buenos Aires Hotel which had a splendid view on the Boulevar Des Magnifiques , a tropical double laned walking street overviwing the sea on the Cliff Savage de Sollei. I will never forget the fish we ate at the Risotto Restaurant . It came close to my first kiss which I gave in our holiday in Egypt to my current husband. Now read the above text again, but insted put there the full urls, see my point? Care about your audience / real people more than caring about rules especially machine-rules
