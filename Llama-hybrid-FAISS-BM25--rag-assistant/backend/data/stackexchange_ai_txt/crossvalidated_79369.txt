AIC itself doesn't adjust the model, but serves as a tool to select the best model if you construct multiple ones. It's basically a tradeoff between residual error and model complexity. You can furthermore take a look at other "information criteria" or more advanced techniques like crossvalidation, penalized logistic regression ("penalized" package in R), ...
