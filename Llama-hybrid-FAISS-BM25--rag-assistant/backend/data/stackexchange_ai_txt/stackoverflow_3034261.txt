Conditional Styling In Silverlight?

While I'm fine with standard control styling in silverlight I have recently began using more dynamic methods of fetching data to be displayed in items controls. One of the controls I am reworking is a collection of links. The issue I am having is that each link is coloured differently when moused over. One red, one blue, one green, etc. Is there a way to style these items without sacrificing the dynamics of using an items control with a data template?
