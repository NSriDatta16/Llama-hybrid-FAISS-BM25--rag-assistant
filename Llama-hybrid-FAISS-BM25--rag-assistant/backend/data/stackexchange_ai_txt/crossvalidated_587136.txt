How are repeating dependent variable in long-data format affect outcomes in mixed effects linear regression models

My question is about the mixed effects linear regression analysis (i.e. lme4 or brms libraries in R) using long data format in R. How does brms analyze the data where the dependent variable repeats itself across the rows of a changing independent variable within the same subject? i.e. I would like to see if blood pressure predicts body temperature. In this design we measured blood pressure 10 times within every 30 minutes and body temperature at the end of every 30 minutes. Consequently, Iâ€™d like to see if the average blood pressure within 30 minutes predicts the consequent body temperature at the end of every 30 minutes. In a long data format, may I have the body temperature repeat itself 10 times (as many times as the blood pressure measure) to ask this question? Or do I need to average the blood pressure for each 30 minutes and then relate that to blood temperature? What is the statistical difference here? Thank you!
