If you want to check if all of the elements of a list are equal, a quick solution is allEqual [] = True --(edit: this case is not necessary as pointed out by sepp2k) allEqual xs = all (== head xs) xs Somebody will write a more elegant way to do this, I am sure, but this is serviceable. Edit: Thanks to sepp2k for the suggestions.
