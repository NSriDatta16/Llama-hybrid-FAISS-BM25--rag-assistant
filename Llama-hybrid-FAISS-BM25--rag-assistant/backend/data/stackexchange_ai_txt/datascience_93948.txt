How to convert longitude and latitude in time series data from daily to weekly?

I have time series data like this: date longitude latitude 01/01/2010 -5.42766 107.5784 02/01/2010 -6.42728 104.5245 07/01/2010 -7.42702 105.5816 14/01/2010 -4.42728 99.57834 17/01/2010 -6.41523 103.5562 ... ... ... 31/12/2013 -4.42728 99.57834 This is location data (longitude and latitude). I want to change the data from daily to weekly, something like this: week longitude latitude week 1 ... ... week 2 ... ... week 3 ... ... week 4 ... ... how to transform the data? since calculating the mean of the data doesn't make sense because it is location data.
