The dbo prefix you are seeing is called a schema. This is the same for products. The schema is somewhat like a namespace for sql server. If you want to attempt transferring the tables in the product schema to the dbo schema, you would use the following syntax: ALTER SCHEMA dbo TRANSFER product.[someTable] However, if the table name in the product schema already exists in the dbo schema, you will not be able to do it, since you can't have two tables with the same name. Mostly, your schema will be for organization purposes. Addition The reason you don't need to add the 'dbo.' schema prefix in your queries is because this is the default schema for every database. When you write queries without this schema, SQL Server just assumes you mean 'dbo'. Some best practices state that your queries should always include the schema.
