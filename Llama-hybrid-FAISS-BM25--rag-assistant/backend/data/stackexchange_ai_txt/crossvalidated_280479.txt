I would suggest to start with a model without the lagged component, hence something like $$SW_{i,t} = \beta_0 + \sum_{q\in Categories} \beta_q Cycle_{q,i,t} + \beta_{q+1}Water_{i,t}+u_{i,t}$$ as you do not know whether there is a temporal correlation in the data. Then you can have a look at the residuals $\hat{u}_{i,t}$ and start with a visual analysis via plotting the time series of resiudals. If there are some patterns you might consider doing something like $$\hat{u}_{j,t} = \gamma_{0,j} +\rho_j \hat{u}_{j,t-1}+ \eta_{j,t}$$ for all $j$ sites. In case that some of the $\rho_{j}$'s are significant you could rebuild your model by employing $$SW_{i,t} = \beta_0 + \sum_{q\in Categories} \beta_q Cycle_{q,i,t} + \beta_{q+1}Water_{i,t}+\beta_{q+2}SW_{i,t-1}+\epsilon_{i,t}.$$ Then you can check the residuals again in order to look whether the autocorrelation is gone. By this approach you not only detect the autocorrelation, but you also gain a sound reason, why to include the lagged response.
