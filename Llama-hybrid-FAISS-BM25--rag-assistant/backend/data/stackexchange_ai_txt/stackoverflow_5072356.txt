flash as3 sortOn - sorting an array by another array's position

I'm not quite sure how to do this - I'm building an admin interface to sort the order of a series of flash slides into a dynamic presentation. The admin interface pulls the slides from xml and displays each as a thumbnail. The thumbnails, when dragged, reorder themselves in the array appropriately. The problem is, I want the actual array of slides to reorganize itself accordingly. My code is this: function onThumbPress( e:MouseEvent ):void { e.target.startDrag(); } function onThumbRelease( e:MouseEvent ):void { e.currentTarget.stopDrag(); sortSlides(); } function sortSlides():void { project_thumbs_array.sortOn( 'x', Array.NUMERIC ); for (var i:int = 0; i So what I want to do is take the change in the array (say 0 moves in front of 1 in project_thumbs_array) - and make sure that my other array (project_clips_array) moves item 0 in front of 1 as well. I thought something like this might work but it doesn't: project_clips_array.sortOn ('project_thumbs_array.x',Array.NUMERIC);
