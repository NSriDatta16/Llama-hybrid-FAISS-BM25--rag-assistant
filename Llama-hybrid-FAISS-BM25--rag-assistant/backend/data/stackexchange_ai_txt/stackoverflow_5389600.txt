jQuery - change background image on mouseover but not if element is selected?

I need set a background image on mouseover, but not if the element is selected. Im using the jscrollpane: http://jscrollpane.kelvinluck.com/ I need I need the scrollbar (div.jspDrag) to have a different background image when a users hovers their mouse over it. However I need the background image to change back to its original when the drag the scrollbar. The hover pseudo-class is standard, but how do i recognize if the element is being dragged? Should I have a jquery listener to see if the mouse button is being held down? Thanks EDIT Ive tried the following but it does nothing: $("document").ready(function() { $(".node-type-collection-public .jspDrag").mouseenter(function() { $(this).css("background-color","red"); }); });
