It's unclear what the ordering algorithm is for your filenames. It doesn't appear to be entirely dictated by the filename (such as alphabetical ordering). If you have arbitrary order in which you must execute these scripts, I would recommend that you create an additional file which defines that order, and use that to drive the ordering. If the list of filenames is known at compile time, you could just hard-code that order in your code. I'm assuming, from your question, however, that the set of files is likely to change, and new ones may be added. If that's the case, I refer you to my previous paragraph.
