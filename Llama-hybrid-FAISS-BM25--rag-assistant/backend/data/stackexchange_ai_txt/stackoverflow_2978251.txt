Suggestions for a web framework with no external dependencies

Recently I was asked to take over the website of a small-ish non-profit organization. The website is a pretty simple setup, about a dozen pages of relatively static information, some image galleries and a main page with recent information about the organization, etc. (even the main page won't be updated very often). My first thought was to lay down a simple CMS like Wordpress or Joomla, when I discovered something rather unfortunate. Because this is a non-profit, the website is being served off of some donated hosting without the benefit of a PHP/Ruby/Python install. What this means is that I'm limited to serving up straight HTML/CSS/JavaScript and basically nothing else. What I'm looking for, then, is suggestions for a web development framework that, as a final step, could "pre-compile" the website into straight HTML/CSS/JavaScript that I could then upload to the server. I know I could write everything myself by hand, but there is going to be a lot of boilerplate code shared between every page that I don't want to have to copy and paste over and over again. The only framework that comes to mind is Google Web Toolkit , but that seems like it might be a bit overkill for my requirements. Really all I need is a decent templating framework that I could plug new content into, as basically every page will share the same header, footer and navigation. Any other suggestions?
