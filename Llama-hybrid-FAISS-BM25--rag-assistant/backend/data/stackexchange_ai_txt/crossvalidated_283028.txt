Does adding audits produce less biased data?

My team made a survey about sexual behaviors among college students in China, and the result looks unreasonable 1 , so we suspect that many of the participants aren't serious when filling out the questionnaires. I'm considering adding audits in the questionnaires. For example, On average, how often do you have sex with others? never twice a year or less more than twice a year, less than or equal to once a month more than once a month, less than or equal to once a week more than once a week, less than or equal to once a day more than once a day, less than or equal to once an hour more than once an hour Since it's practically impossible for one to have sex more than once an hour, if a participant chose more than once an hour , we'll mark their response as invalid and ignore it when performing analysis. Or maybe a more generic one like: Monnow Bridge (Welsh: Pont Trefynwy) in Monmouth, Wales, is the only remaining fortified river bridge in Great Britain with its gate tower standing on the bridge. It crosses the River Monnow 500 metres (1,600 ft) above its confluence with the River Wye. Please choose Disagree below. Agree strongly Agree Disagree Disagree strongly If a participate chose anything other than Disagree , it indicates that they wasn't paying attention when taking the survey, and thus their response would be filtered out. My question is: does adding such audits produce less biased data? if so, will it have a large impact? also, will it introduce extra noise? 1: I'm not going to disclose the accurate figures, but it looks like "0% of the participants had sex between once a week and once a day, while ~5% of them had sex more than once a day". Also note that the Chinese society is quite conservative.
