Probably means to transform the time series with first differencing (to deal with a trend) and/or log (to make the trend more linear) to create a stationary time series that can be modeled with ARMA. Here is a reference https://otexts.com/fpp2/stationarity.html . Alternately, you might choose an exponential smoothing model instead, which compared to ARIMA, has a more robust and elegant way to deal with trends.
