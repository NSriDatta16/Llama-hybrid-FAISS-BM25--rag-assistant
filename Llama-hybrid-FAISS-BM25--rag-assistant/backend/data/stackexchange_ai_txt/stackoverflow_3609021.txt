The downside of the "if" solution is that the commented out code still has to be compiled (and therefore still has to be syntax checked). The downside of your pod solution is that your comments will appear in any documentation generated from the pod. I use a version of the pod solution that doesn't have that problem. Pod supports =begin format ... =end format paragraphs that are handled by specific formatters. I just invent a "comment" format that isn't handled by any of the formatters I use. #!/usr/bin/perl print "This line is executed\n"; =begin comment print "This line isn't\n"; =end comment =cut print "This line is\n";
