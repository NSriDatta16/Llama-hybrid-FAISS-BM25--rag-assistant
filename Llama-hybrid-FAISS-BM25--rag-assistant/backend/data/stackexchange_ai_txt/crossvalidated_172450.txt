The figures you refer to are contour plots of the hyperparameter response surface, that is the cross-validated performance for each pair of hyperparameters. Visualizing grid search is effectively only useful when you have a pair of hyperparameters, which is rarely the case. Grid search is generally a poor approach to optimize hyperparameters, though it is still by far the most common approach. Better approaches use metaheuristic or Bayesian solvers and are available in packages like Optunity and Hyperopt . Here are some examples of SVM hyperparameter optimization using Optunity: optimizing the kernel family and its hyperparameterization at once: http://optunity.readthedocs.org/en/latest/notebooks/notebooks/sklearn-svc.html with contours: http://optunity.readthedocs.org/en/latest/notebooks/notebooks/local-optima.html optimizing learning algorithm and hyperparameterization: http://optunity.readthedocs.org/en/latest/notebooks/notebooks/sklearn-automated-classification.html Disclaimer: I'm the main developer of Optunity. Edit: only realize now that you asked about alternative figure types instead of alternative optimization approaches, so I guess part of this answer is not directly relevant. That said, I think the suboptimality of grid search can't be stressed enough.
