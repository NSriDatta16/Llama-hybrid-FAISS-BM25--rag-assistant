What is the best way to create a "fully" modular ZF-based application?

For the past time I have been working on a Zend Framework based webshop application that we are building from scratch. The application has been successfully been set up for several clients, but we are stumbling upon more and more problems regarding extensibility and modularity of the application. A lot of clients require a lot of different approaches on some matters, often requiring customizing default modules or extending them. I have been looking on the web for Zend Framework based code that could guide me to this and so far Magento has been the only example I have come up with. Although Magento seems to do a very good job offering extensibility and modularity, the code is far too complex and extensive for my current needs (or so it seems). In an ideal situation, it would work as follows: Each client gets the "base" application installed Modules, controllers, models should be easily overridden or extended New modules should be easily created Are there any other Zend Framework based applications or other pointers that could guide me in the right direction? Thanks in advance.
