Insert into replicated table fails - identity range check

I'm trying to insert a few thousand rows into a table in a database that is replicated across two servers. From either the publisher or the subscriber, I get the same error: Msg 548, Level 16, State 2, Line 1 The insert failed. It conflicted with an identity range check constraint in database 'XXX', replicated table 'dbo.NODE_ATTRIB_RSLT', column 'ID'. If the identity column is automatically managed by replication, update the range as follows: for the Publisher, execute sp_adjustpublisheridentityrange; for the Subscriber, run the Distribution Agent or the Merge Agent. The statement has been terminated. Checking the constraint on the table, it seems to me like I should be able to insert at least 1000 rows at a time before running into issues. However, I get the same error when trying to insert just a few tens of rows! Here's how I'm trying to insert data: insert into NODE_ATTRIB_RSLT ([NODE_ID] ,[ATTRIB_ID] ,[STATE_ID] ,[PLAN_REVISION_ID] ,[TIMESTAMP] ,[VALUE] ,[VALUE_TEXT] ,[LAST_MODIFIED]) SELECT [NODE_ID] ,[ATTRIB_ID] ,[STATE_ID] ,[PLAN_REVISION_ID] ,[TIMESTAMP] ,[VALUE] ,[VALUE_TEXT] ,[LAST_MODIFIED] FROM [NODE_ATTRIB_RSLT_TEMP] The PK column is an autogenerated identity called ID. To try to insert fewer rows at a time I've added a WHERE clause at the end of the select like so: WHERE ID >= 1000 and ID but to no avail. Running sp_adjustpublisheridentityrange on the Publisher executes successfully but has no effect. How can I fix this problem with inserts? How can I modify the ranges of the indentity range contraints to a more reasonable level while leaving the replication running?
