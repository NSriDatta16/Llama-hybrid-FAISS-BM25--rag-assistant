Explaining race conditions to a non-technical audience

Recently, I found myself having to write up some concerns I have about race conditions in an application that is in development (not by me). This will likely be brought to the attention of stakeholders who are non-technical and with whom I do not have a direct line of communication, so my explanation needs to be in written form. I have already made an attempt at this write-up. I gloss over the technical specifics as best I can, give an example of how a race condition would occur in the application, and describe its impact. I feel I did pretty well, but it's far from perfect. The problem is, as much as I try to shield the reader from computer science, I have still found it difficult to eliminate phrases like "threads of execution" and "mutual exclusion" without losing correctness and substance. The risk is that, with too much hand-waving, these concerns could be dismissed as a made-up boogeyman. Anyway, my question to you is this: How would you explain race conditions to a non-technical audience? Would you dare to explain CPU scheduling? Would you invoke the dining philosophers ? You don't have to work within the constraints of my situation (but it would be awesomely helpful if you did).
