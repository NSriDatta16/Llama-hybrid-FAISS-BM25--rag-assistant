Do Bayesians ever argue there are cases in which their approach generalizes/overlaps with the frequentist approach?

Do Bayesians ever argue that their approach generalizes the frequentist approach, because one can use non-informative priors and therefore, can recover a typical frequentist model structure? Can anyone refer me to a place where I can read about this argument, if it is indeed used? EDIT: This question is maybe phrased not exactly the way I meant to phrase it. The question is: "is there any reference to discussion of the cases in which the Bayesian approach and the frequentist approach overlap/intersect/have something in common through the use of a certain prior?" One example would be using the improper prior $p(\theta) = 1$, but I am pretty sure this is just the tip of the tip of the iceberg.
