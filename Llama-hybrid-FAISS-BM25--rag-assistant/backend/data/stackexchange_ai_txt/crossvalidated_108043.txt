Backshift operator property not clear

In my introductory book on time series analysis the backshift operator $\mathbf{B}$ is introduced using the following definition: $$ \mathbf{B}x_t=x_{t-1} $$ Then the author sets off to derive some properties of random walks, and there is this step, that is a complete mystery to me: $$ x_t=(1-\mathbf{B})^{-1}w_t\Rightarrow x_t=(1+\mathbf{B}+\mathbf{B}^2+\mathbf{B}^3+\dots)w_t $$ I do not understand how $(1-\mathbf{B})^{-1}$ is equivalent to $(1+\mathbf{B}+\mathbf{B}^2+\mathbf{B}^3+\dots)$. Maybe in the book the author did not provide some important properties of the backshift operator that were used deriving the above step.
