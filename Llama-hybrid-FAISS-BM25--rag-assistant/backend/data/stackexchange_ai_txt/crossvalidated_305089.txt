Difference in means vs difference in proportions

Can i use difference in proportion test to compare two ratios i.e the average height of two groups a and b are 1.4m and 1.6 respectively. Assuming i have the sample sizes of these groups, can i use difference in proportions calculator (test) to evaluate whether there is a significant difference between the heights of the two groups instead of difference in means hypothesis test? What happens if the heights are 0.7m and 0.6m respectively? Is using difference in proportions calculator to identify whether there is a significant difference between the two groups highlighted above a right approach. If not, how does this flawed interpretation change w.r.t to the values being compared?
