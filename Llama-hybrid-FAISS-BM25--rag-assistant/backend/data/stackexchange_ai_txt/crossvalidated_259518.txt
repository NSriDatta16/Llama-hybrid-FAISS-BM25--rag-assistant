To determine what the distribution of the individual parameters look like, bootstrapping can be used within each time group to better explore what the basis is for extrapolation for prediction. If that is done then two years is enough data to test for a significance of difference, but not enough to establish a trend, because we lack a third value to test accuracy of forward and backward extrapolation (error of 1,2 for predicting 3, and error of 3,2 for predicting 1) or for interpolation (error of 1,3 for predicting 2). The absolute range of the parameters is needed information. The distributions of the parameters in each category is needed. Once that information is supplied, suitable transformations can be explored for transformation of parameters for linear model or other extrapolation model of parameter prediction. Update from further information: The cumulative distribution function of the Dagum distribution (Type I) is given by $F(x;a,b,p)= {\left( 1+{\left(\frac{x}{b}\right)}^{-a} \right)}^{-p} $ for $x > 0 $ and where $ a, b, p > 0 $. The cumulative distribution function of the Dagum (Type II) distribution adds a point mass at the origin and then follows a Dagum (Type I) distribution over the rest of the support (i.e. over the positive halfline) $F(x;a,b,p,\delta)= \delta + (1-\delta) {\left( 1+{\left(\frac{x}{b}\right)}^{-a} \right)}^{-p} .$ The results you list, since the last parameter is zero, seem to correspond to a Type I Dagum distribution. You need at least one more data point to test any trend assumption. Also, the Dagum parameter support for $x,a,b,p>0$, which may be problematic, as follows. Next update: With the third set of parameters, provided that they correspond in the order listed, to those above, we now have year k a b 2012 0.12941 10.504 146.90 2014 0.17555 9.9954 147.31 2016 0.20865 9.9207 146.58 Now, if we just do ordinary least squares linear regression on this we obtain $k = -39.73 + 0.01981year$ with $p=0.0603$ (ANOVA F-test) $ a = 303.8 - 0.1458year$ with $p=0.2562$ $ b = 308.1 - 0.08000year$ with $p=0.7119$ Only the regression line for $k$ has a borderline significant probability, and the others are not significant. Upon further testing we cannot be assured that the line slopes are in the directions indicated or the $y$-axis intercepts useful. Use of power functions and potentially more motivated fit models have the problem that the date is not a start time for literacy, whereas recorded history , our defacto marker of literacy, began ~5000 years ago, with the exact date being unknown. Thus, if we use non-linear functions to fit the 3 points above with semi-infinite support having $0\leq t
