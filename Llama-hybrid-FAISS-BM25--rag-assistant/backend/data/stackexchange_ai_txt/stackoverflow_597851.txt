Help required with ancient, unknown storage system

Morning all, I've gone and told a customer I could migrate some of their old data out of a DOS based system into the new system I've developed for them. However I said that without actually looking at the files that stored the data in the old system - I just figured a quick google would solve all the problem for me... I was wrong! Anyway, this program has a folder with hundreds... well 800 files with all sorts of file extensions, .ave, .bak, .brw, .dat, .001, .002...., .007, .dbf, .dbe and .his. .Bak obviously isn't a SQL backup file. Does anyone have any programming experience using any of those file types who may be able to point me in the direction of some way to read and extract the data? I cant mention the program name for the reason that I don't think the original developer will allow this... Thanks.
