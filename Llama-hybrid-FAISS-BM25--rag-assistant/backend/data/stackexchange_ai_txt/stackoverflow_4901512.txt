Great Delphi source code to read and learn from

This question relates to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9603/what-is-some-great-source-code-to-read which compiles a list of great (in the sense of readable, elegant, ...) source code. Part of the learning experience when reading source code is certainly independent of the language but every language has its own ways to do certain things. So in this question, I'm looking for great Delphi code. What is some great Delphi source code to read and learn from? Any suggestions?
