Error message in logistic regression model

I am trying to understand how both temperature (factor: 6 levels - 20, 23, 26, 29, 32, 35 degrees Celsius) and species (factor: 2 levels HA and AP) affects the likelihood of moving from one life stage to the next (in this case from the 2nd instar to the 3rd) using a logistic regression model as below: X3rdmodelA When I try to run the model the following error appears: Warning message: glm.fit: algorithm did not converge Would anyone be able to tell me why this error might be occurring and what I may do to fix it. Below is the data I am using if this is helpful: Temperature Species No.2nd No.3rd 20 AP 32 30 23 AP 53 50 26 AP 46 39 29 AP 72 66 32 AP 38 32 35 AP 3 7 20 HA 41 41 23 HA 48 42 26 HA 117 113 29 HA 89 87 32 HA 42 42 35 HA 59 39 Any help anyone could provide would be greatly appreciated.
