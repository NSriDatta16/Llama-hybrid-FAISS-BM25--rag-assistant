"Meanwhile, the sprint start date is upon us and we start grabbing at the requirements we are pretty sure are stable. Once those are done we are left with endless days of tweaking the code as the requirements shift around slightly." Please do not call that an Agile method or scrum. That's just craziness. If you're tweaking things after the sprint starts, you're not doing it right. You're enabling (indeed, your encouraging) bad behavior. If they can't get the requirements before the sprint starts, you have two choices. Wait. Nothing wrong with this. It's cheaper in the long run. Start. However. Since the requirements are fixed for the duration of the sprint, you have to finish the sprint with no "tweaking". Changes become part of the backlog. You can do shorter sprints. You can simply backlog the tweaks until they get the idea that they're causing their own problems. Also, a lot of management review is not very Agile. It's not per se wrong. But it indicates a lack of trust. Agile means collaboration and interaction between developers and product owners. It doesn't mean another layer of management review.
