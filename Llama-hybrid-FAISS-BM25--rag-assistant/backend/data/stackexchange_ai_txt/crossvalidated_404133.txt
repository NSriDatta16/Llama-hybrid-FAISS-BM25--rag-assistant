why did the subset and factor influenced coefficients of logistic regression in R

The coefficients changed a lot when I used all the factor levels versus when I limited to only one level of a factor as a subset of the data. I am trying to do a logistic regression between the disease and contact exposure. There were several different sites, so I use the factor function (model:ml1). I also tried to focus on only a specific site:WB to analyze the association, which site was used as the subset of the data (model:ml2). ml1 |z|) (Intercept) -3.44400 0.25761 -13.369 ml2 |z|) (Intercept) -3.4016 0.4347 -7.825 5.06e-15 *** x 0.1421 0.1454 0.977 0.32834 **factor(anycontact)1 0.7380** 0.2590 2.850 0.00438 ** factor(comecat)2 -0.4049 0.2042 -1.983 0.04738 * factor(comecat)3 0.1136 0.2182 0.520 0.60273 However, the coefficient of factor(anycontact) changed significantly, increasing from 0.4085 (ml1) to 0.7380. I could not tell why that happened (I think it should be the same in both the models). Can someone help to explain the difference between the two model and the reason? Thank you very much.
