Auto-regressive time series prediction

$\hat{x}_{t+1} = \beta_1x_t + \beta_2x_{t-1} + \dots \beta_Mx_{t-M+1}$ So we actually base our prediction on the previous $M$ values. The task then specifies that we need to minimize the objective function: $ J = \frac{1}{N-M}\sum\limits_{t=M}^{N-1}{(\hat{x}_{t+1}-x_{t+1})^2}$ , which of course makes sense. There is a further hint, however, that I don't understand. It suggests finding the matrix $A$ and the vector $b$ for which: $J = \frac{||A\beta-b||^2}{N-M}$ . Quote: "...this allows you to find the coefficients that minimize $J$ . The final hint is to use the scipy.linalg.toeplitz function. I haven't solved problems with time series before, so can you please elaborate a bit on the hints or link me to a book/article that could clarify things for me. Thank you!
