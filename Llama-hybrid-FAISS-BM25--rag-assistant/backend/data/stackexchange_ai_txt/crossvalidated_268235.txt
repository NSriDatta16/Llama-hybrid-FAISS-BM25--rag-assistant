Data Unable to Meet Normality/Equality Assumptions

I've been working with a rather difficult data set for over a week with no real progress. I am trying to compare the effect of temperature (15, 20, 25, 28, 30 degrees) on development time. The problem is the data is very non-normal and the variance unequal despite many transformations. What I have observed is as temperature decreases the variance increases quite substantially. For example, at 30 degrees the organism basically develops at 7 or 8 days but at 15 degrees the range of development can be 22-28 days ect. I've looked at running Kruskall-Wallis, Welsh ANOVA, but am still too concerned with the assumptions. Any advice? Here is my SAS Code if anyone wants to see what the issues are.
