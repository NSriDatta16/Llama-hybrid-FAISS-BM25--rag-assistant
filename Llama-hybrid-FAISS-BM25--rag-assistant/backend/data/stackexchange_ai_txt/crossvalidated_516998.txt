Doing simple bagging ( mtry = 5 ) will give you RF predictive performance (RMSE = 14.3) somewhat close to the linear model (RMSE = 11.4). Modern machine learning methods are data hungry. You probably need a bigger dataset to see the RF outperform good ol' linear regression. df $predicted - df$ MRR)^2)) # out-of-bag predictions
