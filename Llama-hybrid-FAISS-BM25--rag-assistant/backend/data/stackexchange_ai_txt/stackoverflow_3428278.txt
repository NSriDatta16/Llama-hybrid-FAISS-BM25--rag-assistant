Site incredibly slow for firefox, instant on every other browser: KeepAlive issue?

I have a site where a page takes 10 seconds to load with firefox, and a further 10 seconds to load the images. It's a php page running on apache. The Images are just static images. It runs beautifully on chrome.... instant loading. googling for the answer has pointed me towards a possible issue with keep alive and the lack of content length confusing firefox, and indeed, it appears that content length isn't being set by the server on either the static or non static content, but disabling keep alive on the server doubles the load time! Some sites have suggested disabling keep alive on the browser, but I'm reluctant to recommend that to everyone that views the page! Am I perhaps barking up the wrong tree? browser is firefox 3.6.8 on Lucid Lynx. server is Apache 2.2.11. apache.conf is apended... I think it's the one that comes out of the box, although I reduced the KeepAlive timeout to 3 in a vain attempt to try and get the page to load. Am I barking up the wrong tree?
