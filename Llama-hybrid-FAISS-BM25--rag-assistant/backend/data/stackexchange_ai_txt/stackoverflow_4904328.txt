A: iText HTML->PDF converter isn't all that good, thought it looks to be getting some attention in the immediate future. B: I'm going to guess there's some script stuff going on there, which even a Really Souped Up iText will never handle. Check out wkhtmltopdf . It uses web kit for all its rendering (including javascript handling).
