I wonder if you have considered using the vegan function capscale ? This is introduced in Borcard et al. 2011 on page 188. It is a form of RDA which takes as input a pre-calculated species dissimilarity matrix, such as Bray-Curtis or Sorenson. I don't know if this would suit your needs but if you are still trying to investigate how to make this type of analysis, I would suggest looking into it.
