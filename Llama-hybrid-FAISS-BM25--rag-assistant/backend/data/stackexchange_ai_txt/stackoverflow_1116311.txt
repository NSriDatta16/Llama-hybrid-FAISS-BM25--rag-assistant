How to put an extended WinForms Control on ToolBox

I plan to add functionalities to TextBox with the following: public class TextBoxExt : TextBox { protected override void OnKeyPress(KeyPressEventArgs e) { base.OnKeyPress(e); } } The question is how can we use this TextBoxExt? Is there anyway to get this class onto the ToolBox so that we can just drag and drop it onto the form? If not, what is the best way to use the TextBoxExt?
