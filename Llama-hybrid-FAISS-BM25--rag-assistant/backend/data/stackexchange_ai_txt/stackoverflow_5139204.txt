I'm afraid so far there is no way to disable build.number property from TeamCity. The only possibility I can imagine is not to use TeamCity Ant runner and use Command-line runner instead. But in this case you'll miss many nicities of the bundled Ant runner (like immediate test reporting). Why would you want to use buildnumber task of the Ant? To keep build number across the builds, you'd have either to commit mybuild.number to version control or to run the build always on the same agent in the same place.
