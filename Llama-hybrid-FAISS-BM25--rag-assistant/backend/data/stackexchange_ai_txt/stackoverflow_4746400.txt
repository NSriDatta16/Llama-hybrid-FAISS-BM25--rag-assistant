Problem With Multiple Data Bindings (Silverlight)

I am using silverlight to create an Intranet for managing chemical usage. All data is stored in a MS SQL database, and is retrieved by using a DomainService (RIA). By dragging the database onto the form, Silverlight has created a DomainDataSource based on this table. By then creating a new record using the following code, I am now able to add new records. Me.ChemicalApplicationDomainDataSource.DataView.Add(chemicalApplication) However one of the controls I have on the screen is an AutoCompleteBox. I have bound this to the database, and the values display fine on here. When an item is selected on here, I want to populate the value of a textbox with values retrieved from a second datatable. I have created an event on the AutoSelectedItemChanged, and added the following code: Context.Load(Context.GetChemicalByNameQuery(AutoMaterialTradeName.Text)) I can then bind this to a datagrid.ItemsSource, and it shows the relevent record. But I cannot for the life of me get it to bind to a textbox. Textboxes dont have an ItemsSource, only a DataContext, but binding to this does not seem to display anything.. Any tips on how to achieve this?
