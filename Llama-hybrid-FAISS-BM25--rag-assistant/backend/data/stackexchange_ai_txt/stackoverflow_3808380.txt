cookies are part of the request and response headers, so loading them up means loading up every request and response. Secondly, you are limited to a total of 50 cookies per domain, and 4k per cookie. Thirdly, many users are absolutely terrified of cookies, and tend to delete them even if they are harmless. Because of those 3 reasons, web developers very rarely use them unless absolutely necessary (i.e. session tokens). Because web developers very rarely use them, there are few "best practices" around them, and they tend not to get much attention. I would make sure it is actually interacting with the cookies that is the problem before addressing it. The implementation is browser specific, so you will probably see very different results of those tests depending on what browser you try it on.
