Best way to organise Javascript code

How do you guys organise your javascript code? I know that it is good practice to store the code in an external .js file and this is fine for code that is run in multiple pages but how do you organise if you have, say 20 pages, and only 1 of them uses a particular function. Do you create a new external file for that 1 page or create the code inline?
