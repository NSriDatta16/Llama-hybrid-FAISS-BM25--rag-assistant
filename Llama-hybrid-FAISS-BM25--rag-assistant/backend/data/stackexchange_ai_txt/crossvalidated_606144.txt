You seem to not have taken adequate note of this message: NOTE: Results may be misleading due to involvement in interactions You have a model that includes the interaction of condition and suffix . If the interaction is at all important, it means that the condition s compare differently at each suffix -- and hence that you probably should not be averaging over suffix , as was done. Accordingly, I invite you to consider doing the comparisons separately for each level of suffix : EMM This of course will flag as non-estimable the comparisons for which you have no data. The simple = "each" specification shown applies only to cases where you obtain EMMs of combinations of two or more factors; and that does not seem to be what you are interested in. If, and only if, the interaction effect is negligible, then you can re-fit the model with the interaction excluded, then do what you did before. You will not get the advisory message about interactons, because there is no interaction.
