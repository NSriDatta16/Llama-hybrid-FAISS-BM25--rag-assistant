Remember as Tim Berners-Lee said, "cool URLs don't change". Once the server hands out a URI to the client, it is now the server's job to keep the URI working in the future by (for instance) sending a Moved-Permanently response in case the URI changed and someone requests the old one. This is actually what encourages many to design opaque URIs, such as based on database ids or timestamps, rather than using some human-readable property of the resource in the URI. Anything that people understand, they will want to change.
