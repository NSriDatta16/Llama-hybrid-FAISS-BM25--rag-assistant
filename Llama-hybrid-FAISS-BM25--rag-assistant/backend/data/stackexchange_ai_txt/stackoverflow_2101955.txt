How to configure Eclipse formatter to not insert blank line between field declarations?

I am using Eclipse 3.5.1 (Galileo) and am having trouble with one of the auto-formatting settings. At the moment when I auto-format a blank line is inserted between each and every field declaration. The behaviour I'm looking for is to organise field declarations without a blank line between. Except in the case where there is already one or more blank lines between the declarations, in that case I'd like the formatter to respect the space, and reduce >=1 lines to 1 line. I know this was possible at some point with Eclipse (can't remember the version but I have used a setting for this), but I can't seem to find the correct settings in Window->Preferences->Java->Code Style->Formatter . Which setting do I configure to enable this behaviour? EDIT: It seems the behaviour I'm describing is the default, and for some reason I couldn't find a way to return to that without removing the .settings directory. It also couldn't be reproduced, which suggests that it's something weird with the project settings (it's checked out from an open source project). Although I've found a hacky way to fix this, I'm still looking for suggestions and will be able to verify and accept an answer.
