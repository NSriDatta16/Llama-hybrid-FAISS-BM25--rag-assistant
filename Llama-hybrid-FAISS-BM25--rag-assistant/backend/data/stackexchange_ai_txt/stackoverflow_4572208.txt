How to get first-order optimality from scipy.optimize module

If I have this equation f(v,R,xi)=2/v*((((((v*t0/2)+R))* 2+((xi-x0) *2))**0.5)-R). How to get the first-order optimality from that equation when I use that equation to get min v,R using scipy.optimize.leastsq ? I don't have problem to get min v,R using scipy.optimize.leastsq but I get confused when I want get first-order optimality... Thanks for your attention :D. Happy New Year
