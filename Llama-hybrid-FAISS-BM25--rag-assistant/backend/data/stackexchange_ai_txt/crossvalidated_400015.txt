How to interpret $P(\bar X \geq 36.2) = 0.0023$ when population distribution is skewed right with mean of 30 and standard deviation of 12.9?

Text: Sullivan, Michael I. Fundamentals of Statistics, 5th Edition. Scenario: The mean weight gain during pregnancy is 30 pounds, with a standard deviation of 12.9 pounds. Weight gain during pregnancy is skewed right. An obstetrician obtains a random sample of 35 low-income patients and determines their mean weight gain during pregnancy was 36.2 pounds. Does this result suggest anything unusual? I understand that the sampling distribution of $\bar X$ for a sample of size 35 is approximately normal with mean $\mu_{\bar X} = 30$ and standard error $\sigma_{\bar X} = \frac{12.9}{\sqrt{35}}$ . So to determine whether having a sample of size 35 with a sample mean of 36.2 is unusual I want to find $P(\bar X \geq 36.2)$ . I can do this by standardizing and using a z-score table, so I understand that $P(\bar X \geq 36.2) \approx 0.0023$ Interpretation: The text says the following -- We can conclude one of two things based on this result: The mean weight gain for low-income patients is 30 pounds, and we happened to select women who, on average, gained more weight. The mean weight gain for low-income patients is more than 30 pounds. We are inclined to accept the second explanation over the first since our sample was obtained randomly. I am having trouble seeing why that is the interpretation we should make in this scenario. For a sample of size 35, it is unusual to see a sample mean of 36.2 or more. How does this translate to the mean weight gain being more than 30 pounds?
