Wikipedia says this: Artificial intelligence (AI) is the intelligence of machines and the branch of computer science that aims to create it. AI textbooks define the field as "the study and design of intelligent agents" [ 1 ] , where an intelligent agent is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chances of success. What you are considering is more specifically referred to as Machine Learning , which is indeed a subbranch of AI. As you can see from the second sentence above, however, the "AI" considered in games also fits perfectly well into this definition. Of course, the actual line between what is AI, and what not, is quite blurry. This is also due to the fact, that everyone and his mother believes to know what "AI" means. I suggest you grab yourself a more scientific book (say the classical Russel,Norvig ) to get a more thorough grasp on the different fields that are present under the huge roof of what we simply refer to as "AI".
