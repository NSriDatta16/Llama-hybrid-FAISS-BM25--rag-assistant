for clustering the abstracts, I would suggest the following steps: In order to make the abstracts mathematically comparable, we need to convert these to vector representation. This can be, for example, using a word2vec model to get vector representations for each meaningful word (excluding words such as 'a', 'the', for example) and maybe, for example, taking the average of the vectors to represent a single abstract. Now we have a way to represent abstracts, we can now mathematically compare them. To cluster them, one obvious way to do this a clustering algorithm, such as K-means clustering. In your case, we want to set k (number of clusters) to 2. Note : such clustering algorithms are non-deterministic. This means that every time you run the clustering algorithm, you will get different results. If you want something more deterministic, then I would recommend something like hierarchical clustering and take the clusters, when it reaches the desired number of clusters (2 in this case).
