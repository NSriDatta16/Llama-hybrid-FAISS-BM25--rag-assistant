Simulating results from logistic regression

After predicting the probability of success for each datapoint in a logistic regression model i would like to run a simulation to simulate the number of succeeded iterations. Im not trying to do something super advanced so my first thought was to maybe iterade through each predicted probability and simulate a value between 0 and 1 from a uniform distribution and then compare the simulated value with the predicted probability. If the simulated value S is lesser than the probability P then this will be coundet as a success, else it fails. I'm just wondering what types of arbitrary simulations you guys can come up with and mainly if you think that my simulation is good, bad , worthless etc
