Handling onclick event if no GUI element was clicked

To make it more clear what I need to do, here is the structure of the search form / HTML page I am working with: --- |A| --- --------- --------- --------- | | | | | | | B | | B | | B | | | | | | | --------- --------- --------- --------------------------------- --------- | | | C | | | --------- | | | X | --------- | | | C | | | --------- | | --------------------------------- The boxes A , B , C are buttons which can be clicked by the user. The X is the content are where the search result will be displayed. The boxes behave at the moment like this: Click on A returns to the previous site (= a back button) Click on B and C apply filter and submit the form (= retrieving the result set of the search) Click on X does nothing - the search result shown here This works all fine and well. My new requirement is: When the user clicks "anything else" then A , B , C or X then a help message appears in the content area. As you can imagine, the HTML of the boxes is fairly different and nested, only the boxes of the same type (= same letter) share a CSS class. E. g. C looks like this: My first thought on how to implement this was: Attaching an onclick listener to document.body Check if the event.target is A , B , C or X or contained in any of them If not, then the user has not clicked a GUI element and the help message is being displayed This could be made more easy by attaching a common CSS class ( gui-element ) to all GUI elements so the document onclick event handler checks only if the event target has this common class. The drawback is that if any new element e. g. D is introduced in the HTML it must have this CSS class, too. Do you think the above approach is good or is there a more "elegant" way of doing this? EDIT: A few more details: I am using YUI2 as JavaScript framework I know the whole idea of the help message appearing onclick might be ...uh annoying, but I have to do what I am told, sorry
