In regression problems the marginal distribution of Y does not matter. The conditional distribution of Y | X is what matters. For some problems this translates to examining the distribution of the model residuals. But your sample size is too small to check assumptions. It would be far better to use a robust approach that has many fewer assumptions, e.g. If you have one X and want to quantify the strength of relationship between X and Y, use a rank correlation coefficient Use a semiparametric regression model such as the proportional odds model that makes no assumption about the distribution of Y | X but only makes assumptions about the relative shapes of conditional distributions across different value of X. This generalizes rank correlation and Wilcoxon-type methods. Use a Bayesian model that generalizes the usual models, e.g., that has a prior distribution for the degree of non-normality or non-constant variance of conditional distributions. Use the bootstrap as advised above, but be cautious because the bootstrap is only approximate.
