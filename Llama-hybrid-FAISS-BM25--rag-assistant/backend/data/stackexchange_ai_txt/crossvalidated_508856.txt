Using logistic regression in R to determine if cases and controls are different?

I'm sorry if this is a basic question - I'm really struggling to get my head around it. I have a dataset of disease cases and healthy controls, and a score. I want to see if the score is different between cases and controls. I have a dataset, my_data , which looks like this: my_data head(my_data) ID case_status score age 1 ID1 0 2.620 20 2 ID2 0 2.875 20 3 ID3 1 2.320 20 4 ID4 1 3.215 15 5 ID5 0 3.440 15 6 ID6 1 3.460 15 I want to use a logistic regression model to see if score is different between case_status ( 1 is diseased, 0 is not diseased). So am I correct if I run: model And then when I do summary(model) One of the outputs: Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 10.9370 5.4987 1.989 0.0467 * score -2.5077 0.9866 -2.542 0.0110 * age -0.1809 0.1625 -1.113 0.2656 So score (p = 0.0110) is significantly different between cases and controls. Is that correct?
