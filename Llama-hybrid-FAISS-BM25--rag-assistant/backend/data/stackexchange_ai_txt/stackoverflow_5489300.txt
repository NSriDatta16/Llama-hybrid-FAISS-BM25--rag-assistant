There are no published limits to the number of tables, only the 100TB 500TB limit on a given storage account. Combined with partition+row, it sounds like you'll have a direct link to your data without running into any table-scan issues. This MSDN article explicitly calls out: "You can create any number of tables within a given storage account, as long as each table is uniquely named." Have fun!
