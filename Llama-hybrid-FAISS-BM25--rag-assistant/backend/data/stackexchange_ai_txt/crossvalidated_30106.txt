I've never used iSight, so I took a quick look at the product description (pdf) . It seems like a fancy data analysis package that has an (allegedly) easy to use, LabView-like GUI and a proprietary distributed computing engine. The last two pages of the data sheet suggest that essentially does a lot of standard statistical stuff (e.g., generating experimental design matrices, fitting distributions, a smattering of machine learning) along with some numerical optimization, visualization, etc. I haven't checked every single thing in that pamphlet, but I'm pretty sure R/NumPy/Matlab can do everything on there, even if the workflow ends up being a little different. If you've got questions about what various iSight components do (e.g., "What is this Latin Hypercube thing?"), they'd definitely be germane here. Questions about the statistical aspects of using the program are probably on-topic too, but you might have better luck with the network/distributed computing part on stackoverflow or superuser.
