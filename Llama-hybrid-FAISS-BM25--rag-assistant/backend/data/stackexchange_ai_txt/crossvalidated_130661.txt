Blind source separation of convex mixture?

Suppose I have $n$ independent sources, $X_1, X_2, ..., X_n$ and I observe $m$ convex mixtures: \begin{align} Y_1 &= a_{11}X_1 + a_{12}X_2 + \cdots + a_{1n}X_n\\ ...&\\ Y_m &= a_{m1}X_1 + a_{m2}X_2 + \cdots + a_{mn}X_n \end{align} with $\sum_j a_{ij} = 1$ for all $i$ and $a_{ij} \ge 0$ for all $i,j$. What's the state of the art in recovering $X$ from $Y$? PCA is out of the question because I need the components to be identifiable. I've looked at ICA and NMF - I can't find any way to impose nonnegativity of the mixing coefficients for ICA, and NMF doesn't seem to maximize independence.
