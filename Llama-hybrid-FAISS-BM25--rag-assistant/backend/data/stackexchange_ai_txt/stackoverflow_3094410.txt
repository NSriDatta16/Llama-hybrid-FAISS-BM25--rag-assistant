Select distinct rows from MongoDB

How do you select distinct records in MongoDB? This is a pretty basic db functionality I believe but I can't seem to find this anywhere else. Suppose I have a table as follows -------------------------- | Name | Age | -------------------------- |John | 12 | |Ben | 14 | |Robert | 14 | |Ron | 12 | -------------------------- I would like to run something like SELECT DISTINCT age FROM names WHERE 1;
