problem with bitmap not displaying image after a text

i am trying to show an image directly under a text which i had retrieved from a file in the sdcard but only the text is showing but not the image, have been trying several methods but non of it is workable below is my code to display them //Find the directory for the SD Card using the API //*Don't* hardcode "/sdcard" File sdcard = Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(); //Get the text file File file = new File(sdcard,"file.txt"); //Read text from file StringBuilder text = new StringBuilder(); try { BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(file)); String line; while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) { text.append(line); text.append('\n'); } } catch (IOException e) { //You'll need to add proper error handling here } //Find the view by its id TextView tv = (TextView)findViewById(R.id.TextView01); //Set the text tv.setText(text); Bitmap bitmap = BitmapFactory.decodeResource(getResources(),R.drawable.icon); Canvas canvas = new Canvas(bitmap); canvas.drawColor(Color.BLACK); canvas.drawBitmap(bitmap, 130, 10, null);
