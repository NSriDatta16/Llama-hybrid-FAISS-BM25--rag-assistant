werkzeug mapping urls to views (via endpoint)

Starting using werkzeug, i try to map urls (from a file urls.py) to views (from a folder views and then in different files to manage differents kinds of view), my folder organisation looks like that : myapp/ application.py urls.py views/ __init__.py common.py places.py ... my urls.py files looks like that: from werkzeug.routing import Map, Rule url_map = Map([ Rule('/places', endpoint='places.overview') ]) and obviously i got that piece in the views/places.py file : def overview(request): mycode... render_template('places.html', extra...) Most of werkzeug examples show the utilisation of the decorator expose to attach urls to views. It's practical for an app with 5 or 6 urls but can become a hell when you got more... Is there a simple way to map the urls directly to the views??? Thanks.
