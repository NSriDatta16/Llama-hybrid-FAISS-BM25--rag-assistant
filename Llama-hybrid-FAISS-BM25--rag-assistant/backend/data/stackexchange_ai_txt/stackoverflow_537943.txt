A lot depends on how detailed you want to get - but additional 'buffer' time should be based on a risk assessment - at a task level, where you put in various buffer times for: High Risk: 50% to 100% Medium Risk: 25% to 50% Low Risk: 10% to 25% (all dependent on prior project experience). Risk areas include: est. of requirement coverage (#1 risk area is missing components at the design and requirement levels) knowledge of technology being used knowledge/confidence in your resources external factors such as other projects impacting yours, resource changes, etc. So, for a given task (or group of tasks) that cover component A, initial est. is 5 days and it's considered a high risk based on requirements coverage - you could add between 50% to 100%
