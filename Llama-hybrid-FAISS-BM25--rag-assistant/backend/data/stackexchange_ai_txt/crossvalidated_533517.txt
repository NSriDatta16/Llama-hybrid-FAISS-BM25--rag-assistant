What is the relation between Linear Classifier and Linear Decission Boundary (or Non Linear Decision Boundary)?

As we know (Wikipedia Definition): Linear Classifier makes a classification decision based on the linear combination of the feature vectors. Mathematically : $y = f(\sum w_i x_i)$ So , $f$ is our linear classifier (which may be logistic or any other function). Now this linear classifier creates a decision boundary. Now, for example consider only two features(X1, X2) : If the decision boundary is straight line then we say its linear decision boundary otherwise non linear decision boundary. So, my question : (1) If a classifier is a linear then it creates a linear decision boundary and vice versa. (2) Non linear classifier always creates non linear decision boundary Does the above statements are true if not then please explain? I have seen so many examples , like for SVM classifier, we transform the data to higher dimension and get the hyperplane in feature space but in input space it has non linear decision boundary. So, what is the exact relation between a classifier and decision boundary, especially in the linear case?
