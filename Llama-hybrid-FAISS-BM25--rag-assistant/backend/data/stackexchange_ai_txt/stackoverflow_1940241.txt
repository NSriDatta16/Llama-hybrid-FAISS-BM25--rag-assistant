You obviously need a web-based client (like ActiveX/Flash/Java) to enable things like drawing objects or dragging them around. Of course DHTML/JavaScript is another option but I wouldn't take that road. You might consider Silverlight/Flash but if you're not familiar with these platforms you might consider Processing , a lightweight and simple language which outputs java applets. I believe you can integrate processing applets with your Asp.NET application, just like the other alternatives mentioned in the other suggestions. Please check and see if it works for you. http://processing.org/learning/
