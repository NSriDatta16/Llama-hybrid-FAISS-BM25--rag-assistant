In measuring blood samples for hemoglobin content an assay for hemoglobin (Hgb in g/dl) and the percent of red cells per volume (hematocrit, Hct in %) are considered equivalent for many clinical purposes. Different units, different variances, and one is numerically very nearly 1/3 of the other (typical Hct might be 15%, typical Hgb might be 45g/dl). A regression approach shows points tightly clustered around a straight line (correlation nearly $1),$ so that both measures are considered reliable-- maybe what you're calling 'consistent'. By contrast if the two methods of measuring something give normally distributed results, with the same units and the same variance, then a paired t test would suffice to show they're equivalent. Addendum, per edit and comment: Here are two scenarios, in which paired t tests show no difference between the two methods using $n = 20$ samples. Scenario 1: set.seed(928) x1 = rnorm(20, 50, 2); x2 = x1 + rnorm(20, 0, 5) t.test(x1, x2, pair=T) Paired t-test data: x1 and x2 t = 1.6775, df = 19, p-value = 0.1098 alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 95 percent confidence interval: -0.4867153 4.4164390 sample estimates: mean of the differences 1.964862 So a t test shows no difference between the two methods. However, the differences for the 20 items are as summarized below. Method differ on average by about 2 units with a standard deviation of about 5 units, and correlation is low (about 0.44). summary(x1-x2) Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. -6.115 -3.651 2.633 1.965 5.864 10.688 sd(x1-x2) [1] 5.238252 cor(x1,x2) [1] 0.4397941 Scenario 2: y1 = rnorm(20, 50, 2); y2 = y1 + rnorm(20, 0, .1) t.test(y1, y2, pair=T) Paired t-test data: y1 and y2 t = -0.05817, df = 19, p-value = 0.9542 alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 95 percent confidence interval: -0.05053764 0.04780447 sample estimates: mean of the differences -0.001366584 Again no significant difference, but much better agreement: Average differences are about 0.0014 with standard deviation 0.11, and a high correlation about 0.998. summary(y1-y2) Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. -0.232753 -0.063022 -0.016312 -0.001367 0.061754 0.226550 sd(y1-y2) [1] 0.1050631 cor(y1, y2) [1] 0.9982463 Here are scatterplots for the two scenarios: par(mfrow=c(1,2)) plot(x1,x2, pch=20) plot(y1,y2, pch=20) par(mfrow=c(1,1)) So again, you need to decide what you mean by 'consistent': no statistically significant difference observed among 20 items? Small standard deviation of differences for individual items? Reliable small differences below some amount of practical importance? Good correlation between the two measurements? Maybe you want to test whether the mean if the differences $d_i$ is smaller than some crucial amount. What are the methods measuring and for what purpose. Are you trying to see if a manufacturing process is out of control? Are you trying to give customers a guarantee of a specific measurement with a small margin of error? By whatever meaning of 'consistent', and without knowing your objectives, I would certainly prefer the new (2nd) method of Scenario 2.
