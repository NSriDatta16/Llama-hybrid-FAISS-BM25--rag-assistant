How to calculate algorithm's accuracy in cross validation and repeat cross validation

I'm using R tool to make machine learning algorithms. I made algorithm and now I have to evaluate model accuracy. So I used train(), trainControl() function. In trainControl() function, I used cv & repeatcv parameters to evaluate. I am wondering that how to calculate model accuracy in cv & repeatcv. Is it calculated mean of produced algorithms?? or Is the model with the highest accuracy selected? Have a nice day!
