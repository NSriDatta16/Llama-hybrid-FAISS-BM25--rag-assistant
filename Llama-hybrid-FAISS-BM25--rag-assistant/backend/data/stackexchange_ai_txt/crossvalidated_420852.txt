Is there a name for this type of transition probability diagram which seems not to be a transition probability graph?

This is a "transition probability graph" coming from the book "Introduction to Probability, 2nd Edition by Dimitri P. Bertsekas and John N. Tsitsiklis". That book also gives this figure, which seems not to be a transition probability graph. Is there a name for this type of transition probability diagram?
