If your goal is to estimate the magnitude of the difference between groups , then your procedure is fine (in principle). You can decide whether it's more meaningful to consider $\mu_1-\mu_2$ or $\mu_1/\mu_2$ based on whether the original scale or the log() scale is more sensible to deal with. The HDI's won't be exactly the same (because HDI's aren't invariant under nonlinear transformations) but will probably yield the same conclusion. Same for $\sigma_1 - \sigma_2$ . If you want to make a decision based on the magnitude of difference, you need a decision procedure; see this article (disclosure: I wrote it). If your goal is to test the null hypothesis that the difference is zero then you're probably wanting to frame the question as a Bayesian model comparison. This can be a very useful approach but it can be very sensitive to the choice of prior distribution, unlike parameter estimation. For caveats about this approach, and references for how to pursue it, see this article (which I also wrote).
