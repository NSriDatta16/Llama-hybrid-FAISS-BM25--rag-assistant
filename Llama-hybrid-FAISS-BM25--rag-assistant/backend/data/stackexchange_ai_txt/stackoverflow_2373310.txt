Yes, otherwise the destructor for PicLib will not be called. One stylistic note though: If you new a method-scope object in a function, try and delete it in the same function. As a junior engineer that has had to go through large projects fixing other people's memory leaks...this makes things a lot easier for other people to read. From the looks of it, you could delete *lib after beginStorage() returns. Then it would be easier to see the scope of *lib in one place.
