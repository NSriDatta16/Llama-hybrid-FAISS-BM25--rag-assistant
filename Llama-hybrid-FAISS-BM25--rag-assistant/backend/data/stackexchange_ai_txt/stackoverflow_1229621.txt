If you really want to close down your application completely, I suggest you define a job in SQL Server Agent, and just execute a T-SQL statement to start that job manually. The syntax is: sp_start_job { [@job_name =] 'job_name' | [@job_id =] job_id } [ , [@error_flag =] error_flag] [ , [@server_name =] 'server_name'] [ , [@step_name =] 'step_name'] [ , [@output_flag =] output_flag] The job would execute your stored procedure. You will have to be a little creative to pass in any arguments. For example, insert the parameters into a "queue" table and have the job process all the rows in the queue. Instead of a job, an insert trigger on your queue should work as well.
