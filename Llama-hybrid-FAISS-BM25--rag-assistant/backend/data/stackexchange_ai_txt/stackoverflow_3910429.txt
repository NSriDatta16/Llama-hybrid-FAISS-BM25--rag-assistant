It All Depends On What You're Trying To Do. :) The file index number, like the documentation says , is really only a good identifier for the file in NTFS (as opposed to FAT), but even then it can change if the file is deleted and recreated (think backup/restore), though you might actually consider that a bonus if you were looking to distinguish those. It's probably best not to worry about the link tracking service with regard to object IDs, and instead think of them as something you can create/set/read , though again only in NTFS. Object IDs have some overhead, whereas file IDs do not. For most applications, I would probably end up picking file reference numbers (even though they are potentially fragile).
