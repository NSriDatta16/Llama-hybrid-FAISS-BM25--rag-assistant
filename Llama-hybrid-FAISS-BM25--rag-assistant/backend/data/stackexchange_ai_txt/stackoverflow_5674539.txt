jquery problem css when drag item from treeview

I have a treeview menu where user can drag something and drop on a list (like gmail with labels). Everything works 99%. When the mouse hover an item in the treeview, the background color changed (that's ok for me). When the mouse leave the item, the background is back to white. The problem is when the (jquery) drag begin, the item background is changed and didn't come back to white as normally should (a refresh problem?). How can I proceed (when drag start?) to arrange this little problem? I already try: $(this).children().css('background-color','#ffffff'); But it is not acceptable because the css is definitively changed (no more hover/leave difference). I need something like a refresh of the item. I see that if I mouse hover the item (after the drag/drop operation) the background is back to white (as it should). Screenshot 1 first image On this first screenshot we see the user mouse over an item in the treeview and so the background color is light blue. No drag drop this time so ok for me. Screenshot 2 second image On the screenshot 2 the user drag an item and we see the helper dragged. The problem is that the original itm in the treeview is still blue! Annoying... If the drag'n drop is cancelled or finished and the user mouseover this blue item, it become back to white background but too late... I edit my question to respond to Phortuin @Phortuin: the mouseenter, mouseleave events are both managed with css as you can see below: .treeview li{ margin-top: 2px; margin-bottom: 2px; padding-left: 20px; list-style: none; } .treeview li a:hover { background-color: #f3f7fd; border-color: #bbd8fb; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; } So if I don't know how to proceed. Another solution will be to manage mouseover/mouseleave events only with jquery as you showed me but maybe there is an easier solution (and keeping my css)?
