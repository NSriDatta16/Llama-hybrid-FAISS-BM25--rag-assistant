Yes, you should create edit_team and update_team methods in controller and add them into routes.rb #organizations_controller def edit_team @organization = Organization.find(params[:id]) @team = @organization.affiliations end def update_team # updating affiliations end #routes.rb map.resources :organizations, :member => { :edit_team => :get, :update_team => :put } and this is enough.
