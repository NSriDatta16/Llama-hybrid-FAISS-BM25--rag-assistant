This is a mediation problem. You have a causal diagram as follows: Here $U$ represents unmeasured influences on $T.$ There is no backdoor path from $X$ to $Y,$ so you do not need to use anything like instrumental variables, the backdoor adjustment formula, or the front-door adjustment formula. This is a pure mediation problem with no confounders. So, if you want the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) of $X$ on $Y,$ there's nothing stopping you from performing the usual calculation . Your question, though, seems to be more concerned about not knowing what constitutes $U,$ the unmeasured variables. If you examine the causal effect of $T$ on $Y,$ you see that $T\leftarrow X\to Y$ is a backdoor path from $T$ to $Y.$ So you could use the backdoor adjustment formula, $$P(Y=y|\operatorname{do}(T=t))=\sum_x P(Y=y|T=t,X=x)\,P(X=x),$$ to get the true causal effect of $T$ on $Y.$
