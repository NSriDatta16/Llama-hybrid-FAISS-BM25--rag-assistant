You can set the div to display:none. Like: $("#mydiv").css( "display", "none"); EDIT: I haven't really tested this, but couldn't you just start each div as display:none and on your link to the new window add a hash like: mypage.htm/#detail1. then in that page on document ready get the location.href and set the display for that element back as detailed above. This isn't an answer, just an untested suggestion. There may very well be a more elegant solution to this.
