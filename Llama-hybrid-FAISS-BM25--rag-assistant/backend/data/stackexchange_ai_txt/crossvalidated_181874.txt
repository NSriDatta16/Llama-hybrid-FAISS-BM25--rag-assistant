The Dirichlet distribution is conjugate prior to the categorical and multinomial outcomes. So the posterior distribution in the case of a Dirichlet prior with a multinomial or categorical likelihood is also Dirichlet. Posteriors are priors that have been updated in light of the data. This is called Bayesian updating. Because of the conjugacy property, you don't need to worry about using sampling methods to obtain posteriors, provided you're using a conjugate model. I'm not clear on what you mean by "full conditional." For a multinomial or categorical model with Dirichlet priors, the posterior distribution is a Dirichlet distribution, where each parameter value is the sum of the corresponding prior values and the observed values from your data. So once you've observed all of your data, the posterior distribution is fixed . The wikipedia article, particularly the section on conjugate properties, is useful in answering this question.
