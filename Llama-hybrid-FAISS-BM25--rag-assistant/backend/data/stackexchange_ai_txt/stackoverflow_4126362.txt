You can't do this in (anything close) to the way you seem to want. You can manage to do it, but it's a fair amount of work. Basically, you have to concatenate the two programs together, with yours first so it's the one that will execute. Your program will then have to extract the other to a temporary file, execute it, and then delete that temporary file after it's done (or, if available, use OS functions to ensure it's deleted automatically). Also note that this is extremely fragile on a number of levels -- a hacker who knows what he's doing will probably break your attempt at security in less time than it took you to do it to start with.
