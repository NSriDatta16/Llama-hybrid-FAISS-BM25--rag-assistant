You seem to throw some things into one bag here that each should be evaluated individually and actually are in current research intensively: Random aspects of model input Unfair aspects of model input Biased aspects of model input Random aspects of the process (learning behaviour) Unfair aspects of the process Biased aspects of the process Random aspects of the output Unfair aspects of the output Biased aspects of the output explainability (XAI) as an own sub-field Result reproducibility Result consensus (Do 2 or multiple independent AI research teams come to the same conclusions for the same data set? Or if not, how much do their results differ and in what patterns?) Some practical issues influencing ethical application of AI methodology arise in real-world circumstances, too: Outdatedness of models trained with old data Reduced potential for humans to stop machine-made decisions (even when humans are still kept in the loop and making the final decision, with fewer headcount they might only oversee a fraction of all decisions, like e.g. edge cases and overlook others, so where to set this threshold?) Potential lost jobs for humans in the decision-process before (influences social aspects of ethics with the main question being "Is it more ethical to pay a human for a job instead of a machine with electricity?") So I would object to viewing this as something undisclosed, and rather view this as an ongoing debate and research topic currently gaining some traction. And that's exactly what especially the model transparency initiatives are achieving by aiming at the replacement of black box models by explainable AI. And for example this new research currently in review which came out after you asked the question indicates that maybe in the future the non-probabilistic seeding is not necessary (which still doesn't solve all the other bullet points mentioned above): ZerO Initialization: Initializing Neural Networks with only Zeros and Ones This means that considering especially the non-deterministic learning process and model initialization aspects, this randomness likely has a rather negligible effect when compared to other ethical considerations, which might rather explain that it is overlooked more in comparison to more pressing ethical dilemmas, despite it being an absolutely valid aspect of ethical considerations to make.
