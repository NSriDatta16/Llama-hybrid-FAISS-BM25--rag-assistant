Question on Linear Regression: What is a good transformation for this data?

$\newcommand{\rv}[1]{\texttt{#1}}$ The Question: The wealth in billions of dollars for $232$ billionaires is given in $\rv{fortune}.$ Determine a transformation on the response to facilitate linear modeling. Note: This is a significant portion of Problem 14.7 in Linear Models with R, 2nd Ed., by Julian Faraway. My Work So Far: There is the usual R code: require(faraway) data(fortune, package='faraway') summary(fortune) wealth age region Min. : 1.000 Min. : 7.00 A:38 1st Qu.: 1.300 1st Qu.: 56.00 E:80 Median : 1.800 Median : 65.00 M:22 Mean : 2.684 Mean : 64.03 O:29 3rd Qu.: 3.000 3rd Qu.: 72.00 U:63 Max. :37.000 Max. :102.00 NA's :7 Plotting $\rv{wealth}$ against $\rv{age}$ is instructive: require(ggplot2) ggplot(fortune, aes(x=age, y=wealth, shape=region))+geom_point() with result I have tried many, many combinations of the form sumary(lm(wealth~age,fortune)) sumary(lm(log(wealth)~age,fortune)) require(pracma) sumary(lm(sigmoid(wealth)~age,fortune)) sumary(lm(sigmoid(wealth)~age+I(age^2),fortune)) ... (That is not a typo in the sumary command: it's Faraway's simplified summary function for linear regressions - a bit less verbose.) I have not gotten anything remotely suitable. Realizing that $R^2$ is by no means the only indicator of quality of fit, you would still expect it to be somewhat larger: the largest value of $R^2$ I've gotten is $0.03.$ I tried the Box-Cox method , with the result of $\lambda=-0.7955,$ but it performed no better than any of the other transforms. My Question: What transformation will work on this data so that I can get even a half-decent model? What's odd about this data is how right-skewed the $\rv{wealth}$ variable is (financial variables often are, I understand), and I think that is affecting the regressions. Should I eliminate some outliers or influential points? Check leverages?
