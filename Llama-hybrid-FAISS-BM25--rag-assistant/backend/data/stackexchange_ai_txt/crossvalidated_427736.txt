error in the book "A first course in Machine Learning"?

I am reading the book "A first course in Machine learning". At page 74 when talking about the maximum likelihood solution, considering the data matrix X 2x2, he uses this expression $z^TX^TXz = z_1^2\sum_{i=1}^N x_{i1}^2+2z_1z_2\sum_{i=1}^N x_{i1}x_{i2}+z_2^2\sum_{i=1}^N x_{i2}^2$ and then it says Because the first and last term must be positive, proving this expression is greater than zero is equivalent that their combined value is larger than the middle term: $z_1^2\sum_{i=1}^N x_{i1}^2++z_2^2\sum_{i=1}^N x_{i2}^2>2z_1z_2\sum_{i=1}^N x_{i1}x_{i2}$ and from that it makes some reasoning. Should not be $z_1^2\sum_{i=1}^N x_{i1}^2++z_2^2\sum_{i=1}^N x_{i2}^2> - 2z_1z_2\sum_{i=1}^N x_{i1}x_{i2}$ or am I missing something?
