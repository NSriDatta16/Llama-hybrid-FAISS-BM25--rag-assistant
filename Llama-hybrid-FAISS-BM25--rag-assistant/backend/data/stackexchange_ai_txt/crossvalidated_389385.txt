Likelihood for a test data (sequence of characters) given two unigram models

I would like to find the likelihood of a sequence of characters (the test data), given two unigram models. The sequence (test data) is: A B C B B The models are: Model 1 Model 2 P(A) 0.3 0.4 P(B) 0.4 0.5 P(C) 0.3 0.1 Basically, I would like to know the likelihood, and if I can make a prediction as to which model the sequence belong and the underlying assumptions. I understand that given any unigram language model, the likelihood (or probability) of any sequence of characters is p(sequence of characters|Model). What I have done so far was to find the MLE for each character: P(A) = $\frac{1}{5}$ ; P(B) = $\frac{2}{5}$ ; P(C) = $\frac{1}{5}$ I don't know how to compute p(sequence of characters|Model). Should I multiply these to find the likelihood and establish which model it came from? How to handle the model probabilities given? Thanks in advance :-)
