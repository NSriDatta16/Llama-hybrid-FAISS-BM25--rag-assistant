Non-indexed file (?) still found in Google

How is it possible that my page /admin/login.asp is found in Google with the query "inurl:admin/login.asp" while it isn't with the "site:www.domain.xx" query? I've this line of code in my robots.txt: User-agent: * Disallow: /admin/ And this in the HTML code of the page: Any ideas?
