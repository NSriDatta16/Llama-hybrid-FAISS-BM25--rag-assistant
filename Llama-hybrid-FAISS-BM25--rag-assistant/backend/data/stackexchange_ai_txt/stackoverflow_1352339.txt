There are two reasons why one may call a perl function from C: extending and embedding. In the former case, it isn't all that uncommon actually, but it's rather invisible for outsiders. What I think your question really is though is "why don't people embed perl more often?" There are a number of reasons for that, it being far more difficult than it should be is the most important one IMHO (see perlcall , perlembed , perlguts and perlapi ).
