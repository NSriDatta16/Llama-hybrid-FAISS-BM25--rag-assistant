To leverage CoreData, you'll need to know a fair amount of Cocoa technologies, concepts, and patterns. The learning curve is not really steep if you know these things. If it looks steep, I would avoid making it critical to your project, and then just learn during downtime, finally using it once you are comfortable with it. It is definitely not a beginner technology; you'll need a good programming foundation, including Cocoa specific technologies and concepts. A lot of people see it and think it will be easy for them, because they would, could get a lot for free. It's like a code generator, pretty close to useless to somebody who uses it to do just that (churn out code), rather than using it skillfully in response to the problem set.
