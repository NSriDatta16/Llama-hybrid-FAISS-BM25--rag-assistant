How to effectively change local changes made to an html document via javascript back to the server?

So let's say you display a list of divs that each represent a list item with certain properties (for an example a todo list): Some title . . . Some other title Now each item has three properties (title, a specific icon, and a custom footer). All these properties can be changed via javascript (say clicking on one cycles through the options). Now everytime something is changed i want to save these changes to the server (and no, i don't want to store the whole html code block (that way i can't sort by the properties later, also it's ugly ;) ). What would be the most elegant and effective way to do this ? (I'm using jQuery if that helps...) Thanks a bunch !
