If you want to forecast time-series data, first you need to check whether it is stationary . Basically this means checking whether data has trends. If for example some time trend is present, you can concern yourself only with its forecast, because time-trends usually dominate everything else. For stationary time series it is good to use Box-Jenkins approach. This in the end will give you some kind of ARMA model (autoregressive model suggested by @whuber is a subset of this model). Since you have three time series you may look into VAR models. If you use R, then first step can be performed by function stl , it is function from standard R. Autoregressive models can be fit automatically by auto.arima in package forecast . This function can either fit your desired model, or find the best specification for certain definition of best. You might look into that package more, since it is specially designed for forecasting time series. For VAR model use VAR function from vars package. This package has a nice vignette describing its capabilities.
