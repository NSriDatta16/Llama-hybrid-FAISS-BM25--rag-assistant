Central limit theorem for $\bar{X_n}$

On the wikipedia page in my native language it is stated that according to the central limit theorem for $X_i$ iid with finite mean and variance we have that $\bar{X}_n$ is approximately normal. Isn’t this wrong? Take for example $X_i$ bernoulies then $0 . So it can’t be normally distributed right? I always thought that it only holds for the rescaled average. Can someone help me out here?
