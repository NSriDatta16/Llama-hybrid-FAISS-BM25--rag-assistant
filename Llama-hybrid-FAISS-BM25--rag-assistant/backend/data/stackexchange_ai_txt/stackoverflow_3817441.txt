Sort 2d array into 3d array PHP

I'm trying to figure out how to sort a 2d array into a 3d array in PHP. The array contains tasks from users in a management tree and is currently arranged like so: Array ( [0] => Array ( [Title] => Test Task [Author] => 5 [DateIn] => 2010-09-15 [Deadline] => 2010-09-30 [Position] => 1 [Description] => This is a test task [Assignee] => 3 ) [1] => Array ( [Title] => Test Task [Author] => 5 [DateIn] => 2010-09-15 [Deadline] => 2010-09-29 [Position] => 1 [Description] => Blah blah [Assignee] => 3 ) ) I want to sort it so that it's a 3d array where each 2nd level array contains all of the tasks assigned to one user. Is there an easy way to do this? The closest thing I found was array_multsort, but that doesn't quite do what I want. *Edits This is basically a task manager app for the company I currently work for. Managers need to be able to see the tasks that have been assigned to their employees. I currently have employees and supervisors organized into a tree, so they need to see everything in their branch. Right now, the function I've written returns the tasks for employees of each "manager" sorted in no particular order. To reduce clutter, I need to be able to only display one "employee's" tasks at a time. Currently this is not possible, as the structure of the array is such that it simply contains a list of all the tasks where the author is marked as the current user. In short, I would like to sort these tasks into a 3 dimensional array, where each 2nd level array contains the tasks belonging to one "employee" belonging to the current user.
