How can I programmatically obtain the company info used to digitally sign an assembly in .NET?

As a means of simple security, I was previously checking the digital signature of a downloaded update package for my program against its public key to ensure that it originated from me. However, as I'm using cheap code signing certs (Tucows), I am unable to renew an existing cert and therefore the keys change every time I need to renew. Therefore, a more reliable means would be to verify the organization information embedded in the signed assembly (which is displayed in the UAC dialog) against my well-known organization string, as this will continue to be the same. Does anyone know how to obtain this information from a digitally-signed assembly?
