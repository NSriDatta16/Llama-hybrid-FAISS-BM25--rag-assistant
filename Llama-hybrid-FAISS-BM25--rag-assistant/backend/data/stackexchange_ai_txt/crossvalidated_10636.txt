I have a question/comment. I thought that by definition, logistic regression uses the logit link. If you are using the probit or complementary log-log link, then I do not think that is logistic regression. What you are doing is fitting generalized linear models on a binary outcome, which is assumed to follow a Bernoulli. The 3 usual choices of link functions are the logit, probit, and complementary log-log. If you are using the logit link, that is logistic regression.
