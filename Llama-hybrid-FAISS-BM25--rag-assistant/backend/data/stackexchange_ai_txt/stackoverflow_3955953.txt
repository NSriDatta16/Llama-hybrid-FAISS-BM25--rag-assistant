rails Column cannot be null:

I noticed that my application was automatically setting all my processes to having been completed as soon as they were created. I looked through it, couldn't find why the date was being updated without being told to, but I found that one of my views was looking for a field that didn't exist. I created the 'complete' field, set it as a not null boolean and tried again. I was getting it being set automatically to true again so I tried setting it as false explicitly in the create method, this still didn't work :S so I tried putting a hidden field into the form. I am now getting a "column cannot be null" error even though the value is being provided. As you can see there is clearly a parameter for the complete value. What am I missing? Error: Mysql::Error: Column 'complete' cannot be null: INSERT INTO `decommissions` (`completed_at`, `keep_backups`, `services_stopped`, `updated_at`, `operating_system_id`, `comments`, `username`, `disposition`, `stakeholder_email`, `complete`, `alias`, `storage`, `model_id`, `contract_maintenance`, `created_at`) VALUES(NULL, 1, 1, '2010-10-18 00:32:37', 1, NULL, NULL, '', 'test@qut.edu.au', NULL, 'test1', '', 1, '', '2010-10-18 00:32:37') Parameters: {"decommission"=>{"dns_items_attributes"=>{"0"=>{"ip"=>"131.181.185.111", "alias"=>"test", "retain"=>"1", "_destroy"=>""}}, "keep_backups"=>"1", "services_stopped"=>"1", "operating_system_id"=>"1", "stakeholder_email"=>"test@qut.edu.au", "alias"=>"test1", "model_id"=>"1"}, "commit"=>"Submit", "authenticity_token"=>"cMMf0zS/5jPExlXqVPaYVXndqPeVkm+OQ/WEPIYd2+g=", "disposition"=>"Dispose", "complete"=>"false", "storage"=>"Local", "contract_maintenance"=>"0"} When I put the following in my create controller it renders 'true': @decommission = Decommission.new(params[:decommission]) @decommission.complete = false render :text => @decommission.complete
