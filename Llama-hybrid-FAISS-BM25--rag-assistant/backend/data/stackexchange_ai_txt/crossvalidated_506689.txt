correlation of PCA components

I'm used to posting on stack overflow for code questions, so not sure about the rules here, but I have some trouble with a Principal components analysis, and I don't know where to find help. either I did something wrong or there is a bug in the program I'm using. As far as I understand, one of the reasons to use PCA is to reduce collinearity - in other words, components should be less correlated than the raw variables (specifically, they should not be correlated, the correlation coefficient should be around 0) I ran the PCA in a stats program (JASP), using varimax orthogonal rotation (the variables are centered automatically), and it gave me 6 components, and said the correlation between each of them was 0 (this was also an automatic output so I don't know how it was obtained), as it should be. However, if I copy paste the values of each component and correlate them manually/run a zero-order correlation between component 1&2, 2&3 etc., the correlation is not 0, in fact the correlation between component 1&2 is 0.5 (this is the case using correlation matrix option in JASP, cor function in R and correl function in Excel). Am I correct in thinking that there are issues with the PCA, and the components are not in fact uncorrelated for some strange reason I have yet to discover? I haven't posted here much so please let me know if I need to provide more detail, I'm so confused that I don't even know what I'm looking for exactly, but I can't use the components when they are correlated so don't know how to keep doing my analysis... EDIT: added some detailes in brackets
