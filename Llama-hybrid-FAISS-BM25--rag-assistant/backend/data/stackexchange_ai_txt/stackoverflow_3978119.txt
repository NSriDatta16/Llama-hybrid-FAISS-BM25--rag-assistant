JQuery UI - Drag from Sortable to Droppable

I have a list of images which are sortable. To delete them, the user will drag them from the Sortable list to a Droppable div representing a trashcan. How can I accomplish this? Do I need to add a draggable to each of the image for it to work with the droppable?
