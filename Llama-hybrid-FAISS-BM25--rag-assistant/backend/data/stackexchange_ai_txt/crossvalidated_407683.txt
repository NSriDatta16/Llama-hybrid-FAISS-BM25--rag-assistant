What you are reporting is not the result of a Bayesian test. First off, from a very high level, proper Bayesian testing is done with Bayes Factors. Furthermore, you must prespecify (prior to even looking at the data) the objectives of the analysis including the comparisons, ways to control for FWER or FDR if considering more than one, and clinically relevant thresholds of effect and evidence. What you describe as the "Bayesian test" is a descriptive analysis with a few problems. It is not inference. You are simply describing the posterior distribution of the sample proportion. You specially picked Treatment 2 to compare to Treatment 1 and Control because it had a notable mean difference. Secondly, unless it's a matched design (A/B tests as a general concept can be done many ways), one has to ask if the 87% and 90% you calculate are based on the posterior of Treatment 1 and a point estimate of Treatment 2 and control. Lastly, the choice of thresholding your Bayesian belief (of 87% and 90%) into a "significant" vs "non-significant" designation is totally arbitrary. Whether you think it's significant or not is arbitrary because you've already done the data analysis. In each case, you did not prespecify what the objectives of the analysis were, and it doesn't matter whether one is Frequentist or Bayesian when they do that, the inference is invalid.
