Quantity like correlation

I want to calculate this sort of quantity, $f()$, for my data. $x$ and $y$ are time series. $f$ behaves like a pseudo-correlation, but is different in the sense that even if the values jump up and down, their $f$ is still weakly positive, and it becomes negative if the values alternate sign(frequently). Here is the rough application context. Suppose in real time we encounter 2 types of objects: blues and reds, each of which is of different size. I want to measure the temporal clustering of these objects. The change of color(i.e. the change of sign) is more heavily-weighted than the change of quantity. If I see 2 consecutive blue objects of radically different size, I want to say that there is still some clustering, but not too much, while when I see 2 large objects of different color, I want to say there's 'anti-clustering'.
