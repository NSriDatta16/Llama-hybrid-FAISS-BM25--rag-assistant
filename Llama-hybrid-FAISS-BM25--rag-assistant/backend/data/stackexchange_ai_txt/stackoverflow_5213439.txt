Ada Generic Averaging Function

I have a function which averages a certain numeric value from an array of records. This value is either a natural or an enumerated type delta. I have it summing up the values correctly but my question is this: how do I get the length of an array into a generic type, so that it can divide both integers and delta type numbers?
