bitscan (bsf) on std::bitset ? Or similar

I'm doing a project that involves solving some NP-hard graph problems. Specifically triangulation of Bayesian networks... Anyway, I'm using std::bitset for creating an adjacency matrix and this is very nice... But I would like to scan the bitset using a bsf instruction. E.g. not using a while loop. Anybody know if this is possible?
