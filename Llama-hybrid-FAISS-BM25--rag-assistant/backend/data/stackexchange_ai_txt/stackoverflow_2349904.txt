As other people noted, "well written" is quite a subjective point of view. The best thing you could do is to build a corpus of both "well written" and "not well written" (according to your standards) texts. You would get bonus if you were able to create a method to classify them in numerical terms (0.1 for Youtube comments, 0.9 for Stack Overflow comments ;). Once you will have done that, there will be many alternatives, but I would recommend statistical ones in this case. N-grams could probably do the job with simple relative frequency, but I would suggest you to investigate into markov models and especially bayesian text classification tools. In fact, the best single answer, once you have a collection of "good" and "bad" texts, is to use the many free classification systems available (think of anti-spam tools). The best one will depend on your needs and the programming language you are most confortable with.
