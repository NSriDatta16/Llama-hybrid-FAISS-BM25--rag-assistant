Did you keep a copy of the files before you began editing them? If not, then make a note to always keep a copy. You should be able to go and download clean copies. So one approach is to go bakc to clean install. Another approach is to study the error message. Something is wrong on line 236. Is that a line you changed? Compare it with examples you find on net, study the documentation figure to figure out jow to fix it. It looks like actually that its your entry in sites-enabled directory that's the problem. Is that the file referenced in line 236? Compare this site file with other site files, try and spot the problem.
