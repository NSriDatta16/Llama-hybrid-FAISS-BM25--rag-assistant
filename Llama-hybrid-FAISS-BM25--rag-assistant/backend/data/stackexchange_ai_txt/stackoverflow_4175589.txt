Writing an instance of liftIO for Text.JSON's Result type

Haskell's Text.JSON library uses an abstract data type called Result, it's basically their form of Maybe, but instead of Nothing, there's Error String. Anywho, I need to use liftIO to convert a function call returning an IO thing to a Result thing inside of my implementation of JSON.readJSON. I'm new to monad transformers and can't seem to implement liftIO for Result (I keep trying to construct the infinite type, according to ghci). Any ideas? Many thanks EDIT Sorry it's taken me so long to elaborate! I appreciate your help guys. readJSON (JSObject obj) = do text So the last line before return uses getSiteTitle to parse a website at that url for its title. However, that function returns a type of IO String and the compiler tells me it wants the it to be Result. Is this impossible? Thanks again! EDIT2 I've decided to eliminate the title from my data type and get it later on when inside an IO monad. Thanks for everyone's help! I've certainly learned from this issue.
