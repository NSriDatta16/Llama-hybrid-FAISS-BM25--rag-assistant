How to callback the new list id jQuery UI: sortable

I'm trying to use the sortable widget for my site. I have a mini scheduling app that I'd like to display a list of appointments for the week sorted by days. For this example we'll use only two days ( 2 lists ). If I wanted to drag an appointment (list item) from day 2 over to day 1, is there a way I can callback the id of list 1 after I dragged an item to it? I can find the id of the parent list upon page load but I can't seem to be able to pull the new id after sort. Is this even possible? $(function() { $("#day1, #day2").sortable({ connectWith: '.sortable' }).disableSelection(); }); ==== Ok here's what I have so far but i can't seem to get the items being dragged to stick to the list their being dragges to: $(document).ready(function() { $("#sortable1, #sortable2").sortable().disableSelection(); $("ul:first h3").droppable({ accept: ".connectedSortable li", hoverClass: "ui-state-hover", drop: function(ev, ui) { var $item = $(this); var $list = $($item.find('a').attr('href')).find('.connectedSortable'); $(this).appendTo($list); } }); });
