preg_replace or str_replace

I have some text, something like this: Paragraphs of text (SOME KNOWN TEXT)Unknown Text(SOME OTHER KNOWN TEXT) Some additional paragraphs of text What I want is to keep the Unknown Text , but get rid of the ( SOME KNOWN TEXT) and (SOME OTHER KNOWN TEXT) . I think the preg_replace will give me what I want, but I need the regular expression to replace this: (SOME KNOWN TEXT)Unknown Text(SOME OTHER KNOWN TEXT) with this .. Unknown Text I see the preg_replace takes 3 parameters, the regex , the replacement text , and subject . Is there a way to pass the value of unknown text to the replacement text parameter, OR, a way to reaplce the left and right pieces (SOME KNOWN TEXT) and (SOME OTHER KNOW TEXT) without removing the Unknown Text? Alternatively, is there a str_replace() solution to this? Thanks ---UPDATE--- The (SOME OTHER KNOWN TEXT) piece may exist in other places in the text, but I don't want it removed unless it follows the pattern of (SOME KNOWN TEXT)Unknown Text(SOME OTHER KNOWN TEXT) . I am thinking the initial str_replace suggestions would not work because of this.
