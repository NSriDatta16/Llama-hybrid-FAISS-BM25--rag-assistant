If you want it to match only User-agent: * and not also (e.g.) User-agent: webcrawler you need "^User-agent:\\s*\\*" The * character has a special meaning, so must be escaped with \ . The (.*) in your code matches zero or more occurrences of any character and captures the match. Edit: You also need to escape the backslashes as pointed out by rubber boots .
