You could build your own HibernateTransactionManager which creates both types of sessions. This has little overhead, as Sessions are cheap to create. Start with a copy of that class from the Spring.NET source tree. Have it open and close a IStatelessSession when it does so for a regular ISession. Put your IStatelessSession into a Spring.Threading.HybridContextStorage for easy access. Then create a method or extension method GetStatelessSession on your classes that need the IStatelessSession. Alternatively, and if you are using SQL Server, you might be better served by using SqlBulkCopy .
