Padded values are noise when they are regarded as actual values. For example, a padded temperature sequence [20, 21, 23, 0, 0] is the same as a noisy sequence where sensor has failed to report the correct temperature for the last two readings. Therefore, padded values better be cleaned (ignored) if possible. Best practice is to use a Mask layer before other layers such as LSTM, RNN,.. to mask (ignore) the padded values. This way, it does not matter if we place them first or last. Check out this post (my answer) that shows how to pad and mask the sequences with different length (with a sample code). You can experiment with the code to see the effect of removing the mask (treating padded values as actual values) on the deterioration of model performance. This is the python snippet for quick reference: model.add(Masking(mask_value=special_value, input_shape=(max_seq_len, dimension))) model.add(LSTM(lstm_units)) where special_value is the padded value that should not have overlap with actual values.
