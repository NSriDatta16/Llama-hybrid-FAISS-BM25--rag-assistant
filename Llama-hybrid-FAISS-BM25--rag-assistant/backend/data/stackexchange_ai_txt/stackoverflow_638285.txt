"Undefined subroutine &HTML::Entities::decode_entities called"

I'm getting the error Undefined subroutine &HTML::Entities::decode_entities called` using LWP::UserAgent , although the module is there, as well as the HTML::Parser module. I suspect it has something to do with XS modules missing, since the function in question seems to be implemented in XS, but I am at a loss.
