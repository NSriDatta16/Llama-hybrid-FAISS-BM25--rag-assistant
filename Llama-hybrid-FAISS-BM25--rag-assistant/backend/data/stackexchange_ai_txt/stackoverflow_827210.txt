The answer, of course, varies by language - both the hosted dynamic language and the lower-level implementation language. That which applies to Perl does not necessarily apply to Python, nor does what applies in Tcl apply in Java or LISP or ... well, do they count as dynamic languages. In Perl, there's a C-level structure that goes by the name SV (scalar variable) that contains different storage for different versions of the variable's value. These often heap-based; the storage for strings always ends up being heap based, though a pure numeric value that has never been converted to string might be in an SV that is strictly on the stack. In Perl, these things are reference counted (and mortalized, or immortalized, and all sorts of other interesting terms). More complicated types (AV, HV, RV, etc) are based on SV.
