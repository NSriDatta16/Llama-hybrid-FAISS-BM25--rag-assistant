This is not about design pattern but about architecture. Your architecture itself is not bad but it is really complex so unless you are creating very big project this architecture can be overkill. Moreover your naming of different layers is not correct. What you call BusinessFacade is usually called ServiceAgent. BusinessFacade should be placed on service site and wrapped by WCF service. Usual responsibility of BusinessFacade is to aggregate several business operations into single calls = create less granular API which can be easily and effectively exposed for remote calls.
