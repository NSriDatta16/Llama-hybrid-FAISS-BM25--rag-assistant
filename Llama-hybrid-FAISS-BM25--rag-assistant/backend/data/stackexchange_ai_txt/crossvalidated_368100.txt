Trajectory clustering - preprocessing and algorithms

Context Consider the following problem where we have two time dependent (yearly) measures: Fertility rate Life expectancy And a dimension: country. In other words we have over two hundred "bivariate" time series , one for each country. This data can be plotted in a scatter plot for a single year (LHS) and animating the scatter plot over several years gives the following trajectory path (RHS). See here for the gif animation. Question What approaches, preprocessing steps and algorithms can be used in order to cluster the trajectories of each country over time ? For example, a use case would be to find a cluster of countries for which the life expectancy falls abruptly (and against the overall trend) during the mid 90's. This is partly due to the AIDS epidemic in sub-saharan Africa at the time. I am familiar with various clustering techniques for longitudinal data, but I struggle to understand how to transform this ordered data set into a format which can be fed into an algorithm. Some sources / ideas \ comments The following SE posts offer some help Trajectory Clustering: Which Clustering Method? clustering-method which suggests in a comment to use DTW on the data by using a polar transformation $r= \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$ how DBSCAN can be used with track data/trajectory data which suggests to compute a distance matrix using a suitable trajectory distance and run DBSCAN Clustering of Vehicle Trajectories which uses the Hausdorff distance but I am not sure how.. The blocking point in my understanding is that there are ordered sets of points, which means that using clustering algorithms on the unordered data may be miss leading. For example in the picture below Trajectories are close together when un-ordered, but far when ordered.
