How to anchor QGraphicsWidget/Item (make them static) on QGraphicsView

I want to make something like a hud. I have a QGraphicsScene with a huge QPixmap , that I added to a much smaller QGraphicsView . Now I need to add some control elements, like QLabel , QPushButton and QGraphicsEllipseItem . That's, I think, is not a problem. I found this helpful page Graphics View Classes . But how do I anchor this control elements to the View or maybe better said how do I not anchor them? When I drag the QPixmap , then I don't want that the hud is moving with the QPixmap out of the QGraphicsView . What do I need to do, to solve this problem. Hope someone can help me.
