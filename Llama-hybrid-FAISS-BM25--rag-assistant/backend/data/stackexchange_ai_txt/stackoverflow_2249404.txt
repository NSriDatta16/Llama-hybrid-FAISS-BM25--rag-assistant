Storing Documents and associating Metadata

This question is somewhat related to this. I want to have document storage along with some complex metadata. I am not using sharepoint. I have a very simple directory structure that goes 2 levels deep. (One folder and documents underneath). I want to store metadata associated with each file....tags, popularity (# of times accessed), creator name, etc... What is the best way to achieve this? I am leaning towards the relational database with the link to the file but I have to think this problem has been solved before.
