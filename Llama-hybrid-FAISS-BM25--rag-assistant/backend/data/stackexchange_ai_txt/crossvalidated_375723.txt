The short answer is that you are right. The clearest explanation that I know is in "Statistical Rethinking" by Richard McElreath. He puts it like this: So define $D$ now as the posterior distribution of deviance,. This means we compute deviance...for each set of sampled parameter values in the posterior distribution. So if we draw 10,000 samples from the posterior, we compute 10,000 deviance values. Let $\bar{D}$ indicate the average of $D$ . Also define $\hat{D}$ as the deviance calculated at the posterior mean. This means we compute the average of each parameter in the posterior distribution. Then we plug those averages into the deviance formula to get $\hat{D}$ out...DIC is calculated as: $$\bar{D}+(\bar{D}-\hat{D}) = \bar{D}+p_D$$ I hope that helps.
