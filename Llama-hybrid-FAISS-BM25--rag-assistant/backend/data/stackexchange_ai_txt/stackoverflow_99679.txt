You should try handling WM_NCPAINT. This is similar to a normal WM_PAINT message, but deals with the entire window, rather than just the client area. The MSDN documents on WM_NCPAINT provide the following sample code: case WM_NCPAINT: { HDC hdc; hdc = GetDCEx(hwnd, (HRGN)wParam, DCX_WINDOW|DCX_INTERSECTRGN); // Paint into this DC ReleaseDC(hwnd, hdc); } This code is intended to be used in the message loop of your applicaton, which is canonically organized using a large 'switch' statement. As noted in the MFC example from Shog, make sure to call the default version, which in this example would mean a call to DefWindowProc.
