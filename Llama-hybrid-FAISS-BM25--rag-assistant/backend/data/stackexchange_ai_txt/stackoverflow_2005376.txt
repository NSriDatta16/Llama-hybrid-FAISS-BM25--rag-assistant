Actually, Joshua Bloch, in the final paragraph of page 178 in Effective Java (2nd Ed.) , says that it's not essential for methods of concrete classes that override abstract methods to use the Override annotation because the compiler would give an error anyway. However, "it is not harmful to do so". I'd recommend choosing a strategy and sticking with it consistently.
