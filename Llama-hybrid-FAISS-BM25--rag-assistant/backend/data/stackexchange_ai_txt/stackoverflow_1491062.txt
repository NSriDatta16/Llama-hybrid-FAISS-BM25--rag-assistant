Using HTML inside resource files

I am developing a standard small ASP.NET MVC website which will be made multilingual using ASP.NET resource files. My question is about the resource files. See if you have a block of text which should be shown in paragraphs, is it appropriate to add tags inside your resource file text? If not, what would be the best way to deal with it?
