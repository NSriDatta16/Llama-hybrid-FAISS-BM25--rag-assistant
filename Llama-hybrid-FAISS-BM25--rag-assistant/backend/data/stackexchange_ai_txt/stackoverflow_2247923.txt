Local static variables are part of th C standard, so yes. \pedantic{ If your code is well organized, with separate files (compilation units) for different subsystems, you might do better to have a static variable with file scope. This will make it easier to factor the code that uses it into separate functions. If the code that uses the variable is complicated, this will permit you to split it into smaller static functions, which are easier to read, understand and debug. }
