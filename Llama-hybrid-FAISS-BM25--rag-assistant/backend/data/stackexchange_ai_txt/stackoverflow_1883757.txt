Prevent MSVC from creating debug symbols by source code pragma?

While compiling a large c++ program with msvc .net 2003 and with debug information, I ran into C1067 , the fatal compiler error for to big or to large debug symbols. As it is in boost, and I don't want to fiddle around with the source code, the easiest thing would be, if there is a pragma or something that could switch off the generation of debug symbols from source code side. Any idea?
