Why is no one using Deep Quantile Regression as alternative to MDNs?

There are numerous articles and implementations of Mixture Density Networks, however I have seen almost no literature in regards to using Quantile Regression with Deep Learning. Why is this the case? Is there some disadvantage to "Deep Quantile Regression" compared to MDNs that I am missing? To those unfamiliar with the term, here and here are examples of such approaches.
