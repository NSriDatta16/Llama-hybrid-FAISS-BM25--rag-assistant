Outlier detection can be an alternative. A one-class SVM would give you the list of points that can be considered "anomalies", given the overall distribution of the data. Other simpler methods are based on the quantiles of the distribution or multiples of the median absolute deviation (MAD). If you instead want to detect a "peak" in a curve, in general, there are a gazillion way of doing it. One simple method (but not very robust) is finding the points where the first derivative changes its sign. Then you can work with small windows around that point and estimate the second derivative to find the base points of the peak (maximum curvature).
