Organization of UnitTests in a existing library ProjectGroup

In our Delphi2007 environment we have a SGLibrary groupproj which contains some 30 bpls. We're just starting out creating unittests for these libraries and are not sure what the most convenient way of organizing the Unittest projects would be. We are inclined to create a test-executable for each bpl, as this will make compilation an running easy and fast. The test-exe can be set as the active project and Compilation of the bpl can be forced by setting a dependency. It is also easy to run tests, ie by setting the test-executable as the Hostapplication of the bpl. But the downside is that the library groupproject will be expanded with another 30 items, making it a very large group (why can't we make subgroups in Delpi ???). The opposite arrangement would be to create 1 test executable which contains all unit-tests but that would create a executable with over a hundred units, and lots of depencies which all have to be compiled before a single test can be run. So my question ... Does anybody have any suggestions, best practices, or other ideas on how to organize this into a manageable and fast running setup? Extra consideration: We want to have the possibility to run all tests at once, and of course this will be easier in we put all tests in one executable.
