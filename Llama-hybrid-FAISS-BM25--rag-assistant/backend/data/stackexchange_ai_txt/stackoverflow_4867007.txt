PlayFramework: Ajax + Drag n' Drop + File Upload + File object in controller?

Does anyone know of a way to upload a file via Ajax and using drag n' drop from the desktop that supports PlayFramework's ability to convert file uploads to a File object? I've tried several different methods, and nothing works correctly.
