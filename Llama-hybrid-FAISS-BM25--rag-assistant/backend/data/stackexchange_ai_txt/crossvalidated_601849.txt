Can you combine a categorical variable with a numeric variable?

I have multivariate(?) time series data where I am trying to model coral populations over time. Measurements were taken at discrete timepoints for specific individuals within a population, and I am trying to assess the survival rates over time, as well as possibly predict future survival rates (~ 3-5 years). My issue however, is that I have categorical variables representing "transition periods" (ex: Jan2015-July2016, July2016-July2017, July2017-Jan2018, etc.) but each transition period has a different time elapsed in years (ex: 1.51, 0.99, 0.52, respectively) Is there a way I can pair these two variables, where I could get for example, Jan2015-July2016 paired with 1.51 years and July2016-July2017 with 0.99 years? I am trying to create a logistic regression to predict the survival of coral species' over time, but the chronological order of transition periods do not correlate with the time elapsed. Additionally, there were heat waves in certain years that greatly impacted coral survival, and I would like to include that aspect in future predictions, making the conservation of the chronological timepoint essential. For now however, I am mostly interested in figuring out a way to combine my two time-related variables, especially since I am not allowed to share my real data online. Can anyone help me with this issue?
