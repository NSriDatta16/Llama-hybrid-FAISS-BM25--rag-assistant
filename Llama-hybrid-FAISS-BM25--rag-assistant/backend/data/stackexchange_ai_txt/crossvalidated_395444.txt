Read this state of art review paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.02709.pdf and this article: https://medium.com/dair-ai/deep-learning-for-nlp-an-overview-of-recent-trends-d0d8f40a776d Your problem generally falls into the "simple relation" types and this paper will be highly relevant: http://acl2014.org/acl2014/P14-2/pdf/P14-2105.pdf To be more concrete your solutions may involve several layers of functionalities: a. First is to sift all the sentences that have simple vs non-simple relationship. b. Next for the simple relationship you should again sift out (based on whitelisting all known vocations (eg, "CEO", "farmer", "singer" etc) and throw away all other sentences. c. For what remains, you will want to extract out all "xxx is CEO" or "CEO is yyy" sentences. d. Last step may be to eliminate sentences with common words as "xxx" or "yyy" above, for eg, "CEO is very happy", or "The dog belong to CEO". A name is usually anything "not-seen-before".
