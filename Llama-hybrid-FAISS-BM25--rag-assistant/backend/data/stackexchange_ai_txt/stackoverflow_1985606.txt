Firstly, if you're just embedding the video on a web page, you do not need the Content-Disposition header, so just remove that line. Secondly, can you please show us which Content-Type values you are using for each video type. That your browser opened the video in Windows Media Player is not proof that you are using the correct type, as Internet Explorer and some other browsers can ignore the Content-Type header and rely on the file extension. So the fact that your filename is .avi is enough for IE to play the video in WMP.
