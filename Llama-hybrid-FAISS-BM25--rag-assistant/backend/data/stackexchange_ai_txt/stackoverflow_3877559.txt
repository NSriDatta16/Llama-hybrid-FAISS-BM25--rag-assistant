With this table: company pmonth performance 1 1 10 2 1 8 3 1 15 1 2 15 2 2 5 3 2 25 1 3 5 2 3 4 3 3 20 I create this query: SELECT p.company, p.pmonth, p.performance FROM MonthlyPerformance AS p; Then change the query to PivotChart View and drag company field to "Drop Series Fields Here", drag pmonth to "Drop Category Fields Here", and drag performance field to "Drop Data Fields Here". If you prefer, you can create a form using the same query SQL as its data source, then set the form's Default View to PivotChart, and set up the chart the same way as I did for PivotChart view on the query. If that's not what you want, give us some more information about the type of chart you want and the context in which you will display it.
