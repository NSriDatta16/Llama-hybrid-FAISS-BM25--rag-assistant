Probably the server reads your User-Agent header and decides not to serve your request. Alternatively it can rely on some other headers being typically set by normal browsers (like FF). I tried this one: import urllib2 request = urllib2.Request("http://www.ip-adress.com/ip_tracer/74.82.190.99") request.add_header("User-Agent", "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; es-ES; rv:1.9.1.5) Gecko/20091102 Firefox/3.5.5") f = urllib2.urlopen(request) print f.read() and got the proper result. NOTE: Please check the Terms of Service of the site if you plan to use it programmatically. It might violate their rules if you keep sending such requests automatically.
