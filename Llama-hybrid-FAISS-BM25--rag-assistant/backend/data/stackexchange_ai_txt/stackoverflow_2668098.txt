If you call exit , the destructor will not be called. From the C++ standard (ยง3.6.1/4): Calling the function void exit(int); declared in (18.3) terminates the program without leaving the current block and hence without destroying any objects with automatic storage duration (12.4). If exit is called to end a program during the destruction of an object with static storage duration, the program has undefined behavior.
