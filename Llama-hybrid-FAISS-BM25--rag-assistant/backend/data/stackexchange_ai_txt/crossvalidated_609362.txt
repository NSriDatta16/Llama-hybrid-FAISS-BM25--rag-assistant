Slightly indirectly, yes. [I'd probably have called those intensities or rates; calling them 'densities' without some modifying adjective or similar, such as a noun taking the role of an adjective, will tend to lead to confusion with probability densities in a discussion such as this one. It took me a while to realize you weren't asking about comparing probability densities.] If the counts occur independently and in proportion to the length in meters (as they would if the densities of the events were the same), then yes. Indeed the length in meters don't have to be the same, even though they are in your example. If the rate per meter is the same (as would be assumed under H0) then you can treat the whole set as two draws from the same population, which should occur in the ratio of the proportions of the lengths in meters to the whole length. In this case, on average both counts should be $\frac{5000}{5000+5000} = \frac12$ the total. The most common approach would then be to condition on the total and test for equality of proportions; this is equivalent to testing whether the first proportion is one half. Which can indeed be done as a chi-squared goodness of fit test if the sample size is not too small (it's fine in this case). Note that your expected counts in this case are both $(2050+1500)\times\frac{5000}{5000+5000} $ There's other approaches to arrive at essentially the same test.
