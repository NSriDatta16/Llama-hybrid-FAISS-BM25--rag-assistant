Each page is a fresh restart of any JavaScript that runs in it, so any data you have would need to be stored externally. If you want to pass directly from one page to the next, then encoding the value in the URL would probably be the easiest method. Otherwise you are looking at cookies (well supported but small) or things like HTML 5 Offline Storage. These, however, risk introducing race conditions (should the user be viewing the site in more then a single tab at a given moment).
