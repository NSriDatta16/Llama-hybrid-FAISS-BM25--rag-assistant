using the :sass filter with :css

We are currently making a widget that requires some default declared styles along with it(widget html is included by javasacript, along with the default css in style tags) but the problem is i can't "chain" haml filters. What I'm trying to do is to add an internal stylesheet along with the widget like so: p {color: #f00;} etc We are using haml so I tried doing it with the sass filter: :sass p :color #f00 #widget-goes-here %p etc sadly, it just generated a div with a p plus the generated css code literally on top: p {color: #f00;} paragraph here I then tried using the :css filter of haml to enclose the thing in style tags(theoretically it should then turn the paragraph text color to red): :css :sass p :color #f00 #widget-goes-here %p etc But this also failed, it did generated style tags but then it just enclosed the words :sass p :color #f00 in it(it didn't parse the sass code) We did change it to :css p {color: #f00} and it worked out fine, but I still plan on doing the styling in sass(instead of plain old css) is there a way to do this?
