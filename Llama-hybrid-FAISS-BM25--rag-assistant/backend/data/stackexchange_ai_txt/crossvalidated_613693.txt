Logistic regression and group sequential design/interim analysis

I want to design an RCT (randomised controlled trial) with interim analysis using the Oâ€™Brien Fleming interim stoppage criteria to control the Type I error. I wan to have 3 interim analysis and then the final one then at each analysis I need to have to following p-values to reject $H_0$ : 0.00005 0.0039 0.0184 0.0412 ref I know these works fine if I use the Wald or Z-statistic $$ Z = \frac{ \delta_j }{ \text{se}(\delta) } = \frac{\hat{p}_2 - \hat{p}_1}{ \sqrt{ \frac{\hat{p}_1\hat{q}_1}{n_1} + \frac{\hat{p}_2\hat{q}_2}{n_2} } } $$ Bu I want to adjust for some covariates and use logistic regression and test if the $\beta$ coefficient of the group variable (no treatment/treatment) is significant. To test the significance of the $\beta_1$ I will use the Wald ref . Can I still use the group sequential boundaries for the interim analysis when I use logistic regression to assess the difference between the groups? If do can someone give me a reference or an explanation of why? If not what else can I do? This paper states that "the sequential test statistics need to have the independent increments covariance structure in order to control Type I error " and uses an information criteria to control the Type I error ( $\alpha$ ). But I would rather use the O'Brian Flemming boundaries if possible.
