Desktop application in Javascript/CSS/HTML for Google Chrome

I have to make a Google Chrome based application solely for desktop purpose. By Desktop I meant that it would not be loaded from some URL rather would be invoked on the machine only. The data would be stored/fetched from HTML5 SQLite databases or some storage provided by CHrome(Is there any?) The application would be purely based on Javascript/CSS/HTML. I also have to make it secure so that nobody could "steal" the code and data. Can you refer me some relevant documents? Thanks
