Determining if linear regression is appropriate

I am designing an experiment, and I want to know if using a hypothesis test on the linear regression model to analyze my data is appropriate. The experiment will have five independent variable values (continuous variable), with five trials for each, for a sample size of 25. I'm not sure if using linear regression is appropriate since the data is not really a scatterplot; visually, it's five points above each of five values on the independent variable axis. Would this test be appropriate, or is there something better I can use? Edit: One idea I had was averaging the result for each independent variable value, but would this impact my regression statistics in a way that the sample is treated as having size 5 rather than 25?
