Timer issue on Asp.Net

I have encountered a serious issue in asp.net which is stopping me going further. The issue is due to server side timer control. The following is the scenario, When main page loads , timer will start automatically and it should keep run throughout the application. My page contains Infragistics controls. If i open model dialog and after 2 to 3 sec , i am closing the model dialog... the wdmenu_Context_ItemClick server side event (which is for opening model dialog ) is firing two times... Also on click of that button , i am opening model dialog using java script which is shown below Untitled Page function wdmenu_Context_ItemClick(sender, eventArgs) { var win = window.showModalDialog("Default2.aspx", "Dialog", 'center:yes;resizable:no;dialogHeight:500px;dialogwidth:660px'); } Please help me regarding this....
