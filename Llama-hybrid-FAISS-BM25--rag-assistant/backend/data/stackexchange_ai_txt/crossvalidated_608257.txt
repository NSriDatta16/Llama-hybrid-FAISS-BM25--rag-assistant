Regression with an unrepresentative sample

We commonly fit regression models to estimate the conditional expectation function $\mathrm{E}(Y|X=x)$ . We fit models by minimizing a loss function (e.g. sum of squared errors) on the training sample. An intuitive motivation for this is that we want a model which minimizes said loss function on the population, but since we only have access to the sample we minimize the loss on that instead. If a given sample $x_s,y_s$ is representative of the population (i.e. if $x_s,y_s \sim F_{X,Y}$ , where $F_{X,Y}$ is the joint distribution of the population) then this approach makes sense and there's a lot of theory, e.g. maximum likelihood, to back it up. My question is about the situation where we have an unrepresentative sample $x_u,y_u$ , where $x_u$ has not been drawn from $F_X$ . Unrepresentative samples can easily arise through non-random sampling techniques, such as those based on availability of data. Obviously, if the marginal population distribution $F_X$ is unknown then the best we can do is fit to the sample and hope for the best, but what about the situation where $F_X$ is known? Intuitively it would seem that some kind of importance sampling could be applied here. Is there a name for this situation, and is there a standard approach for dealing with it? EDIT: I found that this problem is known as "covariate shift" in the machine learning community. Proposed solutions are based on the idea of importance sampling, but the more successful methods avoid explicit density estimation (e.g. this paper ).
