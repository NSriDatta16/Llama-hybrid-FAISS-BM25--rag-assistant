ARIMA(1,0,0) one-step ahead prediction in R/forecast

Return series with 30 observations: Return ARIMA(1,0,0) generation with Return[1:29] series by Arima function in R ( forecast package). library("forecast") M_Return_1_29 So, when calculate one ahead prediction (prediction for 30th value for Return ) by: predict(M_Return_1_29,n.ahead=1) It gives this output: $pred #Time Series: #Start = 30 #End = 30 #Frequency = 1 #[1] -0.0005256081 $se #Time Series: #Start = 30 #End = 30 #Frequency = 1 #[1] 0.009368022 I would like to caculate -0.0005256081 by hand. But when I try this Ŷ30 = -0.0007 + (-0.0365*Yt29) = Ŷ30 = -0.0007 + (-0.0365*-0.0057619568) = -0.0004896885768 Note that I take -0.0057619568 as Yt29 from the original series.
