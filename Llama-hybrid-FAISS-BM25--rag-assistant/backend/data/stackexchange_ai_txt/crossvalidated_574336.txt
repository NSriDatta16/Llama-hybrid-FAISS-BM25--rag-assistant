Logistic regression: variable coefficient is statistically significant but not statistically significant as an exponentiated odds ratio?

As mentioned in the title. I came across this instance using GLM in R. Is this an error? EDIT: The p-value of the coefficient was calculated by GLM in R and is less than 0.05. I then plotted the odds ratios (OR's generated using tidy exponentiation method) and generated the confidence intervals by multiplying the std. error * 1.96 (+/-). When I plot it, the CI includes 1. My understanding is that a CI that includes 1 is not significant for logisitic regression. My confusion is how the coefficient is significant before exponentiating, but the odds ratio includes 1 and is thus not significant. I hope this edits helps, please let me know if I can provide more information. Thanks for your help! @whuber @Schortchi
