I would suggest " Generalized Alignment Kernels " by Marco Suturi for time-series classification. The idea is to use the well known DTW distance in the SVM. The problem which was solved in the paper is that the DTW distance does not result in a valid SVM kernel; there are some tricks employed by the authors to enable that. I ran this algorithm on some popular time-series datasets and noticed: The algorithm is very fast The performances are very good on the respective datasets with respect to the published test sets ( UCR Time Series ) Finally, the source code is available.
