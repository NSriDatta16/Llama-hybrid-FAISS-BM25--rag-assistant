Note that if you have the sample average $\bar{x}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nx_{i}$, then using the same "sample average" operator on the individual moments to define $\hat{\mu}=\bar{\mu}$ and $\hat{\sigma}^2=\overline{\sigma^2}$, your Lyapunov equation becomes $$\frac{\bar{x}-\hat{\mu}}{\hat{\sigma}/\sqrt{n}} \xrightarrow{d} N(0,1)$$ This is essentially the same as the i.i.d. result for the asymptotic sampling distribution of the sample mean.
