No, there's no reason to specify *.class over .class * is a wildcard character, and means "apply this to anything" but that's just the native selector behavior. However, it could have been added by someone who was trying to be explicitly documentary in the face of: Don't select a particular element type, but match all element types But this only holds true if your internal normal code-organization is of the type: $('div.class') $('a.class') $('a:first') etc
