This is a known bug in IE6/7/8 . It doesn't appear that you will get a fix for it. The best workaround you can do for this, is to add another hidden field (if your engineering conscience permits). IE will no longer auto-submit a form when it finds that there are two input-type fields in the form. Update In case you were wondering why this is the case, this gem comes straight out of the HTML 2.0 specification (Section 8.2) : When there is only one single-line text input field in a form, the user agent should accept Enter in that field as a request to submit the form.
