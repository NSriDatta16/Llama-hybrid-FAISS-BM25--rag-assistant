Increase PRAGMA cache_size to a much larger number. This will increase the number of pages cached in memory. NOTE: cache_size is a per-connection setting. Wrap all inserts into a single transaction rather than one transaction per row. Use compiled SQL statements to do the inserts. Finally, as already mentioned, if you are willing forgo full ACID compliance, set PRAGMA synchronous = OFF; .
