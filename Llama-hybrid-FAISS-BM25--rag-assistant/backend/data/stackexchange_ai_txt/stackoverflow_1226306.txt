I have one similar but different problem. We have PostgreSQL8.0 installed on WinXP. One of the columns is of type TimeStamp with TimeZone. The Time value of this column changes with the change in system time zone. Can we avoid this? After every retrieval from table, half hour is getting to thid column for every tuple. I haven'nt been able to trace origin to this problem. rgds nithin
