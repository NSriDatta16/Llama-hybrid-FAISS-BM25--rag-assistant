EarlyStopping based on the loss

When training my CNN model, based on the random initialization of weights, i get the prediction results. In other words, with the same training and test data i get different results every time when i run the code. When tracking the loss, i can know if the result would be acceptable or not. Based on this, i want to know if there is a way to stop the training if the loss begins by a value superior to a desired one in order to re-run it. The min_delta of the EarlyStopping does not treat this case. Thanks in advance
