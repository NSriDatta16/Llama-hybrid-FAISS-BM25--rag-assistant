Your response factor overall_sentiment with levels (Positive, Negative, Neutral)` looks like ordinal, so I would start out trying ordinal logistic regression. There are many posts on this site . But you used the usual glm function, but without a family argument . That gives you a linear regression model (with assumption about gaussian errors), and you converted the response to numerical! That gives you nonsensical results, period. Don't try to interpret that output, start anew . If you had used the somewhat more sensible family=binomial argument, then the following excerpt from the R help page is relevant: For binomial and quasibinomial families the response can also be specified as a factor (when the first level denotes failure and all others success) But neither is that what you want! For ordinal logistic regression in R, start with for instance or How do I run Ordinal Logistic Regression analysis in R with both numerical / categorical values? .
