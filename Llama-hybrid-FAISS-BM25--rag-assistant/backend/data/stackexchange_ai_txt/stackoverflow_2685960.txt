Let your daemon log output into a place that is accessible from a web script (Such as a database table), which can then display it. Have the webpage update once every few seconds. (You can get fancy at do it with XmlHttpRequest and Javascript, if you want) Edit: Simplest way to have a page update, is with a meta http-equiv="refresh" content="5"> tag. A bit more elegant is to use Javascript - You can use something like PeriodicalUpdater for jQuery . These solutions are both polling techniques. There is a trick you can pull to make the event propagate instantly, called comet. But that's a bit more complicated, and frankly a poll probably suits your use case fine.
