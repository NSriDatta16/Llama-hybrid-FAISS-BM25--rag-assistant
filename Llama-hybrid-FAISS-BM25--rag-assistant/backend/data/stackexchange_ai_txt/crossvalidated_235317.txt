My best guess would be the following: Since the "new" instances have not been there during the original normalization phase. One possible action is to include the new instances as bottom rows to your original dataset, re-normalize and then re-train your model. Doing so, you will adjust the relative location of the new instances with respect to the original dataset. If your model still does not perform well in terms of prediction power, you might be experiencing an "overfitting" problem, which is a common problem in predictive models. One indication of overfitting is that your model does well on a training set but fails to generalize to unseen test records. If that's the case, you might want to look at how "complex" your neural network is and how many data records do you have.
