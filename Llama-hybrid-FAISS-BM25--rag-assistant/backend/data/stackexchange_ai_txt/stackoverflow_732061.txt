Amazon S3 is a file storage service, you can't run dynamic sites on it. Amazon EC2 is a VPS service, requires system administration knowledge and is more expensive. Google App Engine doesn't offer a relational database. A typical classical (shared) web host customer can't run phpBB on either of these. I imagine that's why they aren't overly scared. Yet.
