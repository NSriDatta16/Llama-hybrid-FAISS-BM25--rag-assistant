Generalised Logistic Regression with mixed effects - Binomial model creation / selection

I have a dataset with 72 individuals from 5 separate groups, with repeated measures - each individual was sampled 4 times. All data is binomial, and in most cases there are more 0s than 1s. I have a lot of potential predictor variables BacteriaA , BacteriaB etc, (9+ depending on how I group the data), and a number of outcome variables I want to test DiseaseA , Disease B , etc. data $ Group : Factor w/ 5 levels "A","B","C","D",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... $ ID : Factor w/ 73 levels "E1","E10","E11",..: 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 ... $ Time : Factor w/ 4 levels "1","2","3","4": 2 4 2 4 1 2 3 1 2 3 ... $ DiseaseA : Factor w/ 2 levels "0","1": 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... $ DiseaseB : Factor w/ 2 levels "0","1": 2 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... $ DiseaseC : Factor w/ 2 levels "0","1": 1 2 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... $ DiseaseD : Factor w/ 2 levels "0","1": 2 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... $ DiseaseE : Factor w/ 2 levels "0","1": 2 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... $ DiseaseF : Factor w/ 2 levels "0","1": 2 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... $ BacteriaA: Factor w/ 2 levels "0","1": 2 1 1 1 1 2 1 2 1 1 ... $ BacteriaB: Factor w/ 2 levels "0","1": 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... $ BacteriaC: Factor w/ 2 levels "0","1": 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 ... $ BacteriaD: Factor w/ 2 levels "0","1": 2 1 2 1 2 2 1 1 2 1 ... $ BacteriaE: Factor w/ 2 levels "0","1": 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... $ BacteriaF: Factor w/ 2 levels "0","1": 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... $ BacteriaG: Factor w/ 2 levels "0","1": 1 2 2 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 ... $ BacteriaH: Factor w/ 2 levels "0","1": 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... $ BacteriaI: Factor w/ 2 levels "0","1": 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... I have run a model using glmer because I believe I need a mixed effects model, and I have binomial data. model1 |z|) (Intercept) -1.5414 0.4423 -3.485 0.000493 *** Time2 0.6009 0.4518 1.330 0.183535 Time3 0.4617 0.4782 0.966 0.334287 Time4 0.4136 0.4577 0.904 0.366223 BacteriaA1 -0.5733 0.4593 -1.248 0.211939 BacteriaB1 -0.6688 0.5057 -1.323 0.185963 BacteriaC1 -0.6867 0.4371 -1.571 0.116228 BacteriaD1 -0.7494 0.3458 -2.167 0.030236 * BacteriaE1 -0.1796 0.7715 -0.233 0.815964 BacteriaF1 -1.3041 0.6412 -2.034 0.041972 * BacteriaG1 -0.7576 0.3260 -2.324 0.020133 * BacteriaH1 -10.1035 124.1785 -0.081 0.935154 BacteriaI1 -0.1340 0.7987 -0.168 0.866712 --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 Correlation matrix not shown by default, as p = 13 > 12. Use print(x, correlation=TRUE) or vcov(x) if you need it convergence code: 0 Model failed to converge with max|grad| = 0.0337228 (tol = 0.001, component 1) I am super new to modelling, never mind mixed models, and I'm just really stuck on what I should do next. Is this the right model? How do I work out the odds ratios from this? What does Model failed to converge with max|grad| mean? And most of all, how do I choose a model from this? Is there a stepwise way of dealing with so many variables?
