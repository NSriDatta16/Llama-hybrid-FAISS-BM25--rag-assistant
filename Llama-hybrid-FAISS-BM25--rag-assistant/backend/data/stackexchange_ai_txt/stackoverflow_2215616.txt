How do PHP/MySQL database queries work exactly?

I have used MySQL a lot, but I always wondered exactly how does it work - when I get a positive result, where is the data stored exactly? For example, I write like this: $sql = "SELECT * FROM TABLE"; $result = mysql_query($sql); while ($row = mysql_fetch_object($result)) { echo $row->column_name; } When a result is returned, I am assuming it's holding all the data results or does it return in a fragment and only returns where it is asked for, like $row->column_name? Or does it really return every single row of data even if you only wanted one column in $result? Also, if I paginate using LIMIT, does it hold THAT original (old) result even if the database is updated?
