I would embed the RadioButtonLists in a Panel or an other Container-control. Then you can loop its control-collection to get all RadioButtonLists. Do you want to divide by the number of RBL's or by the number of selected RBL's? Example that divides by RBL-Count,hence counts non selected as zero, and rounds to next integer: aspx: and in codebehind: Protected Sub BtnCalculate_Click(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs) Handles BtnCalculate.Click Dim rblCount As Int32 Dim total As Int32 Dim avg As Int32 For Each ctrl As UI.Control In Me.OptionPanel.Controls If TypeOf ctrl Is RadioButtonList Then rblCount += 1 Dim rbl As RadioButtonList = DirectCast(ctrl, RadioButtonList) If rbl.SelectedIndex <> -1 Then Dim value As Int32 = Int32.Parse(rbl.SelectedValue) total += value End If End If Next If rblCount <> 0 Then avg = Convert.ToInt32(Math.Round(total / rblCount, MidpointRounding.AwayFromZero)) End If Me.LblResult.Text = "Average: " & avg End Sub According to youre new informations that you need to count only the selected RadioButtonLists and ignore f.e. RadioButtonList14 completely, have a look: If rbl.SelectedIndex <> -1 AndAlso rbl.ID <> "RadioButtonList14" Then Dim value As Int32 = Int32.Parse(rbl.SelectedValue) total += value rblCount += 1 'count only the selected RadiobuttonLists' End If I have moved rblCount += 1 into the If rbl.SelectedIndex <> -1 -Statement, besides i've added rbl.ID <> "RadioButtonList14" as additional restriction to ignore this RadioButtonList.
