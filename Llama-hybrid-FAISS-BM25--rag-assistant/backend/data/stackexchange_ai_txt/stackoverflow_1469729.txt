One simple way is just to have those two datasets sent in a ViewData element, which you can access in a field. example: ViewData["Elements"] = new SelectList(aElements, "Guid", "Name"); is consumed as: Also, I think that if you read between the lines of this blog post here you will find an elegant way of achieving what you want ;) but its a bit more involved..(only because you mentioned Views instead of just variables.. Quote: We need to create our own implementation of IViewFactory. This is responsible for locating and creating an instance of an IView (which both ViewPage and ViewUserControl implement). To “inject” (all you DI fans excuse me borrowing the term without using a DI framework) our new View Factory into every Controller we are going to create our own IControllerFactory implementation. We need to configure the framework to use our new Controller Factory. Finally we can create two Views – an AJAX version and a pure HTML version. Building on that should be all you need Good luck!
