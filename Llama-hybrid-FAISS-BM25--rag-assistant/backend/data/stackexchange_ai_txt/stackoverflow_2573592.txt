How to organize JS files in a Appcelerator Titanium project

I have recently started creating an iPhone application using Appcelerator's Titanium. Since the application is essentially all JS, I needed some advice on how I should organize this project. It's becoming very easy to just create long procedural files for each view in the application. Is there a way I can incorporate MVC, or some structure to the project? Thanks, I appreciate it. -Tilo
