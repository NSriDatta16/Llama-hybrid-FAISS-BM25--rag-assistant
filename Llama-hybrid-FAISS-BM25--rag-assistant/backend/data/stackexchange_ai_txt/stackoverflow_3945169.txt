Cannot find any coverage data (.coverage or .coveragexml) files. Check test run details for possible errors

I am using Visual Studio Ultimate and I cannot get code coverage data. All of my unit tests pass, and I edited the Local.testsettings file to enable code coverage and configured it to reference the dll of my project. Also the active test setting is set to Local.testsettings and not TracAndTestImpact.testsettings.
