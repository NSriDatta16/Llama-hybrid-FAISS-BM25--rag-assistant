causal inference vs sensitivity analysis to create acurate ML predictions?

I recently discovered the concept of "causal inference" and I'm trying to understand if I've grasped its essence correctly. If I understand it correctly, it involves finding what influences the outcome while being able to quantify the importance of each variable. In this sense, how is it different from sensitivity analysis? There's also something else I haven't been able to fully comprehend from the examples I've seen. With the DoWhy toolbox in Python, it appears possible to construct a relationship graph between the data. Do we need to specify the structure of the graph ourselves, or is it an algorithm that determines it automatically? Assuming it's the algorithm that determines the graph automatically, can we use this graph as a guideline to build a cascading machine learning model? thx for highlight
