Not only have the returns diminished, but if you set string types with arbitrary limits you're much more likely to cause a problem than solve one. If it's really a business constraint, then use TEXT type (or similar) and a CHECK constraint on the length, and pick the number according to the business constraint you're trying to enforce. The DBMS will probably implement the storage for the TEXT type identically to varchar(x) anyway. If it doesn't, and you really care, you should investigate the internal storage strategies of your particular system, and consider whether there's any benefit to varchar or not.
