Linear regression: comparing effects between multiple (50+) groups in R

I have a dataset of 30.000+ observations. For my thesis I am investigating the effect of the weather on rating scores. For a subquestion I need to compare the effect of precipitation on the review score for people from different countries. specifically: Iâ€™m trying to find out if the effect of precipitation on the rating score is higher for people from countries where the yearly average precipitation is lower. I ran the regression models for all different countries in the dataset and I am wondering how to best proceed from here. How can you test whether the effect of one country is significantly higher than that from another country to test if the hypothesis is true? This are the models: # regression per country by_country part of the data: output data_grouped https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eOi10fiqIFSHVXZLYNnAHoxlP1YtUPEDyO6pjBKA6iM/edit?usp=sharing output data_grouped2 https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-EL0-TsU9PlbKxi8xU0vIaq7JVT381msG0ZmF5xVBv4/edit?usp=sharing
