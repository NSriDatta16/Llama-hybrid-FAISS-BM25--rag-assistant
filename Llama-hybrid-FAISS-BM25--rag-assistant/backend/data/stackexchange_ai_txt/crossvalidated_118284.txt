Can we change the value of alpha(learning rate ) dynamically to achieve minima early?(liner regression )

I am new to machine learning .In linear regression we use alpha as a constant (which is learning rate ) .We take alpha such as learning is fastest . Can we do like this make alpha large when we away from minima and make it small when we are near minima . Do you this this approach would work fine or name or please tell me where am i wrong
