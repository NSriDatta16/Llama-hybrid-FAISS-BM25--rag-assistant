the form of the rejection region ( asymptotic )

We consider $ z1,z2,...zn $ a series of iid random variable with average of $ m $ and variance $ \sigma ^ 2 $ . We want to test the hypothesis $ m \leq m_0 $against $ m $ > $ m_0$ with a risk threshold $ \alpha $ . How could I find the form of the rejection region ( asymptotic )? Thanks for your help
