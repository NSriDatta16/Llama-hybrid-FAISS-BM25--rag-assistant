The answer to such questions depends on understanding the properties you require of a similarity/correlation measure pertaining to your use case. If you describe your use case, we might be able to help you better. If time series are of different lengths, you could do one of the following: Rescale the longer series to a smaller length using averaging and then apply correlation. Use Dynamic Time Warping https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_time_warping , which uses an edit-distance like approach to computing similarity between two sequences of differing lengths. Embed the two time series into a smaller, fixed-length "feature space" and then do similarity in the embedded space. The embedding could pick features of the time series that you are most interested in (e.g., number of peaks, auto-correlation at various lags, etc.)
