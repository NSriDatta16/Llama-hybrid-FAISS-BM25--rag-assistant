At the risk of sounding like a hammer salesman trying to make everything sound like a nail, if you can export your source control files to a clean, temporary folder, there are two ways I'd look at doing it with PBL Peeper . App Compare : Load your local app on the PBLs Page (lots of documentation on how to do this in the documentation if you're stuck). Go to the Compare \ App page. Make sure the radio button is set to scan folders for export files, and drag the source control folder into the selected pane on the Compare \ App page. Hit the Go button in the toolbar (the "Play" icon). Anything that is not in the source control that is in the PBLs will be listed as "Added". File compare tool : Go to the Exports tab and dump your local PBLs to a similar temporary folder/subtree. Then you can use any directory comparison tool to compare the two subtrees. My current favourite is Total Commander , which will make it easy to see which files exist in the source control subtree and not in the local export subtree (Synchronize Directories and uncheck Duplicates, then uncheck the appropriate direction). There are many ways to solve this particular problem. These are just another two. Good luck, Terry.
