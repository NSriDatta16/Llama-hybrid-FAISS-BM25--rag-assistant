why byte += 1 compile but byte = byte + 1 not?

If I have a byte variable: byte b = 0; why does the following work: b++; b += 1; // compiles ... but this does not ? b = b + 1; // compile error Does compiler understand first as byte and second as int ? [EDIT] I know casting but I want to draw your attention to the b++, b += 1 and b = b + 1 I think they are equal so why compiler differs them ? what is the difference between b += 1 and b = b + 1 ?
