Store file mapping from local to cloud

In Python, what do you believe is the best way to store file mapping info from local machine to cloud storage? i.e. A user has 10 files in 3 different folders on his local machine. They are also stored on a cloud storage, each identify by URL or other descriptors. Best way - in terms of scallability, search/insert efficiency, etc.
