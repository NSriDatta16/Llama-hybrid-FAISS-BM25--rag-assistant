Inclusion of correlated dependent variables in a logistic regression (seed dispersal from shrubs)

I am trying to model seed dispersal from shrubs, and I am wanting to explore if number of seeds on an individual shrub, plus the seeds in the surrounding neighborhood, affect percentage of seeds dispersed. However, I can't quite think through how to include the neighborhood seed number without including the seeds on the individual shrub being monitored. I have included the seeds on the individual in the neighborhood seed count, but this results in a strong correlation between individual seed number and neighborhood seed number. But I don't want to simply remove the seeds from the individual from the neighborhood seed number. Here is some example data. Ind_seeds = c(29, 12, 157, 50, 119, 26, 65, 104, 45, 73, 22, 50, 125, 149, 37, 66, 18, 39, 150, 124, 117, 24, 75, 13, 61, 65, 49, 35, 61, 77, 26, 37, 50, 44) NH_seeds = c(29, 12, 157, 50, 119, 26, 121, 104, 60, 73, 22, 60, 125, 149, 37, 75, 169, 39, 169, 124, 117, 202, 210, 13, 98, 210, 49, 98, 202, 77, 202, 98, 50, 44) success = c(0, 0, 8, 4, 9, 0, 42, 29, 1, 71, 21, 7, 0, 31, 32, 9, 8, 37, 15, 53, 102, 14, 10, 3, 9, 51, 46, 13, 28, 23, 11, 23, 28, 23 ) fail = c(29, 12, 149, 0, 0, 20, 10, 22, 7, 2, 1, 4, 57, 2, 5, 4, 6, 2, 12, 0, 15, 10, 16, 10, 29, 14, 3, 22, 10, 24, 6, 14, 8, 12 ) dat = data.frame(success,fail,Ind_seeds,NH_seeds) dat $Ind_seeds_scale = scale(dat$ Ind_seeds) dat $NH_seeds_scale = scale(dat$ NH_seeds) The correlation between individual seeds and neighborhood seeds is 0.41 cor(dat$Ind_seeds,dat$NH_seeds) and the plot looks like this How can I account for the individual seed number in the neighborhood seed number? It just seems like a model like this model = glm(cbind(success,fail) ~ Ind_seeds_scale * NH_seeds_scale,family = "binomial",data = dat) is not quite accurate.
