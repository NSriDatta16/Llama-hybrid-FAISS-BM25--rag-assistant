Have you tried RIA Services SP1 Beta? It includes TableDomainService that handles all the logic by managing entities in the specified Azure Storage account. Also, you can inspect traffic between your service and Azure Storage using Fiddler to find out what the problem is. References: WCF RIA Services SP1 Beta announcement Kyle McClellan's blog - he is the person who developed TableDomainService. There are a lot of posts in his blog about this feature. EDIT: As Kyle McClellan mentioned below in the comment, this problem really exists in WCF RIA Services SP1 Beta .
