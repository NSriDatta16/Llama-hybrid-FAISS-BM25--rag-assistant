The step you're missing is likely adding the image to the project. Drag an image from the finder to the Resources section of the project outline. Xcode infers the action from the file type, and images will be copied to the Resources folder. You can check it out in the Targets section of the project outline, if you disclose your Hello World target you'll see the different build phases, including a "Copy bundle resources" build phase. Anyway once the image is added to your project, the UIImageView inspector image name will autocomplete your image name, and all should work. No code needed.
