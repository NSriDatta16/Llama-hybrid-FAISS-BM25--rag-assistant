Named Entity Recognition (NER) would extract names of people, organizations and such. Example: "Penalty missed! Bad penalty by Felipe Brisola - Riga FC - shot with right foot is very close to the goal. Felipe Brisola should be disappointed." So it could be helpful for the "person" field, but probably not for the rest. Note that you could also train a system similar to NER in order to predict other fields, but it would require a good amount of annotated data and it's not sure to work well.
