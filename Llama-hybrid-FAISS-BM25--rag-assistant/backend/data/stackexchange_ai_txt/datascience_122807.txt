I have created a CNN model and now i want to draw its architecture diagram can anyone help me with that

following is my architecture: model = Sequential() model.add(Conv1D(filters=8, kernel_size=2, activation="relu", input_shape=(9, 1))) # CNN Pooling model.add(MaxPooling1D(pool_size=2)) # Flatten layer model.add(Flatten()) # Fully connected Layer model.add(Dense(16, activation="relu")) # Decision Layer model.add(Dense(1, activation="sigmoid")) this is what i got from the code: but i want architecture like this: i dont know how many layers should i add can any one help me with this thanks.
