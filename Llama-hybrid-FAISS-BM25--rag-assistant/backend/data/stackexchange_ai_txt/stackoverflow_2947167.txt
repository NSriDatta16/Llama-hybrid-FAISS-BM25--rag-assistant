Unfortunately, it appears that FlowDocument TableColumn objects are considered layout guidelines rather than true mandatory objects. As a result, changes to those objects are not tracked by the change tracking system build into the WPF RichTextBox control. See here for further details. I worked around the problem by making table changes that involve TableColumn objects into atomic operations that would be tracked by the change tracking system. Basically, if I want to perform an operation that involved manipulating TableColumn objects, I began a grouped undo operation, removed the enclosing Table from the FlowDocument, manipulated it as needed, added it back to the FlowDocument, then closed the undo batch. This way, the change tracking system record a replacement of existing content, which undo/redo can properly handle.
