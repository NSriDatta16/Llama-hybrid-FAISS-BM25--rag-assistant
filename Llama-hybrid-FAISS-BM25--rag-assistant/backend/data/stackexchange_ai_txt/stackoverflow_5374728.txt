Here is the code, I have used, to get it work. Now I have a form, Form1, and a usercontrol, Usercontrol1. To drag the usercontrol, I inserted a panel in the top of the usercontrol, and only if the user pressed the panel (panel1), the control should to move - like normal windows forms. Public Class UserControl1 Shared mypositionX As Integer Shared mypositionY As Integer Shared mBlnFormDragging As Boolean Shared drawBeginX As Integer Shared drawBeginY As Integer Shared drawing As Boolean Private Sub Panel1_MouseMove(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.Windows.Forms.MouseEventArgs) Handles Panel1.MouseMove If mBlnFormDragging = True Then Dim position As Point = Form1.PointToClient(MousePosition) Me.Location = New Point(position) End If End Sub Private Sub Panel1_MouseUp(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.Windows.Forms.MouseEventArgs) Handles Panel1.MouseUp ' Dim dd1 As DragDropEffects = DoDragDrop(ParentForm, DragDropEffects.Move) mBlnFormDragging = False Dim position As Point = Form1.PointToClient(MousePosition) Location = New Point(position) End Sub Public Sub Panel1_MouseDown(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.Windows.Forms.MouseEventArgs) Handles Panel1.MouseDown 'Dim dd1 As DragDropEffects = DoDragDrop(ParentForm, DragDropEffects.Move) mBlnFormDragging = True End Sub
