Drag and drop Javascript in iPad

I need to develop drag and drop functionality in iPad. As I am new to Javascript, I tried to get some solution to get this thing done. I could find the way to move the element on the screen. Here the the url http://popdevelop.com/2010/08/touching-the-web/ Now what I want to know is, when I drag any element, I need to put it in a predefined area, like drag from x container and putting into y container. I need help to create drop-able container, so that I could drag and drop into the container. Some thing similar to the below functionality I need to create in iPad. http://html5demos.com/drag Please help.
