the t-test tells you that the average graduation age of men is statistically significantly different than the average graduation age of women, under all the usual assumptions of the t-test. For feature selection, it tells you that if you're trying to predict gender then a graduation age will be informative or vice versa. Although it does not tell you anything about if the feature will improve your model if other features are already there. It does not tell you anything about improving a model performance for predicting anything else but gender or graduation age
