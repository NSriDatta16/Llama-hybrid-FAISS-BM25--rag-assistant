How do you train a neural network when inputs are not the same size?

Say I'm looking to train a neural network to decide the winner of a tic-tac-toe game (contrived example I realize). The problem is that the number of moves in a given game isn't always the same. Therefore, my inputs will be of varying lengths. Are there any strategies for training a NN that do not involve "normalizing" my inputs so they're all the same lengths? I've found 3 other posts ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) with essentially this same question, but they all boil down to normalizing the data into equal lengths. Are there any other strategies? Or are there any other techniques instead of NNs that can handle varying input sizes?
