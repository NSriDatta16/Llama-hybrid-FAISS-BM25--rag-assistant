Suitable model to be trained on Chinese COVID-19 data in order to forecast other countries data

In an article by WHO (World Health Organization) published on February 24, they present a very interesting plot (page 7) comparing symptom onset vs diagnosed cases for China. Since there is a lag time between the start of illness and diagnosis, the plot can give an idea of the true daily COVID-19 cases. Knowing such information could, maybe, help to manage the emergency through prevention. Symptom onset time series used in the article (Jan 1 - Feb 21)(cn = china): cn_onset = 50,50,50,50,70,50,80,120,100,190,190,210,290,300,490,560,720,790,950,1500,1690,2180,2670,2930,2890,3030,2970,2920,2620,2600,2450,3700,2300,2000,1880,1790,1390,1320,1070,920,940,700,650,620,420,380,300,300,350,170,90,90 Diagnosis time series used in the article (Jan 1 - Feb 21): cn_cases = 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,80,280,320,620,920,900,1110,1480,1620,1880,2120,2550,2750,3120,3700,3550,3150,3320,2580,3610,2900,2410,2110,2060,1480,1090,980,1000,1090,630,630,820 As we can see from the plot, few days after the lockdown the true daily cases started to decrease, where true stands for symptom onset. My initial intent was to find an ARIMA model, train it on article data and test it on Italian data. Using R functions on the Symptom onset series, we see that data is non-stationary(?) (p-value = 0.94), ACF has first 8 values and last 4 values significant, PACF has only first value significant, R suggests ARIMA(0,2,2) (moreover, AFC and PACF of the once differenced data have no significant values, does this mean something?) Using R functions on the Diagnosis series, we see that data is stationary (p-value = 0.79), ACF has first 4 and last 6 values significant, PACF has only first value significant, R suggests ARIMA(1,0,0) with zero mean (also in this case, AFC and PACF of the once differenced data have no significant values). Since I don't know yet how to use these models, I used a very rudimentaary and naive approach. I hope some more experienced users could run a more accurate analysis. OBJECTIVE: Use the above Chinese data to estimate the Italian symptom onset time series and to forecast the Italian diagnosis time series Italian diagnosis time series provided by CSSE (Feb 20 - Mar 15)(it = italy): it_cases = 1,17,42,93,74,93,130,202,233,240,566,342,466,587,769,778,1247,1492,1797,1577,1713,2651,2547,3497,3590 First, compute the rates of growth rg for the Onset series, it will be used to estimate the Italian onset series. rg(i+1) = cn_onset(i+1) / cn_onset(i) Second, compute the ratio of onset over diagnosis ood for each day from Jan 21, it will be used to predict/forecast the Italian diagnosis series. ood(i) = cn_onset(i) / cn_cases(i) Now, to generate the Italian onset series I thought about the following procedure the first value to be generated is the one corresponding to the Hubei lockdowns, which happened on January 23, and it is generated by multiplying the Italian diagnosis on March 10 (20th value inside it_cases ), day of Italy lockdown, by the ratio of Chinese onset over diagnosis for January 23 (3rd value inside ood ) it_onset(?) = ood(3) * it_cases(20) = 8.34 * 1577 = 13158 = reference value the previous value, i.e. on March 9, is computed dividing the reference value by the rate of growth of the corresponding day in China, which was Jan 23 (lockdown)(22nd value in rg ) it_onset(?-1) = it_onset(?) / rg(22) the value on March 8 is computed by it_onset(?-2) = it_onset(?-1) / rg(21) , and so until we reach February 17 (which corresponds to rg(1) ). the next value, i.e. on March 16, is computed multiplying the reference value by the rate of growth of the corresponding day in China, which was Jan 24 (24th value in rg ) it_onset(?+1) = it_onset(?) * rg(24) the value on March 17 is computed by it_onset(?+2) = it_onset(?+1) / rg(25) , and so until we reach April 8. The total length of it_onset is 52, since cn_onset contains 52 values. Now, to forecast the Italian diagnosis series , divide the Italian onset of each day by the corresponding Chinese ratio onset over diagnosis it_cases(25+i) = it_onset(28+i) / ood(8+i) In this plot, blue bars are the estimated symptom onset values in Italy, orange bars up to March 15 are the real daily cases in Italy, orange bars from March 16 onwards are the forecasted daily cases in Italy. Basically this procedure is just a way to generate a symptom onset series with the same shape as the Chinese one, and to generate a forecast of the diagnosis series with the same shape as the Chinese diagnosis series from the lockdown onwards. So probably, this is the worst estimation possible, as one can also notice looking at the big jump between 3/15 and 3/16. So, how to properly estimate symptom onset and forecast diagnosis?
