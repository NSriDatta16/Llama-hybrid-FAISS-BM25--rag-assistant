How do I add per item personalisation options to the cart page of Magento?

We are need to build a cart page that allows customers to personalise their products according to pre-defined options (see wireframe image here: https://i.stack.imgur.com/OY5XF.png ). The personalisation must be on the cart page for user experience. Technically speaking, what is the best way to build this type of feature? I have been suggested to look at attributes, but my feeling is they don’t provide quite the level of personalisation we’re looking for and I’m also unsure as to how to locate these options on the cart page. Any help and advice would be very much appreciated.
