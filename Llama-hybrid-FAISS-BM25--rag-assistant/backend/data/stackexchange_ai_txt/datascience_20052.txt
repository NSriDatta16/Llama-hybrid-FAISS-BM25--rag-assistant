Which Regression Machine Learning algorithm to use in Azure for statistical prediction/forecasting

I've a golf website that pulls a load of statistical data and makes forecasts for upcoming events. I'm trying to improve the algorithm and have been looking into Azure's ML Studio. I've lots of data about previous events and stats the competing golfers had and the time of the event so I'm confident I need to be using some sort of regression based algorithm but I'm not sure which one, there's a few that look appropriate? Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Thanks
