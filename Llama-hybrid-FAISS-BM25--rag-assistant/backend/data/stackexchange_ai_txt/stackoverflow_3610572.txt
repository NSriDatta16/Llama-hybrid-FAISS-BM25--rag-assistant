IE6 being a pain. When I resize the browser my UL moves

I did some checking over my site today to see whether it was Cross Browser Friendly. Turns out that it is... Except IE6... So, my question to you lot is: Why, in IE6, is my moving when I resize the browser window? Unfortunately I cannot provide any code as I'm not at my desk, but I'm sure I am not the only person who has come across this bug! The basic problem is that I have an element (UL) with: position: relative; bottom: 160px; left: 370px; top: -1px; *top: 4px; And when I resize the IE6 window (not scroll, or drag - just resize) - the element moves about 100px right. Anyone encountered anything like this before - tis a first for me! Thank you!
