Well, one point is that you are using a Poisson, which technically has a domain on $\mathbb{N}$ , to express outcomes that are instead only in ${[0,1,2]}$ If your outcomes have an "intrinsic order" then I would rather look into ordinal logistic regression (take a look here or here ). If your outcomes are simply factors, then just use multinomial logistic regression (there are some post on this site, like this , or blogposts like this one ) Using the correct link function should definitely improve your fit.
