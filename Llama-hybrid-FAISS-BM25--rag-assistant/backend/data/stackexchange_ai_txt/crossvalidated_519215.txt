If you're trying to generate data from logistic regression's assumed data generating mechanism, your code does not do that. Logistic regression's data generating mechanism looks like $$ \eta = X\beta$$ $$ p = \dfrac{1}{1+e^{-\eta}}$$ $$ y \sim \operatorname{Binomial}(p, n) $$ What it looks like you're trying to do is create a linear regression in the log odds space, error term included. That is incorrect. The error term comes from the binomial likelihood. To create data properly so that glm will estimate the parameters you've specified, you need to do library(sigmoid) N ```
