I'm interpreting this as fixing a bug, not a design problem. Isolate the problem. Does it always occur? Does it occur only the first time run on a set of new data? Does it occur with specific values, but not with others? Is the system generating any error message that appear related to the problem? Verify that the error messages are not generated when the problem does not occur. Has anything been changed recently? Those are likely places to start looking. Identify the gap between what I know is working (e.g. I can start up the app and attempt to do a query) and what I know is not working (e.g. it gives me an error instead of the expected results). Find an intermediate point in the code where it seems possible to look for a problem (does this contain valid data at this point?). This allows me to isolate the problem on one side or the other of the point I looked. Read the stack traces. If you have a stack trace, find the first line that mentions in-house code. The problem is not in your libraries. Maybe it will turn out to be, but just forget about that possibly first. The error is in your code. It's not a bug in java, it's not a bug in apache commons HTTP client, it's in code written in your organization. Think. Come up with something the system could be doing that can cause the symptoms you see. Find a way to validate whether that is what the system is doing. No possibility the bug is in your code? Google for anything you can think of related. Maybe it is a bug in the library, or poor documentation leading you to use it wrong.
