Using 1d CNN for time series classification of patchy time series

I would like to apply 1d CNN like models for the patchy time series classification. For a LSTM like model, my plan to deal with the patchiness problem is to add a time column for the data. However, it not clear to me how to add this into the 1d CNN as the convolution should attempt to pre-process signals for the data, but I wouldn't expect it to do this for time. Has anyone tried this before, any idea of how to input time into a 1d CNN?
