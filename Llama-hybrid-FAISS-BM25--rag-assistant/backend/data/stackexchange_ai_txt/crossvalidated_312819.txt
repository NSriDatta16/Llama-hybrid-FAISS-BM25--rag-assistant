What simulating amounts to is investigating the underlying distributions. Actually, this amounts to predicting what you would observe if you were to recruit new participants. You can learn a lot of interesting things this way. For instance: Suppose you recruit a new male or a new female. How probable is that she or he is $Y Y_0$? Suppose you recruit one new male and one new female. How probable is that the associated $Y$ satisfy $Y_m Y_f$? Or invert the question. Suppose you sample people at random from the top or bottom 2% of the unconditional distribution. What distribution of males vs. females can you expect? (Hint: tiny differences in means, with equal variances and normal distributions, can leverage to huge differences in representations at the tails.) This gets even more interesting if the two classes differ not only in the mean, but also in variances (or higher moments).
