Simplistically, you would just create an entity for each type of dictionary you wanted to persist and have an attribute for each key in the dictionary. In this case it looks like you would have two entities: Header and Asset . If the headers have a one-to-relationship with assets you might have (pseudocode) entities like this: Header{ backGroundImageUrl = string; dataField = string; headerText = string; id = string; itemRenderer = ?; toolTip = ? width = integer; asset Asset.header } Asset{ assetId = string; askColorCode = string; askPrice = float; bidColorCode = string; bidPrice = float; //...etc header Header.asset } The basic idea is that the model, well, "models" whatever real world object, event, condition or information you want to persist. In this case, the JSON is providing nice, neat dictionaries with all the data already organized and labeled for you.
