Developing Web Application

I am a PHP developer who is seeking some guidance. I am developing a paid web application service. I have already developed the first phase of the project. The code is organized but I want to re-implement it in an MVC structure. I have just started using CodeIgniter for my freelance clients and it works really well. Question: What is good development practice in this situation? a. Develop using a framework like CodeIgniter b. Develop a completely custom API using the MVC design pattern Example of web applications: Basecamp, Beanstalk, Less Accounting etc. Thank you in advance.
