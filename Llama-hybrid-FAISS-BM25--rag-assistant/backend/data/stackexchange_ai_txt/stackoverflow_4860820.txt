This is quite a vast topic, but Sitecore doesn't limit you here. The general note about it is mentioned in paragraph 1.2.7 "Web Services, AJAX, and other Internet Interfaces" of this article . I would recommend you to explore the standard Sitecore web service (it is present in any Sitecore release). Type http://yourhost/sitecore/shell/webservice/service.asmx to get an idea of what it can offer. It consists of just basic operations, but those are enough for the most of cases.
