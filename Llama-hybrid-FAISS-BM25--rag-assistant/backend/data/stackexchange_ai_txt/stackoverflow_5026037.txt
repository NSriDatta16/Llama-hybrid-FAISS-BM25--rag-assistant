Drag and Drop UI layouts using jQuery

For our next project (a small app in ASP.NET/C#) we have to create drag and drop zones in the UI so that components/widgets can be dragged and dropped and layouts can be changed dynamically (for example, the user should be able to switch between two-column to a three-column layout from the front end). After doing some searching, I got to know that there are two approaches: Use Web parts and Content-zones. Using jQuery. I also learnt that jQuery approach is preffered, but I would like to know how can I create such zones in my application and also save these zones per user (in the D so that when the new request comes for that user their preferred layout is displayed? I basically want to know if there are some tutorials on creating persistable drag and drop zones using jQuery. Thanks, Mohit Kumar
