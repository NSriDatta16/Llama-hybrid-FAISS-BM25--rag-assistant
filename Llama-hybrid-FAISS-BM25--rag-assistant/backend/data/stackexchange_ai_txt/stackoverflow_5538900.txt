.NET Object initializers question

I'd like to have a convenient way to add Phone objects to a Phone collection. Is there some sort of object Initializer syntax that I can use to avoid the following custom routine? I am using .NET 3.5 Private Function PhoneNumbersToCollection(ByVal ParamArray phoneNumberArray() As TelephoneNumberType) As TelephoneNumberCollection Dim PhoneCollection As New TelephoneNumberCollection For Each phoneNumber As TelephoneNumberType In phoneNumberArray If phoneNumber IsNot Nothing Then PhoneCollection.Add(phoneNumber) End If Next Return PhoneCollection End Function EDIT: Public Class TelephoneNumberCollection Inherits System.Collections.ObjectModel.Collection(Of TelephoneNumberType)
