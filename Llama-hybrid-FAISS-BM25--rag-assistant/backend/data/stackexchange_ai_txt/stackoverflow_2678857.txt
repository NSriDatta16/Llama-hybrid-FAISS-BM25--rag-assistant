General method for making sub arrays around a particular element

What is a quick, elegant way of using MatLab to form a subarray around a particular element? Element are selected randomly from the data, so you can't take a subarray in the normal way (it has to be generalized for the elements that are selected). What I mean is, forming an array for example 5x5 or 7x7 or something, where the middle element is the one you want. Thanks, but I mean a more general approach. Sorry for not being clear. What I mean is something like, let's say a = magic(10) b = find(a and then I thought about doing the rest using for loops but am not really sure how to generalize it and wondered, like I said, if there's an easier way to do it using MatLab. The reason for such a general approach is I want to analyze any array for elements with certain properties and then be able to form a subarray around each element to basically zoom in on it for further data analysis if that makes sense.
