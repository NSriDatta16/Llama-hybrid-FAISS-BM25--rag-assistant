You could try adding the [Column(...)] attribute; no idea if that'll work. A few options that leap to mind: build a class that does map 1:1 (by name), and then translate this data (via Select , or a LINQ query) into your actual intended class write a wrapper SP that renames the column (not nice; you'd need a temp table, presumably forcing recompile due to DDL/DML interleave) drag the SP onto the data-context designer and rename the columns manually in the generated types (consdier this as an automated implementation of the first bullet) move (refactor) the interesting part of the SP into a UDF that you can call from your existing sp, and use the UDF directly from the data-context (drag the UDF onto the designer)
