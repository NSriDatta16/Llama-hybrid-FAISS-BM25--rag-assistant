You're using jQuery, which I notice has a Drag and Drop plugin, whose comment section had the following that may be helpful: @Ian Q: I had a similar problem, when DnD didn’t worked for rows added after initialization. var params = { onDragClass: “onDragRow”, onDrop: function(table, row) { }, onDragStart: function(table, row) {} }; // Initialization $(“table”).tableDnD(params); Then call $(“table”).tableDnD(params); everytime you add rows to that table.
