Users can still add in duplicate records with no errors being reported. What do you mean by "duplicate records"? Depending on collation, case, accent etc. may matter, and 'test' and 'TEST' will not be considered duplicates. Could you please post the results of SHOW CREATE TABLE mytable ? Also, could you please run this query: SELECT date, door, shift, route, trailer FROM mytable GROUP BY date, door, shift, route, trailer HAVING COUNT(*) > 1 If it returns the rows, the problem is with the index; if it does not, the problem is with your definition of a "duplicate". Update: Your columns allow NULL s. NULL values in MySQL are not considered duplicate from the point of view of a UNIQUE index: CREATE TABLE testtable (door VARCHAR(20), shift VARCHAR(15), UNIQUE KEY (door, shift)); INSERT INTO testtable VALUES ('door', NULL), ('door', NULL); SELECT door, shift FROM testtable GROUP BY door, shift HAVING COUNT(*) > 1; From documentation : A UNIQUE index creates a constraint such that all values in the index must be distinct. An error occurs if you try to add a new row with a key value that matches an existing row. This constraint does not apply to NULL values except for the BDB storage engine. For other engines, a UNIQUE index allows multiple NULL values for columns that can contain NULL . If you specify a prefix value for a column in a UNIQUE index, the column values must be unique within the prefix.
