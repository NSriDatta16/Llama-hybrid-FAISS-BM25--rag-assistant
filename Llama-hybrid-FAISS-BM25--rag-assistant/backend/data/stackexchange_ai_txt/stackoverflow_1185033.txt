First of all, you can use Textmate (which I believe has Xcode integration). Otherwise: Window (Menu) -> Organizer (ctrl-command-o) At the bottom of that window, if you don't have two panes, click the square to the right of the gear. Now drag code files of interest to the left, grey pane--a single click or arrow up/down will open the file in the editor pane. If you do open a bunch of windows, as vog suggested, you'll need to command-~ through them--not alt-tab. Cheers.
