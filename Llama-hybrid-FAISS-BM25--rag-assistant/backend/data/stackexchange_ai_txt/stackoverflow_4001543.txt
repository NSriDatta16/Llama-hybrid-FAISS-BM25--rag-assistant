Something grabbed my attention in your link: Quote: It is not common to access the TIB fields by an offset from FS:[0], but rather first getting a linear self-referencing pointer to it stored at FS:[0x18]. That pointer can be used with pointer arithmetics or be cast to a struct pointer. I'm no assembly expert, but to my understanding, what you're doing at the end is a 0x24 offset from FS:[0x18]. The table in the link says FS:[0x24] is the thread ID, but that's not where you ended up. If you're going to offset 0x24, then start from 0x00. Or if you must start from 0x18, then only offset 0x0C, which is the different from 0x18 to land at 0x24. Am I on the right track here?
