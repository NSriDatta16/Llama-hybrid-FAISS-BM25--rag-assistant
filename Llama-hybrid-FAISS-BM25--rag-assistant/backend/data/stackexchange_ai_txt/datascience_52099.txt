Large scale Autoencoder for friendship recommendation

I have a user friendship graph for about 30 Million users. I am trying to use an auto encoder [30 Million, 512, 512, 1024, Dropout(0.3), 512, 512, 30 Million]. But I am not learning anything. Has anyone used Autoencoder for Friendship recommendation on a large scale graph?
