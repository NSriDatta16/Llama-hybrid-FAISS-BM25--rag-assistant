Changing ajax to request that fills a div with html content to be embedded into the html page itself

I am having a trouble embedding ajax html into the html page itself, I need to make this ajax response be apparent in the page source. I have 2 servers, one that runs the web application and the other is responsible for performing search queries (searcher). Now the application server sends the html page to the client's browser, which will request some search queries to searcher through ajax, after the successful reply the browser will put the html result into the page. The problem is that search results do not exist in the html source which is not good for SEO, google crawlers will have no idea what is being searched for. The other problem is if I made the application server make a request and wait for searcher results, the page will take tons of seconds to load. I am not sure what to do.. I really need to make the website SEO friendly and also need the page to load quickly!! Any pointers or ideas will be appreciated. Thanks a lot, Wa'el
