@EdM has provided a good answer. Binning is not a good idea in general, or here specifically. Let me add a couple complementary points. I wouldn't trust "the literature" that there isn't a difference between 26 and 27 year olds. It is to be expected that the differences between nearly identical values will be very small. There will be no power to detect those differences. Note that using bins assumes there there is a meaningful difference between 27 and 28 year olds. In R, if you use as.integer(ageBinned) , you convert the ageBinned levels into 1,2,3,...,10 (whereas the binning converted the original values into unrelated bins). This means you are fitting a series of constantly incremented step functions. If you make the categorical ageBinned variable into an ordinal categorical variable, you will use the same number of degrees of freedom, they'll just be decomposed into linear and increasingly complex curvilinear fits. Your best bet is to refit the subsequent model (or find a better one) so that you can use age as continuous. Assuming you can't, use age as continuous here, then average over the predicted values from this model ( $\hat{y}$ s) within each bin to get the values you'll use for the subsequent model. Note that you'll need to make some assumptions about the distribution of ages within the bins for that. There may be some data (e.g., census) you can use, but it also may not make much difference and you could just use a uniform distribution within each bin.
