It's not always possible to extract paragraphs from a pdf since sometime paragraph are split into multiple pdf frames so pdftotext split them into different paragraph even if there are actually linked. Similarly some frames ends collocated even they represent different information like the menu in the example pdf. Here is a simple approach to split a text file into multiple paragraph using empty lines: def txt2paragraph(filepath): with open(filepath) as f: lines = f.readlines() paragraph = '' for line in lines: if line.isspace(): # is it an empty line? if paragraph: yield paragraph paragraph = '' else: continue else: paragraph += ' ' + line.strip() yield paragraph
