AFAIK, v1.99.0 is sort of a v2.0 prerelease, so you could try installing v2.0.x , changing the RAILS_GEM_VERSION in config/environment.rb and runing rake rails:update . If you think about it, it's not as silly as it might seem at first. You make an app using a fast evolving web framework as RoR. Your choices are: continue developing your app at aproximately the same pace the framework is evolving, or freeze the rails gem (and evertything else your app depends on, like gems, plugins) into your app in order to make it less fragile to expecting gem updates.
