How to deal with Different Shapes of X_train and X_test after OneHotEncoding?

I am trying to perform OneHotEncoding as well as feature scaling on my training and testing data separately, steps I did: X = df.drop("target", axis = 1) y = df.target X_train,X_test,y_train,y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2) categorial_features = [List of Categorical Features] numerical_features = [List of Numerical Features] one_hot = OneHotEncoder() scaler = StandardScaler() tranformer = ColumnTransformer([("one_hot", one_hot, categorial_features),("standard_scaler", scaler, numerical_features)], remainder = "passthrough") transformed_X_train = tranformer.fit_transform(X_train) transformed_X_test = tranformer.fit_transform(X_test) But now the shapes of transformed_X_train , and transformed_X_test are different, I know the reason why it is different, but I want to know how to deal with this situation? Thank you.
