There is a whole blog dedicated to the subject which includes lots and lots of resources Depends on the usage, you can use ESRI's map services : "ArcGIS Online standard map services are available at no cost for internal (personal or within an organization) and non-commercial, external use."

USGS and ResMap are in this category.
