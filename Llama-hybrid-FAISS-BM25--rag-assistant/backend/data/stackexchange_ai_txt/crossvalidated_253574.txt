I am not an expert on R or glmnet either. Leveraging Stephen's response and package above. Question #1: I don't think there is a way in plotmo to label only the non-zero lambda's at lambda.min. Stephen demonstrated: If you use label=some.number it will label only the top some.number variables with largest final abs(coefficients); not necessarily the ones that were non-zero at your lambda.min. If you change the color to 0 the variables are hidden/removed altogether, not just unlabeled....but if they are unlabeled you can't be sure which variable it is so maybe it ok to just remove it. Alternatively, you can label everything and adjust the color so that the important ones stand out (see Stephen's plot #3 above and response to question #2 below). This way you can see which variables are important and which ones are not. I agree that it would be nice to label only the important variables when there are a large number of variables and lambda is specified by user. Maybe this is something that could be added to plotmo in future? You may consider adding a reference line for lambda.min to your plot to see which variable coefficients are non-zero at the cross-validated min error location. In plotmo, you can add the vertical line using parameter s=somelambdavalue. Question #2: You should be able to color the important variables based on the coefficient values at lambda.min. Following code is extension of what Stephen provided for mtcars. library(glmnet) mod 0,0])[[1]] coef.decrease
