The response was idiotic, my condolences. What you suggested is not unreasonable. It will probably not work, but how would you know in advance? Both your options were good starting points. Although the simple polynomial approach is probably not a good idea in a literal sense, but in principle, it's not much different from Nelson-Siegel curves, e.g. see widely used Diebold Li approach . Nelson-Siegel parametrization is based on orthogonal Laguerre polynomials . Hence, your answer was not off the mark, in my opinion. Treating yield curves as time series is also not wrong in principle. There's a bunch of paper where people do something along this line, e.g. this arxiv paper . In fact they compare performance vs. PCA. The PCA is probably the best approach if you want to reduce number of inputs. You get first three component scores, and use them as your inputs instead of the original yield curve. First three PC usually cover more than 90% of variance. However, I wouldn't say that it's universally best approach. For instance, if you're modeling markets some entities may specifically be sensitive to 10 year US treasury rate, then maybe it's good to have it as a distinct input etc.
