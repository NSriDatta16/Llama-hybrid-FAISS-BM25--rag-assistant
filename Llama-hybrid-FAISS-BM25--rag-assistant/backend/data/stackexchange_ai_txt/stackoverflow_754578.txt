Bug reports by developer is a horrible metric. As a QA Lead I have argued against this time and time again. Bugs will happen. How they are dealt with when they do is more meaningful. A better metric is what the developer's bug reopen rate is. In other words, when QA logs a bug, which is then fixed, is the bug fixed correctly, or is there something that was missed, causing QA to reopen the bug? The more often this happens, it is a clue that the developer may not be paying real attention to the problem. This is assuming, of course, that the bug was intelligently logged in the first place, preferably with steps to reproduce, the actual outcome, the expected outcome, and why. Screen shots help, too. Obviously, this is just one metric on which to report. Other possibilities are Does the developer meet promised deadlines? Responsiveness to client concerns. Accuracy of any required documentation. and probably others. Edit: I have done both development and QA and was lucky enough during my development time not to have bug counts used against me in reviews. I argue against it at my current company in my current role because it is an unreliable metric IMO. We used reopen rate as a compromise to make upper management (read "pointy-haired" dev director) happy that they have something to report on. I am not a manager and don't actually generate any reports myself (in case that's the cause of some downvotes).
