How to take my PHP form handler pages into WordPress to connect with PayPal API

I'm trying to integrate a form like this into Wordpress This form works perfectly with the PayPal API sandbox. However, when I tried to move this work over to the WP site of my organization, globalcitizenyear.org/donate/donation-form-2/, I keep coming up short. Anyone have any tips to keep in mind when doing this? What steps would you take first to make this happen in Wordpress - any details on what to avoid, or what potential hangups might be?
