there isn't anything exactly saying you shouldn't use use a blank TD, and it passes when you try to validate. Although, a more elegant approach would be to use colspan. i.e. item But this will align your content to the left, and you will have to manually (via css) apply styles so the content is aligned where you want. The good thing about using it with colspans, is that screen readers will read only what's there, and not the empty spaces
