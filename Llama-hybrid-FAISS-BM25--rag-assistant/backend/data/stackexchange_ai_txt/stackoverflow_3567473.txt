jQuery - Separate text into strings

Lets say my HTML looks like this: 12345, 23, 64229, 359 This paragraph can have hundreds of values separated by comma. It can also be empty. I wanna make these values into links. The first value should link to " http://www.example.com/?id=12345 " The second value to " http://www.example.com/?id=23 " ..and so on. What would be the best way to do this?
