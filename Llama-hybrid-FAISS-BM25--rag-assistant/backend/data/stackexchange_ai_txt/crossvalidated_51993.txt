Another possibility is alpha-seeding . I am not aware whether libSVM supports it. The idea is to divide a huge amount of training data into chunks. Then you train a SVM on the first chunk. As the resulting support vectors are nothing but some of the samples of your data, you take those and use them to train your SVM with the next chunk. Also, you use that SVM to compute a initial estimate of the alpha values for the next iteration (seeding). Therefore, the benefits are twofold: each of the problems is smaller and through smart initialization they converge even faster. This way you simplify a huge problem into sequentially solving a series of simpler steps.
