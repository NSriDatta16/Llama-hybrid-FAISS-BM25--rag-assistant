Bayesian Inversion Review

I am looking over a paper currently and am stuck on a particular step seeing how the intuition works. I know this is quite elementary but it is known: $$P(ab|c)=P(a|c)P(b|c)$$ This being said I am confused how $${P(a|c,d)\over{P(b|c,d)}}={P(c|a,d)\over{P(c|b,d)}}{P(a|d)\over{P(b|d)}}$$ If possible I would like to see the intuition in with how the above Bayesian inversion is done. Thanks. P.S. I also posted this on the Math Stackexchange site get help as well so if this is inappropriate please let me know so that I'll remove this question
