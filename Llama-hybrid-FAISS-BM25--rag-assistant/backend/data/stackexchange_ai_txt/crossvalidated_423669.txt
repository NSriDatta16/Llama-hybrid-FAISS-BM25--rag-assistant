This is in general a difficult problem. Monitoring the discriminator's accuracy is insufficient, since it goes to 0.5 when mode collapse happens. Some GAN variants -- for example Wasserstein GAN, have theoretical grounding which allows you to track the convergence by the loss function, however this is not true for all GANs in general, and is not true for the original GAN formulation. Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID) is the most widely accepted method of evaluating GANs (although flawed in many ways). You can try to track the convergence of your GAN by computing the FID and plotting the trend over time.
