Variation partition analysis: morphology-climate correlation, controlling for geography

I'm working with three datasets with informations about individuals: morphological data, climatic data of the individual sampling site and geographical data. My objective is to assess whether morphology is affected by climate, controlling for the effect of geography. I initially used partial Mantel test, however, there is a list of papers that discourage from using it. They rather suggest to use Variation Partition analyses. Here I'm using varpart function in "vegan" package in R. I run a k-means analysis on the morphological data and extracted the component explaining most variance: morpho_data I run a PCA on climate data and extracted the component explaining most variance: climate_data I used PCNM to convert original geographical distances between individuals: geo_PCNM Then I run the varpart function: varpart(morpho_data,climate_data, geo_PCNM) Do you think my analyses and reasoning is correct?
