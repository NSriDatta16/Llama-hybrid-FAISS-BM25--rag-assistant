Is there a way to use regex to match a string that doesn't contain another string?

Is it possible to use a regex to create a pattern that matches fragments that do NOT contain a certain string? This magic regex would take this input and examine whats between the parenthesis: (foo bar) (barfoo) (zab) (foozab) and only return zab because it doesn't contain foo between the parenthesis. Is this possible, or should I just capture everything between parenthesis and use a langauge function to exclude them?
