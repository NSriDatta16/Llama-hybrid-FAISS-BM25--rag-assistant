Yes, for directories anyway See this section on svn externals . The svn:externals property is set on a versioned directory; its value is typically another versioned directory in a repository (possibly the same one) of your organization. They act in the end something like symbolic links. Update: Good call also by basszero but note that the questioner almost certainly does not have an svn 1.6 repo, so he can't do it with files.
