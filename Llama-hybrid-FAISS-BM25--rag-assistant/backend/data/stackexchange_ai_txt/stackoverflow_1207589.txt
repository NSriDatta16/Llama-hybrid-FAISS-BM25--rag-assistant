You seem to have thought through a reasonable process. Some ideas for you to mull: If you are building a system for internal use, you may be able to use Microsoft InfoPath as the forms tool. It is much more powerful than Word and integrates with Sharepoint. If you use Outlook in your organization, you can use Outlook Forms as a way to create a customized forms submission process. Outlook integrates with Exchange and you could use public folders as a way to manage submission and approval. If you need to keep the system Word-based and browser-based, consider creating a web page that people fill out. This way you can integrate rules and validation into the form submission process. When the web page is submitted you generate a word document behind the scenes to store the submitted form.
