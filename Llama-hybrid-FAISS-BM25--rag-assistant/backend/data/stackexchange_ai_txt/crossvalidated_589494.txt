I think a stronger answer would have been to recommend using a t-test to compare the distribution of each users' events during a given month. A t-test takes the analysis you did one step further by applying a hypothesis test to it. One reason we typically don't rely on comparisons of the means alone is that two groups (in this case, each users' respective event count), may appear slightly different, but actually be the same. Let's consider another example. Let's say we want to understand if chipmunks are heavier, on average, than hamsters. We take 20 chipmunks and 20 hamsters and weigh them. Now, let's say that the chipmunks' average weight is 10 ounces (I have absolutely no clue if this is a reasonable assumption!) and the hamsters' average weight was 10.5 ounces. We might just declare hamsters the winner, but we'd be forgetting one important question - "is the difference a true difference, or is it reasonably the result of chance". The difference in their weights is subtle. Can we really assume that it wasn't a mere chance they were different? A t-test allows us to assign a level of confidence to our analysis. In your example, a t-test would allow you to set a confidence level to determine if one user's total event count was statistically significantly larger than the other.
