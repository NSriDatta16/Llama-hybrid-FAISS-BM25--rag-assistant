This is far too big for the scope of a single question. You're going to need to write at least a few different pieces. 1.) Access to the database and a way to view datasets 2.) Control handlers to drag and drop datasets onto your chart object 3.) A chart object that can handle receiving dropped dataset items and render itself accordingly. There are lots of good charting frameworks out there including Flare, Axiis, Flex charting, Fusion Charts, iLog Elixir. I'm not sure what you're trying to do but any one of those should be able to serve as your charting piece.
