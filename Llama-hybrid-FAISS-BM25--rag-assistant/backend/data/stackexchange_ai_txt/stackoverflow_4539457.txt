I'd recommend: Use two-table structure with composite key in comments for best uniquness in index. 100 comments per article is a bad limition that may hit you in the back. Dont use different tables for comments regarding video/pictures etc. If huge amounts of comments, add an comment-archive table and move old comments there. Most requested comments (newest) will have a smaller and more efficient table. Do save blobs (pictures and videos) on different partition and not in db. Db will be smaller and less fragmented at file level. regards, /t
