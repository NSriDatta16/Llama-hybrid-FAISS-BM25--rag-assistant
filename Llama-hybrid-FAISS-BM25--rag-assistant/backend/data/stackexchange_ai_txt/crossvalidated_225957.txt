In the K-Fold method, do we still hold out a test set for the very end, and only use the remaining data for training and hyperparameter tuning (ie. we split the remaining data into k folds, and then use the average accuracy after training with each fold (or whatever performance metric we choose) to tune our hyperparameters)? Yes. As a rule, the test set should never be used to change your model (e.g., its hyperparameters). However, cross-validation can sometimes be used for purposes other than hyperparameter tuning, e.g. determining to what extent the train/test split impacts the results.
