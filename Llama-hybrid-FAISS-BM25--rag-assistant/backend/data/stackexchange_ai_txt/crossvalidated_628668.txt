You could show an example of a simplified version of the problem. Reduce the sample size to two families; the first with one child and the second with two children. Ask them to solve for the average number of children. It is possible that larger numbers temporarily confuse the issue and reducing it to a very simple form may grant the student an "Oh! That's obvious!" moment.
