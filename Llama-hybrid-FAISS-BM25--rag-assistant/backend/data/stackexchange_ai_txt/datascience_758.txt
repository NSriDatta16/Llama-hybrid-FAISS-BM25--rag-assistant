Tools and protocol for reproducible data science using Python

I am working on a data science project using Python. The project has several stages. Each stage comprises of taking a data set, using Python scripts, auxiliary data, configuration and parameters, and creating another data set. I store the code in git, so that part is covered. I would like to hear about: Tools for data version control. Tools enabling to reproduce stages and experiments. Protocol and suggested directory structure for such a project. Automated build/run tools.
