This definition of random assignment seems to be assigning with equal probability. To assign 0 weight any of the possible assignments could create bias and should be considered a nonrandom assignemnt by any definition. However sampling with unequal nonzero weights can be an acceptable procedure (e.g. sampling randomly proportional to size or stratified random sampling with unequal samples per stratum are survey sampling examples). They fit into a more general definition of random sampling. If one is estimating a mean a weighted average can be used to get a unbiased estimate of the population mean. By excluding a possible outcome you change the population and it is not apprpriate to draw an inference to the large population that you chose not to sample from. Also because potential samples were excluded it is impossible to make a weighted adjustment to guarantee an unbiased estimation for the mean of the unrestricted population.
