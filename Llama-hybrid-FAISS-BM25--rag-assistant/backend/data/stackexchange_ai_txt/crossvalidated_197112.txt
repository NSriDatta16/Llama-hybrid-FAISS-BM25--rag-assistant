Why information criterion (not adjusted $R^2$) are used to select appropriate lag order in time series model?

In time series models, like ARMA-GARCH, to select appropriate lag or order of the model different information criterion, like AIC, BIC, SIC etc, are used. My question is very simple, why donot we use adjusted $R^2$ to choose appropriate model? We can select model which lead to higher value of adjusted $R^2$. Because both adjusted $R^2$ and information criterion penalize for additional number of regressors in the model, where former penalize $R^2$ and later penalize likelihood value.
