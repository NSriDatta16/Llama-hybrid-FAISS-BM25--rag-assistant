I really don't know what you mean by "manually", and I don't know what "sf.net" is. If you want to install MinGW, download from http://tdragon.net/recentgcc - current latest version 4.4.1 - and run the installer. You can install multiple versions - I usually have two or more on the go at once. If this isn't what you are asking, please clarify your question.
