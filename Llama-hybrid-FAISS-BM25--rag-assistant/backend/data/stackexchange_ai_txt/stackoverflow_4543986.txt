Java Apps are 16Mo (mdpi) or 24Mo (hdpi). But Native aren't and OpenGL Java API is only a JNI wrapper. So you can load on GPU more than 24Mo of texture. My experience was to limit Atlas at 512*512 at first (because G1 was slow on big textures) but today i use bigger atlas texture. Our current games use 20-50 Mo of ram and use 2048*2048 textures.
