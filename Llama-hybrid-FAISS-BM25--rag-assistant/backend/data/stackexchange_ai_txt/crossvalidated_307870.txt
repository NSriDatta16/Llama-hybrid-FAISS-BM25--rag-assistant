Interpret odds ratios of ordinal independent variable in logistic regression

I have a set of data where I would like to do logistic regression modeling the odds of a binary outcome variable (Therapy), with Stage as an ordinal explanatory variable (0,1,2,3,4). I am using SAS. The output I have been given is this: Odds Ratio Estimates and Wald Confidence Intervals Odds Ratio Estimate 95% Confidence Limits Stage 1 vs 0 0.873 0.547 1.394 Stage 2 vs 0 2.434 0.895 6.620 Stage 3 vs 0 0.915 0.431 1.941 Stage 4 vs 0 0.356 0.132 0.961 Stage 2 vs 1 2.788 0.980 7.935 Stage 3 vs 1 1.048 0.465 2.360 Stage 4 vs 1 0.408 0.144 1.156 Stage 3 vs 2 0.376 0.113 1.249 Stage 4 vs 2 0.146 0.038 0.567 Stage 4 vs 3 0.389 0.117 1.288 If I am reporting Stage as an ordinal variable, then is it correct that I create a table like this: Stage 1 vs 0 0.873 0.547 1.394 Stage 2 vs 1 2.788 0.98 7.935 Stage 3 vs 2 0.376 0.113 1.249 Stage 4 vs 3 0.389 0.117 1.288 Or, should I report it like this: Stage 1 vs 0 0.873 0.547 1.394 Stage 2 vs 0 2.434 0.895 6.62 Stage 3 vs 0 0.915 0.431 1.941 Stage 4 vs 0 0.356 0.132 0.961 The variable in question, Stage, is a measure of severity of structural variation in an eye that is diagnosed based on set criteria. The differences between 1,2,3, and 4 are different, and 0 is the absence of this structural variation. For reference, the following is my SAS code. PROC LOGISTIC data=new; class EyeID Therapy (ref ="0") Stage (param = ordinal) Gender (ref="M") Ethnicity (ref="C")/ param = ref; model Therapy = Stage Gender age A1c Ethnicity; oddsratio Stage; run;
