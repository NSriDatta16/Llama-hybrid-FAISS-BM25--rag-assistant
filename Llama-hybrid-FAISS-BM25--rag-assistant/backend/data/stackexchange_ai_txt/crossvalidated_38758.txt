I don't really know RDS but I looked briefly through the site and I have used Weka. Some advantages of Weka: Developed by academia - I generally prefer this over private company software. One reason is that it is more transparent As far as I remember Weka has hundreds of models/combinations. RDS looks much more limited. For example I couldn't find Support Vector Machines for RDS - that is a basic for a machine learning environment. It seems to me that RDS is more based on rule-mining, which is only a small part of what Weka can do. Weka is written in Java and is easily extendible by your own models and such. I personally found Weka very easy to use - but I haven't tried RDS so it might be easier. But I think Weka is definitely more powerful and flexible.
