Not entirely clear on what you are asking. In regard to performance - if you are compressing the strings in memory before storing them in the database your program is going to be slower than if you just stuff the data straight in to the table and let SQL worry about it later. Trade off is that the sql database will be larger, but 1Tb hard drives are cheap so is storage really that big a deal? Based on your numbers (200K by 300 bytes) you are only talking about roughly 60Megs. That is not a very large dataset. Have you considered using the Bulk Copy feature in ADO.NET ( http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/7ek5da1a.aspx ). If all over you data goes in one table this should be fun. This would be an alternative to having something like EF generating essentially 200K insert statements. UPDATE Here is another example: http://weblogs.sqlteam.com/mladenp/archive/2006/08/26/11368.aspx
