Getting text from a paragraph in jquery

This might be a very simple thing in jquery but I am not able to figure it out. My html document has the following structure This is the text I want to extract I tried this $("body").find("a p").text() but this does not seem to be working for me. I am able to get the paragraph object but not the text. I tested it with console.log with no use.
