Android Image Capture Saving Small Sizes on Milestone

I've written a simple app that opens the camera and supplies a path for saving any captured images. The code basically looks like this: File file = new File( Environment.getExternalStorage() + "myimages/", "my_image.jpg" ); Uri outputUri = Uri.fromFile( file ); Intent intent = new Intent(android.provider.MediaStore.ACTION_IMAGE_CAPTURE ); Intent.putExtra( MediaStore.EXTRA_OUTPUT, outputUri ); This works perfectly on my Droid. Images are consistently saved at 2592x1936. However, when testing on the Milestone, the images are saved at much smaller sizes such as 320x240 and 1280 x 1900. Using adb logcat, I can see that the image size is set as soon as the photo is taken. It seems like there is a default setting on the Milestone causing this behavior. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks, ~Jeremy
