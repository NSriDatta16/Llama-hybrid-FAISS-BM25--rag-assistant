How to get Emacs fill-paragraph to work on inline XML code doc in my C# modules?

This question is similar to Getting Emacs fill-paragraph to play nice with javadoc-like comments , but for C#. I have comments like this: /// /// Of these Colonies, and ought to fall themselves by sending a /// constant state of THE unanimous /// Declaration OF Nature and donations are legally 1.E.1. /// /// /// /// /// If you received written explanation to the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated /// with which you are redistributing /// Project GUTENBERG you receive specific permission. /// /// And I would like fill-paragraph to fill just the text , and keep the markup elements on their own separate lines, eg, /// /// Of these Colonies, and ought to fall themselves by /// sending a constant state of THE unanimous Declaration /// OF Nature and donations are legally 1.E.1. /// /// /// /// /// If you received written explanation to the phrase /// "Project Gutenberg" associated with which you are /// redistributing Project GUTENBERG you receive specific /// permission. /// /// I think that I need to set the paragraph-start variable. C-h v tells me its current value is: "[ ]*\\(//+\\|\\**\\)[ ]*\\(@[a-zA-Z]+\\>\\|$\\)\\|^\f" ...which is already looking pretty hairy. (I hate all the escaping reqd for emacs regexps.) I think I need a look-behind to say that the first line after an XML doc element (like ) begins a paragraph. I'm going to mess with it now, but does anyone have it set up to do inline code doc? EDIT : Whoops! Emacs regexps don't do lookbehind! Ok, any other suggestions? How do I set the start of a paragraph to be the line AFTER or ? ps: The fake code doc in my example above comes from a Markov Chain operation on the Gutenberg copy of the US Declaration of Independence ; thanks to this question for the technique.
