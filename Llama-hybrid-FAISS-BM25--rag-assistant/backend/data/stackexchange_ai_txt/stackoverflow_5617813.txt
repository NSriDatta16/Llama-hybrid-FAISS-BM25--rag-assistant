I usually use below as I have to loan/unload xla multiple times during excel session. Let me know if it works for you: AddIns.Add Filename:= "C:\test\1.XLL" AddIns("Pricer Add-In").Installed = False AddIns.Add Filename:= "C:\test\Arbitrage.XLL" AddIns("Pricer Add-In").Installed = True you have to make sure that filepath and name of the addin match. To check the name of the addin, go to Tools -> Addin. you can also use "Record Macro" feature and start recording and disable/enable the addin/xll from Tools -> Addin. Good luck
