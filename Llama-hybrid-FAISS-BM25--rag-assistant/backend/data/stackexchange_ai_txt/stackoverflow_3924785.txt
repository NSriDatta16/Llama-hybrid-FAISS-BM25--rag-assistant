I would implement a Javascript singleton AppCacheManager that initializes in the document.ready event. A bit JS oop and you have a fully fledged OOP datastore. Whenever information is needed, you load it through Ajax / RESTful Webservice and cache it in the AppCache Manager. So you have 2 caches: 1. Browser Cache, possible due to RESTful webservice URL caching, and 2: the JS Cache Manager. You access all requests to the AppCacheManager which transparently fetches the new data or returns the cached data, so that the client doesnt need to know anything of the caching. in short: write a JS CacheManager don't fetch the whole data at once but in small parts when needed and cache them define a convenient interface for the cachemanager Example usage: linktext Unobtrusiveness is a very difficult thing in JS and i'd be eager to know something about that, too. hope that helped.
