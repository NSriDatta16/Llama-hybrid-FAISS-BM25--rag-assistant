Why to use ARMA model as a time series is either over-differenced or under-differenced?

Knowing that a time series is over-differenced or under-differenced, and adding an AR term to the model means that we are partially differencing the time series if it's underdifferenced till a white noise remains, and adding MA term means that we are removing the effect of over-difference time series till we get also to white noise. Thus as adding MA terms has an effect that oppose to the effect of adding AR terms to our model why are combining the two into ARMA model as the series is either over-differenced or under-differenced??
