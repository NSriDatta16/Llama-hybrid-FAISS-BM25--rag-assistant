Scientific name of rolling median applied for times series outliers detection algorithm

I am a beginner in Machine Learning. I have a small python module related to times series outliers detection. I found in some posts and blogs an algorithm using thresholds calculated based on the rolling (or moving) median and moving standard deviation like in these posts . df['median']= df['b'].rolling(window).median() df['std'] = df['b'].rolling(window).std() #filter setup df = df[(df.b = df['median']-3*df['std'])] Question 1 : Is there a scientific name for this algorithm? Question 2 : Is there a reference for this algorithm? Thank you very much in advance for your help :)
