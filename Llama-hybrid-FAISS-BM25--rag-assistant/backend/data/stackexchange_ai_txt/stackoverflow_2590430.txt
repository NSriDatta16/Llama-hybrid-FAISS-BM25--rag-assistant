So i used two subreport parallely to map the data.The problem what i am facing is i could not able to organize the second subreport content corresponding to first subreport.That is , if any field's width is big in the first subreport then content in the second report will not align properly corresponding to the first subreport.The below sample will give a good idea about the problem My expected Output SubReport1 SubReport2 S.No Value S.No Value 1 value from first 1 value from second bean java bean value bean 2 value from first bean 2 value from second bean Result which i am getting SubReport1 SubReport2 S.No Value S.No Value 1 value from first 1 value from second bean java bean value 2 value from second bean bean 2 value from first bean Please kindly help me to sort out this problem.
