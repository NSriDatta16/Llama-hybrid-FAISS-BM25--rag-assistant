Modelling flight delays with negative values

Modelling flight delays with negative values I am working on a model to predict whether a flight will be delayed. The data consists of some explanatory variables for flights from a specific airport. I initially thought modelling this as count data would be a good idea, but as pointed out in the comments that is misleading. The response variable is the number of minutes deviations from departure initial departure time. I have some explanatory variables about the flights to work with, i.e. date, distance traveled, etc.. I don't have any weather variables though. The following is the histogram of the data. I have a positively skewed distribution and I am thinking what kind of a distribution would be a good candidate to model this. I am now asking, what kind of model is appropriate for this kind of data? The main goal is to do predictions. One idea I had was to train a classifier first to determine whether the flight will be delayed or not and then predict how late it would become with a regressions model, but I would also like to predict how early it went if that is the case. I think that I will use logistic regression to predict whether a flight will be late or early and then construct a prediction model for these two classes. What ideas do you have for models that would be good to predict deviation from set take-off time conditioned on that it will be a delayed take-off or an early take-off? Edited to remove my confusions about count data.
