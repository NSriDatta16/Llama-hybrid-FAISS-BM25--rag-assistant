Estimating a weighted regression based on weighted sample from Generalized Random Forest (grf) package

I am using the grf package from R ( https://grf-labs.github.io/grf/articles/grf.html ) for treatment effect analysis. The package runs a procedure to identify a matched (or weighted) sample of treatment and control units. I would like to use the weighted sample from the grf procedure to run my own regression analysis using the lm function in R. Does any one knows how to extract the weighted sample to replace Z in the following model. lmresult = lm(variable~treatment,data=data.df,weights=Z), where variable is the dependent variable of interest and treatment is an indicator that equals 1 for treatment unit and 0 for control unit. Thanks in advance for any help.
