Modifying HTML strings in C#?

In my MVC solution, I have an HTML string and want to search for comment nodes and replace them based on their content. How can I do this? Thank you. EDIT: The language is C#. The HTML string is e.g. " blahblah show real comment content before this paragraph. " . I need to get the comment block and then generate real content based on the count and length attributes.
