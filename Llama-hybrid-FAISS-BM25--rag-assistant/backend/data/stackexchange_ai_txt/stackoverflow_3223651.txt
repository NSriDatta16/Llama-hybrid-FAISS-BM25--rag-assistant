for loop structure

This program will calculate the average grade for 4 exams using a for loop by prompting the user for exam grades, one at a time, then calculate the average and display the result. public class ExamsFor4 { public static void main(String[] arguments) { int inputNumber; // One of the exams input by the user. int sum = 0; // The sum of the exams. int i; // Number of exams. Double Avg; // The average of the exams. TextIO.put("Please enter the first exam: "); // get the first exam. inputNumber = TextIO.getlnInt(); for ( i = 1; i My result: Please enter the first exam: 100 Please enter the next exam: 99 Please enter the next exam: 98 Please enter the next exam: 97 Please enter the next exam: 96 The total sum for all 4 exams is 394 The average for the exams entered is 98.50. This would be correct except for the last print out of: ' Please enter the next exam: 96 ' I tried putting the IF statement between the ' sum ' line and the TextIO.put 'Enter next exam' , but that isolates it. Thanks, from a Network Dude trap in a Programmer's world.
