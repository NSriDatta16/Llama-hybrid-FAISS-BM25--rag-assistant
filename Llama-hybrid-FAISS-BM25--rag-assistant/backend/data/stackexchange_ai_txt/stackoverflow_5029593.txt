Getting Varnish To Work on Magento

First please forgive me for total lack of understanding of Varnish. This is my first go at doing anything with Varnish. I am following the example at: http://www.kalenyuk.com.ua/magento-performance-optimization-with-varnish-cache-47.html However when I install and run this, Varnish does not seem to cache. I do get the X-Varnish header with a single number and a Via header that has a value of 1.1 varnish I have been told (by my ISP) it is because of the following cookie that Magento sets: Set-Cookie: frontend=6t2d2q73rv9s1kddu8ehh8hvl6; expires=Thu, 17-Feb-2011 14:29:19 GMT; path=/; domain=XX.X.XX.XX; httponly They said that I either have to change Magento to handle this or configure Varnish to handle this. Since changing Magento is out of the question, I was wondering if someone can give me a clue as to how I would configure Varnish to handle this cookie?
