Microsoft Word Document Controls not accepting carriage returns

So, I have a Microsoft Word 2007 Document with several Plain Text Format (I have tried Rich Text Format as well) controls which accept input via XML. For carriage returns, I had the string being passed through XML containing "\r\n" when I wanted a carriage return, but the word document ignored that and just kept wrapping things on the same line. I also tried replacing the \r\n with System.Environment.NewLine in my C# mapper, but that just put in \r\n anyway, which still didn't work. Note also that on the control itself I have set it to "Allow Carriage Returns (Multiple Paragrpahs)" in the control properties. This is the XML for the listMapper Note that this is the listMapper C# where I actually map the list (notice where I try and append the system.environment.newline) namespace DocEngine.Core.DataMappers { public class CSimpleListMapper:CBaseDataMapper { public override void Fill(DocEngine.Core.Interfaces.Document.IControl control, CDataSelector dataSelector) { if (control != null && dataSelector != null) { ISimpleTextControl textControl = (ISimpleTextControl)control; IContent content = textControl.CreateContent(); CInputFieldCollection fileds = dataSelector.Read(Context); StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder(); if (fileds != null) { foreach (List lst in fileds) { if (CanMap(lst) == false) continue; if (builder.Length > 0 && lst[0].Length > 0) builder.Append(Environment.NewLine); if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(FormatString)) builder.Append(lst[0]); else builder.Append(string.Format(FormatString, lst.ToArray())); } content.Value = builder.ToString(); textControl.Content = content; applyRules(control, null); } } } } } Does anybody have any clue at all how I can get MS Word 2007 (docx) to quit ignoring my newline characters??
