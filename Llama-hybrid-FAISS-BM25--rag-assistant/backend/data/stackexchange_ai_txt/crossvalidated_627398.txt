From the changepoint detection literature, it seems that SiMUltaneous Changepoint Estimation (SMUCE) approach could be useful. There is lots of literature, and there is an R package provided by the authors where they provide the estimator for several setups (including autocorrelation in the time series) The paper Pein et al (2017) explains the theory. An easy implementation in R is available in the stepR package It will detect all changepoints in your series, that you can later use to remove the episodes that you want. Good luck!
