Does it make sense to do PCA when you got two variables with the same scale?

I want to make to measure perceived standard of living in different countries in Europe. I got two variables from the European Social Survey that almost covers this: slvpen: Standard of living of pensioners: 0 = Extremely bad, 10 = Extremely good. slvuemp: Standard of living of unemployed: 0 = Extremely bad, 10 = Extremely good. I want to combine these variables into one variable in order to get the best indicator of standard of living generally. As far as I see, I have two options: Additive scale: 1/2 * slvpen + 1/2 * slvuemp PCA-analysis: I am a bit confused whether I need to do PCA or not as the scales of the two variables are equal. However, their standard deviations do differ a bit: slvpens: Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. Standard Deviation 0.000 3.000 5.000 4.587 6.000 10.000 2.28857 slvuemp: Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. Standard Deviation 0.000 3.000 4.000 4.095 5.000 10.000 2.099822 What would be the smartest thing to do in this situation?
