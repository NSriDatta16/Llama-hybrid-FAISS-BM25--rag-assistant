Should I standardize or normalize variables before conducting a principal components analysis

I am very confused as I am reading through PCA. Some sources say that I should normalize my data before applying PCA, and some sources say that I should standardize my data before applying PCA. I know that normalization will only change the scale of my values into a range of [0,1]. On the other hand, when standardizing, I am changing variables' means to 0 and standard deviations to 1. Sources say that I should standardize my variables: https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat505/node/55 http://sebastianraschka.com/Articles/2014_about_feature_scaling.html#the-effect-of-standardization-on-pca-in-a-pattern-classification-task Sources say that I should normalize my variables: https://datafai.com/2017/10/27/data-standardization-or-normalization/ Why do we need to normalize data before principal component analysis (PCA)?
