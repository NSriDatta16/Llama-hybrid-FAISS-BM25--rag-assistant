My suggestion: do away with manually checking the posts. Once you regulate content, you become liable for all the content on the website. Accepting posts without any form of moderation will eliminate a great deal of liability. In order to maintain the quality and prevent undesireable content, though, you can add the ability for other users to "flag" content as inappropriate, which would allow you to manually review only the subset of content that has been flagged, without having to review all content. Now, to answer your actual question,... you can automate filtering using machine learning techniques. Do not expect this automated filtering to be 100% accurate, however. You will have to experiment with different types of features and different ML algorithms, but I'd aim for something in the 90% range, and expect at least something 80% or more accurate. That said, I wouldn't even bother with that, because unless you have a very low false positive rate, you will annoy people for blocking legitimate posts, and allowing users to flag inappropriate content is typically sufficient. You could also provide a way for users to rate each other's posts. Crowdsourcing is a fairly effective technique for this kind of thing. Also, I should add one last thing... if you still want to have people manually review posts or if you want to get a large number of posts manually rated in order to have a sufficiently large labeled dataset for training your machine learning algorithm, you might be interested in Mechanical Turk , which allows you to leverage a very large number of people really, really cheaply.
