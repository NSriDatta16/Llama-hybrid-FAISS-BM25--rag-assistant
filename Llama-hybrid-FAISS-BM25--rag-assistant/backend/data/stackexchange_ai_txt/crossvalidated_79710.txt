Calculating a confidence interval and required sample size for the mean time to next event of a Poisson process

I am fairly new to stats and the field of confidence intervals, so I apologize if the question seems trivial. I am working on a physics experiment and I am measuring the time to occurrence of a particular event. I know occurrence of this event follows a Poisson process. My question is, if I calculate the average time to occurrence based on 10 such events, how do I calculate the upper and lower error bound (in other words, the confidence interval) of the estimated average. For instance, if I want the estimated average time to occurrence to be within $\pm 20\%$ of the actual mean based on a confidence level, how many samples do I need to record? Someone told me that I need to use inverse chi-squared distribution, but I would like to have a more in depth tutorial/info in this.
