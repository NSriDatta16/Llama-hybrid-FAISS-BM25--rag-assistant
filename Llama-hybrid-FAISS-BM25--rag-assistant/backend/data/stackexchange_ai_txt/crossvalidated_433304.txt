Hi: That's a very poor way that they describe the procedure. This topic can be extremely confusing if not presented clearly and in an organized way. If you haven't already looked at it, I highly suggest Hamilton's text for a really nice explanation. What I think they are saying ( who wrote that ? ) based on your verbatim is the following: If you think that the underlying process is A) $y_t = y_{t-1} + \epsilon_t$ , then do the DF test using $y_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times y_{t-1} + \epsilon_t$ as the model to be estimated. On the other hand, you think that the underlying process is B) $y_t = \mu + y_{t-1} + \epsilon_t$ , then do the DF test using $y_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times t + \beta_2 \times y_{t-1} + \epsilon_t$ as the model to be estimated. Essentially, the model to be estimated should always be one level more than what is assumed under the null hypothesis. They should have been more clear with their terminology. My experience is intercept and mean are $\beta_{0}$ and $\mu$ . The drift term is $\beta_1 t$ and is often referred to as the "trend" term. Note that I just realized that I wrote things with respect to the DF test. The concept is the same for the ADF test except that there are differenced lagged responses added on to the regression models. My mistake there. ADDENDUM: Note that the way I wrote it is also not the way the actual DF test is implemented. The actual test subtracts $y_{t-1}$ from both sides so that the actual test ends up being a test that the $\beta$ coefficient being tested is zero. So, there are two issues going on in my answer. I wrote it for the DF and I didn't use the differencing trick. Neither of these really effect the answer but I strongly suggest that one look at Hamilton for the gory details. SECOND ADDENDUM: For anyone reading this answer, the topic of ADF testing is quite complicated and the cases considered here are only two out of a possible four cases. I strongly recommend reading chapter 17 in Hamilton's Time Series Analysis text for a much more detailed and enlightening discussion. Page 502 summarizes the tests but I believe that one needs to go through the whole chapter for a clear understanding.
