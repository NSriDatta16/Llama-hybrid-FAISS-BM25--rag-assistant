Given your data set $(X,Y)$ , what you do with a neural network is actually trying to find a (very complex) function $f$ that explains the data: $f(X)=Y + \epsilon$ , where $\epsilon$ is the residual. Instead of creating one such highly dimensional complex function with a neural net, the idea of Gaussian Processes is to model a distribution over all functions that explain the data. This is of course non-parametric in a sense that there are infinitely many such functions. Theoretically, this is equivalent to a infinite-dimensional neural net that is able to model such any function.
