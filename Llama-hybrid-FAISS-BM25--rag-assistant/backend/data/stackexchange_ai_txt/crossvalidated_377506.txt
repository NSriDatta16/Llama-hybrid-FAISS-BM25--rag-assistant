Here is a direct visualization to understand what the number "3" refers as regards the kurtosis of the normal distribution. Let $X$ be normally distributed, and let $Z = (X-\mu)/\sigma$ . Let $V = Z^4$ . Consider the graph of the pdf of $V$ , $p_V(v)$ . This curve is to the right of zero, and extends to infinity, with 0.999 quantile 117.2, but much of the mass is near zero; e.g., 68% less than 1.0. The mean of this distribution is kurtosis. A common way to understand the mean is as the "point of balance" of the pdf graph. If $X$ is normal, this curve $p_V(v)$ balances at 3.0. This representation also explains why kurtosis measures heaviness of tails of a distribution. If $X$ is non-normal, the curve $p_V(v)$ "falls to the right" when the kurtosis is greater than 3.0, and so in this case the density of $X$ can be said to be "heavier-tailed than the normal distribution." Similarly, the curve $p_V(v)$ "falls to the left" when the kurtosis is less than 3.0, and so in this case the density of $X$ can be said to be "lighter-tailed than the normal distribution." It is commonly thought that higher kurtosis refers to more mass near the center (i.e., more mass near 0 in the pdf $p_V(v)$ ). While in many cases this is true, it is obviously not the (possibly increased) mass near zero that causes the graph to "fall to the right" in the high kurtosis case. It is instead the tail leverage. From this standpoint, the essentially correct "tail weight" interpretation of kurtosis might be more specifically characterized as "tail leverage" to avoid confusing "increased tail weight" with "increased mass in the tail." After all, it is possible that higher kurtosis corresponds to less mass in the tail, but where this diminished mass occupies a more distant position.
