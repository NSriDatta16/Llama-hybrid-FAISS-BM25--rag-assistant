How much noise should I add to my training data to test model robustness

For research purposes I am performing a regression prediction task which involves two time series (A and B). Aim was to map input: time series A and the last value seen in time series B into the value for the next step in time series B. The prediction task was successful outperforming the baseline (persistence algorithm) nicely. Algorithms used are KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest and SVM (regressors). However, I need to include robustness of the models in the research. From what I understand robustness relates to the extent to which the models fit noise. Being more robust is the ability of a model to fit noise to a lesser extent. I would like to test the robustness of the models by adding noise to my training data. x If I want to test robustness via adding noise, what percentages relate to minor, moderate or a lot of noise added to the training data?
