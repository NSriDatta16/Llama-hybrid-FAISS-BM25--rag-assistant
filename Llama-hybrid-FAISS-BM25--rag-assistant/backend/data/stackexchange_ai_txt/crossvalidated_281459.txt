None of these information criteria are unbiased, but under some conditions they are consistent estimators of the out-of-sample deviance. They also all utilize the likelihood in some fashion, but the WAIC and the LOOIC differ from the AIC and the DIC in that the former two average the likelihood for each observation over (draws from) the posterior distribution, whereas the latter two plug in point estimates. In this sense, the WAIC and LOOIC are preferable because they do not make an assumption that the posterior distribution is multivariate normal, with the LOOIC being somewhat preferable to the WAIC because it can be made more robust to outliers and has a diagnostic that can be evaluated to see if its assumptions are met.
