I'm assuming that you are using Visual Studio and have added the ProgressBar control by dragging it to the form. If this is correct, then following line, may be the problem: this.progressBar1 = new System.Windows.Forms.ProgressBar(); By recreating the control, you are loosing its link to the form. Just remove or comment that line and try it again.
