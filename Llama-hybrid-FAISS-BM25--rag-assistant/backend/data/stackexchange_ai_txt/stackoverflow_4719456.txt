That looks like a very difficult way to go about doing it. I havent been coding long myself but maybe the following might help you. lets say u have a nsmutablearray called enemies and you add the new enemy object to this array when ever you create one. enemy object would be a ccnode and have a ccsprite within it called _enemySprite then do the touch -(void)ccTouchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { NSSet *allTouches = [event allTouches]; UITouch * touch = [[allTouches allObjects] objectAtIndex:0]; //UITouch* touch = [touches anyObject]; CGPoint location = [touch locationInView: [touch view]]; location = [[CCDirector sharedDirector] convertToGL:location]; int arraysize = [enemies count]; for (int i = 0; i hope this helps
