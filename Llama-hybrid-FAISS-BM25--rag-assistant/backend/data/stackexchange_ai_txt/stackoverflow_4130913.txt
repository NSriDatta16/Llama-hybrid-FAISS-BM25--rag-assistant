What is the use of := in this program?

Possible Duplicate: VB.NET := Operator Yesterday I was browsing through MicrosoftÂ® Agent code snippets and I saw := used while calling a function. I tried searching it in Google but I could not find anything related to it. Is := used because we are calling a function of COM Library ? Code : Public Class Form1 Dim agent As AgentObjects.Agent Dim merlin As AgentObjects.IAgentCtlCharacter Private Sub Form1_FormClosing(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.Windows.Forms.FormClosingEventArgs) Handles Me.FormClosing agent.Characters.Unload("merlin") merlin = Nothing agent = Nothing End Sub Private Sub Form1_Load(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load agent = New AgentObjects.Agent agent.Connected = True agent.Characters.Load(CharacterID:="Merlin", LoadKey:="merlin.acs") merlin = agent.Characters(CharacterID:="Merlin") agent.PropertySheet.Visible = True End Sub Public Sub IntroMerlin() Dim strName As String With merlin 'Display character. .Show() 'Make the character play an animation. .Play(Animation:="Greet") .Play(Animation:="Restpose") .Speak(Text:="Hello!") .Play(Animation:="Announce") .Speak(Text:="I am Merlin.") .Play(Animation:="Pleased") .Speak(Text:="It is nice to meet you.") End With End Sub End Class Thanks.
