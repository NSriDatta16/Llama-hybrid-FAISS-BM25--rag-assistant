Try http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/stanford-manual-annotation-tool-2004-05-16.tar.gz It's very simple to use. Just launch the jar file, create your tags, and start annotating. It even has a batch mode so you can keep annotating file by file. You point the app to a folder of text input files and it outputs the annotated files to a different folder.
