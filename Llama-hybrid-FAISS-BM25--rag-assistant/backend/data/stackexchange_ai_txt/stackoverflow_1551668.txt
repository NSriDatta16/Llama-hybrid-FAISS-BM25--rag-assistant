Generic Xcode usage questions

I have 3 general questions related to the usage of xCode. Any help would be greatly appreciated please: Whenever I open documentation, the left content/index column is always small and I have to drag it wider. Is there a way to permanently set its size? Is there a way to perform a wildcard search and replace e.g. I have 3 lines: var1Letter = @"A"; var2Letter = @"A"; var3Letter = @"A"; In the above I would like to replace var?letter in 1 go. How do I set the default SDK? Thanks.
