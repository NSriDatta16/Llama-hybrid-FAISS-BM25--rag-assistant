How to set the printer properties programatically?

As a paper saving drive throughout the organization, we plan to set 2 page printing (back to back) as default setting on all the Windows machines. Is it possible to program this in .NET / Java (or any scripting language)? Can we change printer properties by a program? Thanks for your time.
