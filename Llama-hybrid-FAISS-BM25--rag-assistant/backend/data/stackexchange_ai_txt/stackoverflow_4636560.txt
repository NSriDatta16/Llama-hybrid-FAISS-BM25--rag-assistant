I don't think access time tells you anything, really. If you have slow or incorrectly configured storage, then this access time metric will be dwarfed by how much time is spent on waits and split I/Os. Network latency is also a factor, since I'm guessing you probably won't want to have your code on the same machine as your database, and you will most likely have a few network devices you'll need to traverse in your production environment. In my experience, all the database platforms these days will all perform adequately if configured correctly and paired with a complementary application. Pick the DBMS that best fits your requirements, follow the best practices for configuration of the DBMS on your hardware, and you should be please with the outcome.
