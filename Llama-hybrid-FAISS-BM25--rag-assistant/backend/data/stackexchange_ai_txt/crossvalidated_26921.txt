The standard approach in sports analytics is to use Bill James' "log5" technique . It was originally developed for team winning percentages, but it has successfully been adapted for other things such as batter-pitcher matchups. Dan Fox (who currently works in the front office of the Pittsburgh Pirates) wrote this article describing how it works for individual matchups. The general technique is a little more complicated, so I'll just include the original winning percentage version here. Let $A$ represent the winning percentage of Team A (ideally the expected winning percentage against an average team) and similarly for $B$. Then the expected winning percentage for Team A is as follows: $$W\% = \frac{A * (1 - B)}{A * (1 - B) + (1 - A)*B}$$
