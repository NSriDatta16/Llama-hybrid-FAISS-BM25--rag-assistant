If you train your favorite classifier (random forest, boosted trees, whatever) to predict geography, and use the feature importance metric to rank the features, this will give a certain sense of an answer to the question "how are these geographies different." The precise meaning will depend on the algorithm and the way you measure importance, but this should provide a straightforward way to make progress. In the same vein, using the boruta algorithm will also allow you to filter out irrelevant features.
