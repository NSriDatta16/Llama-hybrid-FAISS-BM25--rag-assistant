I believe absolutely avoiding usage of a commonly accepted solution (even it is outdated) is the same thing as designing a table with tags instead of tags, just so you can use . When designing your website, you probably won't require the use of tags, but I can still imagine them being useful where user input is needed, for example. I don't see anything wrong with using but have not come across many situation where I required using them. In most cases, there probably are more elegant (and prettier) solutions than using tags if this is what you need for vertically seperating content.
