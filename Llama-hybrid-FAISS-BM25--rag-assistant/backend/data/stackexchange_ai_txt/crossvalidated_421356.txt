The solution and the general method are both correct, but some of your notation is unnecessary (e.g., there is no need to define $Y$ at all). Note that this result is just a special case of a more general probability rule, which holds that that the probability generating function of any mixture random variable can be written as a weighted average of the probability generating functions of its mixture parts (with weights equal to the mixture probabilities). Theorem: Let $X$ be a mixture of the random variables $A_1,...,A_k$ with mixture probabilities $p_1,...,p_k$ , then the probability generating function of $X$ can be written as: $$\mathcal{G}_{X}(z) = \sum_{i=1}^k p_i \cdot \mathcal{G}_{A_i}(z).$$ Proof: From the stated mixture form we have $X = A_H$ where $H \sim \text{Categorical}(p_1,...,p_k)$ . Thus, using the law of total expectation you have: $$\begin{equation} \begin{aligned} \mathcal{G}_{X}(z) = \mathbb{E}(z^X) &= \mathbb{E}(z^{A_H}) \\[6pt] &= \mathbb{E}( \mathbb{E}(z^{A_H}|H)) \\[6pt] &= \mathbb{E}( \mathcal{G}_{A_H}(z)) \\[6pt] &= \sum_{i=1}^k p_i \cdot \mathcal{G}_{A_i}(z), \\[6pt] \end{aligned} \end{equation}$$ which was to be shown. $\blacksquare$ Observe that nothing in this proof requires any assumption about the distributions of the random variables $A_1,...,A_k$ to be discrete.
