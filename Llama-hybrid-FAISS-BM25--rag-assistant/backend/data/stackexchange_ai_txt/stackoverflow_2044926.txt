True Parallel Processing in jBPM

need to achieve: Forking processing to multiple tasks ... ... ... jBPM solution should execute tasks in parallel, and not, how it is done by default, sequential. I have read jBPM documentation which suggests to use async="true" on the nodes/tasks, however it is unclear on how exactly this should be implemented. One of the suggestion was to persist it in DB, and send the tasks to JMS queue, not to deal with custom multi-thread management. However I found it too strange that jBPM does not have a straightforward solution for this. I hope somebody will prove me wrong here, and will show me simple and elegant solution with jBPM 3.2.6 [as this is the latest supported by Red Hat] Thank you.
