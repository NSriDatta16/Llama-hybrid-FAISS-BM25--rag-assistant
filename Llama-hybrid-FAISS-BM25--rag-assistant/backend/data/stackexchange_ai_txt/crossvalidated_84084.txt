One alternative is to forgo p-values altogether and focus on what the results mean . In many situations, p-values answer a question we are not (or ought not be) interested in: If, in the population from which this sample was drawn, there is no effect, how likely is it that, in a sample of this size, we would get a test statistic as big or bigger than the one we got? Instead, we ought to be interested in what the statistics add to an argument about what is going on. This idea is fully developed in the book "Statistics As Principled Argument" by Robert Abelson (link goes to my review) but, essentially, we ought to be asking these questions about the effects we find: How big are they? How precise are they? How widely do they apply? How interesting are they? How credible are they? This can only be done if we are also substantive experts or if we work closely with experts. For example, sometimes small effects are quite interesting - so interesting that they are worth discussing. Indeed, sometimes effects are interesting because they are small - if the literature and theory suggests that they ought to be big. Highly credible claims require less evidence than ones that are not credible, but credibility has non-statistical sources.
