The following solution actually edits the file inline, only uses one command, and is a bit more elegant than the other proposed solutions (IMHO). awk '{gsub(/restartfreq\s*[0-9]+/,$2/2,$2)}' my_file.conf Apologies to Dennis, et. al for answering my own question, but I feel this is the best solution and hopefully it will benefit others who read this... Edit 1 Whoops I lied. That just prints to the terminal too... It took me a long time to find, but this works, using only sed and awk: sed -i '/restartfreq/s/'`sed -n 's/restartfreq*/&/p' my_file.conf | awk '{print $2}'`'/'`sed -n 's/restartfreq*/&/p' my_file.conf | awk '{print $2/2}'`'/g' my_file.conf Perhaps this can be streamlined, but at least it works! :)
