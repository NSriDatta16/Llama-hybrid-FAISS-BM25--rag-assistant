I've never done it myself, but I suspect you just need to implement the IXmlSerializable interface. As far as I can tell, that means you have to make your struct mutable - which is a pain. Ideally the XmlSerializer should recognise if your type has a constructor with a certain signature, but as that doesn't seem to be an option (as far as I can see) it would be worth implementing the interface using explicit interface implementation to at least discourage users from using it directly themselves. I wonder how other structs (e.g. DateTime) manage... perhaps they have explicit support in XmlSerializer.
