'Standard logistic regression' (part of generalised linear models) The logistic regression can be the 'standard' logistic regression with fixed coefficents, so in the univariate case (for simplicity I take one explanatory variable, but the reasoning holds also in the multivariate case), the logistic regression tries to predict the probability of 'success' conditional on a given value of the explanatory variable: $P(y=1|_{X=x})=\frac{1}{1+e^{-(\beta_1 x + \beta_2)}}$. If you assume that your coeffcients are fixed then you have the logisitic regression as explained by @Enrique (+1). Mixed effects logistic regression (part of generalised mixed effect models) But in some cases it may be interesting not to assume fixed $\beta_i$ e.g. because you think that for each participant in a survey the intercept is different (see an example in the case of a linear model in my answer on How to account for participants in a study design? ). If you assume thet e.g. $\beta_2$ is random , then you can estimate these coefficents for this 'mixed effects logistic regression model ' . The estimation of the parameters $\beta_i$ is a bit more complicated but implemented in most statistical software. The interpretation of the estimated parameters is harder however.
