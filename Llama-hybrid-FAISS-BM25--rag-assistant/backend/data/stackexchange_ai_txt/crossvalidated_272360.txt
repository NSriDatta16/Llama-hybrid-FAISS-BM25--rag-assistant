Started as a comment but grew too long; I guess it's an answer-by-way-of-general-advice now. Such window-width choices involve a bias-variance tradeoff -- the wider your window the smoother the result (lower variance), but the less responsive it will be (which is where the greater bias comes in), while narrower windows will have less bias but greater variance. You can always try something like minimizing leave-one-out mean-square prediction error (if your interest is mainly on smoothing) or one-step-ahead prediction error (if you're using it to predict) to choose the particular smooth (such as the window width for a plain moving average). [As whuber says, speed shouldn't be a big problem with a suitable choice of algorithm.] However, if you expect smooth trend in your data, raw moving averages may not be your best choice (see what happens when you smooth a noiseless quadratic trend, say, or a sine curve). If you're doing a smooth that looks only back in time ("filtering"), as you might do when predicting, even a linear trend will have this problem. There are particular forms of weighted moving averages that can reduce that particular source of bias.
