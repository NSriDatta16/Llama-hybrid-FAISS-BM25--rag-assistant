Could you use the Isolated Storage in .Net? While, it isn't necessarily restricted away from your users it may be a lot harder to find.... (stores under the local settings\application data\isolated storage for the logged in user) Via code you work with it by using / importing the System.Io.IsolatedStorage and then you can create directories, files, etc... normal. You also don't have to keep track of the actual directory on the HD it's in as .Net manages this. Maybe a nice plus.
