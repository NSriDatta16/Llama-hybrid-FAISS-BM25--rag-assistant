I am considering resurrecting this code, translating it into a modern language, and open-sourcing the project as a refactoring power-tool. I think it would be simply great to have such a tool freely available. But there is a commercial product available: DMS Software Reengineering Toolkit . The DMS Software Reengineering Toolkit is a set of tools for automating customized source program analysis, modification or translation or generation of software systems, containing arbitrary mixtures of languages ("domains"). The term "software" for DMS is very broad and covers any formal notation, including programming languages, markup languages, hardware description languages, design notations, data descriptions, etc. This toolkit is the first step towards the implementation of The Design Maintenance Systemâ„¢, an ambitious vision of a 21st Century software engineering environment that supports the incremental construction and maintenance of large application systems, driven by semantics and captured designs. Also, for C source code there is the coccinelle tool: Coccinelle is a program matching and transformation engine which provides the language SmPL (Semantic Patch Language) for specifying desired matches and transformations in C code. Coccinelle was initially targeted towards performing collateral evolutions in Linux. Such evolutions comprise the changes that are needed in client code in response to evolutions in library APIs, and may include modifications such as renaming a function, adding a function argument whose value is somehow context-dependent, and reorganizing a data structure. Beyond collateral evolutions, Coccinelle is successfully used (by us and others) for finding and fixing bugs in systems code.
