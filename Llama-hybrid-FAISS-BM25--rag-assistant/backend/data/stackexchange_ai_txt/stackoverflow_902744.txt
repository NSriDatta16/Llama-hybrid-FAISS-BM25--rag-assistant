SVN Server running on Windows Vista in a Home Network, Accessing from Mac OS X

I have SVN running on my main windows development box on my home network. I access the server from various development laptops depending on what I'm doing. I also do this with a Mac OS X development laptop but I apparently have to use the IP Address of the SVN Server. This is causing problems because the IP address of the SVN server changes. On my windows machines, I can access SVN via the servers name. Is it possible for me to do something like this from my Mac? Or perhaps some configuration so I can "configure" my mac to to name an IP Address? (Perhaps the hosts file?) Thank you all! Regards, Frank Update : I access my SVN repository on my Mac with ZigVersion . I use a URL like the following: http://Frank@192.168.1.7/svn/RepositoryName/ Update 2 : While Chris gave a good answer (that I understand), I was hoping for something a little more elegant. If you think this is the best method, please chime in by voting. I'm looking for other ideas but also community opinion on how this might be accomplished. Also, If it'd be possible to Post this on ServerFault , please let me know how.
