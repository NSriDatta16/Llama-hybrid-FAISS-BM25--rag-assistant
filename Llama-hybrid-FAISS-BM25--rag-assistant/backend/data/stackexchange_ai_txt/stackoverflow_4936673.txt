By test, BULK INSERT is much faster. After an hour using SQLBulkCopy, I was maybe a quarter of the way through my data, and I had finished writing the alternative method (and having lunch). By the time I finished writing this post (~3 minutes), BULK INSERT was about a third of the way through. For anyone who is looking at this as a reference, it is also worth mentioning that the upload is faster without a primary key. It should be noted that one of the major causes for this could be that the server was a significantly more powerful computer, and that this is not an analysis of the efficiency of the algorithm, however I would still recommend using BULK INSERT, as the average server is probably significantly faster than the average desktop computer.
