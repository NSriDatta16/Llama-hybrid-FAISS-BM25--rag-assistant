Can SharePoint be used for public facing web sites? Oh yes, indeed. If you have your doubts, check out this site: http://www.topsharepoint.com , where you'll find sites such as Ferrari , Volvo Cars , Library of Congress , Carlsberg , Viacom , KPMG and a lot of other high profile company or government organizations. Admitted, there can be accessibility-challenges with SharePoint if you rely only on the Out of the Box-features from Microsoft Office SharePoint Server(MOSS), but in time even these issues have all been addressed. The ARF is a nice example of how some of these issues have been addressed (and now even web parts can be made to validate). Another is AKS , which even has Microsoft officially involved. A third is BKS . If people are still making non-validating sites in SharePoint today, it could very well be because they haven't researched thoroughly or aren't prioritizing it. If you look above the challenges of validation, I would say since you've already decided on using SharePoint for intranet, there's very little reason not to do so for your public sites also. A lot intranets running on MOSS are in fact based on it's CMS-templates, because then you get the best of both worlds. All the collaborative features can, for the most parts, be easily enabled for CMS-sites as well. In fact you get a very mature, enterprise-ready, scalable product i MOSS which also includes a range of other features like easy code-package deployment, enterprise-ready search, workflows, scheduled server-to-server content deployment, detailed user-management and a long list of other features . I could go on and on about SharePoint, but in closing I just have to say that even the free WSS-part can be made into a CMS system, proven by sites such as Tozit and CompleteSharePoint.NET . You will most likely also find, that should you need consultants or hire people for the job, it's easier to get SharePoint-people on board than Umbraco, simply because of the big community supporting the SharePoint-platform.
