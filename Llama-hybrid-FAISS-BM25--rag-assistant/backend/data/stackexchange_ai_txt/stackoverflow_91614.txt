I recently had to do something similar and using switch wasn't an option. Doing an == on the typeof(x) is fine, but a more elegant way might be to do something like this: if(property.PropertyType is bool){ //dostuff; } else if (property.PropertyType is string){ //do other stuff; } But, I'm not certain that you can use the "is" keyword in this way, I think it only works for objects...
