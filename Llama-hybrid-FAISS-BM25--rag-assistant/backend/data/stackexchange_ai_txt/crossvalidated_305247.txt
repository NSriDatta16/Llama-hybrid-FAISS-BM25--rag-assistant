Updating posterior distribution in online fashion

First, I am sorry if this is an obvious question, I am starting to study bayesian statistics (mainly for machine learning) and I was seeing the classic coin flip example using a Bernoulli distribution with parameter $q$. So I checked the math using an uniform prior ($P(q)=1$), and I was trying to see how the posterior would change after seeing for example $D=\{heads,tails\}$. So After computing the equations, I got that the posterior $P(q|D)=6(q-q^2)$. Then I did the same computation, but this time in 2 steps; that is, first I computed $P(q|D)$ but only with $D=\{heads\}$ which was equal to $2q$. Then I computed the posterior again with $D=\{tails\}$ but this time using the posterior that I just obtained ($P(q)=2q$). And then I obtained the same posterior as before. My question is, is this always the case if we assume iid samples or just works for this simple case? Is this how real life systems are programmed (using the previous posterior distribution as prior)? Thanks!
