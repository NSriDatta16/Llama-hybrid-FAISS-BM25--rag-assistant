Drag Drop using SendMessage

This sounds funny..just a little experiment. i wanted to simulate a drag drop of a file on a Application/Window using Send Message. Is it possible? I dont have code for the application but on the executable. The application is IP Messenger . What i wanted to do is use "Send To" functionality to send the file to an .exe ,which will find IPMessenger window and simulate a drag drop thr code. The user will select the file and right click "send to" to the .exe which will do drag drop from code. **Note: IP Messenger supports drag-drop operation for files thx amit
