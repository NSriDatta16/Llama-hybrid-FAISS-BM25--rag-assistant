You can, it's not much work. But i can tell you i switched from Smarty to Zend_View a long time ago, those view-helpers are a real elegant way working with the zend framework components and wrapping them for smarty is a really non-trivial task, as smarty templates yet not know arrays, and you will need them often: URL-View-Helper and many more. Skip Smarty it's the best choice when working with the Zend_Framework ;)
