I have the same proble. I have tried all the suggestions above, they wont fix my problem. I finally found the solution: Quit Xcode. Open the BasketballTeams.xcodeproj folder (either in Finder with control click Show Contents of Package, or cd down into the directory with terminal) and delete the files that begin with your username (i.e Felipe.*) delete the build directory Open the project again in Xcode and try Build and Run again Actually I suggest you to reset you simulator and clean all targets as well. It works for me, you may find the original post here: http://forums.pragprog.com/forums/83/topics/1095
