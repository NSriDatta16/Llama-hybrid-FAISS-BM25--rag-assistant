It sounds like what you need is a (non-hidden) Markov model with multinomial logistic regression on the transition probabilities. It seems that there are packages for this; see for example the package hesim , which has a vignette dedicated to " Markov models with multinomial logistic regression ". For the sake of completeness, you could do this with moveHMM, using the option "knownStates" to pass the vector of observed states to the function fitHMM. I'm showing the code for this below, building on your example. Because moveHMM expects columns for "x" and "y", I created dummy variables, but they do not affect the state classification because the states are known. Similarly, initial parameter values need to be specified, but they do not matter here. # Load package library(moveHMM) # Add dummy "x" and "y" columns d $x y After fitting the model, you can plot the relationship between the transition probabilities and the covariates using plot(hmm) , and the relationship between the stationary state probabilities and the covariates using plotStationary(hmm) . Both functions can take the option plotCI = TRUE to obtain pointwise confidence intervals.
