I would first look at how much of this 8s delay is related to: Server side processing (how much took for the data to be generated) There are a lot of techniques to improve this time, including: DB indexes caching a faster to_json library Some excellent resources are the NewRelic podcasts on Rails scalability http://railslab.newrelic.com/2009/02/09/episode-7-fragment-caching Transmission delay(how much time took for the data to be sent between the server and the client) if the keys are pretty much the same, you may implement the sollution from Compression algorithm for JSON encoded packets? ; You may want to look at https://github.com/WebReflection/json.hpack/wiki/specs-details and http://www.nwhite.net/?p=242 in addition to this, you may also compress (gzip) it from your frontend server http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_deflate.html http://wiki.nginx.org/NginxHttpGzipModule If the data structure is constant and you can also try to implement a binary service, that is much much faster, includes compression, but also more difficult to mantain, like thrift: http://www.igvita.com/2007/11/30/ruby-web-services-with-facebooks-thrift/ If this is suitable to your needs, maybe you can make some kind of a versioning/cache system server-side, and send only the records that were modified (but that is pretty heavy to implement)
