Hmmm.... The problem, if I understand correctly, is that the browser jumps down to the fragment anchor position when arriving from another page, before the SmoothScroll object is loaded. The first thing that comes to mind would be a solution that uses sessions or cookies. When a user is on the index page and clicks on a link to portfolio that should scroll to the #blogg anchor: Instead of adding the hashtag fragment to the URL of the link, save a cookie that indicates the page should be scrolled and link directly to the top of the portfolio page. Then, in the portfolio page domready event, load the SmoothScroll object, check for the presence of the cookie, scroll to the #blogg anchor if it exists, and remove the cookie.
