Managed Extensibility Framework (MEF) vs. Composite UI Application Block (CAB)

We are currently looking at either using CAB or MEF for our next application. I didn't see any examples on codeplex of how event brokering is handled for sibling control communication, maybe I missed it. How does inter-control communication work in MEF? Also, we are planning on using Infragistics which has provided additional components for the CAB framework. How well will Infragistics controls integrate into MEF? Overall, is MEF worth pursuing for a decently large, 15,000 hours of strictly development, application?
