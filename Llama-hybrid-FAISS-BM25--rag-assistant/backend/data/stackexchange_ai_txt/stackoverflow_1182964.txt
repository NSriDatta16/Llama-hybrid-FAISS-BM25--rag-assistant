How to process an object literal?

I am new to Javascript and trying to extract some text stored in an object. The object is defined as an object literal and is passed to a function in a Javascript script that calls the function. The script (and object) have this structure: foo({ "query": { "count": "2", "created": "2009-07-25T08:17:54Z", "lang": "en-US", }, "results": { "result": [ { "abstract": " Pizza HutÂ®. Order Online for Delivery or Carry-out. Fast &amp; Easy.", "title": " Pizza Hut" }, { "abstract": "Official site of Domino's Pizza delivery chain, which offers thin crust, deep dish, and hand tossed pizzas with a variety of side items and beverages. Site ... ", "title": "Domino's Pizza " } ] } } }); The object is passed to to a callback function named "foo": function foo(o){ var out = document.getElementById('container'); out.innerHTML = o.query.count; } My Problem: I know how to print out the query count variable using the callback function above, but I don't know how to print out the the title of the first result in the results array. How can I change the callback function to display the first result title? And also, is there a foreach statement, where I could print out all the titles from all the results? Thanks!
