Graphic representation of averages

I have a series of averages. One of these however turns out to take too high a value due to a N. low equal to 1. Let me explain better by means of an example: I have to calculate the averages of the fishing days for each month for a sample n. of fishermen. Now in May it appears that only 1 fisherman went fishing. Therefore, compared to the other months, the data is very different only because in that month there is only 1 respondent. Representing this data on a boxplot could lead to misunderstandings. -What to do in these cases? -Enter the data or not? -Insert a table (legend) with the number of "respondents" (fishermen) by choosing a minimum number of data is reported with an asterisk? -Is there anything in literature that could help me?
