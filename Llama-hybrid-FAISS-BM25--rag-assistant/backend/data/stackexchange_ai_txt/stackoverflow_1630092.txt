token parsing in java

I have created a file with printStream object as shown below. PrintStream outPutOffice = new PrintStream( new BufferedOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(inDir+"/Office.txt"))); outPutOffice.print(fValue + (findx Now I have to read it content and separate it tokens with "|" as I have written token with "|" separated. I have write code as shown below it will read line correctly but not separate token with "|" character. BufferedReader inPutAgent = new BufferedReader( new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream(inDir+"/Office.txt"))); String column=inPutAgent.readLine(); String []columnDetail = column.split("|"); columndetail array contains single character in each index instead i want single token in each index. What is the problem?
