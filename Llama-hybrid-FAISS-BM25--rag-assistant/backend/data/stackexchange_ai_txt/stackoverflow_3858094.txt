Your float approach was a good start: you need to remove the whole number which gives you a fraction representing time of day. Average that, change back to datetime. To use this, ignore the "01 jan 1900" and take the time bit as your average select name, Reference1, CAST(AVG(CAST(CompletedTime AS float) - CAST(CompletedTime AS int)) AS datetime) From tblOrderRouteStops where Name not like 'Cta%' and Reference1 <> '000000' and Name <> '' and CompletedTime is not Null Group By name, Reference1
