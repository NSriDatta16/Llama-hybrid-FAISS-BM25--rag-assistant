I find myself in the same dilemma often and try to make myself learn a new technology or a new language. But most of the times, unless your employer demands it, you are not going to be doing much with that piece of technology or anything useful with that language. You will end up writing a bunch of little programs useful to learn the features of the language and try out some cool advertised bits. And more often than not you are trying to convince yourself that the new language is trying to do what you did with your old language in a better way. And in trying to adopt this functionality I forget to use the language for what it is good for. Eventually, two things happen -- The new way is better than my old way, because it saves on a few lines of code. But I am still doing the old things with the new packaging. OR The new features suck, I'll stick to the old ways and flame all propaganda creators. :) But that learning was essential in some cases. And sooner or later you begin to gain an intuition about what will probably take off and what won't once you've done this drill a couple of times. So it does help to stay updated, at least there will be a lot of commentary on the internet to help you out in this regard. But always remember, learning technology is easier than learning to program.
