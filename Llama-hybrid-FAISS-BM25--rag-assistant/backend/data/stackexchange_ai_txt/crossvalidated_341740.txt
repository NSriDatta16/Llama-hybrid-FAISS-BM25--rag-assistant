Handling missing data for a neural network

I'm training a regression NN to generate insurance premiums. I have training data which consists of various metrics about the individuals. The problem is, quite often the dataset is incomplete, for example, I may not know whether the individual smokes, it's just missing data, but for others I do have that data, but in both cases I know what their premium was. I'd say a considerable portion, maybe 75% is missing at least one item of data across the whole spectrum of what I'll be providing. I'm not sure how best to handle it? The only thing I could think is if the data is missing then I set it to the zero variance of the normalised data? i.e. it's neutral and has no impact positive or negative? Any other ideas? Many thanks
