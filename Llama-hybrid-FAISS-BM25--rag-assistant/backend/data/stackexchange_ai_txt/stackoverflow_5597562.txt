Attribute specifier error in LINQ to XML / Excel / XDocument code

I'm trying to use LINQ to XML to create an Excel spreadsheet. I created a template spreadsheet, exported it to XML, pasted the XML into my code and then began to edit it. When I try to create a set of XElements using LINQ, I get these errors: The first squiggle under says "attribute specifier is not a complete statement" The second under ss says "'>' expected" The third under Type says "'Type' is a type and cannot be used in an expression" Ignore the error under "Lot 1..." I will be putting an expression hole there. The squiggle under says "Identifier expected" I have all of the Import statements that I should need for this code. Any suggestions why these errors arise?
