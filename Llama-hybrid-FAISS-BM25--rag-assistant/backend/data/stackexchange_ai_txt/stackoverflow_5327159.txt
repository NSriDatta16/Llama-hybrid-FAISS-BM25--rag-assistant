DotNetNuke - Allowing users to save their credentials in their browser

The default behavior of a DNN installation is to prevent users from saving their account credentials in their browser. I believe this is done by changing the ID of the credential input controls on the login page(s), but I am not sure. Is there a setting or common method for fixing this so that users can save their credentials? Edit: I'm not talking about the separate issue of whether a user's session is "remembered" by clicking "remember me". I'm just referring to enabling web browsers' login/pw storage. It can't be too horrible to enable if Amazon allows it.
