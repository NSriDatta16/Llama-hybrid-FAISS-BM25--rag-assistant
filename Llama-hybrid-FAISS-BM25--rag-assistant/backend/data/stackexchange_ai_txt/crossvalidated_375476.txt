You know that the conditional mean of the dependent variable in a probit model is $$E[y=1 \vert x,z]=\Phi(\alpha + \beta \cdot x +z \cdot \pi).$$ This is also you predicted probability, $\Pr(y=1 \vert x,z)$ . Here $\Phi(.)$ is the standard normal cdf, and $\varphi(.)$ is is the standard normal pdf, which will be used below. The standard elasticity formula is $$ \epsilon = \frac{\partial E[y \vert x,z]}{\partial x} \cdot \frac{x}{E[y \vert x, z]}$$ The marginal effect for a continuous variable $x$ in a probit model is $$\frac{\partial E[y=1 \vert x,z]}{\partial x}=\varphi(\alpha + \beta \cdot x +z \cdot \pi)\cdot \beta .$$ This comes from applying the chain rule for derivatives to the expectation and the fact that $\varphi()$ is the derivative of $\Phi()$ . You can plug that in for the first term in the elasticity formula. The denominator in the second term is just the predicted probability. For a discrete $z$ , a semi-elasticity makes more sense (percent change in probability when $z$ goes from 0 to 1). You can approximate a small percentage change in the probability by taking differences of logged predictions with $z$ set to one less the prediction with $z$ set to zero: $$\ln \Phi(\alpha + \beta \cdot x +1 \cdot \pi) - \ln \Phi(\alpha + \beta \cdot x +0 \cdot \pi).$$ Some people multiply this by 100 to convert to percent. For both the elasticity and the semi-elasticity, you can average these in some sample or calculate them at representative/interesting values of the covariates. You can also plot curves or surfaces of these functions.
