Replace this: global storage_i storage_i = i With this: birdofprey.storage_i = i You also have a typo at line 75: storage_ii = stroage_i + storage_ii ( stroage_i was intended to be storage_i ) This line should actually be: storage_ii = birdofprey.storage_i + storage_ii EDIT : Also, without having looked closely at it, your use of a class attribute (storage_i) looks like it's susceptible to race conditions. Consider using mutexes to guard accesses to that attribute. I think you also need to wait for the threads to finish executing before you can access the values. But I'm not sure if a global (or class attribute) is really what you want. I think what you really want is a thread-local variable that you can access after the thread has finished (see the Thread.join method.) If I'm reading that correctly, then forget what I wrote above about mutexes. Instead, set the storage_i attribute as self.storage_i (creating a separate instance for each thread.) Then in the for loop where you're summing the values, access the value as urlv.storage_i . Again, it looks like it's important that you perform a join on each thread before you try to access its values. That's all the help I can offer for now; perhaps tomorrow morning (my time) I can check in again.
