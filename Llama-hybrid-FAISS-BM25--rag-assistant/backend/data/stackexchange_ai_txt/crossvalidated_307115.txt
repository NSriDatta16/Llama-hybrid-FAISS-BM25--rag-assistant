It depends on what sort of model you're using. I imagine that if your predictions are coming out as probabilities then you're using a logistic regression such as: $Pr[\text{Student Evades School}|\vec{x}] = \frac{1}{1-\text{Exp}[\beta_0 + \sum\limits_{i=1}^n \beta_i x_i]}$ Where the $x_i$ are your predictor variables. The simplest way to assess the relative predictive-ness of different $x_i$ is to consider the magnitude of the $\beta_i$. When the coefficients are large, this means that small changes in the corresponding variable produce big changes in the predicted probability. This would be a good approach if you wanted to, for example, find the variable that best reduced the probability of truancy. Note that the sign of the $\beta_i$ reflects what an increase in $x_i$ will do to the probability; negative coefficients mean increasing the variable will decrease the probability. Keep in mind that you will need to combine this information with the specific predictor variable values for a given predictor. If $\beta_{10}$ is way bigger than every other $\beta_i$, but for specific prediction $x_{10} = 0$ then you will need to look for the next biggest $\beta_i$ and so on.
