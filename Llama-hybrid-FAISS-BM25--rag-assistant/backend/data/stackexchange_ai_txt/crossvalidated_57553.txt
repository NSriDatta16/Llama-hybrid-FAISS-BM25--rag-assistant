After centering, interactions' effects got reversed. It was not fixed by reversing the dependent variable. What should I do?

In a binary logistic regression, I centered all the independent variables (binaries, continuous, dependent, independent, all [I have 5 IVs: three binary and two ordinal]). Multicollineariy was eliminated. But all the effects got reversed. I could manually fix the report (by switching every + to a minus and vice versa in beta values) and in odds ratios, by dividing 1 by each odds ratio. But I didn't know if Wald values remained the same? So I reversed the zeros and ones of the dependent variable in order to simultaneously reverse again all the once-reversed betas (and fix them). Ok IV betas are now fixed. However, their interactions remain in the opposite direction! It seems that the interactions' directions depend on the IVs, and have apparently nothing to do with the dependent variable. I think I should temporarily reverse all the signs of the centered IVs so the beta signs for the interactions (and their odds ratios) get what should be. But in that case, the betas for the main variables would be again reversed! But I don't know if it is valid? Can I rely on such a model, in which the signs of betas are correct for the interactions, but reversed for main variables, Or a model in which main variables are correct but interactions are reversed? Perhaps I should reverse centered IVs together with the DV, in the hopes that betas get fixed for both IVs and their interactions. Do you have any solutions in mind? I would appreciate.
