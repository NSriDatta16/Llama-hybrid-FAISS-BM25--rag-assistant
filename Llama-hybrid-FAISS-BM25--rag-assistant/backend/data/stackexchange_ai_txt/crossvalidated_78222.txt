Python is today very well suited for Data Analysis, Machine Learning and related fields. Please refer to packages such as: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/ http://pandas.pydata.org/ Answering the question, you should not invest time learning R for the moment if you already know Python, that's my opinion.
