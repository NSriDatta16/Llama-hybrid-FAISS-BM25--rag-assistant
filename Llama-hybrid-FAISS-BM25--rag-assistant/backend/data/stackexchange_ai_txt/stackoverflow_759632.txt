Creating a factory for which can support both real object & a NullObject

I want to create a factory which will create a smack XMPPConnection. The factory should return the real XMPPConnection or a NullObject if the connection could not be made. However smack's XMPPConnection is a concrete class. It does not implement any interfaces, so I can't use java dynamic proxy API to proxy the sucker. I could extend the XMPPConnection but that's not very elegant. Are there any other options ? Note that the factory must never return a null !
