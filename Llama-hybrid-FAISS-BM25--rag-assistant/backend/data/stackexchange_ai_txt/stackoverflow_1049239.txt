SpreadsheetGear for .NET can read workbooks while Excel has them open. Here is the code we use to do it (note that we lock the entire file after opening to keep Excel or any other app from writing while we are in the middle of reading): stream = new System.IO.FileStream(path, System.IO.FileMode.Open, System.IO.FileAccess.Read, System.IO.FileShare.ReadWrite, SG.CompoundDocumentIO.Storage.OpenBufferLength); try { stream.Lock(0, stream.Length); } catch { // .NET 1.1 requires cast to IDisposable ((IDisposable)stream).Dispose(); throw; } Disclaimer: I own SpreadsheetGear LLC
