Unstructured Text to Structured Data

I am looking for references (tutorials, books, academic literature) concerning structuring unstructured text in a manner similar to the google calendar quick add button. I understand this may come under the NLP category, but I am interested only in the process of going from something like "Levi jeans size 32 A0b293" to: Brand: Levi, Size: 32, Category: Jeans, code: A0b293 I imagine it would be some combination of lexical parsing and machine learning techniques. I am rather language agnostic but if pushed would prefer python, Matlab or C++ references Thanks
