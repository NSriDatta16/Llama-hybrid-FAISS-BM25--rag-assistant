Following Nikolas answer, I did the following. The mz values (mass/electric charge) range from 102 up to 999 (atomic units). So I have ~900 values for each treatment * 4 treatments = 3600 columns. db This produced a matrix m with lots of NAs. So I used the Bray-Curtis distance, which is more appropriate for tables with lots of empty spaces (first I turned all NAs to zeros). install.packages('vegan') library(vegan) m2 Another approach was to group columns in groups of 10. So all mz from 110.0 up to 119.99 became 11. m3
