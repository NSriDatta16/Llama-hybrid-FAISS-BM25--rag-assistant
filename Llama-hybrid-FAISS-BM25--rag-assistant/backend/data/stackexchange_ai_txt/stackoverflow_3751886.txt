You should definitely consider splitting the data by site across databases or schemas - this not only makes it much easier to backup, drop etc an individual site/client but also eliminates much of the hassle of making sure no customer can see any other customers data by accident or poor coding etc. It also means it is easier to make choices about partitionaing, over and above databae table-level partitioning for time or client etc. Also you said that the data volume is 1 million rows per day (that's not particularly heavy and doesn't require huge grunt power to log/store, nor indeed to report (though if you were genererating 500 reports at midnight you might logjam). However you also said that some sites had 1m visitors daily so perhaps you figure is too conservative? Lastly you didn't say if you want real-time reporting a la chartbeat/opentracker etc or cyclical refresh like google analytics - this will have a major bearing on what your storage model is from day one.
