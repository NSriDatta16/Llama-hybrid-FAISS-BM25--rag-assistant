Something that various people are pointing out is that the vectors $(1,1)$, $(2,2)$, or $(-1,-1)$ all represent the same line. When you find an eigenvector, what's uniquely determined is the line, not the actual vector. An eigenvector for a matrix (linear transformation) $A$ is defined as any vector $\mathbf{v} \neq \mathbf{0}$ which satisfies: $$A \mathbf{v} = \lambda \mathbf{v}$$ If $\mathbf{v}$ is an eigenvector, any scalar multiple $\hat{\mathbf{v}} = \alpha \mathbf{v}$ will also work ($\alpha \neq 0$): \begin{align*} A \mathbf{v} = \lambda \mathbf{v}\quad & \Leftrightarrow \quad \alpha A \mathbf{v} = \alpha \lambda \mathbf{v} \\ & \Leftrightarrow \quad A\hat{\mathbf{v}} = \lambda \hat{\mathbf{v}} \end{align*} Eg. Choose $\alpha = -1$. If $\mathbf{v}$ is an eigenvector, so is $-\mathbf{v}$. Let's say your PCA algorithm guarantees you that $\|\mathbf{v}\| = 1$. You still have two possibilities because if you take the intersection of a line through the origin and the unit circle, you get two points. In this example, whether you have $\mathbf{v} = (\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2},\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2})$ or $\mathbf{v} = (-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2},-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2})$, it really doesn't matter. A fun example of flipping the sign on basis vectors: upside down map Instead of a map where the y-axis measures how far north and the x-axis measures how far east, you could just as easily have a map where the y-axis measures how far south and the x-axis measures how far west. Up and down would still be aligned with the magnetic axis.
