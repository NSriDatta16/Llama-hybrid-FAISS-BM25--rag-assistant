In one of Robert Glass's recent books (I'll have to look up the reference) he mentioned a study on the cost of well maintained code. What they found is that well maintained code was edited more often than poorly maintained code. That sounds counter intuitive but when they dug deeper the discovered the reason: Well maintained code has more features added to it in the same time frame than poorly maintained code. Does your Boss like features? Sure, they all do. If more you improve the maintainability of the code, the more features you will be able to deliver with that limited budget.
