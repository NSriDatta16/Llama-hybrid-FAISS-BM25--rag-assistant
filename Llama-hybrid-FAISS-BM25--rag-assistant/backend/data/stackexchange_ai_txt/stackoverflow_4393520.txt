Is there a way to make a "ghost cursor" in any language?

The term "ghost cursor" is a bit confusing; what I mean is a mouse cursor that isn't controlled by the user, but is created and completely under the control of a program. That means that there are now 2 cursors on the screen, instead of just one. Is the concept of having more than 1 cursor on the screen possible? If it is, what are the ways/what is the way to make it happen? The programming language doesn't really matter to me, as what can be done in one language can most likely be reproduced in another. In case you were wondering what this is for, it's actually just for general knowledge and of course the awesome idea of having more than one cursor. Thanks very much in advance. Edit : To all the answerers as of yet - You all gave nice examples, but they don't quite hit the spot. The new cursor is to be a new cursor on the screen of the client, and that cursor behaves like a regular cursor; except that it's controlled by the program. It's not a replacement for the existing cursor or an image. It's a component that can left click and right click, move about the screen, drag and drop and everything else.
