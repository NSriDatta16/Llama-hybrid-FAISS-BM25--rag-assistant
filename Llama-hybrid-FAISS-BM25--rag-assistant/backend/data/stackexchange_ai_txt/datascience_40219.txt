pandas: how to change the specific column as index and change index into various columns

Hi I'm new to data science. Learning data science from course-era. I'm having pandas data frame as follows, time value A 9 5 A 8 4 A 7 3 B 9 3 B 8 2 B 7 1 C 9 3 C 8 2 C 7 1 I want to convert this as , A B C 9 5 3 3 8 4 2 2 7 3 1 1 As I start to write query for this, it is getting complicated. Is there any easy way to do this? Thanks for the help.
