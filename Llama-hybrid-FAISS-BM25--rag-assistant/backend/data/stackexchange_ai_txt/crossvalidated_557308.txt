This reminds me of modeling the futures curve (or the forward curve). There is a large academic literature on that. You will find both journal articles and textbook chapters if you look for it. If we were not to involve any subject-matter theory, one option would be to use a VAR model on transformed data. You would define a time series of one-month-ahead prices: the price of February delivery in January followed by the price of March delivery in February followed by ... You would do that for two-months-ahead prices: the price of March delivery in January followed by the price of April delivery in February followed by ... You would do that for several more months, so you get a bunch of time series that have a shared time index. (If some series start a bit earlier than others or end a bit later than others, you could discard the ends that are sticking out so that the time index is shared among all series.) These could be modelled by a VAR model, possibly allowing for cointegration (so there would be a VEC representation of the model).
