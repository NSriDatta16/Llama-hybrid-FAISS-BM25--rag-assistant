A .NET object has no persistance unless you write it yourself - for example by serializing to a file in the user's profile (or isolated storage for ClickOnce). Note: personally, I wouldn't use DataSet at all in this scenario; if you are downloading the data as a list of objects, then just keep them like that - List etc. Re xml: 9-10Mb is big but not immense. It really depends on the nature of the data and other requirements; unless you are already using web-compression (GZIP etc), you might find that the data transfers quicker with a more compact format, such as csv, or a binary format such as protocol buffers .
