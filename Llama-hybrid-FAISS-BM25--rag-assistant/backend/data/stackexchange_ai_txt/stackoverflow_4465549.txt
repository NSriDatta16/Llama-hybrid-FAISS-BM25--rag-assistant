It's quite difficult (but not impossible) to create such a result set dynamically in MySQL as it doesn't yet support any of recursive CTEs , CONNECT BY , or generate_series that I would use to do this in other databases. Here's an alternative approach you can use. Create and prepopulate a table containing all the possible rows from some date far in the past to some date far in the future. Then you can easily generate the result you need by querying this table with a WHERE clause, using an index to make the query efficient. The drawbacks of this approach are quite obvious: It takes up storage space unnecessarily. If you query outside of the range that you populated your table with you won't get any results, which means that you will either have to populate the table with enough dates to last the lifetime of your application or else you need a script to add more dates every so often.
