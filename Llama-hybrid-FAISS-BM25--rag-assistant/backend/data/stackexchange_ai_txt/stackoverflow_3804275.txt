It happens when Xcode doesn't recognize your certificate. It's just a pain in the ass to solve it, there are a lot of possibilities to help you. But the first thing you should try is removing in the "Window" tab => Organizer, the provisioning that is in your device. Then re-add them (download them again on the apple website). And try to compile again. By the way, did you check in the Project Info Window the "code signing identity" ? Good Luck.
