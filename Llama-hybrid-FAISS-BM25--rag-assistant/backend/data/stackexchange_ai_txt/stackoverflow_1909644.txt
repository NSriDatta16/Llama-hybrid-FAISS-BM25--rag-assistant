Vista/Win7 Bass and treble volume

I'm having a hard time with this crazy Vista/Win 7 architecture, it might be just me but its hard to get used to it :| So, my current problem is that I cant set the bass and treble values for my sound card, I found that there is a IAudioBass and IAudioTreble interfaces which can do this, but I'm getting lost how to create these interfaces, I know that I can use the IPart interface to activate them, but it doesnt work, and I guess I'm doing something wrong. I started to do this in Delphi, but the header conversion took too much time and I just switched to Visual C++ to do it. Does anyone have some demo source code ? Thanks a lot for your attention folks !
