Actually you can merge two different DL model into a big one. I'm using Keras+Tensorflow for deep learning, and there's an example about models with multiple inputs(outputs). In this example, tweets are fed into a RNN, while the extra data are fed into a fully-connected layer along with the output of this RNN.
