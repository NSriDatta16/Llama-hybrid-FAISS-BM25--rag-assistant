Addresses stored in SQL server have many small variations(errors)

I have a table in my database which stores packing slips and their information. I'm trying to query that table and get each unique address. I've come close, but I still have many near misses and I'm looking for a way to exclude these near duplicates from my select. Sample Data CompanyCode CompanyName Addr1 City State Zip 10033 UNITED DIE CUTTING & FINISHIN 3610 HAMILTON AVE CLEVELAND Ohio 44114 10033 UNITED DIE CUTTING & FINISHING 3610 HAMILTON AVE CLEVELAND Ohio 44114 10033 UNITED DIE CUTTING & FINISHING 3610 HAMILTON AVE. CLEVELAND Ohio 44114 10033 UNITED DIE CUTTING & FINISHING 3610 HAMILTON AVENUE CLEVELAND Ohio 44114 10033 UNITED DIECUTTING & FINISHING 3610 HAMILTON AVE CLEVELAND Ohio 44144 10033 UNITED FINISHING 3610 HAMILTON AVE CLEVLAND Ohio 44114 10033 UNITED FINISHING & DIE CUTTING 3610 HAMILTON AVE CLEVELAND Ohio 44114 And all I want is 1 record. Is there some way I can get the "Average" record? Meaning, if most of the records say CLEVELAND instead of CLEVLAND, I want my 1 record to say CLEVELAND. Is there any way to par this data down to what I'm looking for? Desired Output CompanyCode CompanyName Addr1 City State Zip 10033 UNITED DIE CUTTING & FINISHING 3610 HAMILTON AVE CLEVELAND Ohio 44114
