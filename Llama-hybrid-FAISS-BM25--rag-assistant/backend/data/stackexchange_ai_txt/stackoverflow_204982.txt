Here is my less that elegant solution to the problem.. You will need access to a php server. The feed needs to be tranformed into RSS from atom, and there is a really good xsl stylesheet here that fits the bill: http://atom.geekhood.net/ , specifically: http://atom.geekhood.net/atom2rss.xsl There is one element in the feed that VS seems not to like: to get around this, go to the end of the stylesheet and comment out the following copy like I have done: Unknown element --> Now create a php file on your php server with the following content: loadXML($content); $sheet = new DOMDocument(); $sheet->load('atom2rss.xsl'); $processor = new XSLTProcessor(); $processor->registerPHPFunctions(); $processor->importStylesheet($sheet); $result = $processor->transformToXML($chan); echo $result; ?> Now move the atom2rss.xsl file to the same dir as the php file you created.. Now in VS you can add the new starpage url as: http://yourserver.com/file.php?http://stackoverflow/feeds Where yourserver.com is your domain and file.php is the file with the php content from above... Then you should be able to enjoy the RSS feed from Stackoverflow.com in you start page in Visual Studio, that is of course if you are into that kind of thing.. This assumes you are running PHP5 and have the php_curl.dll and php_xsl.dll enabled on the server.. Enjoy
