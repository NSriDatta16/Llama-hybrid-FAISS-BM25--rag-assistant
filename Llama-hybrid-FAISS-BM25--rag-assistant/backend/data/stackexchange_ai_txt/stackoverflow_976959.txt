This doesn't do what you asked for, but it probably does what you want. You can modify your .bashrc (or equivalent shell init file) to set your prompt based on whether you're using ssh or not. i.e. put something like: if [ -n $SSH_TTY ]; then export PS1=`echo -en '\033[42m\w\$ '`; fi; at the end of your .bashrc file on the remote machine. the \033[42m is an ANSI Escape Code that changes the background colour to green. This way, the background colour of your terminal will be green (or magenta, or cyan, or whatever) only when you're logged in to a remote machine.
