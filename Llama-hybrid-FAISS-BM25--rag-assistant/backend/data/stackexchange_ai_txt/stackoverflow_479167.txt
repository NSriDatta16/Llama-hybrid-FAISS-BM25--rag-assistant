blurry font in silverlight2 app

I did my first Silverlight 2 application and what annoys be is that text-fonts looks blurry or ragged. You can see it here: alt text http://img516.imageshack.us/img516/1444/blurryfonthp3.png Is that a 'feature' of SL or I'm doing something wrong? I know that SL2 uses a few fancy techniques to make applications device-independed but this fonts aren't acceptable (i'm using Vista with Aero ). The bonus question: is there any reference business application in SL2? Best regards, Tomasz
