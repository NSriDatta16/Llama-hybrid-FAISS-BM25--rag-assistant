E_ALL would should all the error and warning and notice - everything E_NOTICE is a special error level, showing things that won't produce error but are not good or gonna be obsolete in future release of PHP. The notice error level is meant to encourage best practices. Also it should be error_reporting(E_ALL ^ E_NOTICE); to report everything except notice. You are advice during development to set the error reporting to E_ALL and fix all the notice errors. a look in the manual would give much more details.
