From the documentation ( :help macvim-drag ): Dragging files and dropping them on a window opens those files in tabs in that window, unless Vim is in command-line mode. In command-line mode the names of the files are added to the command line. Holding down modifier keys whilst dragging is not supported. If a file is dropped on the Dock icon, it is always opened in a new tab regardless of the mode Vim is currently in. The same holds if you double-click on a file in the Finder. The "Open files from applications" preference in the General preference pane gives more options on how dropped files should open, in case tabs are not desired.
