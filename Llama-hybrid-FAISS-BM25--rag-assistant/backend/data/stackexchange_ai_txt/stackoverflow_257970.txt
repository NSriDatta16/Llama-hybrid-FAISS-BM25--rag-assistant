Defragging to the point that there are absolutely no gaps is not necessarily a good thing. Some OSs/FileSystems try to pack files in as tightly as possible and fill without gaps where possible. The problem with this is if any of the earlier files get changed or appended to then you are either leaving an early gap (which will tend to case fragments) or forcing the extra bit to be entered at the next gap (creating a fragment again). Defrag when you start getting weird behaviour (quite often it helps... even though it is not supposed to); however you don't need to do it every day, nor is a totally defragmented drive a sign of a particularly health drive.
