Creating a context menu on drag complete in WPF

I am working on a node-graph-view similar to Maya's HyperGraph in which I can connect Nodes with drag and drop. Because the target-node can have several Inputs, I want to create a temporary ContextMenu to select the input as suggesting in the following mock-up: http://www.pixtur.org/images/uploaded/0000/0696/large.jpg I tried for quite a time to trigger the creation or opening of a context-menu. It looks like the Win32 TrackPopupMenu does roughly, what I'm looking for. Is there an WPF / C# equivalent? Thanks pixtur
