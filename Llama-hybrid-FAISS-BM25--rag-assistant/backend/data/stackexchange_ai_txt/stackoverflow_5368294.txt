Translating complex logic to MySQL CASE statement

I'm having translating the following logic into a MySQL CASE statement, I'm sure there is an elegant way to do it but I think I have been working on for way too long and confused my self! The business rules: Programmes have an programme_start and programme_end Individuals have an attend_start and attend_end Individuals attend multiple programmes during one period, they can only have one of the following example attendance spans: What I need to do is categorise each span into a category type i.e. Type 1 ... 9. but I'm having trouble building up a CASE statement that can mutually exclusively cover each span. Has anyone done something like this before? If not could someone help with the logic behind it? Thanks in advance!
