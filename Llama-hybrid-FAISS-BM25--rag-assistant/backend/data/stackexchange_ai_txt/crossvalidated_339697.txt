Stick-breaking construction of Dirichlet process

In the stick-breaking construction of Dirichlet (let me base things on Sethuraman's construction - slide 6 of this ) do we sample one $\phi$ vector from the base distribution $H$ and use it for sampling $\phi_k$ at each step $k$? This is what I "think" they actually do. But I am puzzled, as in their paper they mention $H$ is a symmetric Dirichlet distribution over the vocabulary (see the third paragraph of section 2 of this ). Which means the dimensionality of $\phi$ would be the size of the vocabulary. Then it is not clear how the index $k$ of $\phi_k$s are mapped to the index of $\beta_k$s. Basically sampling $\beta_k$ will stop if no more stick is left, which means the $k$ index of $\beta_k$ can potentially be much smaller than the size of the $\phi$ vector of size $|\text{Vocabulary}|$ sampled from $H$. My guess is that they first sample $\phi_k$s, but all they keep from the sample is its corresponding index in $\phi$. Then the sampled $\beta_k$ is just a weight associated with that index. This ways it is clear what each $\beta_k$ corresponds to.
