How do I move and Image View while program is running

So I have an ImageView sitting on a FrameLayout. I want to move this image view when user taps on it and drags it somewhere. This is what I tried to do: FrameLayout.LayoutParameters params = new FrameLayout.LayoutParams(WRAP_CONTENT, WRAP_CONTENT); params.setMargin(marginLeft, marginTop, 0, 0); view.setLayoutParams(params); This does not work however. The imageView does not move. Do I need to refresh the view somehow after I set new layout parameters?
