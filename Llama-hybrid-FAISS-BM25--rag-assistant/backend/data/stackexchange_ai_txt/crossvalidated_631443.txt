Having trouble with my analysis. I have no one to ask. I thought I would post here

I performed an experiment where I shocked fish eggs at different times prior to first cellular cleavage, this was to create tetraploid fish larvae. I have a control group and then 9 treatments (60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, and 100% of the cellular cleavage). All treatment groups were conducted in triplicate, a total of 30 experimental units. To analyze, I collected ploidy from ten larvae in each experimental unit. Then I created a table with two columns, "treatment" and "tetraploid." The "tetraploid" column was populated with the percent of tetraploids sampled from each experimental unit. I then checked for normality and homogeneity of variances, the data was not normal, and variances were not homogenous. I arcsine transformed the percent data and still it was not normal, and variances were not homogenous. I then ran a Kruskal.test, and found that the P-value was 0.012. However, when I ran a Dunn's post hoc test (bonferroni method) none of the treatment groups were significantly different from each other. What makes me most confused is that I have one treatment group that is 100% tetraploid. Why isnt this group statistically different from the controls (controls are 0% tetraploid)?? I have never asked a question on these forums, but I reference them all the time, because R and statistics are very challenging for me. I have seen that this "significant Kruskal, insignificant Dunn's" is a thing that happens. I guess I just want some help determining if there is a better was to analyze this data. Or for someone to help me interpret the results that I am getting from the Kruskal/Dunn's.
