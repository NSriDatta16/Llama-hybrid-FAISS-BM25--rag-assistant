MCMC stands for "Markov chain Monte Carlo". There are two aspects to how long you will run your MCMC sampler: one for the Markov chain and one for the Monte Carlo part. Markov chain : Like user2974951 wrote in their comment, usually there is a burn-in or "warm-up" period, where you can't necessarily give your Markov chain a good starting value, so your chain takes time to get to areas of high probability. This part may be ignored and thrown away, since the samples are not representative of the distribution. However, if you have a strong knowledge of the areas of high probability, you can start your Markov chain from a point in that area, in which case a "warm-up" is not essential. In any case, this part does not factor into the sampling. Monte Carlo : To answer your question, I would need to know more about what you're using your samples for. But generally, if you're doing MCMC, samples are used for Monte Carlo averages. That is, if your target distribution is $\pi$ , and you're using MCMC to estimate $E_{\pi}g = \int g(x) \pi(dx)$ , then from a Markov chain sample $X_1, \dots, X_n \sim \pi$ , the Monte Carlo estimator of $E_{\pi}g$ is $$\dfrac{1}{n} \sum_{t=1}^{n} g(X_t)\,. $$ That is a true average is estimated by a sample average. Now the question is, if you're given a distribution, and given samples from that distribution, then are 10 samples enough to estimate the mean of the distribution relatively well? The answer is almost unequivocally, no. 10 samples from the target distribution is nearly not enough, let alone the fact that MCMC gives you "corrupt" samples, since they are correlated. To understand how many samples after "burn-in" you may need, read this post and my answer there.
