@Supyxy a better approach for movie recommendations would be to use a neural network approach based on abstract features generated after analyzing the movie database (factors for generating those features could be keywords | people's ratings | director's name | actors, etc). A sample open source movie recommendation engine is provided by the Filmaster project. You can read about it on the wiki: http://filmaster.org/display/DEV/New+recommendation+engine and get the code from the bitbucket repository: http://bitbucket.org/filmaster/filmaster-test/src/tip/count_recommendations.cpp But answering the problem you have in your current solution, if further query optimization fails, I would add some more redundancy into data be storing references to similar films for each film (computing could be done lazily or in a cron job daily as those values should not change often).
