TL DR: Don't do any variable selection and don't do any adjustment for multiple comparisons. Longer answer: Regarding adjustments for multiple comparisons in general, I like what Jacob Cohen said, many years ago: This is a subject about which reasonable people may differ. But regarding your particular problem, you wrote I want to extract from each model the significant predictors for each PCA component and also 4 predictors of interest and age and gender to adjust for so my recommendation (provided that you have a reasonable sized sample) is to not extract certain predictors. Why not? First: You have a strong a priori hypothesis. Stick with it. This is the best situation to be in. Second: For your variables of interest, you are interested in them, whether they are significant or not. You didn't give us context, but, with variables of interest, finding a small effect can often be as important as finding a big one (and never mind all the problems with significance). Finding a small effect would be surprising and, as my favorite prof in grad school said: If you're not surprised, you haven't learned anything. Third: For age and sex (I'm guessing it is sex, not gender) these are variables you want to adjust for. That is important whether or not they are significant. They may have big effects on the other parameter estimates. Or they might not. But that might also be surprising and interesting. And the other benefit is that, with these a priori hypotheses, I think you can make a strong case for not adjusting at all.
