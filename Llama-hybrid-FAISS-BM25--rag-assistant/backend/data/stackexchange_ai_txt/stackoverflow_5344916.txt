you should use this form in dealloc: [entryTextField1 release], entryTextField1 = nil; you should use this form to set (e.g. in viewDidUnload ): self.entryTextField1 = nil; running static analysis should catch a few more issues. fix them. once all that is corrected, then re-run the app. (i assume that will not be 100% coverage) also, make sure you use version control. you will find yourself hunting down a lot of issues - until they are all sorted out, you should expect more issues/crashes along the way. unfortunately, you can't avoid memory issues forever, and it is painful to track some of them down --while learning proper memory management at the same time (iow, the hard way). good luck!
