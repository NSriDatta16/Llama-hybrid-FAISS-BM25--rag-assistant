The approach is advocate in RWH ch 11 and in XMonad is approximately: State all properties of the system in QuickCheck Show test coverage with HPC. Confirm space behavior with heap profiling . Confirm thread/parallel behavior with ThreadScope . Confirm microbenchmark behavior with Criterion . Once your major invariants are established via QuickCheck, you can start refactoring, moving those tests into type invariants. Practices to support your efforts: Run a simplified QuickCheck regression on every commit. Publish HPC coverage details.
