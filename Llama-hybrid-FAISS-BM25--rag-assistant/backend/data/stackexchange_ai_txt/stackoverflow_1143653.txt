During my adventures of designing class structures, I’ve noticed that it’s very helpful to start with writing some pseudo-code. That means: I start with “writing” some general fragments of application’s code on a highest level, play with it, and discover the elements that are appearing – in fact, the elements that I – as a programmer – would like to use. It’s a very good starting point for designing general structure of modules and their interactions. After few iterations the whole structure starts to look more like a full system of classes. It’s a very flexible way to design parts of code. You can call it a programmer-oriented design.
