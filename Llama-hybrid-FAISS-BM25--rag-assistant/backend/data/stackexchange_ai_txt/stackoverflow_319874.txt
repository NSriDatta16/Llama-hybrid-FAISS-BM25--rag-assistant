Know of SSO turnkey Appliance with ldap, radius, openid, etc?

I'm helping a typical small company that started with a couple of outsourced systems (google apps, svn/trac). added an internal jabber server (ejabber for mostly iChat clients). subscribes to a couple of webservices (e.g. highrisehq). and has a vpn service provided by a pfsense freebsd firewall. And the net result of all this is that they're drowning in passwords and accounts. It seems that if they had a single unified login / single signon service they could go a long way to combining these. E.g.: ldap as the master repository, radius linked to it for vpn, ejabber and even WPA2 wireless access, plugins for google app sign on, and perhaps an openid server for external websites like highrisehq. It seems that all these tools exist separately, but does anyone know of a single box that combines them with a nice GUI and auto-updates? (e.g. like pfsense/m0n0wall for firewalls, freeNAS for storage). It doesn't have to be FOSS. A paid box would be fine too. I figure this must exist. Microsoft's Active Directory is likely one solution but they'd rather avoid Windows if possible. There seem to be various "AAA" servers that ISPs use or for enterprise firewall/router management, but that doesn't seem quite right. Any obvious solutions I'm missing? Thanks!
