NMDS with ecological data containing many zeros in R - data transformations

I am trying to perform NMDS metaMDs() on mixed taxonomic data in R. My taxa data is organized with rows as observations and columns as different taxa. These data contain many zeros. I found that transforming my data using decostand(method="total") or decostand(method="wisconsin") causes my NMDS to throw a warning of a stress value of nearly zero. Are there any recommendations, other transformations, or other ordination techniques I can try to work with data like these? My environmental data that I am trying to fit to the NMDS result contains a mix of factor and numeric variables.
