It would probably be best if you split the storage of your percent data into two different fields if possible. But this will do what you're looking for, I believe. I split it into two functions - "convertPercentageDataToDecimal" extracts the percent from your data and converts it to a decimal, then "convertPercentageDataToDecimal" simply multiplies the price by the percent.
