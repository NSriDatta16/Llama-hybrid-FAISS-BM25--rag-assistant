Joan, while it is certainly possible to develop an applications Front End in C# and the logic in C++ I believe it to be a huge waste of effort to do it this way since you only complicate yourself for no real benefit since you can code both things in the same language. C# has many advantages over C++ and I personally use mostly C#, but I can clearly see many programmers who love C++. Now going into your question regarding the similarities between C++ and C# the answer is yes and no. Yes in the sense that C#'s syntax is clearly derived from C++. Many things like ifs and for loops are written exactly the same, so if you know how to write an if in C++ you can write it in C#. The difference (and a critical one that is) lies in the way the languages work. C++ is an strictly compiled language (it goes from C++ code to machine code). C# is an interpreted language (it goes from c# to MSIL and during runtime to machine code). In C# you can't use pointer arithmetic without explicitly allowing, in C++ you can (and will) use pointer arithmetic. C# has garbage collection, C++ does not. In the end, as I said in the first paragraph you can use both languages to build an application, but it would be highly complicated. My advise to you is to learn a bit of C# and then decide which language you would prefer to build your GUI application. But don't believe even for a second that C++ can't be used to build a front-end since there are a myriad of frameworks for that. One I remember from the top of my head is Qt . Another option for you is to use "C++/CLI" which is a flavor of C++ which can use the .NET Framework (the same framework C# uses) EDIT: Thanks Jerry for pointing out that Managed C++ is obsolete and that C++/CLI is the one!
