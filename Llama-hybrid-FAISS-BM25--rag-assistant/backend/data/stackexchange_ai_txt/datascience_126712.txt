How to decide your first self-project for Data Science/Analysis

Suppose a complete beginner(in the field of data analysis/data science), which is my case indeed, decided to make a project for his/her resume. These are the following skills he have learnt: Python(pandas, NumPy, seaborn/matplotlib)- 2 years of experience(intermediate level) 2)SQL- 1 month experience have knowledge of basic querying PowerBI/Tableau- beginner level familiarity Now, he wanna learn by practicing thus creating an end-to-end project on data analysis which contains Problem statement, Research question, hypothesis and EDA verifying or disproving his hypothesis. But as beginner it's very tough task. May you please guide me how do I make my first project including these parameters.(Additionally, the work experience is 0 ) thank you :)
