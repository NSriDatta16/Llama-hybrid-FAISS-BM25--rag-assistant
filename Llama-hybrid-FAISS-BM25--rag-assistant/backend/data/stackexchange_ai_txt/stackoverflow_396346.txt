What is your bottleneck? Reading data or Writing data? If you are concerning about reading data, using a memory based data caching machanism like memcached would be a performance booster, As of most of the mainstream and biggest web sites doing so. Scaling facebook hi5 with memcached is a good read. Also implementing application side page caches would drop queries made by the application triggering lower db load and better response time. But this will not have much effect on database servers load as your database have some other heavy users. If writing data is the bottleneck, implementing some kind of asyncronyous middleware storage service seems like a necessity. If you have fast and slow response timed data storage on the frontend server, going with a lightweight database storage like mysql or postgresql (Maybe not that lightweight ;) ) and using your real database as an slave replication server for your site is a good choise for you.
