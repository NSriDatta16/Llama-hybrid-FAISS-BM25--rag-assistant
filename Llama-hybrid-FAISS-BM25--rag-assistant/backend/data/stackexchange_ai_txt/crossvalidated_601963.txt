Yes, it is possible to do regression on your data. Your question is quite broad, do I will try to answer it in bullet points: It's a pity that st. errors for your data are not known, but for the sake of your analysis you may as well consider them negligible and ignore any possible variability in the accuracy of the data. It's very important that you are aware of the shortcomings of doing regression on aggregated data. @dipetkov rightly cited ecological fallacies , the most infamous of which is Simpson's paradox, you should study them very carefully. Take for instance the association between age and income that you were talking about: it's known to everyone that these are indeed associated, and that older workers are in average better payed, however, you may conduct a regression on your data and find an opposite correlation, this is totally possible and may be explained by the fact that wealthier districts have a bigger share of young immigrants, or other factors. It's also possible that younger populations are associated to higher age-adjusted per-capita income, but because you don't have atomic data and older workers do take higher salaries, you aren't able to see that. So you must be extra careful about your conclusions and also warn your readers from getting wrong ideas from your analysis. The purpose of spacial models that you seem to be looking into, is to get away with not including into your model factors that are shared between closer disricts. In other words, using models that consider spacially correlated residuals may un-bias your results. Of course you got to have spatial data to feed models like the ones you linked (in R). You can create a random effect model grouping your data in divisions. In fact, in analogy as the last bullet point, this seems like a good idea. The models you can use on your data depend on the data you have. If you have spacial data you can create a spacial model, if you have graphical data ( representing infrastructure, for instance ), you can use the graph to model the correlation of your residuals, if you just what you have showed us, you can do a random effects model and not much more.
