Normalization of mysql database

On my website a user can post comments and group these into categories. e.g. category: good quotes links: "some quote 1", "some quote 2", and so on. So the number of categories and comments are determined by the users. I'm thinking how I should organize this in the mysql database. I can't have one table for each category because there would be A LOT of categories. But how could I organize this in a table? should a category be in one column, and a comment be a row? or should it be the other way around? But then, isnt it a bad practice to increase the number of columns after you have defined the table? Any suggestion would be helpful!
