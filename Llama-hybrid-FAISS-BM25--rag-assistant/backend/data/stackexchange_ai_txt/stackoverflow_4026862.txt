If you care about coverage metrics, setters and getters can kill you. Regardless of that, you should definitely test them, especially if they do more than set or get. Also, its OK to test set/get in one test. If the props are private, then you have to do it that way, unless there are side effects of a set. Or you can implicitly test them when testing other methods. For example, if you are testing a DAO, you can use the setters and getters when you write you testSave method... To make life easier, you might be able to write a reflection based test utility to test setters and getters. Or just write simple tests, its not hard or time consuming, although it is boring... There are a lot of options here...
