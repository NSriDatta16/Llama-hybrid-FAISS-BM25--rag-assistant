What do you use IsolatedStorage in Silverlight for?

I don't see a lot of value for Isolated Storage except to maybe cache temporarily some images or code locally. Being that you only get 1MB I don't see much value in it even for this. Saving settings in Isolated Storage doesn't make a lot of sense since the user could access your silverlight application from another browser on a different machine. Plus Settings make more sense stored on the server. What do you use IsolatedStorage for that I might have missed?
