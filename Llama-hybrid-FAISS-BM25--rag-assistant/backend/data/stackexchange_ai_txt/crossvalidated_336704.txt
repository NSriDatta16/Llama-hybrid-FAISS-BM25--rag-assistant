Now that this is several months old, I am going to assume it is safe to give a full answer, without unfairly advantaging you in any academic assessment. So, have a look again at the model form: $$Y_i = B_0 + B_1 X_i + U_i \quad \quad \quad \mathbb{V}(U_i) = \sigma^2.$$ In a classical linear regression model, the explanatory variables $X_i$ are considered to be fixed (since the problem is to find the conditional behaviour of the response) and the parameter values $B_0$, $B_1$ and $\sigma$ are considered to be "unknown constants", meaning they are also treated as fixed.$^\dagger$ So the only thing on the right-hand-side of the equation that is random is the error term $U_i$. Since $U_i$ is a random variable, this means that anything that depends on $U_i$ is also a random variable. Hence, the response $Y_i$ is also a random variable (when not conditioning on it having been observed) and the estimators $\hat{B}_0$ and $\hat{B}_0$, which depend on these response values, are also random variables. Hence, in this question, items 2, 3, 4 and 6 would all be considered random variables. $^\dagger$ This assumes you are doing your analysis in the classical frequentist statistical framework. Using Bayesian analysis the parameters would be treated as random variables.
