What will be frequency for daily observation in time series and how to deal with 0 values?

I have to forecast sales for stores. So for that I am using ARIMA model.Here first we need to create times series object using ts function which takes frequency parameter.As far as I know we use 1=annual, 4=quarterly, 12=monthly but don't know sure what will be frequency for daily observations. I tried using 1,7,365 and number of observation as values for frequency parameter but with these I am not able to get proper plots and forecast.My second question is how to deal with 0 values for specific observation as they are producing errors as follows: Error in na.fail.default(as.ts(x)) : missing values in object for acf() and pacf() and Error in OCSBtest(x, m) : The OCSB regression model cannot be estimatedauto.arima() functions.
