The ASP.NET Cache uses its own dictionary so using its dictionary to locate your dictionary to do lookups to retrieve your objects seems less than optimal. Dictionaries use hash tables which is about the most efficient lookup you can do. Using your own dictionaries would just add more overhead, I think. I don't know about diminishing returns in regards to hash tables, but I think it would be in terms of storage size, not lookup time. I would concern yourself with whatever makes your job easier. If having the Cache more organized will make your app easier to understand, debug, extend and maintain then I would do it. If it makes those things more complex then I would not do it. And as nullvoid mentioned, this is all assuming you've already explored the larger implications of caching, which involve gauging the performance gains vs. the performance hit. You're talking about storing lots and lots of objects, and this implies lots of cache traffic. I would only store something in the cache that you can measure a performance gain from doing so.
