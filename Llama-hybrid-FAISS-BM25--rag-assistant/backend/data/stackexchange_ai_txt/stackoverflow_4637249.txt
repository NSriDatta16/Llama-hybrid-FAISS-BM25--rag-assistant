Most elegant way to return value from within JQuery $.each?

I was wondering if there a more elegant way of returning a value from the function I've pasted below : "getImageURLforPOICategory". As you can see I've used JQuery's "each" function to iterate through an array of objects, when I find the matching value I want to return a result out of the "each" loop and then right out of the function that contains the each loop. I've used a local variable to "cache" it and then I'm returning that. I'm not entirely sure if this is the best approach? Is there a way of returning the value directly from within the each loop? Tracker.getImageURLforPOICategory = function (POICategoryID) { var url; $.each(Tracker.pointofinterestcategories, function () { if (this.id === POICategoryID) { url = this.imageurl; return; } } ); return url; }; Thanks for reading, Cheers, Duncan
