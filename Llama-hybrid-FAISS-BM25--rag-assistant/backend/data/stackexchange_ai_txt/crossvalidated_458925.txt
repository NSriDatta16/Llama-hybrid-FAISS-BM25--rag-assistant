Impute Continuous Predictor which 0 or median is not an option

I have a dataframe of the following patients: PatientID Days.To.Develop.Symptoms 1 0 2 1 3 3 4 NA As you can see above, patient 4 did not develop symptoms. It logically incorrect to impute Days.To.Develop.Symptoms with 0 or the median since the patient never developed symptoms. My model (Logistic Regression with LASSO regularization using glmnet) does not accept NA. What is an appropriate method to solve this problem? Note: The outcome of the algorithm is binary (Acute Kidney Injury vs. Not Acute Kidney Injury). There is a total of 210 predictors inputted in the model that are categorical and continuous.
