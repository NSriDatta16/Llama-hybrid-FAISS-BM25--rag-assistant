There aren't concerns unless you are trying to debug it (or turn off batch compilation). Or if you have a bunch of folders. Each folder will have one DLL for all the files with batch turned on. So if you break things up into a bunch of folders, that could cause fragmentation problems of the processes memory. Otherwise, no issues for lots of pages.
