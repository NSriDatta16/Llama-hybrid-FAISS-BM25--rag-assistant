Reliability of opensource ML packages

While working on a machine learning project, in addition to the widely known opensource ML packages like tidyverse (R), pandas/scikitlearn (python), we end up using lot of other little known packages, built for very specific purposes. As the open source packages are not regulated/moderated unlike SAS, how reliable will be the results from those packages. Quite often, those packages' github repos have existing unsolved issues and we may not go through them to identify any potential pitfalls. Business will be making critical actions based on the predictions/insights we, as a data scientist provide, which in turn could be based on those packages. How can we minimize the risk in such scenarios ?
