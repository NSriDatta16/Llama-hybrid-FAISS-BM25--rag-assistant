Two factorial time series mixed effect model using lmer

I'm facing a problem regarding the the selection of an appropriate model and right synthax using lmer()-command (lme4-package). But first let me explain the design of the study: Study design: I ran an experiment were I measured the activity of soil samples i.e. CO2 production (=dependant variable "CO2") over time. First independant variable is the type of organism applied to soil (independant variable "organism" with the 4 levels: A / B / C /D). Second independant variable is whether or not the system is supplemented with a stimulant (independant variable "supplement" with the 2 Levels: Yes / No). So In total there are 8 treatments which are combinations of two independant factorial variables: A x Yes B x Yes C x Yes D x Yes A x No B x No C x No D x No Each of these treatments is replicated 6 times (N=6) in isolated containers. So in total there are 6 (replicates) x 8 (treatments) = 48 containers. CO2 production in the containers is measured in 1-minute intervals for 1 week (=10080 dates). Study question: I'm interested whether (i) the type of organism, (ii) the supplement and (iii) the interaction of both have an effect on the CO2 production. Statistic question: So if I understand right I have a fully crossed random effects where each container (random effect variable "container" with 48 levels) appears at each sampling date (random effect variable "time" with 10800 levels). Consequently i expect that the synthax should be: lmer(CO2~organism*supplement+(organism*supplement|time)+(organism*supplement|container)) I could of course also just use the data from the last measurement and create a model like this: lmer(CO2~organism*supplement+(organism*supplement|container)) However, I would prefer to use the whole data because otherwise I would lose a lot of information. However, since this the first time I work with such a design I'm quiet unsure if I have chosen an appropriate model and synthax. So Iâ€™d be very grateful if someone could tell me if the proposed statistical method is appropriate and if yes, if the presented synthax is right. Many thanks!
