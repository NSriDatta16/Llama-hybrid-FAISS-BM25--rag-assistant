A one-sided t-test between the two distributions will give you a statistic that expresses (relative to a chosen significance level) whether the average orange is heavier than the average apple. You can, for example, do this in R: > a o t.test(o,a,alternative="greater") Welch Two Sample t-test data: o and a t = 2.5538, df = 18, p-value = 0.009971 alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is greater than 0 95 percent confidence interval: 0.3209788 Inf sample estimates: mean of x mean of y 2.9 1.9 This does assume a t-distribution, but as you increase your sample size, this will generally be a good assumption. Sure enough, oranges are heavier than apples -- the confidence interval of the mean does not include 0 (which would mean no difference).
