Organizing an EF4 data layer?

I am new to Entity Framework 4, and I am wondering, what's the best way to organize my data layer--the code that accesses EF4? At this point, my data layer is set up like this: DataStore class: Holds a reference to the EF4 ObjectContext, and contains methods to open, close, and persist the ObjectContext to storage. Repository classes: One class for each entity, with methods to create, fetch, and delete entity objects. Is there a better way to organize this functionality for EF4? I've looked for articles/blogs on the subject, but I'm not finding much. Any suggestions?
