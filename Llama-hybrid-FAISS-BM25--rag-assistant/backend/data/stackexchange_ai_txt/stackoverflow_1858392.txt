What is the best way to organize a group of groups in Obj-c?

I have an unusual problem where I have a list of fruits (apple, orange, banana, grapes, etc etc). They can be organized into small groups for example: Group 1: apple, green_apple, pineapple Group 2: grapes, banana, strawberries, apple Group 3: orange, grapes, green_apple Each group is then associated with a price. So Group 1->9.99, Group 2-> 15.99 etc And then later on when given a list, they need to be matched against existing groups, and if none was found, create one. If one exists, return the price. What is the best way to do this? Basically the association needs to be an NSDictionary, but the key seems like it should be an array. The problem then is, how do I construct the key when given some input? I have to resort to keeping things in alphabetical order for keys to be consistent? But then this approach would not be too good when names includes symbols ($apple etc). What would your approach be?
