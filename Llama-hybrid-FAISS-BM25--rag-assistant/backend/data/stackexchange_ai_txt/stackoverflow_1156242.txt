How can the CAPTCHA process be more user friendly or better implemented?

I have used CAPTCHA on my various web sites in the standard manner where I generated some obfuscated string of characters (odd pair of words, random number, etc.) in an image for the user to manually reproduce in a text box. I am also aware of recaptcha.net which extends the basic functionality of screening bots from humans and as well as helping to digitize books. I just came across another way of performing CAPTCHA with the AJAX Fancy CAPTCHA jQuery plugin which rather than asking the user to reproduce a string instead asks the user to drag an image that is readily recognizable (scissors, pencil, book, etc.) into an area that is equally recognizable. When I saw this I had to say to myself "WOW...that's cool!" Question: Does anyone out there have any other examples of a neat and different way of performing CAPTCHA without having to generate a random string of characters into an image for the user to try and read (or regenerate until they can) so that they can manually type it into a box?
