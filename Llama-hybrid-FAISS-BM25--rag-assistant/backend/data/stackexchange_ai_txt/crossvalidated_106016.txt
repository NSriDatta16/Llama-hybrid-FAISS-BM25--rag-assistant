Is using deciles to find correlation a statistically valid approach?

I have a sample of 1,449 data points that are not correlated (r-squared 0.006). When analyzing the data, I discovered that by splitting the independent variable values into positive and negative groups, there seems to be a significant difference in the average of dependent variable for each group. Splitting the points into 10 bins (deciles) using the independent variable values, there seems to be a stronger correlation between the decile number and the average dependent variable values (r-squared 0.27). I don't know much about statistics so here are a few questions: Is this a valid statistical approach? Is there a method to find the best number of bins? What is the proper term for this approach so I can Google it? What are some introductory resources to learn about this approach? What are some other approaches I can use to find relationships in this data? Here is the decile data for reference: https://gist.github.com/georgeu2000/81a907dc5e3b7952bc90 EDIT: Here is an image of the data: Industry Momentum is the independent variable, Entry Point Quality is dependent
