Using exploratory data analysis

I am trying to use exploratory data analysis to decide which model to use with my data for prediction either linear regression/neural networks etc, basically I am focusing on linear and non linear models. What kind of exploratory analysis can I do to decide whether a linear model is good enough for me or a non linear model would be good?
