To answer Steve B's question: POSITIVE_INFINITY is the largest postive number that you can store if you have unlimited storage space. Without this luxury we have to use a construction like 1.0 / 0.0 which does a fine job. Same goes for NEGATIVE_INFINITY but then the largest negative number. NaN is normally defined as 0.0 / 0.0 because there is no such number as 0/0 so that perfectly qualifies for a NaN.
