Generally it is discouraged to use the same key pair for authentication and encryption. That is why a GnuPG key contains actually 2 private keys for instance. From the cryptographer's point of view you'll need to store another key pair for encryption or use a symmetric key for data encryption. Do you read and write database contents with always the same client? If so, you can use a symmeric encryption and store the key on the client.
