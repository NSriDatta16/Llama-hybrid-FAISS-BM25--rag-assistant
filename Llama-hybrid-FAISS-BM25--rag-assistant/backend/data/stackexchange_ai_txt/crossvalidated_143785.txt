It has to do with there being a lack of bias in your samples. If you were to randomly select samples, even very small ones, from the population, their means will be above and below the population mean an equal number of times. So, on average, the mean of the sample means should be a good approximation of the true population mean. Sample size will, however, affect variance of your estimates around the true mean. If you have a large n, samples will be closer to the true mean; if you have a small n, they will be dispersed widely around the true mean.
