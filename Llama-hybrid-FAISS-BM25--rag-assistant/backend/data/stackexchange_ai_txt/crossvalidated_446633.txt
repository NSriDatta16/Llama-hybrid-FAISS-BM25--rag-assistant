Most of the theory behind the support vector machine assumes you are constructing a maximal margin classifier following a fixed transformation of the input space (via a kernel). The theory is less applicable if the fixed transformation has been learned from the data (as would be the case for the lower levels of the deep neural network). This means that there probably isn't much reason to expect a linear SVM to be better than a conventional (regularised) neural layer.
