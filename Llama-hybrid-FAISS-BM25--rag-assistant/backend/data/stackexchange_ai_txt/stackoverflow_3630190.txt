as3: draw circle with a hole in it using only actionscript

Okay so basically I want to draw a circle in as3 that has a 'hole' in it (like a donut). Something like this, but without the outlines: http://www.steel.ie/DugganSteel/Pictures/Hollow-circle.gif This doesn't work: SPRITE.graphics.beginFill(0xFFFFFF); SPRITE.graphics.drawCircle(0,0,10); SPRITE.graphics.endFill(); SPRITE.graphics.drawCircle(0,0,5); I mean this seems like it'd be simple but I can't find any information on it. I should also mention that I'm trying to only draw 3/4 of the circle, like 3/4 of donut. So I was planning on drawing a transparent circle and square over the original circle, I know this seems kinda of weird since you'd expect something transparent to show whats underneath it.
