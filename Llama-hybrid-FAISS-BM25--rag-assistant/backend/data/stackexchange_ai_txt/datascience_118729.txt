Is Data Analysis/Science good for online freelancing (Upwork, Freelancer...)?

My interest in data analysis/science began about a year ago because it combines statistics, analysis, and programming. Unfortunately, I was surprised that there was almost no demand for it in the job market in my country, which led me to think about freelancing on Upwork, Freelancer, etc. after gaining experience in data analysis/science. However, I began to wonder, is there a company that would give you its data to analyze? and as you know, data is the most valuable resource for any company. Thank you in advance.
