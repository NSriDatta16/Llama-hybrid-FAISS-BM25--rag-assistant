I'll go against the grain and give you some tough love instead of simply answering the question you asked. My thought is, why would you want to make 2-5 versions of your application that will receive, at best, a lukewarm reception across all platforms? Because that is what you are going to get. If you want to make applications that are well received and make users excited to use them, make them take advantage of the platform. iPhone apps should have well thought out user input and take advantage of as many platform features as possible, like mutl-touch, easy data storage, accelerometers, camera and so on. Palm apps work great in the background so write something that takes full advantage of that. it might even be more than one app to keep to Palm's simple and small approach to apps. Android apps can integrate much more tightly with the system, so let them do just that to the benefit of the user. Your main benefit with any app should be that you understand the domain completely, and can describe what aspects of the problem domain work best with the strengths of any given device. Mobile apps are small(ish) and any small gain you get from trying to share code across devices (and how does that work exactly across Java/Obj-C much less Android to Blackberry library differences?) is totally lost in the distortion of your understanding through the prism of accommodation.
