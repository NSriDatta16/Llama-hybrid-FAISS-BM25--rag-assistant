You could compute the similiarity of all time-series within a cluster - the average intra cluster distance using either Euclidean Distance or Dynamic Time Warping Distance. In most cases for Time-Series Analysis, Dynamic Time Warping is recommended, since it is an elastic measure and yields low distance for two series which are out of phase yet very similiar. To evaluate the randomness for each class, you could compute the average distance of a single measurement to all others in the same class. If the distance is high, the class is more mixed/random, whereas if the distance is low, the variation in between samples of the class is low. YET, you might want to use euclidean distance if not the pattern but the time of the activity that you measured is of interest. Therefore you will chose a metric based on domain knowledge. For more information I recommend the tutorials of Eamonn Keogh which can be found here . The following picture illustrates the difference betwen Euclidean Distance and Dynamic Time Warping and is taken from a tutorial of Eamonn Keogh.
