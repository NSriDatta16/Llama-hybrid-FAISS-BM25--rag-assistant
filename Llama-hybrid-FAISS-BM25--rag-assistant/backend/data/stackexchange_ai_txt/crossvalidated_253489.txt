One method that I like to use to see which feature contribute to a specific prediction is to reset all features to their mean one by one and then see how the prediction changes. I picked up on this method from this page . But I'll explain with an example of my own as well. Say for example we have a model that predicts if a day is a good day to wear shorts based on some weather information, let's say temperature, wind and rain. and let's say we're using a method that gives us class probabilities. Now we have a day where the model is predicting 50/50 for a given day, but we wan't to know what is causing this. So we will go through each of the features, reset them to their mean (or 0) and see what the model predicts now. Say for temperature we have 20 °C, but the mean temperature is 10 °C. If we re-predict the model with the temperature for this day set to the mean of 10 °C, but keeping rain and wind at the same values, the prediction ends up being 80% for no shorts. Clearly temperature has a big effect! Now we can do the same for the other variables. The wind speed is slightly above average, and by resetting wind to the mean and keeping the others equal, the prediction only changes a little to 55% for shorts. Seems temperature is a bigger deal. Now rain is a bit of odd one, since rain is already on the mean. so resetting to the mean obviously would have no effect. But we still want to know if rain is influencing the prediction, so what we can do instead is set the rain to 0. And lo and behold, once we set rain to 0, the model predicts 75% for shorts. Again a pretty big effect. By going through each feature and and setting them to their mean or 0 we were able to identify at a prediction level which features were important. Wind and temperature both had a large effect in either direction, whilst the wind had a much smaller effect. Now why did we reset rain to 0? Doing this for temperature or wind would have been weird, since for these 0 is a value that barely ever happens and holds little significance, but for rain 0 is both relatively frequent and it means something specific, a dry day. Meaning it's sensible to reset to 0. So you really have to look at a feature by feature basis what makes sense.
