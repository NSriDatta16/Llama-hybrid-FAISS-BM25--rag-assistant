Somewhere on Joel on Software, Joel has a comparison between two methods of growing a company: the Ben & Jerry's method, which starts small and grows organically, and the Amazon method of raising a whole lot of money and staking very wide claims from the start. When Sun introduced Java, it was with fanfare and hype. Java was supposed to take over. Most future relevant software development would be on web-delivered Java applets. There would be brass bands and even ponies. In this context, it was sensible to establish, up front, a naming convention that was internet-based, corporation-friendly, and on a planetary scale. OK, it didn't turn out quite as Sun hoped, but they planned as if they would succeed. Personally, I despise projects that can be undermined by success. Python was a project by Guido van Rossum initially, and it was quite some time before the community was confident it would survive if van Rossum was hit by a bus. There were, as far as I know, no initial plans to take over the world, and it was not intended as a web applet language. Therefore, during the formative stages of the language, there was no reason to want a vast hierarchy for a naming scheme. In that more informal community, one selected a more or less whimsical project name and checked to see if somebody else was already using it. (Naming a computer language after a British comedy show might be considered whimsical just to start.) There was no perceived need to cater to a big but unimaginative and clumsy naming scheme.
