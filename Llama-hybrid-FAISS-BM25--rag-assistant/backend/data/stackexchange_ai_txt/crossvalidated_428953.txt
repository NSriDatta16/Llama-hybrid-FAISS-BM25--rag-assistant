CCF to show correlations between time series

2 time series, which looked like highly correlated. I want to prove it with CCF. CCF stands for cross-correlation. In this case, I used R ccf (cross-correlation) function. With direct CCF: fe Am I right here, they are highly correlated with zero lags? With differencing: ccf(diff(male), diff(female)) It shows no correlation. What is the best way to find out the correlations between two time series? p.s. This question is specifically related to CCF, from time seriesâ€™ point of view and trying to understand if there's a lagging factor, not Pearson correlation. Thannk you.
