Yes, definitely keep your production credentials out of source control. Lock down the production user account so that only that user can see/change the config file, e.g. on unix the permissions should be -rw------- Even the directory it's in should be off-limits to unauthorised users. Restrict access to the production server: as few user accounts as possible, auditing, physical access restrictions such as locked server room, etc. Edit: to clarify, my rationale for suggesting keep credentials out of source control is that often, especially in larger companies, production credentials are not permitted to be known/used by a development team. In some places a developer even logging into a production DB could be a sacking offense. Especially if they then break something! Also, developers in other teams/depts may have source control access and this could be seen to substantially compromise the production DB. Of course if you're a 3 man dev organisation this is less of a concern.
