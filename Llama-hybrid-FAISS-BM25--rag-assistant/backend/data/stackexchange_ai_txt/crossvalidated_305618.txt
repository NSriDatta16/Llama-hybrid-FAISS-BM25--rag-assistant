The problem with your question is that you treat logistic regression as a classifier, that is for you it outputs clases . But that is not logistic regression (LR), LR estimates ("outputs") probabilities , see for example Why isn't Logistic Regression called Logistic Classification? or Logistic regression - how good is my model? . The paper you linked do not have a correct definition of complete separation, it says that only occurs if it is caused by one variable $s_i$ . That is not correct, complete separation can well occur without any single variable causing it. So maybe you should find some better source of basic information on LR, maybe https://www.amazon.com/Regression-Modeling-Strategies-Applications-Statistics/dp/0387952322 (there are also many good posts on this site).
