I'm not trying to extend a series into the future, I'm trying to predict an entire set of series given past correspondences plus a "hint." Does this problem have a name and/or standard solutions? Yes. This is called "nowcasting" . The BSTS and CausalImpact packages in R can perform this type of analysis, although I've only used them for one series at a time (i.e one time series + the set of additional variables, in your case that would be one customer + the resources). See this paper for details. More generally, this type of problem can be modeled using state space models and dynamic linear models.
