What Block Type for Left Column in Magento Theme?

I'm working on a custom Magento (1.3) theme and am wanting to add a left column. I've created template/page/html/left.phtml with the html in. In 2columns-left.phtml, i've added the following: getChildHtml('left'); ?> In page.xml, i've added the following: What i'm not quite understanding is what that block type should be - it seems to work if I do page/html, core/template or page/html_header - what is this for and what is the correct value for this case, where I just want to effectively include a phtml file - page/html/left.phtml etc. Thanks, Ian
