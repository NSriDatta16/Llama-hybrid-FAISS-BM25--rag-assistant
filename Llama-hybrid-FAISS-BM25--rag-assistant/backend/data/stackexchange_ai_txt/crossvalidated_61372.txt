Why do Minitab and SPSS give opposite results in Ordinal Logistic Regression?

I run an ordinal logistic regression model using both SPSS and Minitab. The dataset is exactly the same. The results are exactly the same, but in opposite directions. I have not manipulated default values of the two programs. The result of SPSS is the correct one. I know this since when I analyze this dataset using Minitab, but using its linear regression (not ordinal logit), the Minitab itself gives something similar to SPSS. But Minitab's ordinal regression tends to consider a strange default. All betas in logistic regression of Minitab are negated. Why is that?
