Save jQuery Objects in Variables for Reuse Saving a jQuery object to a variable lets you reuse it without having to search back through the DOM to find it. (As @Louis suggested, I now use $ to indicate that a variable holds a jQuery object.) // Bad: searching the DOM multiple times for the same elements $('div.foo').each... $('div.foo').each... // Better: saving that search for re-use var $foos = $('div.foo'); $foos.each... $foos.each... As a more complex example, say you've got a list of foods in a store, and you want to show only the ones that match a user's criteria. You have a form with checkboxes, each one containing a criteria. The checkboxes have names like organic and lowfat , and the products have corresponding classes - .organic , etc. var $allFoods, $matchingFoods; $allFoods = $('div.food'); Now you can keep working with that jQuery object. Every time a checkbox is clicked (to check or uncheck), start from the master list of foods and filter down based on the checked boxes: // Whenever a checkbox in the form is clicked (to check or uncheck)... $someForm.find('input:checkbox').click(function(){ // Start out assuming all foods should be showing // (in case a checkbox was just unchecked) var $matchingFoods = $allFoods; // Go through all the checked boxes and keep only the foods with // a matching class this.closest('form').find("input:checked").each(function() { $matchingFoods = $matchingFoods.filter("." + $(this).attr("name")); }); // Hide any foods that don't match the criteria $allFoods.not($matchingFoods).hide(); });
