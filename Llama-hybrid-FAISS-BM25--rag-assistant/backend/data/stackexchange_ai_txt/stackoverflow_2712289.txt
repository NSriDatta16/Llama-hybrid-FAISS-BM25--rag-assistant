access models and forms within modules

What is the best way to access my models and forms from a controller of a module? Let's explain with "pictures": /application/module/storage/controllers/IndexController.php needs to call readAction in the class called storage_Model_Files in /application/module/storage/models/Files.php I've made this app's dir structure and these forms and models with zf.sh (Zend_Tool). I've read about all sorts of ways of manually including these files. I want to lazy load them much like everything is done automatically with the default module. I can't seem to find how in the docs. Does that make sense? I have: resources.frontController.moduleDirectory = APPLICATION_PATH "/modules" in my application.ini file. So I can access my controllers fine. Thanks for your help!
