It may not be elegant, but in cases like this evicting entities from the session is the only practical solution. For example, once you've finished writing an entity's data to the output stream, call session.evict(entity) to remove it from the session cache. Alternatively, call this at the end of each "page". The combination of the paging mechanism and the eviction should ensure you never have more than 500 entities in the cache at one time.
