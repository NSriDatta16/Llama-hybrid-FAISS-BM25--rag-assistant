Yes, you can add a listener to all a container's components. getComponents and add the listener. You should be able to manage to do this recursively. You can also use ContainerListener to check for adding and removing components. However, MouseListener and MouseMotionListener behave strangely in that the event normally bubbles up to the parent, but does not do so if a listener is present (how is that for hopeless design?). Your choices are: Recursively adding listeners (bad, see above) Adding listeners to specific components (fragile) Adding a "glass pane" (a messy hack) Adding an AWTEventListener to Toolkit (requires permissions) Pushing an EventQueue and checking through events (doesn't work of Opera and Safari apparently; stops system copy-and-paste and applet dragging from working) Use ComponentListener ?
