When can I say a network converges better?

I trained two networks with and without skip connection. The network is a FCNN and has an encoding-decoding structure. I trained the networks with SGD and MSE for 150 epochs. The attached image is a comparison between validation RMSE. The RMSE for the network with the skip connection (network II) is slightly better than the one without skip connection (network I). Given that it is trained with SGD can I take this improvement as an actual improvement or could it be random because of SGD? (I trained the networks several times and always network II reaches lower error) Does this look like a convergence at all? If I go further epochs the fluctuations persists (I guess because of SGD there is a fluctuation) and RMSE doesn't improve
