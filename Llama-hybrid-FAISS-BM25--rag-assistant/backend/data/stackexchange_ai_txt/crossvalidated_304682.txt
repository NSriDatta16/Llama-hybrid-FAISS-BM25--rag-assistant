You don't define how you want to measure best . The easiest answer to give is a weighted average with the weights proportional to the inverse of the known variances. It will be best (minimum variance) among linear estimators (which are unbiased). This is best in the normal case by several common criteria. $\hat{\mu} = \sum_i w_i x_i = \frac{1}{\sum_i 1/v_i}\sum_i x_i/v_i$ $\text{Var}(\hat{\mu})= (\frac{1}{\sum_i 1/v_i})^2 \sum_i 1/v_i^2 \cdot \text{Var}(x_i)$ $ = (\frac{1}{\sum_i 1/v_i})^2 \sum_i \frac{1}{v_i^2} \cdot v_i$ $ = (\frac{1}{\sum_i 1/v_i})^2 \sum_i 1/v_i$ $ = \frac{1}{\sum_i 1/v_i}$
