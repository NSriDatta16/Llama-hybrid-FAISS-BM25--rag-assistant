checking if browser is FF < 3.6.14

I know that in general, we want to check for the presence of specific properties that a browser will have, rather than digging into the user agent string, but I have a special circumstance where I need to do something if the user is running a version of Firefox I'm looking at window.navigator.userAgent, which seems to have everything I need, but any hints or gotchas I might not think of?
