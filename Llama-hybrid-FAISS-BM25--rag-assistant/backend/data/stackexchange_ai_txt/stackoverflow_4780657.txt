Simulate the Ubuntu window effects in Flash with AS3

I need to do the windows moving effect from the following Ubuntu Window Effects video in Flash. Basically the window is transformed while you drag it. I want to have a movieclip and when I drag it to transform the same way the Ubuntu windows transform. I believe that there is something to do with matrix transformations. Any help is really appreciated!
