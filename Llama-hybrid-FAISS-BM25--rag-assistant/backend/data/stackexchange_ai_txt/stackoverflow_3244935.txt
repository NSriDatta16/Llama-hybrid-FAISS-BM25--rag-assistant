UPDATE: For anyone reading this: This is still an unresolved issue. I even contacted the Safari dev team and they just gave me the run around. @Kieran Allen This is the result of the code you asked me to include: Headers sent array(7) { [0]=> string(23) "X-Powered-By: PHP/5.2.2" [1]=> string(38) "Expires: Mon, 26 Jul 1997 05:00:00 GMT" [2]=> string(50) "Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate" [3]=> string(16) "Pragma: no-cache" [4]=> string(40) "Cache-Control: post-check=0, pre-check=0" [5]=> string(44) "Last-Modified: Wed, 14 Jul 2010 09:32:56 GMT" [6]=> string(23) "Content-type: text/html" } My current theory is that Safari disables the snapshot on secure websites using https. (I know it's not the correct protocol to respond with this as an answer to my question, but when I asked this I was not a registered member. I registered within the last hour though, and thought I would be able to claim this question as my own but alas Stack Overflow does not allow this.)
