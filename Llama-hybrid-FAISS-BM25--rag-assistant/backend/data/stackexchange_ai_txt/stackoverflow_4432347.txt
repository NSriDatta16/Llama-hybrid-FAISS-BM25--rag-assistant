jQuery doesn't actually append elements to the DOM. Instead, it just evals the contents of the script. Since it isn't in the DOM, $(data).find(".dataScript") doesn't match anything. If you really need the contents of the tag, you could try using a regular expression to parse the ajax response. Check out Karl Swedberg's comment for more info: All of jQuery's insertion methods use a domManip function internally to clean/process elements before and after they are inserted into the DOM. One of the things the domManip function does is pull out any script elements about to be inserted and run them through an "evalScript routine" rather than inject them with the rest of the DOM fragment. It inserts the scripts separately, evaluates them, and then removes them from the DOM. I believe that one of the reasons jQuery does this is to avoid "Permission Denied" errors that can occur in Internet Explorer when inserting scripts under certain circumstances. It also avoids repeatedly inserting/evaluating the same script (which could potentially cause problems) if it is within a containing element that you are inserting and then moving around the DOM.
