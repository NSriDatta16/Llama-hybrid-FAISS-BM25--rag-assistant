Using the results of clustering to retrain a neural network

I am following and expanding upon previous work from the winner of the Melanoma Classification from here . The dataset has 9 classes. The competition is only interested in the one class (Melanoma). I have taken the feature outputs (pre-final layer) from CNN and performed clustering. Then used this to group different classes (leaving Melanoma as its own group) then used this in the training. I have already performed clustering with other steps (PCA, TSNE, K-Means, Hierarchichal, LDA, QDA, NDA, etc.) and have results. I am largely trying to understand the maths (and background research) behind why this approach in retraining might improve performance (on the ROC-AUC of the class that was not grouped ie. melanoma) Any advice / relevant papers welcome! Thanks,
