Display different set of buttons for different instances of tiny mce

I'm adding text area dynamically, which will be instance of tine mce. In a page, I will be adding text area for say heading, paragraph etc. For heading, I need to have only b,I,U and align buttons displayed, also for p, I need a different set of buttons. Is it possible ? How to do if possible ?
