How to calculate p values in logistic regression with gradient descent algorithm

In logistic regression, the gradient descent algorithm for calculating coefficients can be described this way: Until convergence, do $$ \beta := \beta + \alpha \frac{\partial L}{\partial \beta} $$ where L is the log likelihood function. Coefficients can be got quite easily here, but how can I get the p values with this algorithm?
