You try to persist object of type UUID, which is not hibernate-annotated entity. So the hibernate wants to serialize it to byte array (blob type). This is why you get this message 'expression of type bytea'. You can either store UUID as blobs in database (not elegant), or provide your custom serializer (much work) or manually convert that object. UUID class has methods fromString and toString, so I would store it as String.
