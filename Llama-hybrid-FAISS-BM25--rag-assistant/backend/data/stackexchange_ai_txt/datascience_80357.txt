Demand prediction when having N customers and M products

I have a csv file (dataset) with the following information: date customer_id product_id quantity 11/02/2019 11 2212 2 11/02/2019 12 1116 10 07/04/2020 24 0088 4 22/04/2020 06 2212 7 This dataset represets the sales of a shop during the last 5 years (on daily basis). The dataset contains N customers (~100) and M products (~2.5k) I want to build a machine learning model that can predict the sold quantity of each product, for each customer. For instance, today, I have 10 customers, each bought aroung 20 products with different quantitys. How can I form this problem? probably it's a regression task, but how can I build a model that can produce the needed outputs (predicting for each customer the product and its quantity)? I saw some examples online, but all of them has a model for each item, (e.g. Demand Forecast using Machine Learning with Python ), and in their cases they have few items. In my case, since I have M products, should I build M models (prob. not)?
