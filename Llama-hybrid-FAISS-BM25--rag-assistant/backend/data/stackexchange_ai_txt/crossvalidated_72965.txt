In logistic regression, oversampling events does not affect non-intercept coefficients - they remain unbiased. Only the intercept $\beta_0$ is affected, and this is what drives the incorrect probability predictions. So if you only cared about the coefficients for explanatory variables and not the actual predicted probabilities, you don't need to do anything, but that's not the case here. See King and Zheng (2001) [equation 7] for the direct correction to $\beta_0$ $$ \hat{\beta_0} - ln[({1-\tau \over \tau})({\hat{y} \over 1-\hat{y}})] $$ $\hat{\beta_0}$ being the incorrectly estimated intercept $\tau$ being the proportion in the actual population $\hat{y}$ being the proportion in the sample population So for your simple example, you should have something like ${\beta_0} = -2.2 - ln[({0.5 \over 0.5})({0.1 \over 0.9})] = -2.2 + 2.2 = 0 $.
