The coverage of a CI is a binomial random variable, so yea I think it would make sense to have uncertainty estimates reported in a simulation study. That being said, I if the CI is cheap to compute I think we can likely just run sufficiently many simulations so that the resulting simulation error is within some desirable tolerance. I would probably only care about the first two digits of precision in a coverage probability, meaning if you ran 10,000 simulations the uncertainty estimates likely wouldn't add much.
