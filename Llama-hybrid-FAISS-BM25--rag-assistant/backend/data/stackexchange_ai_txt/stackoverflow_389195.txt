I would avoid relying on assert for other than a casual way to check assumptions during debugging. In release code, your redefined assert is going to be handled by a random crash, this is not user friendly If during debugging, an assumption of yours, say a given condition will never be true, turns out to be invalid. Change your error handling code accodingly to take into account that condition. Otherwise, have a more user-friendly facility for handling assumption violating conditions. Create an exception called CAssumptionViolated, throw it where you would otherwise assert. Catch it in your main routine and provide a means for the user to alert you about the error. Better yet, provide debug information with the exception. Even better, automatically forward the debug information to your organization somehow.
