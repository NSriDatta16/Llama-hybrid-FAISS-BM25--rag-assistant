One advantage would be that the input strings are only scanned once (inside the snprintf() ) instead of twice for the strlen / strcpy solution. Actually, on rereading this question and the comment on your previous answer, I don't see what the point is in using sprintf() just to calculate the concatenated string length. If you're actually doing the concatenation, my above paragraph applies.
