How do I read paragraphs at a time with Perl?

When I write #!/usr/bin/perl -w use strict; while( ) { print "\n-------------------------\n\n"; print; <>; } after each "return" I get one line. Why don't I get with the next script after each "return" one paragraph? #!/usr/bin/perl -w use strict; local $/ = ""; while( ) { print "\n-------------------------\n\n"; print; <>; } __DATA__ line one line two line three line four line five line six line seven line eigth line nine line ten line eleven line twelve
