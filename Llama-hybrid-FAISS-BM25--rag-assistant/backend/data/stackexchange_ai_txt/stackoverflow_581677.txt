How to get the last 25 elements of a SortedSet?

In Java I have a SortedSet that may have 100,000 elements. I would like to efficiently and elegantly get the last 25 elements. I'm a bit puzzled. To get the first 25 I'd iterate and stop after 25 elements. But I don't know how to iterate in reverse order. Any ideas? SortedSet summaries = getSortedSet(); // what goes here :-(
