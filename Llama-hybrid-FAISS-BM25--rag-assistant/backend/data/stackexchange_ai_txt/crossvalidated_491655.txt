Assessing the performance of a neural network in classification task that involves more than two class types

In terms of evaluating how well a neural network performs in a classification task with the number of classes greater than 2 (for example, classifying an observation into one of the 4 classes), which would be a better measure to use: (i) error-based measures such as the cross entropy loss, or (ii) strict accuracy rate? And what would be the advantage(s) of one measure over the other? The previous posts on this topic only discusses about the case of binary classification. Thank you.
