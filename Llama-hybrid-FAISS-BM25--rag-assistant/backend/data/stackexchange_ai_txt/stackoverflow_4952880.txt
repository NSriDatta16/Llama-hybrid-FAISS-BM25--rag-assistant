Multiplication in Django view

I am trying to represent decimal values as percentages in a template. Specifically, I have several fields in a model with values such as '0.4000000059604645'. In models.py I have it representated as information_percent = models.FloatField(blank=True) And in a view I have: org = Organizationaldata.objects.get(name=organization) information_percent = org.information_percent What I cannot figure out is how to get this to show as, for instance, '40.0' in the template. I have done a lot of searching and I can't figure out how to multiply the value by 100, or some other technique that will deliver the intended result. And suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
