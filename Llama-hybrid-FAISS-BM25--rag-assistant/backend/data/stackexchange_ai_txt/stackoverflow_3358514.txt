How can I write a BringToFront method for a WPF UserControl?

I am developing a UserControl, call it CoolControl, that is meant to act somewhat like a window, with a few special features. So far, it can be resized and dragged all around the screen. If I add multiple CoolControl objects to my application window using XAML, the last one that was declared is always in front. This is fine, but I want to make it so that if I click on one of my CoolControl objects during run-time, that control will put itself in front of all the other controls. I've tried using Canvas.SetZIndex , but unless I'm simply unable to come up with a clever enough solution, I don't see how that can help me. Because once I set one control's Z-Index to 9999, over time every other control I click will have the same value of 9999. And then, once again, the control declared last ends up in front. If you were given the task of writing a BringToFront() method for someone's UserControl, how would you do it in the simplest way possible? I'd prefer a better solution than getting the parent window, looping through all the controls, finding the maximum Z-Index, and then setting the Z-Index of the CoolControl accordingly, if THAT is even a valid solution.
