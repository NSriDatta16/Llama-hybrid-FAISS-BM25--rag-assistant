What are the pitfalls of setting enable_nestloop to OFF

I have a query in my application that runs very fast when there are large number of rows in my tables. But when the number of rows is a moderate size (neither large nor small) - the same query runs as much as 15 times slower. The explain plan shows that the query on a medium sized data set is using nested loops for its join algorithm. The large data set uses hashed joins . I can discourage the query planner from using nested loops either at the database level (postgresql.conf) or per session ( SET enable_nestloop TO off ). What are the potential pitfalls of set enable_nestloop to off ? Other info: PostgreSQL 8.2.6, running on Windows.
