Based on the current details about your question, I'm not sure what you seek, but I will give it a try. I assumed you already tried Pearson's coefficient. There are other metrics, which are more or less difficult to implement if not already existing in matlab. Spearman's rank Coefficient of determination Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion All those will provide some insight about dependencies within your dataset.
