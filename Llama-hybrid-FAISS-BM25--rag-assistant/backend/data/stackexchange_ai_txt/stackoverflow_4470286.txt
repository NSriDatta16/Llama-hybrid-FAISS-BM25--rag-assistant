A simple example, // a Product can belong to many ProductCollections class Product { // some properties } // a ProductCollection can contain many Products class ProductCollection { public IList Products { get; private set; } // ... // other collection properties } You may want to group/organise products in generic collections and allow the end user to create new collections. Some collections are used to display products on a website, others are used for administration (person A is responsible for... , person B for other products), some products are keps in a 'out of stock' collection, others in a 'need to be updated' collection, etc... In such a scenario you will most likely always want to retrieve a products using a specific collection. And if you need all the collections a product belongs to, then you can always write a function for that.
