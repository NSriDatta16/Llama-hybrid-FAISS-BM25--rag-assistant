If @Justin Niessner's answer doesn't give enough fine-control, you could try detecting the browser/device from the user agent string. This is frowned upon by some people, and it's not guaranteed to be accurate, but it might be helpful. Basically, detect the browser in Javascript and then dynamically add the correct stylesheet. Alternatively, this could be done server-side.
