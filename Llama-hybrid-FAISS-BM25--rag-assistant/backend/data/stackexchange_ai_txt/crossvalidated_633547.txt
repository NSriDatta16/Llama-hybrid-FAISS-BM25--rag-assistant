Estimating Complier Average Causal Effect (CACE) in a Field Experiment with One-Sided Noncompliance

I am working on a referee report for a field experiment focused on the employment process. The experiment investigates if including a video in job applications can reduce employment disadvantages for individuals with disabilities (specifically, those who use wheelchairs). Each application is randomly assigned to either include or exclude a video. Furthermore, the videos are randomly assigned to either disclose the applicant's disability or not. However, not all employers viewed the videos when included, leading to a scenario of one-sided noncompliance with compliers and "never-takers". The researchers have utilized a linear probability model in their analysis, incorporating the "video inclusion" as a variable in their regressions. My understanding is that the coefficient of the "video" variable could represent the intent-to-treat effect (ITT). I am now interested in estimating the Complier Average Causal Effect (CACE). I would like to know if the random assignment of the video can be used as an instrument in a two-stage least squares (2SLS) regression. Is there anyone with experience in this type of analysis who can provide insights or suggest methodologies for accurately estimating CACE in this context?
