Best Toolkit for Ajax?

What is going to end up to be the toolkit of choice for Ajax development? I've been working with Ajax for several years now and it appears that every year a new toolkit gets attention and appears to become the one to go with. I started out with just using plain XHR, then GWT, then jQuery, now YUI. Everytime I go to a new shop they are using something else. Are we going to end up with lots of toolkits like we have now in five years?
