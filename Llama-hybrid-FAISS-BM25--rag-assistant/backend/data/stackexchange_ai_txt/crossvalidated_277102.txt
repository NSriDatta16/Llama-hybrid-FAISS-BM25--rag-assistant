Learning curve of random forest in caret

I have data with about 1250 rows and 97 features. Using random forest for classification in caret R package, I've trained a model and now, I want to plot the learning curve using the learning_curve_dat funtion: learning_curve I got this plot: It is clearly overfitted by having AUC = 1 for training data. However, I cannot find a way to reduce overfitting. I tried to set mtry to a very low constant value (like 1, 3 or 5), I still got something similar. I have no idea what's happening, anybody could help me?
