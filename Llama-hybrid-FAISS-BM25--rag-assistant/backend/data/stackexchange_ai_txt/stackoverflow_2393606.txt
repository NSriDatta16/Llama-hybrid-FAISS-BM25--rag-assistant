Helpers, methods and classes organization

When my project is growing up, I need to write some methods, but application_controller's private methods and helpers aren't provide enough space to store all extensions. So I have looked at custom classes and methods, which are stored in the /lib folder. But i still have some questions, which i can't solve: -When should I use "class x = MyClass.new x.calculate(array1, array2) And then I have placed my class' methods into "class -When should i use custom modules? Is it always need to 'include' or 'require' them? Please tell me about your modules in your projects, when do you use them? -How can I call helper's method in the controller? I want to use in in ajax responce. For example I use helper method 'users_for_output', and if there was ajax call, my app should render only users as text, to process it with javascript after.
