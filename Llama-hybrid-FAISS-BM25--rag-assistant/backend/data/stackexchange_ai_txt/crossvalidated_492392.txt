Interpreting Augmented Dickey Fuller and timeseries data

I am trying to understand time series. After using statsmodel ADF test, I get a p value of 0.97. My understanding is that the data cannot be modelled as a time series as the p value is high. Is this correct? If not, please help me understand why.
