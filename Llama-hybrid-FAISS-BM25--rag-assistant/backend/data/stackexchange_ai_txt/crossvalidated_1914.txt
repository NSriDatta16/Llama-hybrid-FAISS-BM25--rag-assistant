Choice for priors for exponential spatial covariance

I doing spatial bayesian data analysis, I am assuming a no-nugget exponential covariance. I have tried a variety of priors for the sills and range parameters (gamma, inverse gamma etc.) , unfortunately the convergence diagonstics are typically horrible. I am wondering how to figure out the poor mixing I observe, is there something I can do to make the MCMC chain behave better?
