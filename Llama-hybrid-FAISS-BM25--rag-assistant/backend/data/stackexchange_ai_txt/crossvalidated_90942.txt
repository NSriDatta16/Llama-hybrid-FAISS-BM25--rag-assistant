Using the definition in Bayesian Data Analysis (3rd ed) , if $\mathcal{F}$ is a class of sampling distributions $p(y|\theta)$, and $\mathcal{P}$ is a class of prior distributions for $\theta$, then the class $\mathcal{P}$ is conjugate for $\mathcal{F}$ if $$p(\theta|y)\in \mathcal{P} \mbox{ for all }p(\cdot|\theta)\in \mathcal{F} \mbox{ and }p(\cdot)\in \mathcal{P}.$$ If $\mathcal{F}$ is a class of sampling distributions $p(y|\theta,\phi)$, and $\mathcal{P}$ is a class of prior distributions for $\theta$ conditional on $\phi$, then the class $\mathcal{P}$ is conditional conjugate for $\mathcal{F}$ if $$p(\theta|y,\phi)\in \mathcal{P} \mbox{ for all }p(\cdot|\theta,\phi)\in \mathcal{F} \mbox{ and }p(\cdot|\phi)\in \mathcal{P}.$$ Conditionally conjugate priors are convenient in constructing a Gibbs sampler since the full conditional will be a known family. I searched an electronic version of Bayesian Data Analysis (3rd ed.) and could not find a reference to semi-conjugate prior. I'm guessing it is synonymous with conditionally conjugate, but if you provide a reference to its use in the book, I should be able to provide a definition.
