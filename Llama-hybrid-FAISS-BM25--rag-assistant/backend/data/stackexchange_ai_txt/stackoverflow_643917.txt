Magento Themeing

I've read through all the docs on the Magento E-Commerce website, but I'm still fighting with Magento to get my theme looking just right. I have the basic understanding of the XML file layout files, but all the template code is frustrating me. Can someone explain the basic tags and maybe give a reference or two on where I can learn more?
