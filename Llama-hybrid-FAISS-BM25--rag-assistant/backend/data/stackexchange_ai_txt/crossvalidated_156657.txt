Hessian for linear regression with regularization

I'm using matlab to solve a regularized linear regression via the fminunc() function. The cost function is from the standford machine learning class. It's pretty slow so and I think it could be sped up if I use a Hessian multiply function via the Hessian 'on' option. Can someone provide me with the formula for computing the hessian? I'm a bit of a novice here. Thanks. EDIT: So I think I've got it but can anyone confirm? It's based on my less than expert attempt at calculus. I'm using: hessian = (X' * X + lambda * eye(length(theta)))./ m;
