Neural Network Self-organizing maps

I'm studying the training algorithm for the self-organizing maps. The slides i'm studying says that : after i've found a winner neuron ( in reference to a specific example in the example set), i have to apply this formula to its, and its neighbours. where $d_{t}$ is the specific example, $m_{ij}$ the neuron ij. What i've not understood is the meaning of the dist function in the radius . And what this radius means and what is its purpose. Can you help me ?
