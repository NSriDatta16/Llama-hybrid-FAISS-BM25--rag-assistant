There is an open issue for this , so there's no elegant way to do this. It would be far simpler for you to pick a framework and stick with it. Edit: My previous answer doesn't work because you can't specify dependencies in the execution. I've tried a few approaches, but the best I can manage is to create a profile for the TestNG dependency so you can toggle between TestNG and JUnit testing, there doesn't seem to be a means to run both TestNG and Junit 4 tests. One other point to note: You can launch your JUnit tests from TestNG , but I think this only works for JUnit 3 tests.
