How to track untracked content?

See below the solid line for my original question. I have a folder in my local directory that is untracked. When I run git status , I get: Changed but not updated: modified: vendor/plugins/open_flash_chart_2 (modified content, untracked content) When I type git add vendor/plugins/open_flash_chart_2 then try git status again, it still says untracked. What's going on? Here is a simple summary of my latest half hour: Discovered that my Github repo is not tracking my vendor/plugins/open_flash_chart_2 plugin. Specifically, there's no content and it's showing a green arrow on the folder icon. Tried git submodule init No submodule mapping found in .gitmodules for path 'vendor/plugins/open_flash_chart_2' Tried git submodule add git://github.com/korin/open_flash_chart_2_plugin.git vendor/plugins/open_flash_chart_2 vendor/plugins/open_flash_chart_2 already exists in the index git status modified: vendor/plugins/open_flash_chart_2 (untracked content) Hunted for any file named .gitmodules in my repository/local directory but couldn't find one. What do I have to do to get my submodules working so git can start tracking properly? This may be unrelated (I include it in case it helps), but every time I type git commit -a rather than my usual git commit -m "my comments" , it throws up an error: E325: ATTENTION Found a swap file by the name ".git\.COMMIT-EDITMSG.swp" dated: Thu Nov 11 19:45:05 2010 file name: c:/san/project/.git/COMMIT_EDITMSG modified: YES user name: San host name: San-PC process ID: 4268 While opening file ".git\COMMIT_EDITMSG" dated: Thu Nov 11 20:56:09 2010 NEWER than swap file!

[O]pen Read-Only, (E)dit anyway, (R)ecover, (D)elete it, (Q)uit, (A)bort: I am a complete newbie at Github and despite trying to go through the documentation, I'm a bit stumped by these particular problems. Thank you.
