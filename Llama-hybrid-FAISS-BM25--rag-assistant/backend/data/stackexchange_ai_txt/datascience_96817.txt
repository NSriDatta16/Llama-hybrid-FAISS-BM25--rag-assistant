Neural network linearity and non linearity

Is it right on my part to call: A neural network with only input and output layer (sigmoid) as linear (since it is a logistic regression) A neural network with more than one hidden layer non-linear (since weights interact with outputs from hidden layer and there is no way to write output as op = w2x1+w2x2+b like in linear regression)? Please don't mark this as duplicate as none of the questions actually answer the question asked here. Thank you.
