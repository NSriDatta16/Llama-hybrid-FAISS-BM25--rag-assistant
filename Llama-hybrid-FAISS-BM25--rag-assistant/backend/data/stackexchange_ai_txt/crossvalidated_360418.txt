xgboost prediction threshold

I am trying to classify the data set "Insurance Company Benchmark (COIL 2000) Data Set" which can be found in Dataset . I am using XGBoost in R (I am new to XGBoost algorithm) for the classification and the code that I have come up with is as follows- D For 'XGBoost', the results are floats and they need to be converted to categorical values (for classification) at whichever threshold is appropriate for the model. How do I decide the threshold appropriate for my model? The final prediction has to be either 0 or 1. The minimum and maximum values in "preds" variable is as follows- min(preds) # O/P- 0.03360531 max(preds) # O/P- 0.3086071 Ofcourse, these values are bound to change as I have not used a seed value. Any help is appreciated! Thanks
