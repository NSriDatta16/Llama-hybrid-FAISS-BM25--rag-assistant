What is the "enterprise" best practice for SVN security?

(Specifically for VisualSVN.) Should you use SVN authentication or Windows integrated authentication? Correct if anything here is wrong, but... The issue with SVN auth is that the administrator basically either has to have the dev come over to type their own password in when their account is created, or they have to create a password for them (so they know the dev's password). But of course, the SVN server admin can access their code anyway because they have full access to the repository itself, so does it matter? If you're using Windows integrated auth, I believe(?) this means you're giving the devs full access accounts on the SVN server (which I can see anal auditors calling a bad practice depending on what else is running there). So which type of auth is considered better for a large organization? Does it matter?
