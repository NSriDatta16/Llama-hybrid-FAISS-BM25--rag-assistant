Regarding other answers here, it is not a good idea to tell the question author to turn off this warning. His code is broken - he's passing an unsigned int instead of a float. You should be telling him to fix his code! This isn't a warning, it's an error. However, for me it's not an issue since my program is only dealing with numbers that come out as integers, so I don't care that they aren't floats. If it was just warnings I would move on with my life, but it's not letting me compile. Can I suppress errors somehow? Like I said, the errors aren't coming up on my Mac and the program is fine. Integers and floats use different representations internally. If you have the same number in an int and a float, the bit pattern inside the storage for them is completely different . You cannot under any circumstances whatsoever expect your code to work if you are passing an integer when you should be passing a float. Furthermore, I assert your Mac code either is silently using an overloaded version of that function (e.g. you are on that platform compiling with C++) or you believe it works when in fact it is working by chance or is not actually working. Addendum No compilers ever written has the ability to turn off errors. A warning means the compiler thinks you're making a mistake . An error means the compiler doesn't know what to do .
