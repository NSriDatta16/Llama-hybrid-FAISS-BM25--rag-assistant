This one is mostly web related but... Use Tables for your web page layouts If I was developing a gigantic site that needed to squeeze performance I might think about it, but nothing gives me an easier way to get a consistent look out on the browser than tables. The majority of applications that I develop are for around 100-1000 users and possible 100 at a time max. The extra bloat of the tables aren't killing my server by any means.
