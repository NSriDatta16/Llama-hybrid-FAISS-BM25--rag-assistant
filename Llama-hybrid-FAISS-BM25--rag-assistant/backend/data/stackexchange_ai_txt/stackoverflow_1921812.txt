Here is the complete set of response headers which ought to work in all browsers: The Cache-Control is according the HTTP 1.1 specification. The Pragma is according the HTTP 1.0 specification. The Expires is to avoid Proxies to cache the content. If this still fails, then you just need to clear the browser cache before testing. If still in vain, then the problem lies somewhere else. Common case is that starters think that the included files like scripts, stylesheets and images are cached according the instructions of the parent page. This is thus not true. They all account as independent requests and thus have their own set of controllable response headers.
