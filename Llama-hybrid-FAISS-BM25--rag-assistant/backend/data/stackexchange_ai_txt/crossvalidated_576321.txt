Is my R logistic regression model ok? (NOVICE)

I'm currently training a model for spam detection on a training set with 4757 observations with 3000 variables counting word frequencies. It is taking forever and I have a deadline coming up so I wanted to just run the code by you guys to ensure I'm not waiting for nothing. Any advice would be much appreciated.
