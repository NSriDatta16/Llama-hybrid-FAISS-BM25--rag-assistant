The problem is, in the future when a new browser is released and becomes more modern than those listed, your message will show up, I assume saying something to the effect of 'If you're not using X, you can't utilize all the benefits of this application' in which case I would advise you to not do this for that exact reason. You won't always be around to support the application, and possibly won't account for other perfectly modern and valid user agents that use one of those engines such as Webkit but do not identify themselves as such.
