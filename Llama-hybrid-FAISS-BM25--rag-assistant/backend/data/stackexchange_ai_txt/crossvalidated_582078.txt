Tensorflow Playground - Explanation of the Feature colored with blue and orange

Tensorflow playground input feature $X_1$ is colored orange and blue. What is the meaning of these colors? I think $(X_1, X_2)$ is training data point representing the coordinates of the dot to classify positive/blue or negative/orange in the OUTPUT on the right. Then how come a scalar value $X_1$ has orange part and blue part? $X_1$ is not a filter in a CNN, then how come it is half separated blue and half orange with vertical edge in the middle? Please help understand.
