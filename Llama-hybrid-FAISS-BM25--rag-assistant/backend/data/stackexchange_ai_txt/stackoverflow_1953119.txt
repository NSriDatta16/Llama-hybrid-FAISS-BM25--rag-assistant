jQuery draggable changing css "top" value

I have a table with two columns; names and items (represented by images). bob joe I would like to have the user be able to drag the images from one row to another (i.e., move "thing2.gif" from joe to bob). I accomplished this with jQuery as follows: // initialize these as draggable $(".item").draggable({ revert: "invalid", ghosting: true, opacity: 0.5, }); $(".items").droppable({ accept: ".item", activeClass: "drop_active", drop: function( event, ui ) { $(this).append(ui.draggable); } }); The problem I'm encountering is that after the move, each img seems to have a acquired a new css attribute: top: Â±X; , where X represents how much the image was moved vertically. I.e., if I had dragged the image up for pixels before dropping it, it would have an attribute top: -40px . This would have the effect of making it be displayed 40 pixels above it's new row. Does anyone know how to correct for this? Or, can anyone suggest a better way to do this?
