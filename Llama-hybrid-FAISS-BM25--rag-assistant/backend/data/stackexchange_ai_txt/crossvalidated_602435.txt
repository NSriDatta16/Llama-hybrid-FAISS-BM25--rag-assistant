Appropriate method for testing event data with no "natural" time bins

I frequently get data that takes the form of a list of events with timestamps. For example, it might show different salespeople and each time they make a sale. What is the right method for testing whether two groups have a different rate of events? This isn't a survival / time-to-event analysis because each group can have many events. I can do it by binning the timestamps into periods and doing a Poisson regression treating each time period as an independent sample with a certain number of events (or perhaps using a logistic regression if events are relatively sparse and many periods have zero events). But this feels odd because the time periods are arbitrary. For example, in the data below I could chunk the events by minute, hour, or day, and I'd get similar results. Questions: Is there a more natural way to test differences in rates of events? Is there a recommended R package that can do this simply? For the purposes of this question, please assume that each time period can be treated independently (ie, there are no correlated errors between adjacent time periods) and we aren't trying to model linear or periodic effects of time. Here's an example dataset in R showing two sales teams and each time one of them makes a sale: library(dplyr) library(lubridate) set.seed(413) startdate=ISOdate(2009,4,13,4,13,00) num_sales_eb % arrange(saletime) Here's an example of running a Poisson regression with different time bins and the same results. # bin timestamps sales % mutate( day=ceiling(difftime(saletime, startdate, units="days")), hour=ceiling(difftime(saletime, startdate, units="hours")), minute=ceiling(difftime(saletime, startdate, units="mins")) ) sales_perday % group_by(team, day) %>% summarise(sales=n()) sales_perhour % group_by(team, hour) %>% summarise(sales=n()) sales_perminute % group_by(team, minute) %>% summarise(sales=n()) # note that if there are many periods where one or both teams had no sales, # we need to generate zero-sale records for those periods preg_day ```
