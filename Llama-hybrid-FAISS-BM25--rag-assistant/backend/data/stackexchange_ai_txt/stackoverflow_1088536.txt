It allows the program to be composed from multiple different programs/components/libraries, so that their class names will not conflict and the components are easier to organize. See http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/java/package/index.html In Java it's customary to name packages as reverse domain names. For example, if your company's domain is "initech.com" and you are making a program called "Gizmo", the package names are typically prefixed "com.initech.gizmo", with subpackages for different components of the program.
