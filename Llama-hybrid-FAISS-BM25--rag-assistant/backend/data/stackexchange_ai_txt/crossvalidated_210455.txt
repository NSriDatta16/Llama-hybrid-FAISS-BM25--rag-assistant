Hyperparameter optimization with random search

I would like to do a random search for hyperparameter optimization. The procedure can be found in link . One possibility is to define a fine grid and take random combinations. A better approach would be to define a distribution for each parameter. I'm thinking about optimizing SVM with parameters C and gamma (RBF kernel) and also k-nearest neighbours. Of course C and gamma are continuous while k is discrete. What distributions can be choosen for C, gamma and k? Second, let's assume a random search optimization over parameters which have to sum to one. How could one incorporate this constraint into the search?
