Can one make Theorem numbers behave like subsubsection numbers in latex?

I would like to ask two questions about the numbering schemes in Latex for which I am unable to find any precise reference. I will be very happy if somebody could help me out on this. Question 1) Is it possible to number theorems and subsubsections consistently as follows: 2 Section two 2.1 A subsection 2.1.1 A subsubsection Theorem 2.1.2 : Note that theorem number is behaving like the subsubsection number. 2.1.3 Next subsubsection Theorem 2.1.4 Next theorem. 2.2 Next subsection So basically I want my Theorem numbers to follow the same numbering as a subsubsection. Question 2) Is it possible to make all the section and theorem numbers follow a paragraph number as shown below: 58 A paragraph Theorem 58.1. A theorem in para 58. 59 Next paragraph Theorem 59.1. Next theorem.
