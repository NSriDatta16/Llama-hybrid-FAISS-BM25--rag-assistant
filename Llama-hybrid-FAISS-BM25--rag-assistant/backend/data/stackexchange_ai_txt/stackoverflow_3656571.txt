I suppose that serving media through the Django is far away from the best practices. Correct. It is discouraged in the official documentation as well. Should it be avoided at all costs? ALL costs? Probably not. If the number of requests and the volume of data served is (quite) low enough then serving static files using Django will not affect the system's performance adversely. Does it seems reasonable to access these files via non-Django app (Perl script or something)? General answer: yes. It is difficult to give a better answer without knowing the details of what you are planning.
