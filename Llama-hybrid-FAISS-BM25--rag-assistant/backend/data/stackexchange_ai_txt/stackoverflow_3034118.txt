As has been mentioned, key it twice. Yes it's "double the work", but that leads to point 2. Make the surveys EASY TO KEY. They should be simple to read for the keyers. With section regarding their attention well highlighted so it stands out from the noise of the form. Your "GUI" shouldn't be. The GUIs primary benefit is "discoverability", these folks shouldn't be "discovering" anything. Keyboard navigation should be the "only" way once they start keying stuff in. One or two hands on the keyboard, one hand for changing survey page == no hands for a mouse. Attention to the screen (for a mouse, or anything really) is attention away from the survey for keying. The keyers should be "heads down", and not having to look at the screen at all. If practical, you can used audio prompts to tell the keyers where they've switched pages, to help ensure that what they're keying and what the computer is keying are basically the same thing. If audio prompts aren't possible, then simply have the entry people key in the page of the survey that they are on. The computer will already "know" it's on page "2", and so when the keyers keys in the page number, it can validate that they're on the same spot. DO use audible prompts for keying errors. Don't let them key in garbage, hit "save" and then correct errors. If you KNOW the data is wrong right away, STOP them and have them fix it immediately. Nothing catches their attention than 5 or 6 "ding ding dings", because they're already keying 3 fields later before they realize the computer stopped them. Auditing a long questionnaire for errors is a waste of time. Do NOT "scroll" your data screens. Page back and forth. Scrolling sucks. When you scroll, fields on the screens move. When you don't they're always in the same spot so when the entry person DOES need to look at the screen, they can always look at the same place. Because of this, drop down lists of any length -- suck. They shouldn't be using drop downs anyway, as they shouldn't be looking at the screen anyway. The form should TELL THEM EXACTLY what they need to key. Be consistent with the data entry. Use the 10 key as much as possible. If you have more than 10 options, and 0-9 isn't practical for the entire questionnaire, then you should use 00-99. Don't use A-Z for options, as people don't think of keys that way. They don't memorize letters on the keyboard as much as they memorize word patterns on the keyboard. 01-26 is far faster to key than A-Z any day of the week. Also, the SHIFT key is NOT your friend. But it'll be fine when they're in "typing english" mode. Finally, organize the survey so all the "typing", "fill in the blank" stuff is in one section (ideally at the end). This lets them 10 key the rest in a blaze, get in to a zone, and not have to move their hands back and forth. Many folks will "top key" numbers when typing "english" (i.e. use the top row) and 10 key numbers when not.
