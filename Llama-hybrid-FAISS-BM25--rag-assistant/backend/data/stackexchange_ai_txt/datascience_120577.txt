UMAP is not for clustering. It is just for dimensionality reduction. In the link you provided, UMAP is not used for clustering, just for dimensionality reduction. Specifically, they use BERTopic , which is a topic modeling technique that relies on UMAP. BERTopic takes sentence empeddings, applies dimensionality reduction with UMAP and does clustering with HDBSCAN.
