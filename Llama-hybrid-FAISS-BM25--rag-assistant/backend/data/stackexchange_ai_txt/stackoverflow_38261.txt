I'm not exactly a 'natural' scientist (I study transportation) but am an academic who writes a lot of my own software for data analysis. I try to write as much as I can in Python, but sometimes I'm forced to use other languages when I'm working on extending or customizing an existing software tool. There is very little programming training in my field. Most folks are either self-taught, or learned their programming skills from classes taken previously or outside the discipline. I'm a big fan of version control. I used Vault running on my home server for all the code for my dissertation. Right now I'm trying to get the department to set up a Subversion server, but my guess is I will be the only one who uses it, at least at first. I've played around a bit with FogBugs, but unlike version control, I don't think that's nearly as useful for a one-man team. As for encouraging others to use version control and the like, that's really the problem I'm facing now. I'm planning on forcing my grad students to use it on research projects they're doing for me, and encouraging them to use it for their own research. If I teach a class involving programming, I'll probably force the students to use version control there too (grading them on what's in the repository). As far as my colleagues and their grad students go, all I can really do is make a server available and rely on gentle persuasion and setting a good example. Frankly, at this point I think it's more important to get them doing regular backups than get them on source control (some folks are carrying around the only copy of their research data on USB flash drives).
