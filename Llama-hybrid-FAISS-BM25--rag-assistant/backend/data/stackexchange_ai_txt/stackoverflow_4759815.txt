OpenJPA enhancing a Spring ROO batch application

I'm quite new to OpenJPA and wanted to run my application. I've made a main method and load the context XML there and fire up a transaction to run my service in. But when I run it I get a org.apache.openjpa.persistence.ArgumentException: The type "class tld.myproject.domain.Entity" has not been enhanced. I Google'd around and found that I'd need to add an enhancer, so I added the following to my command line: -javaagent:/home/me/.m2/repository/org/apache/openjpa/openjpa/2.0.1/openjpa-2.0.1.jar Now, I get java.lang.LinkageError: loader (instance of sun/misc/Launcher$AppClassLoader): attempted duplicate class definition for name: "org/springframework/stereotype/Controller" Perhaps it's just getting late and I don't have my head screwed right on, but, what on earth is going on here? What do I need to do to get my Spring Roo batch project running? Cheers Nik PS, I should probably add that in my pom.xml Roo has defined an enhancer for the compile phase
