Is ANOVA a valid test for such application?

Context: Our company sells a product "A" to different region of the world. Our department measure the reliability of the product by measuring the % of product that failed and return by our customers. In each regions there are a several customers, but the same customer can't be in 2 regions. We measure customers satisfaction rate (= % reliable product) by year, within each region, and then average customers in the same year and region, so we get a total satisfaction rate / year / region. Objective: We want to assess if the average reliability of the product "A" is the same across regions or if some region are significantly different. Method: The proposed approach was to use an ANOVA the data below Questions: Is ANOVA a valid test to compare the mean of both this region ? If the test is positive (and we reject the null hypothesis: performance Region1 = Region2), is it reasonable to assume there is some causal relationship between the region and the performance? EDIT To clarify the question, the goal is not to estimate the reliability of each region but to assess if the difference between the average reliability in each region is statistically significant or not.
