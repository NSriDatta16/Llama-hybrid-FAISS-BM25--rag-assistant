So what, old people die - how does making a graph that shows the life expectancy really help anyone with anything useful beyond a infographic? From the perspective of this old person, it's not just that I'll die. At my age I know that viscerally, not just intellectually. What matters to me--and to the insurance systems like Social Security that will provide much of my financial support in the years that remain--is how likely I am to die, how soon. That requires quantitative analysis of the information provided in life tables. Say that I have savings of \$100,000 at retirement. If I know that I'm going to die in the next year and don't need to leave any bequests thereafter, I can spend all \$100,000 during the year. If, however, I have a reasonable chance of living another 25 years then I should only be taking about \$4000 per year from savings (depending on further quantitative assumptions about inflation, rates of returns on savings, etc.). That's a big difference from \$100,000. It's hard to live on \$4000 per year in the USA. Insurance systems have the advantage of being able to average the quantitative risks over large numbers of individuals. Insurance systems that spread risk among individuals were some of the first advances of civilization. As the Encyclopaedia Brittanica puts it : Insurance in some form is as old as historical society. The Wikipedia entry on History of Insurance shows how insurance has been central to commerce for millennia. Application of the principles to individual life insurance took much longer : "it was only in the 1750s that the necessary mathematical and statistical tools were in place for the development of modern life insurance." That's what life tables and the methods of analyzing them have made possible.
