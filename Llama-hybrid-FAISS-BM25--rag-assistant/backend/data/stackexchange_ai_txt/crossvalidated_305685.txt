Ternary Decision Trees

In general, you want to check the performance of basic machine learning algorithm in default settings to get a feeling for the underlying structures, before picking a model. I know every ternary tree can be represented as a binary tree. But why is this a reason to not use ternary trees? Of course they are computationally much more expensive but that is the same for other algorithms. Also, you could use them if the number of features is low but the hypothesis space is huge. Why not include ternary trees in the process of spot checking algorithms to see if they outperform binary trees?
