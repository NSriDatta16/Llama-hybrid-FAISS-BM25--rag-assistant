Some of the previous poster's have been using MC++, which is deprecated. C++/CLI is far more elegant of a solution. The BEST, technique for interop, is implicit interop, not explicit. I dont believe anybody has commented on this yet. However, it gives you the ability to marshal your types from managed native where if you make a change to your type definition or structure layout, it will not result in a breaking change (which explicit interop does). This wikiepedia article documents some of the differences and is a good starting point for further information. P/Invoke (explicit and implicit) Also, the site marshal-as.net has some examples and information as to this newer method (again, more ideal as it will not break your code if the a native struct is re-defined).
