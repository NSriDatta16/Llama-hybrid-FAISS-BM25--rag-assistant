I think you've got the basic MVVM issues. What you might still need is "What do I do when my app becomes too complex for MVVM?" That happens fairly quickly--more than a couple of views, and you get a view-model explosion, or you get monolithic view models that become cumbersome and very difficult to maintain. I'd suggest looking into the Composite WPF (Prism) framework as one solution to that problem. Prism is an architectural framework that simplifies partitioning an application into modules that are more-or-less independent of each other. Each module can have a view or two (one is probably most common), and each view can have its own view model. It does a great job of organizing communications among modules in a very loosely-coupled way. The modules load into a Shell window that can be configured however you need. Hope that helps!
