The comment from @whuber to this question is correct. The chart in question is not a histogram though if the same visualization showed different data it could be a histogram. A histogram doesn't have categories. It shows data continuously, in degrees, amounts or some other measurement. This could be modified to be a histogram by changing the input data. If it showed average GDP by degrees longitude (ordinal data) that could be displayed as a histogram. Continents (nominal data) however are not a measurement of degree or amount. I would avoid the term frequency as it implies a rate over time. This chart is: a nominal data bar chart a bar chart showing average GDP per capita by continent clear, that is, one who understands the data labels can understand the chart a visual summary of the data not a histogram
