How should I organize my C# code by using .cs files and classes?

I build websites with c# and put the code of each single functionality into one .cs file. However, the code of some functionalities can grow really large and become very hard to manage and debgug. To better manage the code in this kind of .cs files, should I sub-devide this .cs file into multiple .cs files (will this cause problem of the solution tree structure not as clear as before. Multi cs files only fulfill one same functionality) or should I create some inline classes (i.e., still in the same one single .cs file, but contains seveal classes)? It seems that I don't have enough knowledge about how to well organize the code in my project by using .cs files and classes. Is there any standards or guidelines that I should follow? Is there any book or ducuments can be recommended? Many thanks for your input! Wei
