I also couldn't find anything on google for this problem I thought would be common, I guess a lot of people are using display or visibility changes on their dropdowns instead of the superior left/right offseting (compatiblity wise). Anyway here is a more elegant solution which will result in all sub menus working first time around too. No need to change any of your existing code (like adding display:block). $("#nav li").hover( function() { $("ul", this).slideUp(0).slideDown(180); }, function() { $("ul", this).slideUp(180); } ); What this is saying: - Select all li elements - On an li hover, quickly SlideUp any child ul element, THEN slide it down at human animation speed - On mouseout SlideUp at human animation speed
