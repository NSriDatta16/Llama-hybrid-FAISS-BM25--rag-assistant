How to read/write data to mounted sdcard

is there any way to write data to a sdcard when the card is mounted as a disc via usb? I get an permission denied exception. If I unplug it everything is fine. I know I should be using Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory, but I don't think this would make any difference. Code: File file = new File("/sdcard/Test/test.txt"); BufferedOutputStream buf = new BufferedOutputStream( new FileOutputStream(file,true)); buf.write(str.getBytes()); Thanks, Nicholas
