Drupal 6 does this (which works in every browser known by me): Expires : Sun, 19 Nov 1978 05:00:00 GMT Last-Modified : Fri, 12 Jun 2009 08:01:46 GMT (the actual modification date) Cache-Control : store, no-cache, must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0 No pragma header in this instance. I'm not sure why your example doesn't work, it might be the negative timestamps, this works on ~250.000 Drupal sites :)
