Mean and variance of probability density with multidimensional indicator function

I encountered the following question while studying machine learning: We are asked to calculate mean and covariance of a given probability density function $$p(x) = \frac{1}{16} \cdot 1_{0 \leq x_1 \leq 4} \cdot 1_{-1 \leq x_2 \leq 3} $$ where $x \in \mathbb{R}^2$ and $1$ is an indicator function. I know the mean in a one-dimensional setting can be computed like so: $$\mu = \int p(x) x dx $$ What confuses me here are two things: How to compute the mean in a two-dimensional setting? If it involves integration: How to integrate the indicator functions?
