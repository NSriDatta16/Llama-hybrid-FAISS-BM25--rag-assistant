What's the name of the storage paradigm that uses cubes subdivided into 8 smaller cubes ad infinitum?

If I have a cube divided into 8 smaller cubes, each of which may be subdivided into a further 8 cubes, ad infinitum, what is the name of my system? I know that it's a special case of a tree, where each brance contains exactly 8 other leaves/branches. I remember the name starting with "Oct", and there was a wikipedia article on it, but I honestly can't find it! Does anyone know what such a data structure is actually known as?
