SQL 2008 Management Studio-- where to find table relationships?

I'm brand new to SQL Server 2008, and have some newbie questions about the diagram pane. I just dragged two tables onto it to do an inner join, and the console "knew" to create a one-to-many relationship between them. Where is this information kept in the Management Studio for me to look at closer? Thanks!
