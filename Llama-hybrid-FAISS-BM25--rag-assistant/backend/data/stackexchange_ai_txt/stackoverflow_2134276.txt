Where did you come across the chunk of code you have posted, any old java code base ? This is what the JLS has to say : 9.1.1.1 abstract Interfaces: Every interface is implicitly abstract. This modifier is obsolete and should not be used in new programs. 9.4 Abstract Method Declarations: For compatibility with older versions of the Java platform, it is permitted but discouraged, as a matter of style, to redundantly specify the abstract modifier for methods declared in interfaces.
