Your database should always enforce your assumptions about the structure of the data. It costs you nothing to do, but it serves as a last line of defense against corruption of your database. Never assume that a client side process is going to hand you well formed data. Your server side scripts should consider anything coming from a browser as having come out of the saddle bag of a dead Pony Express rider whose horse dragged him in from the frontier. Check on both sides. Setting your db column NOT NULL costs you nothing. Javascript uses the client's resources, so it also costs you nothing, and it gives your user instant feedback without having to communicate with the server. You can check that a field has data by checking that it's value attribute is not an empty string. Something like: if (formElement.attachEvent) { //handle IE formElement.attachEvent('onsubmit', function() { if (window.event.sourceElement.someFormElement.value === '') { // outline empty form in red or otherwise alert user of bad input return false; } else { // check other fields that can't be empty } } } else { formElement.addEventListener('submit', function() { if (this.someFormElement.value === '') { // outline empty form in red or otherwise alert user of bad input return false; } else { // check other fields that can't be empty } } } Returning false from the even handler prevents the form from being submitted.
