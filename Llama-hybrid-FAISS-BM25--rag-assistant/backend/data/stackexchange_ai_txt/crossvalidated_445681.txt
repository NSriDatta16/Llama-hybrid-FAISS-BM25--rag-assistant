I don't think this is a useful viewpoint. Computation with real numbers is, in a technical sense, impossible (most real numbers are uncomputable). However most computer programs use and manipulate (representations of) real numbers. In most cases, these are imperfect floating point numbers. Therefore is all the success of computing derived from the fact that we don't care about real numbers and/or how precise our floating point computations are? This is kind of an absurd conclusion. The success of computing comes from a large number of factors, such as the ubiquity of computers, the scalability of software, the usefulness of automation, the rise of the internet, etc. To blame it all on the imperfection of floating point numbers seems... quite forced. Likewise, it probably makes more sense to blame the success of neural networks on years of careful research and engineering effort rather than optimizers which don't necessarily arrive at the global minimum.
