Copying part of one XML DOM to another for XSL transformation (.NET)

The scope of XML and DOM in .NET 3.5 is so large that I'm having trouble coming up with a simple solution to my problem without using too many lines of messy code. Since people here always come up with some elegant solutions, I thought it would be a good question. How do I take in an XML file (that I created and saved earlier in the program) that has n instances of the 'unit' node beneath the root 'report' node to create an XML DOM that has the 'report' values and one 'unit'. I need to do this for each unit and then create an HTML file using my existing XSL transformation stylesheet on the new XML DOMs. I can already get it to work for all the units (the existing XML file), but I need a report for each unit. EDIT (per comment request): What it looks like: Name yyyy/mm/dd 127.0.0.1 localhost ..etc 255.255.255.255 broadcast ..etc And I want each of: Name yyyy/mm/dd 127.0.0.1 localhost ..etc and Name yyyy/mm/dd 255.255.255.255 broadcast ..etc
