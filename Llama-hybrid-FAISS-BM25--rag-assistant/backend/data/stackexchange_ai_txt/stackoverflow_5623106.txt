Seeking OSS charting library for 2-D grids, like the old Windows defrag

I'd like to chart some future chunks of work on my systems. Hours on one axis, hardware on the other, so I'd get various rectangles representing future activites, not necessarily rooted on either axis. I'm imagining something like the old Windows defrag, with different colored blocks for each pending block. I've looked at flotr , gnuplot , and some others. They're really slick, but none of them seem to have this particular device. Any suggestions? ( I've also thought about just toughing it out w/ Perl and GD and rolling my own. )
