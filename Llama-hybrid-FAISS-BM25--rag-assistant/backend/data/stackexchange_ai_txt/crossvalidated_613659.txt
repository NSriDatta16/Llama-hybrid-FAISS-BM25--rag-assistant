Here is a possible solution to your problem. Essentially, the idea is to estimate nonparametrically a bivariate density function to the data at hand and then plot it by means of contour levels. In order to compare the distribution across different groups, you can pick some representative contour levels for each group and draw them on the same plot. Needless to say, the choice of the estimation method is crucial and the sample size should be sufficiently large. In my answer, I'll use a kernel smoother which theory is explained in the book Multivariate Kernel Smoothing and Its Applications by ByJosé E. Chacón, Tarn Duong and implemented in the package ks of R . Other possible solutions are provided in packages sm and KernSmooth , but I'm not pursuing them further here. # generate some data first set.seed(12) n = 5000 x_ = rgamma(n = n, shape=10, scale=0.01) x = 1/x_ y = rnorm(n, 22, sd = sqrt(x)) library(ks) # compute the kernel density estimate # using the default parameters (playing with it # a bit may give better solutions) fhat = kde(cbind(x,y), compute.cont=TRUE) # figure plot(fhat,display="filled.contour",border=1, alpha=0.8, lwd=1) # another figure plot(fhat, lwd= 2, col = 1) points(x, y, pch=20, cex=0.1, col = 'gray') plot(fhat, lwd=2, add = TRUE, col = 1) The plotted curves are approximate probability contours. Here you see the contour levels of approximate probability content equal to 25, 50 and 75. Now, since your aim is to compare different distributions, that is, distributions from different groups, I suggest picking a few contours for each distribution, e.g. 50 and 75 for each group and placing them on the same picture, using different colours. Let's apply this to a real example. In particular, let's consider the iris dataset, and compute a kernel density estimate for each type of flower (e.g. setosa, versicolor, virginica) using the variables sepal length and sepal width. To show pictorially the estimated bivariate densities I've selected the contour plots with approximate probability coverage 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 0.95. Becuase the aim here is group comparison, we can compare one level at a time between the three groups. In the figure below, the contours with level 0.25 are shown in panel (a), the contours with level 0.50 are shown in panel (b) and so on. We note some degree of separation between the three groups, especially between the setosa and the other two groups.
