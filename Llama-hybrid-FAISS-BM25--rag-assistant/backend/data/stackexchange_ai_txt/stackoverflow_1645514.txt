Put something like this in your .ssh/config file: Host subversionserver Host=192.168.1.1 ProxyCommand = ssh 192.168.1.1 /usr/local/bin/nc -w 60 192.168.1.2 %p ForwardX11 = no User = myusername ForwardAgent = yes Then you'll be able to connect to your ssh server with just: ssh subversionserver Basically you'll log in to your public box and run the netcat command once you get in. Your desired to the subversion server SSH connection will be going over the netcat connection. Obviously you'll need to have netcat somewhere on your box. The version in my .ssh/config file has a wildcard Host and uses %h in the netcat command. Very useful when you want to proxy through for all the boxes in a production environment that you have to go through a DMZ to get to.
