Essential skills of a Data Scientist

What are the relevant skills in the arsenal of a Data Scientist? With new technologies coming in every day, how does one pick and choose the essentials? A few ideas germane to this discussion: Knowing SQL and the use of a DB such as MySQL, PostgreSQL was great till the advent of NoSql and non-relational databases. MongoDB, CouchDB etc. are becoming popular to work with web-scale data. Knowing a stats tool like R is enough for analysis, but to create applications one may need to add Java, Python, and such others to the list. Data now comes in the form of text, urls, multi-media to name a few, and there are different paradigms associated with their manipulation. What about cluster computing, parallel computing, the cloud, Amazon EC2, Hadoop ? OLS Regression now has Artificial Neural Networks, Random Forests and other relatively exotic machine learning/data mining algos. for company Thoughts?
