This question requires a long answer. I will point you to the right places. 1) Best solution is to use the free extension. I haven't tried it, but it will suit the purpose. You will have to do some CSS to achieve the right look and feel. http://www.magentocommerce.com/extension/1562/magento-easy-catalog-images Demo: http://extension01.templates-master.com/gb/electronics.html 2) I do not trust in modules as it might become difficult to upgrade if the vendor decided to stop supporting it. I have used the information from the following forum thread to create a vew sites. Have a look... Might not be straight forward. You might have to make some copies of core files to the local directory. http://www.magentocommerce.com/boards/viewthread/3770/P30/ Hopefully this will be of help to you :)
