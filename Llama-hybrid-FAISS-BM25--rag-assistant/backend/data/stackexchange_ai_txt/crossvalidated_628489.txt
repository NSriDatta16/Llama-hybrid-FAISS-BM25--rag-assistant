Significance test of the amplitude of sinusoidal regression

I am working on a multi-level logistic regression model with a binary outcome and a circular predictor. Thanks to this post , I know that I have to add sine and cosine of the circular variable as a predictor and that I can calculate the amplitude $a$ and the phase shift $\phi$ from the regression weights $w_1$ and $w_2$ corresponding to the sine and cosine predictors, respectively. $a = \sqrt{w_1^2 + w_2^2}$ $\phi = \tan^{-1}\frac{w_1}{w_2}$ Say I am not particularly interested in testing the significance of sine and cosine components individually, which is what the model provides. Instead, I would like to test the overall effect of the circular variable (i. e., the amplitude). My thought was to run a model comparison (in R, anova(m1, m2) ) between an intercept-only model m1 and the model including the circular variable m2 to obtain a $\chi^2$ statistic. However, I would like to know if there is a cleaner way of testing the significance of $a$ and $\phi$ - and how the corresponding standard errors are calculated. Thanks in advance for your help!
