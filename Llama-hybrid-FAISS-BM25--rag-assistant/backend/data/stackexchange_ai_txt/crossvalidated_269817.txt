I think you may use Dynamic Time Wrapping to look for similarities between different time series. In order to do that, you may need to discretize your wavelet into collections, like an array. But the granularity would be a problem and if you have a great number of time series, the computation cost will be pretty big to calculate the DTM distance for every pair of them. So you might need some preselection to work as labels. Check this out. I m also working on some task like yours and this page helped me some.
