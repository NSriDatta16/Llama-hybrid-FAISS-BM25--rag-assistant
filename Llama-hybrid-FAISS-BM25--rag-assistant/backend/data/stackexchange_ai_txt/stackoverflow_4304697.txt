Most decent way to multiply/divide array values by $var in PHP

Having an array of the type: $arr = array(23,4,13,50,231,532,3); $factor = 0.4; I need to produce a new array where all values of $arr are multiplied/divided by $factor . I'm aware of foreach method. Just thought, there must be a more elegant approach.
