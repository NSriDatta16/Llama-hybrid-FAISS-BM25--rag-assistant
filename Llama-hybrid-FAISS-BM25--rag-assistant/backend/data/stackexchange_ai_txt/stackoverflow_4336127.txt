I would not recommend this approach. JMS was born for this sort of thing. It'll be better than any implementation you'll write from scratch. I'd recommend using a Java EE app server that has JMS built in or something like ActiveMQ or RabbitMQ that you can add to a servlet engine like Tomcat. I would strongly encourage you to investigate these before writing your own.
