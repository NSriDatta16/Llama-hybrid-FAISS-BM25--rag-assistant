As many said, K is tecnically Kilo, meaning Thousand (of anything) and comes from greek. But you can assume different units depending on the context. As data transfer rates are most often measured in bits, K in this context could be assumed to be Kilo Bits. When talking about data storage, a file's size, etc. K can be assumed to be Kilo Bytes.
