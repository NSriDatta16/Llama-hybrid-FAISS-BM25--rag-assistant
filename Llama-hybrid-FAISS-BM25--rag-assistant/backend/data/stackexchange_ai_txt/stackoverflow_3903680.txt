C++ floats being converted to ints

I have the following function that should return an average of l1 - l7 . However, it seems to only return an integer. Why is it doing this, and how do I make it return a float rounded to 2 decimal places? Snippet: int lab_avg(int l1,int l2,int l3,int l4,int l5,int l6,int l7) { float ttl; ttl = l1 + l2 +l3 +l4 +l5 +l6 +l7; return ttl / 7.0; }
