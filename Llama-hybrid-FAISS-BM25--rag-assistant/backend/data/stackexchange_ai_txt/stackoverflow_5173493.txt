jQuery templates with html5 elements in ie8

I might be asking too much but I'm trying to get jQuery templates with html5 elements working in ie8. I'm using head.js so that's registering the html5 elements, I also tried html5shiv but no luck. There are other html5 elements in the page that work fine, but the jquery template system returns nothing if I use html5 elements in the template. Here's an example of one of my templates: ${name} {{each links}} ${name} {{/each}} If I change the html5 elements to divs and stuff the template works in ie8. I should note that this template works in all other browsers, no big surprise there... I put together a jsfiddle demonstrating my template: http://jsfiddle.net/keegan3d/E6EbG/1/ Is there anyway to get these html5 elements working in ie8?
