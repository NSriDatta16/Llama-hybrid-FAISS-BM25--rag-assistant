Certain things i would normally consider before going for arch change is what are the issues of current arch what am i doing wrong with the current arch.(if this had been working for a while, minor tweaks will normally solve a lot of issues) will it allow me to grow easily (here there will always be a upper limit). Based on the past growth of data, you can effectively plan it. reliability easy to maintain / monitor / troubleshoot cost 200GB is not a lot of data, and you can go in for some home grown solution or use something like a NAS, which will allow you to expand later on. And have a hot swappable replica of it. Replicating to storage of all the webservers is a very expensive setup, and as you said there are a lot of write operations, it will have a large overhead in replicating to all the servers(which will only increase with the number of servers and growing data). And there is also the issue of stale data being served by one of the other nodes. Apart from that troubleshooting replication issues will be a mess with 10 and growing nodes. Unless the lookup / read / write of files is very time critical, replicating to all the webservers is not a good idea. Users(of web) will hardly notice the difference of 100ms - 200ms in loadtime.
