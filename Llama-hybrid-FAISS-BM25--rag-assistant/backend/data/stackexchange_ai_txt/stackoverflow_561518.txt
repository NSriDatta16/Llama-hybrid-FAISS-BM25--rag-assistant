Is thread-local storage persisted between backgroundworker invocations?

Are backgroundworker threads re-used? Specifically, if I set a named data slot (thread-local storage) during the DoWork() method of a backgroundworker, will the value of that data slot persist, potentially to be found be some other thread at a later time? I wouldn't have thought so, but I have this bug... EDIT: This blog post suggests that BackGroundWorker utilises a ThreadPool , which implies that Threads are re-used. So the question becomes; do re-used threads potentially persist thread-local storage between invocations?
