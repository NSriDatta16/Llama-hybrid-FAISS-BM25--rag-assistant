Ordinal logistic regression - SPSS (using both scale and binary predictors)

I'm trying to do an ordinal regression in SPSS (to look at what health behaviors are related to an ordinal quality-of-life outcome). I have 6 predictors of interest and 5 covariates for control. However, about half of them are continuous/scale variables that can't easily be dichotomized (e.g. age, BMI, and a few scores for physical fitness and a sleep questionnaire). So my questions are: How should I interpret the odds ratios for the scale variables? These all have quite different ranges (e.g. 0-6, 0-300, and Age and BMI). I've heard that you can use the z-scores to standardize them, but am wondering if that's acceptable for a paper to be published. What else besides ORs and CIs are of value to report? Are there other tests to do that can tell me how good a fit my model is?
