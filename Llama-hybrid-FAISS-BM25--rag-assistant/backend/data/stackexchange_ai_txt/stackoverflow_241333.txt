you may be able to leverage py++ to parse the C++ source with GCC. Py++ does not reinvent the wheel. It uses GCC C++ compiler to parse C++ source files. To be more precise, the tool chain looks like this: source code is passed to GCC-XML GCC-XML passes it to GCC C++ compiler GCC-XML generates an XML description of a C++ program from GCC's internal representation. Py++ uses pygccxml package to read GCC-XML generated file. The bottom line - you can be sure, that all your declarations are read correctly. or, maybe not. regardless, this is not a trivial parse. @ RE based solutions - you are unlikely to find a RE that handles all possible 'awkward' cases correctly, unless you constrain input (e.g. no macros). for a bulletproof solution, you really have no choice than leveraging the real grammar.
