You could try using a web service for your reporting data source and test that, but you are not going to have unit tests for the rendering. This is the exact same problem you have when testing views. Sure, you can use a web testing framework like Selenium, but you probably won't be practicing true TDD. You'll be creating tests after your code is done. In short, use common sense.
