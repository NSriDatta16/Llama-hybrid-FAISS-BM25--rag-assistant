Is it possible to avoid local installation and use flat files for WiX?

Background: I always try to ensure the following tenet in my projects: After a fresh checkout a developer should be able to do all project related tasks with solely the contents of the combined folders. Obviously, this isn't always possible (e.g. Visual Studio for Windows development). However, I really dislike having to install any third-party libraries or tools that are specific a project like log4net, NHibernate, NUnit, etc. There are number of reasons for this including: For a given development machine, you may work on several different projects, all which leverage different versions of the same third-party library or tool. Minimizing the environment setup requirements makes setting up new developers or machines much easier Facilitates easier maintenance of automated builds Assumptions/Contraints I am currently using WiX 3 beta, but if there is way for either 2.0 or 3.0 please respond I am using Visual Studio 2005 The IDE syntax highlighting is not a requirement. Question: Is it possible to avoid local installation of the WiX toolset and use flat files instead? If so, please explain how. See Also:
