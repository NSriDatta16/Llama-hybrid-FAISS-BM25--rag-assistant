Well you could create your own function linker that can link together certain function "fragments" call orders and cache them to avoid overheads. It probably won't help you much though. A lot depends on the size of the functions. How close they are to each other in memory and all sorts of other things. There would be little point in removing function pointers, for example, if the 2nd function call was right after the first in memory as the start of that function would likely already be cached. Its not a simple question to answer even if you DID give us a few more details. As Mark says ... A profiler is your friend.
