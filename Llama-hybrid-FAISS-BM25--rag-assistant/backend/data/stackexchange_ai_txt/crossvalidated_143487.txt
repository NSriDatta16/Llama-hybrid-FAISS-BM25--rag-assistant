Independence-Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm

IMHA is an importance-sampling version of MCMC, where the proposal is drawn from a fixed distribution g. Usually, g is chosen to be an approximation to f. The acceptance probability becomes $r(x,y)=\min\{\frac{f(y)g(x)}{f(x)g(y)},1\}$. A random variable $Z$ has an inverse Gaussian distribution if it has density: $f(z) \propto z^{-3/2}exp \{ -\theta_1z-\frac{\theta_2}{z} + 2 \sqrt{\theta_1 \theta_2} + log \sqrt{2\theta_2}\}, z>0$, where $\theta_1 >0$ and $\theta_2 >0$ are parameters. It can be shown that $E(Z) = \sqrt {\frac{\theta_2}{\theta_1}}$ and $E(\frac{1}{Z})= \sqrt{{\frac{\theta_1}{\theta_2}} + \frac{1}{2 \theta_2}}$. Say I let $\theta_1 =1.5$ and $\theta_2 =2$. I want to draw a sample of size 1,000 using the independent IMHA. I want to use Gamma distribution as proposal density. How could I accomplish this using R? And would it be appropriate to assess the accuracy by comparing the means of $Z$ and $1/Z$ from the sample to the theoretical means.
