I am not sure about the specific problem i.e. variable names are not descriptive, or are they using variable names aren't in English, variable naming style is inconsistent etc. Either way, you can try to establish detailed coding standards and perhaps use code audits or reviews to enforce them. For example: Using "temp" as the name of local variables is not allowed Variables must be named so that the purpose of the variable is obvious Always use a consistent style to name variables (e.g. Camel Case) The key would be to publish these rules and enforce them for the entire organization.
