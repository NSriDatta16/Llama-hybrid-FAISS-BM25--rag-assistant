Usually this is not a technical problem. You control developer code theft by hiring a lawyer. It is difficult enough "protecting" redistributable .NET code, but I would think it is (nearly) impossible to protect the code against your own developers. Update: Here's also a constructive suggestion, for the sake of the challenge. Organize developers like a spy network -- have them work on individual modules based on agreed-upon specifications in separate geographical locations, with you acting as an information hub. Integrate the modules yourself or with the help of one trusted person. In this way, none of the developers have all the pieces to make the application work "at home".
