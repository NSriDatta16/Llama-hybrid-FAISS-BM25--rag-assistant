Processing data in the right manner in data science

From what i have learned, people say that it is more correct if i preprocess data after splitting it to train/test dataset. My questions are 1.Does it mean we detect flaws of the data + preprocess it after the splitting? if yes/no, why? 2.Is it okay if i detect flaws of the data before splitting it and then preprocess the flaws after splitting it? if it is/ no it is not, why?
