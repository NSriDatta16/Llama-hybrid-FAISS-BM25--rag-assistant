Don't store the libraries; they're not strictly speaking part of your project and uselessy take up room in your revision control system. Do, however, use maven (or Ivy for ant builds) to keep track of what versions of external libraries your project uses. You should run a mirror of the repo within your organisation (that is backed up) to ensure you always have the dependencies under your control. This ought to give you the best of both worlds; external jars outside your project, but still reliably available and centrally accessible.
