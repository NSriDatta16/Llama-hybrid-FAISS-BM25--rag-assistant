Probabilites in Random Forest Prediction

I am using Random Forest to classify my data into 2 classes. After building the model, prediction is performed with type="prob" which throws the probability matrix which has the probability of each record belonging to each class. My question is whether it is possible that the classifier throws equal probabilities for the two classes. Example class1: 0.5 class2: 0.5 If abovementioned scenario is possible which class should we consider?
