In this case to speed up performance on joins on "table_id" you should also store corresponding "created_on" in tables that you will mostly join. If you do that you can always join on both "table_id" and "created_on" so your "PARTITION RANGE ALL" turns into "PARTITION RANGE SINGLE". You can measure speed gains and weigh them against additional storage costs. Edit: How to keep both fields increasing together: ALTER TABLE my_table MODIFY created_on DEFAULT SYSDATE; And fill ID from sequence in all your inserts.
