Using C++ headers (.h) vs headers plus implementation (.h + .cpp), what are the disadvantages?

As a novice C++ programmer I have always put my classes interface in .h files and implementation in .cpp files. However I have recently tried C# for a while and I really like its clean syntax and way to organize files, in particular there is no dinstinction between headers and implementation, you usually implement a class for each .cs file and you don't need headers. I know that in C++ this is also possible (you can code "inline" functions in .h files), but up to now I have always seen a clear distinction between .h and .cpp files in C++ projects. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this approach? Thank you
