Well, I started with the Android developer documentation: http://developer.android.com/guide/index.html If that isn't as organized as you'd like for a complete beginner, you might want to try the FAQ since they have a lot of good tutorial links there, which happen to be very thorough: http://developer.android.com/resources/faq/index.html Once you get the basics, which the tutorials will do for you, the first link to the developer guide will be where you'll spend most of your time. There are even links in the guide for getting started with your IDE of choice, or getting started using no IDE at all. To get a more specific answer, you'll have to ask a more specific question.
