hierarchical Bayesian models vs. empirical Bayes

Would you consider the HBM vs EB to be two alternatives in which the hyperparameters are "in the game" of being sampled/estimated/etc.? There is clearly a connection between these two. Would you consider HBM more "fully Bayesian" than EB? Is there some place where I can see what are the differences between being "fully Bayesian" and the other alternatives? Thanks.
