Cross correlation with R

I've done a cross correlation but I'm not sure if what I'm doing is correct ... Here are the command lines I've used so far (this one is for the first time series. It represents the numbers of subscriptions for men and women on a website during the hours of the day) data (this one is for the second time series, which represents the time where ads have been shown on TV). I've add the time of the ads within a dummy time series. See this post for why I've done it in such manner : Time series and cross correlation ) hr (Then I correlate the time series with the command line below) ccf(data$men,hr,50) And I'm having this graph (see below) but it doesn't make any sense for me. If you have any clue, I will be glad to hear them.
