For some serious fun: apply Flyweight and store all instances in a bitmap? With a small memory device you don't need 4 byte pointers. [Edit] With Flyweight, you can have a separate storage strategy for each field. I do not suggest to directly store the string value in the bitmap, but you could store an index. The type is not stored in the bitmap, but in the unique object factory.
