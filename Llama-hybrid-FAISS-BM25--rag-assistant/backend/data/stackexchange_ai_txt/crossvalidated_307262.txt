Regression model to predict an individual's race

I have a database of individuals containing data about age , gender , place of living (census tract level) and income but nothing about race . Beside this, I have aggregate race data at census tract level, including percentage of white/non-white along with data about average income, proportion of gender and average age of residences in the census tracts. Can I somehow use the later database to predict race for each individual?
