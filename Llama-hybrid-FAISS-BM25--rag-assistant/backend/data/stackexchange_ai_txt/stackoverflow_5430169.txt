sqlcipher: failed to access DB providing hex key

I'm trying to create DB using sqlcipher and then access it by using hex value of password key. According to description from github (https://github.com/sjlombardo/sqlcipher) key is hashed by sha256 algorithm and then used to cipher DB. There is a choice to provide the key in plain and hex form through PRAGMA directive. And if I use plain version it all works correctly, but I unable to access DB with hex key value. For example in my case key is 'demo' and when I use PRAGMA key='demo' all works. I got sha256 with: echo -n demo | shasum -a256 2a97516c354b68848cdbd8f54a226a0a55b21ed138e207ad6c5cbb9c00aa5aea and then provided it to PRAGMA directive according to instructions in sqlite3_exec call: sqlite3_exec(db, "PRAGMA key = x'2a97516c354b68848cdbd8f54a226a0a55b21ed138e207ad6c5cbb9c00aa5aea'", NULL, NULL, NULL); but this doesn't work. What is the hex value of key should I provide to PRAGMA directive?
