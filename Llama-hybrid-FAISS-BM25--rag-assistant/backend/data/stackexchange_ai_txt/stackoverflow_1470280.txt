Unix tools in GUI for Windows

I am a Windows user and would really like to have the power of the Unix command-line for things to speed up programming. (clean up datafiles, search for occurrences of things in files, file/folder operations/ etc.) Now I know that using Cygwin and a few ports, I could use these command-line tools in Windows as well. However, the idea of diving into cryptic command-lines seems hardly tempting. Is there a GUI which has all the UNIX command-line tools, and which allows for simple drag/drop, connect the lines, set some properties, preview, and save the scripts?
