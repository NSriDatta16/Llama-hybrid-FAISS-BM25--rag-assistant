Microsoft Access to SQL Server - synchronization

I have a client that uses a point-of-sale solution involving an Access database for its back-end storage. I am trying to provide this client with a service that involves, for SLA reasons, the need to copy parts of this Access database into tables in my own database server which runs SQL Server 2008. I need to do this on a periodic basis, probably about 5 times a day. Is there an easy programmatic way to do this, or an available tool? I don't want to handcraft what I assume is a relatively common task. I am running this on SQL Azure, so there's no way for me to run prepackaged software on the server. It would either have to be open source and portable to Azure or executable on the client's computer. I'm unfortunately thinking I'm going to have to roll my own tool to do this. Any suggestions or more tools that are out there that can do this themselves before I go ahead?
