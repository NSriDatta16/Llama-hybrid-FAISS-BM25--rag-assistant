Output data from scikit learn logistic regression

I have run a logistic regression using scikit learn in python. I know want to output the results to put into a csv and then load into Tableau. To do that I need to combine the y_test, y_actual, and X_test data. I was wondering if there's a way to output the y_test, y_actual, and X_test data? I know I can use to_csv, but when I try that I can extract each of these data and concat together, but I'm afraid its not matching correctly since there's no identifying to join on. Alternatively, is there a way to keep a unique id (uid) with the logistic regression so then it's easy to see what the regression predicts for a specific person?
