How to request JVM garbage collection (not from code) when run from Windows command-line

how could I request Java garbage collection externally, starting the program from JAR (Windows BAT used)? From the Java code I can do it with System.gc() When running a JNLP distribution, I get this "Java console" turned on from Control Panel / Java / ... and this Java console provides manual garbage collection. But... When I'm running the jar from command-line / bat the java console doesn't seem to open. Couldn't find help with a brief googling, maybe somebody here?
