Location of tax calculation in source for Shopping Cart

can someone please tell me where the calculation of the amount of tax included in the total price of products is in Magento? Im looking at /app/code/core/Mage/Tax but don't know where to look at. Working with discounts calculates the tax wrong in version 1.4.0 and I desperately need help fixing this. Sadly the original magento forum is kind of abandoned... Greetz Spanky
