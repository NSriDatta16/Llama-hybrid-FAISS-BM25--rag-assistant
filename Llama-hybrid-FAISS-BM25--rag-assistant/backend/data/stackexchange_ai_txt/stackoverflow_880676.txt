The Platform is a Foundation One view of a software platform is as a foundation upon which other software relies in order to perform another task. This may seam a simple and rather obvious statement, but it's an important one. The Basics Should Be Easy A platform must have a purpose and platform developers should be aware of this when designing APIs so that it becomes obvious what the primarry use cases are and the APIs around them should be made as straightford as possible to use with respect to the way they are designed but also with respect to the doccumentation around them. Extension Points Should Be Obvious Extensibility in a platoform is about providing developers the oppotunity to extend or change the platform. If this is something you want to encourage then you need to make very clear the nature and limitations of this extensibility and provide a well-defined set of interfaces to allow for this. This might all sound obvious, but if you want a community to develop around a platform, that platform must have a use and extending it should be a straightforward experience. Sorry if this seams a little "achitectural astronaught", I do think I made some valid points, I may well have made them poorly, feel free to point this out or add to them
