No. Matching methods in this case have the same fragility as regression. They do not automagically control for any endogeneity sources. In assessment of treatment effect, both matching and regression base on the same Conditional Independence Assumption (CIA) (Angrist and Pishke, 2008), which is: $$ \{Y_{0i}, Y_{1i} \} \perp \! \! \! \perp c_i | X_i $$ As long as treatment depends on outcome it is a straight violation of CIA and estimator in both methods is biased.
