WPF has a lot of support for localization . Perhaps you can leverage that? Unfortunately I think that changing the user interface language at run-time is somewhat difficult and you probably need to come up with your own scheme. Also, as the view-model is UI agnostic I don't think storing user interface strings in the view-model is a good solution. These belong to the view.
