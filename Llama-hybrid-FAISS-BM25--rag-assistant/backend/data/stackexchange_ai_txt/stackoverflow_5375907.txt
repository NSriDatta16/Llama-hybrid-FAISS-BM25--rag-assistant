is more appropriate as per W3C recommendation: http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-bidi-css-markup Because directionality is an integral part of the document structure, markup should be used to set the directionality for a document or chunk of information, or to identify places in the text where the Unicode bidirectional algorithm alone is insufficient to achieve desired directionality. [...] You should therefore use dedicated bidi markup whenever it is available. Do not simply attach CSS styling to a general element to achieve the effect. User-agents that ignore CSS will also benefit from this approach.
