Intrinsic dimensionality estimation using Laplacian Eigenmaps

I learnt that I can look at the eigenspectrum of the kernel matrices computed by nonlinear spectral techniques in order to estimate the intrinsic dimensionality of a data-set. I use drtoolbox (The Matlab Toolbox for Dimensionality Reduction) to compute the laplacian eigenmaps of the data and the output is the low-dimensional representation of the data. How can I estimate the intrinsic dimensionality from this representation? Or, how can I know how "good" is my embedding? How does the process reveal the intrinsic dimensionality of the manifold? (we assumed the data does lie there)
