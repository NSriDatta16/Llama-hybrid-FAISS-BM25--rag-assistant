From an image, how do I determine the shade?

For a database app I'm trying to determine the average shade of a section of photo, against a colour scale. Being a novice I'm finding this very difficult to explain so I've created a simple diagram showing exactly what I'm trying to achieve. http://www.knockyoursocksoff.com/shade/ If anybody has the time to give me some ideas I'd be very grateful. Best wishes, Warren.
