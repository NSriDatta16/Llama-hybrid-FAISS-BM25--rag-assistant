Help calculating average per day

The daily_average column is always returning zero. The default timestamp values are for the past week. Any thoughts on what I'm doing wrong here in getting the average order value per day? SELECT SUM(price+shipping_price) AS total_sales, COUNT(id) AS total_orders, AVG(price+shipping_price) AS order_total_average, (SELECT SUM(quantity) FROM `order_product` INNER JOIN `order` ON ( `order`.id = order_product.order_id AND `order`.created >= '.$startTimestamp.' AND `order`.created getId().' AND `order`.fraud = 0 ) ) as total_units, SUM(price+shipping_price)/DATEDIFF('.$endTimestamp.', '.$startTimestamp.') as daily_average FROM `order` WHERE created >= '.$startTimestamp.' AND created getId().'
