I know what you mean; Matisse (NetBeans' GUI editor) lets you drag and drop self-assembled Containers (e.g. JPanels) into other Containers (e.g. JFrames), but any subsequent changes in the former will not be reflected in the latter. As far as I know, that's just the way it works, unfortunately. It's one of the reasons I think Matisse can only be used for quick prototyping and toying around. For anything serious, the GUI must be hand-coded.
