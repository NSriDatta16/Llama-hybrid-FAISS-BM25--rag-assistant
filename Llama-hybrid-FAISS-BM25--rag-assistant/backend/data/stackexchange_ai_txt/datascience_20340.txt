python xgboost DMatrix - get feature values or convert to np.array

I'm trying to create a custom evaluation metric (feval) function for xgboost.cv. It should process some of the training features, however I can't find a way to extract features from xgboost.DMatrix() object (only labels).. As I was suggested it can be done with first making a DMatrix slice then saving it to a svmlight file and finally reading it with scikit-learn, but is there a more elegant way if doing it?
