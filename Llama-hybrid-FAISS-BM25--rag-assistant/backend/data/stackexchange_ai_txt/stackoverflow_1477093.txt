Prior to MySQL 5.0.3, a VARCHAR could only store up to 255 characters. To store up to 65535 (64KB) characters, use a TEXT column. To store up to 16777216 (16MB ) characters, use a MEDIUMTEXT column. To store up to 4294967296 (4GB) characters, use a LONGTEXT column. See the storage requirements section of the manual for caveats on their usage. Versions of MySQL after 5.0.3 can store up to 65535 chars in a VARCHAR (However you cannot store more than 65535 bytes in a single row).
