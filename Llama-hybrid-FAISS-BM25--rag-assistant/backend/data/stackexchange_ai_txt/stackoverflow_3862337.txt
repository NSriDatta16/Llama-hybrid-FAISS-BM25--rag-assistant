You need to either Have the JS file parsed by PHP, by naming it filename.js.php or by changing the server's configuration for PHP to parse .js files. This is not optimal however, because a resource-intensive PHP instance will be started for every script request. Alternatively, much better IMO, do the necessary checks in a tag in the embedding document , and store the results in JS variables that the embedded external scripts can query. This way, your script files can stay static. In your case, this would mean something like this. In the main document: .... now, include external JS files .... this will give you the JavaScript variable main_check_a that you can use in your external scripts.
