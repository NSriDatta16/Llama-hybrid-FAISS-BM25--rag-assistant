Sample balancing with batting averages

I'm trying to compare regional batting averages year over year (using comparable time periods i.e. August of each year) but I'm running into what I think is a sample imbalance. This is an extreme example, but say hypothetically a player goes 10-for-10 one day (double-header) and on the same relative day the next year, he goes 1-for-1. In both cases, his batting average for that day is 1.000. However, he obviously did much better the first day, but from an average perspective, there is no difference. Because of the regional data and time period assumptions I need to use, I will sometimes have 25 observations one day and 1 observation the same relative day the next year. I ran a Wilcoxin-Mann-Whitney test on the monthly samples comparing the two years (since the daily data seems to be too small) and they generally show no difference in the medians, but I'm looking for some opinions on if/how to balance the data by at-bats, rather then going strictly off of the batting average. Because of the collection method, I only have samples and at this point I am unable to gather additional data.
