What does "all else equal" mean in multiple regression?

When we do multiple regressions and say we are looking at the average change in the $y$ variable for a change in an $x$ variable, holding all other variables constant, what values are we holding the other variables constant at? Their mean? Zero? Any value? I'm inclined to think it's at any value; just looking for clarification. If anyone had a proof, that would be great too.
