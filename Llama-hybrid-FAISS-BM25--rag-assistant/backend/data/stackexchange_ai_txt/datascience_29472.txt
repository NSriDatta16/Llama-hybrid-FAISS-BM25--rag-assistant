Spatial Transformer Networks vs Deformable Convolutions

As I understand STN as described by the the deepmind paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02025 allow a neural network to learn how to perform spatial transformations on the input image in order to enhance the geometric invariance of the model. whereas Deformable Convolutions https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06211 add 2D offsets to the regular grid sampling locations in the standard convolution. From the paper: ...deformable convolution does not adopt a global parametric transformation and feature warping. Instead, it samples the feature map in a local and dense manner. To generate new feature maps, it has a weighted summation step, which is absent in STN. To me STNs augment the input image whereas DC augment the kernel shape. Results should be similar/same in terms of field of view of the network? Please correct me if mistaken.
