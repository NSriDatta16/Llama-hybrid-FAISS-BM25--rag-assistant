Lua could be a good solution. What I'm really wondering is how complex could be to integrate your rules engine with a scripting language that allows users to write their own rules. A good approach can be to embed everything (the rule engine too) inside the scripting interpreter, otherwise you would end up writing a lot of code to bridge what an user writes into the script with the related rules used in your program. However designing such programmability requires much attention to what your language should be able to do, starting from a little core of utilities and then extending it; or you can really plan a lot before starting the whole implementation but for my experience (I wrote like 3-4 interpreters so far) the better way is to fit it while developing it, of course with the feedback of the users: it will be necessary, because you can suppose how good they are, but I wouldn't count on it.
