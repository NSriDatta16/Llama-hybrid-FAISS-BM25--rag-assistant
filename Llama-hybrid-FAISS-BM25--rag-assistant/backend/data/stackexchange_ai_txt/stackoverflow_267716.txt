If you're going to implement your own custom user control, you could do a Fisheye Grid like this: Dead image link This example shows a full-size 3x4 panel moving around within a 9x10 table. Since (I assume) you don't need to edit this data, the UI could just be something where the user grabs the panel and drags it around. If you're really masochistic and/or have lots of free time, you can even have multiple fisheye panels on the same grid, allowing you to compare one or more regions of the grid simultaneously. Update: Silverlight has one of these , apparently. Sort of.
