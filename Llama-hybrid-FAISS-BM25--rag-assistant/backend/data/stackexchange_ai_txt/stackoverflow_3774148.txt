dont forget the grand-daddy of them all - tcl there is a c++ wrapper for tcl which makes it incredibly easy to embed i am using it in a current project in previous (c#) project I used lua over python. In older c# projects I had used python; I chose lua because the syntax is more normal for average scripter (used to vbscript or javascript). However I will change back to (iron)python for next c# project; lua is just too obscure For c++ I will always use tcl from now on EDIT: My new favorite is jint (.net javascriptt interpreter) v easy to use, nice interface. And nobody can complain about the language given that js is the cool language at the moment
