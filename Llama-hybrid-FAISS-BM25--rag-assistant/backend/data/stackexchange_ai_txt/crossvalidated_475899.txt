Yes, the PCA loadings components represent the "contribution" of each original variable. These can be positive (same direction) or negative (opposite direction). Then you perform the clustering using the PCA scores as new variables. You can estimate which of the PCA components contribute more to each cluster in multiple ways (feature importance, statistical test, etc.). Then you can infer the contribution of the original variables to each cluster, by looking at the weights of the PCA loadings corresponding to components found in the previous step. This interpretation is quite arbitrary because, as said, the loadings are a combination of all variables with large or small weights. One simple strategy is to rank the weights based on their absolute values and extract the top $N$ variables. Then you can see each loading as approximately dependent on these variables.
