Regarding 1). As far as I know, it is not an explicit assumption of PCA that the variables be Normal. However, since PCA is based on correlations/covariances, there may be effects on the results from using variables that are long tailed. In particular, the points at the tails may have large effects on the correlations (how large depends on the exact nature of the distribution). I suggest making a scatterplot matrix of all the variables and seeing if they look reasonable. If you transform the variables, the meaning of the PCA will change somewhat (since the variables change). Regarding 2). As with any OLS regression, it is not assumed that either the DV or the IV are normal. It is assumed that the errors as estimated by the residuals are normal. You can plot these after running the model
