It's probably work reading the Wikipedia article on Unit Testing , as this will answer most of your questions regarding why . The JUnit web site has resources for writing a Java unit test, of which the Junit Cookbook should probably be your first stop. Personally, I write unit tests to test the contract of a method, i.e. the documentation for a particular function. This way you will enter into a cycle of increasing your test coverage and improving documentation. However, you should try to avoid testing: Other people's code, including the JDK Non-deterministic code, such as java.util.Random JUnit is not the only unit testing framework available for Java, so you should evaluate other frameworks like TestNG before diving into it. In addition to "top-level" frameworks, you will also find quite a few projects covering specific areas, such as: HTMLUnit for Web SIPUnit for SIP SwingUnit for GUI Code
