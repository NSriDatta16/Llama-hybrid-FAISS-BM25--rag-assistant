The Morgan-Pitman test is the clasisical way of testing for equal variance of two dependent groups. For $n$ pairs of randomly sampled observations $(X_{11}, X_{12}),...,(X_{n1},X_{n2})$ define $U_i = X_{i1}-X_{i2}$ and $V_i = X_{i1}+X_{i2}$ for $(i=1,...,n)$. Then under $H_0: \sigma_1^2=\sigma_2^2$ the correlation of $U$ and $V$ is zero. If the distributions of the two variables differ in shape then you should use a robust method of testing the hypothesis of $\rho_{uv}=0$. A good description is in Wilcox's Modern Statistics for the Social and Behavioral Sciences (Chapman & Hall 2012), including alternative ways of comparing robust measures of scale rather than just comparing the variance.
