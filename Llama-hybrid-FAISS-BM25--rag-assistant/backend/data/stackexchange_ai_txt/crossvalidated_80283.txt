PCA on linguistic variables: How far languages are?

I performed principal components analysis on continuous variables describing 16 languages. Using the first two axes, which explain 76% of variance, I need to calculate the distance between each pair of languages as appeared on the first two axes; to test in a Mantel test the correlation between distances in linguistic variables and geographic distances. Could anyone help me: how can I do that? cheers
