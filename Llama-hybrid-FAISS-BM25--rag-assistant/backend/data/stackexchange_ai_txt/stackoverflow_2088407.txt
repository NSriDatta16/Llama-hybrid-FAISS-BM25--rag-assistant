Magento has more than one way of matching URLs. modules can register their own patterns, and these will generally be of the form /module/controller/action In addition, CMS pages have URL identifiers and these can be anything you like - they can contain /s to give the illusion of hierarchy, but they're not significant. Finally, Categories and Products have URL identifiers and there's a whole table of URL rewrites that map a path (/[category]/[subcategory]/[product] for example) to a product. In your example, I would guess that the product's URL identifier is 'test123' and that the store is setup to suffix URLs with '.html' So, there's no file to look in (in this case), but rather the database/admin area.
