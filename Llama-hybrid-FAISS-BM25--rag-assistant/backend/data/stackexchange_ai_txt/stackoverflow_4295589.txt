Based on my findings, it turns out that all CCN applications require a CCNx Daemon. This is only based in C right now. So you have to build the C code with all the dependencies. The Java code actually calls the ccnd (CCN Daemon) to run with the ProcessBuilder. I wrote up a blog post about how I got it to work for Ubuntu... but its basically. C Source Dependencies: sudo apt-get install git-core python-dev libssl-dev libpcap-dev libexpat1-dev athena-jot Run: ./configure Build CCN with: make Test with: make test Start the ccnd: ccndstart The blog post has more details.
