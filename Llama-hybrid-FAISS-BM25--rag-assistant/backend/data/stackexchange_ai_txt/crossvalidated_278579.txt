K-fold cross validation for hierarchical data sets in a mixed effects framework (glmer)

I would like to evaluate the predictive performance of my mixed effects logistic regression model using package lme4 (glmer). My model is as follows: glmer(R0A1~MP_Scaled+MPHW_Scaled+HW_Scaled+YP_Scaled+AG_Scaled+SS_Scaled+PR_Scaled+SR_Scaled+(1|Animal_ID)+(1|Year),data=males, family=binomial(link="logit"),nAGQ = 0) My data set is structured as follows: The only packages that I've found to be useful is DAAG or cv.glm; however, these packages are based on generalized linear models. Given the nested structure of my data (locations of animals nested within Animal ID), would these packages be appropriate to conduct a k-fold cross validation. In other words, I would have to remove the random effects and run the packages, which I wonder whether that influences the output, especially given the hierarchical structure of the data.
