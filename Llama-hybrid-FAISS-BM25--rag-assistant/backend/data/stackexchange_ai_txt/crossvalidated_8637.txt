Almost the same question was asked recently on the ISOSTAT listserver (frequented by college professors): If you had a strong undergraduate student who was interested in learning about various multivariate methods (e.g. PCA, MANOVA, discriminant analysis, ...) is there a good, accessible book you might recommend she/he purchase? Here are the responses: Perhaps " Applied Multivariate Data Analysis ", 2nd edition, by Everitt, B. and Dunn, G . (2001), published by Arnold. [Roger Johnson] Rencher 's Methods of Multivariate Analysis is a great resource. I think a strong undergraduate student could grasp the material. [Philip Yates]. I'm fond of Rencher's approach. He offers good intuition and examples. But the matrix algebra can get pretty thick; I'm not sure "accessible" is an adjective I'd use. Nevertheless, I've taught undergrads successfully with his book. His second edition is a good improvement over the first. [Paul Velleman] Applied Multivariate Statistics by Johnson and Wichern . [Brad Hartlaub] I haven't done much with it, but I do like the idea of using modern techniques and modern data sets: Modern Multivariate Statistical Techniques by Alan Julian Izenman . (I own the book, it has the topics you are looking for, and the text seems accessible.) [Johanna Hardin]
