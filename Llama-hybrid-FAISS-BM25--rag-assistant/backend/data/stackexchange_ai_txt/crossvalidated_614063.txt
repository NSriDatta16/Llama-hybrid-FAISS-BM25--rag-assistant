Spearman coefficient and PCA

I have a question about the Spearman rank correlation coefficient. In this reference ( https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.16224.pdf , Fig. 4) they use the spearman correlation coefficient instead of the standard correlation coefficient to perform PCA. This is for me appealing because it removes the need of normalization when the variables have different units. But the theory I know about PCA diagonalizes the Pearson correlation matrix. So my question is: Is it common to perform PCA on top of the Spearman rank correlation coefficient? Is there a theory behind this?
