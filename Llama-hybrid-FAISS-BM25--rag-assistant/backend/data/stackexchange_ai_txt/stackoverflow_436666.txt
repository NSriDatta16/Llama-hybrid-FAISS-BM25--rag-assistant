Does Low Pro Prototype DOM Builder work in IE?

Dan Webb's Low Pro UJS extension to Prototype offers the following elegant DOM Builder: var listItem = $li({ id : 'item-1' }, $strong("Some text") ); // returns a node equivalent to: Some text $('a_list').appendChild(listItem); While this works like a dream for us in Firefox and Safari, it explodes with delight in IE 6 and IE7 with the error "Object doesn't support this property or method" Any insight into what Dan Webb's DOM Builder might be doing to wrap Element.new that isn't compatible with IE?
