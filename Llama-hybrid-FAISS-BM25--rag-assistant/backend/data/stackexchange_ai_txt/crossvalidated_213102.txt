I don't know a package you mentioned, but what you can do as well is to check "importance" of variables the same way it's done in random forests or boosted trees. Firstly, choose appropriate loss function (if your Y is continuous, one common choice is RMSE; for categorical variables you can take multiclass logloss). After that, take each variable, and check increase/decrease of your loss function after permuting it - if the loss is huge, it means that the levels of your variable are important for your prediction.
