I would start by doing a simulation to get a sample of $y$ values when $n=n_{new}$ from the training distribution. Then subtract of $y_{new}$ from the $y$ sample you got, and check if it's credibly non-zero. Here's some code to do that: modelDescription = " model { for( i in 1 : ny ) { y[i] ~ dbin(p[i],n[i]) p[i] ~ dbeta(alpha,beta) } alpha ~ dunif(0,1e3) beta ~ dunif(0,1e3) #some priors... } " sampleSize=500 y=rbinom(sampleSize,10,0.5) n=round(y*10)-rbinom(sampleSize,2,0.5)+rbinom(sampleSize,2,0.5) #set p=1/10 with someRandomFluctuactions n 0 dataList = list( ny = length(y) , y = y , n = n ) parameters = c("alpha","beta") #this is just a wrapper I have for rjags::coda.samples and dclone::codaSamples test1 = bjmCreate("model1",parameters,modelDescription,dataList,60000) require(coda) test1p In the code above, we got an alpha and beta sample from MCMC, now we are going to generate a sample for $y$ when $n=50$ We model $y$ as $y \sim Binomial(n,p)$. So to generate sample for $y$, we need to do y . We know the value of $n_{new}$, but we don't have $p$, but we can get a sample of it by remebering $p \sim Beta(\alpha,\beta)$, so we get a $p$ sample from p . So, by pluging one thing into the other: newN = 50 #setting here the value of N for which we'll predict y p Now we have a sample for $y$ when $n=50$, and our work would be done if we just wanted to predict it. But instead, you want to check if it an specific value of $y$ is from that distribution, so we do newY = 5 yDiff And check if the difference between both is credibly zero. #Analisys of HPD print(HPDinterval(mcmc(yDiff))) densityplot(mcmc(yDiff)) I got the following result from densityplot(mcmc(yDiff)) : lower upper var1 -4 4 attr(,"Probability") [1] 0.95 That is, zero is within the 95% HDP, and thus, we can not reject the hypothesis that the proposed $(y_{new},n_{new})$ "comes from the same model as the training set". This, in fact, makes sense since the our "true" value p=1/10 is exactly the values we used ($y_{new}=5$ and $n_{new}=50$).
