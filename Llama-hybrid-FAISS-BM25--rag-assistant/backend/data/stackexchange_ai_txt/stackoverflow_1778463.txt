You will want to use a well supported XML format for this, as it will allow you to leverage the work of others. A well supported XML format is DocBook XML - http://www.docbook.org/ - and this - http://sagehill.net/docbookxsl/index.html - appears to be a good resource on doing the XML -> PDF using XSLT with the Docbook style sheets and other formats. This approach allows you to use any XSLT processor and any XSL/FO processor to get to your result. This gives you easy scriptability as well as the freedom to switch implementations if needed - notably older Apache FOP implementations degraded badly when the resulting PDF got "too large".
