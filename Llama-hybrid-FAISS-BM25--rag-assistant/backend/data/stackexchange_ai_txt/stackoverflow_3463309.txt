Netbeans Matisse GUI Builder ... separate GUI containers in more than one class?

By default, Netbeans will create all of your drag and drop components into a single class file. I am using a JPanel with 3 tabs. I would like to separate each tab as a separate class in Netbeans Matisse. Is there such a way of doing that, or am I stuck with a one class implementation under this GUI builder?
