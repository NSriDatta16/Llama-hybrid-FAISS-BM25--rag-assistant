Your problem is that window.location.href is a property, not a method. You're trying to set the browser location by code along the lines of: window.location.href("http://www." + address) What you should be using instead is window.location.href = "http://www." + address; If you change your bookmarklet accordingly, it seems to function correctly (i.e. it takes me to www.cnn.com when I paste it into my address bar). I thought about posting the corrected code here but on reflection I think that would be patronising.
