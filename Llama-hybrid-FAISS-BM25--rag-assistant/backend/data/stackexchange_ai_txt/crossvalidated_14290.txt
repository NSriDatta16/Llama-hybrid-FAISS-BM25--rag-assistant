I think your problem is an ambiguity in language. I have always seen "Average Treatment Effect" with Intent-to-Treat as a subset of ATE. For example: ITT analysis is estimating the ATE among those in the treatment arm of a trial. "Treatment of treated" is estimating the ATE among those actually treated .
