How can I insert source code from Xcode into OpenOffice without getting an paragraph for every single line?

That's important for good documentation, but currently it just doesnt work well. If I copy source code from Xcode editor into OpenOffice Writer, then every single line is an own paragraph. I have a paragraph style for source code, but because of multiple paragraphs I get a lot of unnecessary spaces. Could i program a macro that combines these source code paragraphs to a single paragraph, or is there an easy-going way to handle that problem? Maybe some setting in Xcode for text-formatting when copying something to the clopboard?
