Compare skewness of many distributions with few observations

I have a dataset with page view data for about 500,000 users, divided into two groups. Each user can visit up to 5 pages, each as many or as few times as they want. So for each user, I have the distribution of number of visits to each page. I would like to compare the 'average skew' in distribution between the two groups. Roughly, users in one group are more likely to have distributions that look like this {3,0,0,0,0} and users in the other group are more likely to have distributions like this {1,1,0,1,0}. How can I compare the degree of skewness between the two groups? I thought of using the average Gini coefficient or entropy for each group, but each user has so few observations. How can I do this?
