It sounds like your class that gets an instance of your singleton delegate doesn't know what it implements. make sure you are #import ing your delegate to the class that uses it as [[UIApplication sharedApplication] delegate] . Also, if you get a warning about UIApplication not conforming or whatever, you can cast it to your AppDelegate type to avoid it. To answer your question about what this call returns, it is a singleton throughout the lifecycle of the app. To answer the 2nd question, having it in the UIWindow (and thus in the appdelegate) is fine, and probably encouraged, since it is the root controller of your app (from the sound of things)
