Here's something. When nothing else is working, Hold and rules can usually get the job done. I'm not sure it produces the correct results w.r.t. your graph-coloring question but hopefully gives you a starting place. I ended up using Slot instead of named variable because there were some scoping issues (also present in my previous suggestion, x$ vs. x ) when I used a named variable that I didn't spend the time trying to work around. g[edges_] := With[{ors = (Hold @@ edges) /. {a_, b_} :> #[[a]] == #[[b]]}, Function[!ors] /. Hold -> Or ] In[90]:= f = g[GraphData[{"Path", 3}, "EdgeIndices"]] Out[90]= !(#1[[1]] == #1[[2]] || #1[[2]] == #1[[3]]) & In[91]:= f[{1, 2, 3}] Out[91]= True In[92]:= f[{1, 1, 2}] Out[92]= False I feel like it lacks typical Mathematica elegance, but it works. I'll update if I'm inspired with something more beautiful.
