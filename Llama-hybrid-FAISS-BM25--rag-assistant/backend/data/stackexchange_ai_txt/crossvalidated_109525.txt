At this moment, there is no 'rule' as how to divide a data set into a training, validation and testing set. However, 80/20 ( Pareto ) is a popular and widely accepted way of dividing your data set. This translates into 80% training(1) and 20% testing. That 80% training(1) is then divided into training(2) and validation data in the same way (80/20). That's about the same as the 60/20/20 that @Jacob Mick suggested in the other answer (and perhaps more straight forward). As you mentioned a time series, I wouldn't use k-fold, but rather a holdout sample for your validation and testing (aka 1-fold). More specifically, the last part of your data. Otherwise you'll be going/predicting back in time and forth during optimization. Something I would avoid. For your formula...I really don't have enough information about the values to tell you whether it's a good formula in this case.
