Is GZip compression worthwhile with AMF

We've got a Flex/Java application using BlazeDS and we're investigating reducing the size of the payloads being passed between our server and the client. Since AMF is a binary format and supposed to be fairly compact, is there any benefit to turning on GZip compression? Has anyone else done this before and did you see any significant gains from using compression? UPDATE I just performed a simple test to determine what kind of compression ratios we might expect if we were to enable gzipping. I just captured the AMF payloads in some files and just gzipped them using the Linux command line version. I didn't specify the level of compression, just the default i.e. 'normal'. It appears that on average there is a 9% reduction in the payload size, with some payloads getting as much as 61%. Can anyone see a flaw in this method and what level of compression can be used in HTTP gzipping?
