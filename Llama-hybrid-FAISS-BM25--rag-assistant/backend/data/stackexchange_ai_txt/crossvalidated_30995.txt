How would one graph the results of subjective rank order?

I'm looking for way to visualize subjective rankings, separate from my non-parametric tests. I've asked 12 participants to rank 8 different items according to different subjective criterion (separate rankings for each one). For any individual set of rankings, I'm looking for a good way to visualized the high-level trends of the rankings. I've tried both bar and radar plots on the average rankings, and I've seen one other person use a scatter/balloon plot over the number of responses per ranking, but I'm not quite sure what conveys the best overview. Either I can use the 8 mean rankings, or the the 8 counts of each ranking per item. Edit: For example: Each column is an item, each row is a person's ranking of each of the eight items. Not a particularly strong agreement in this example, but in general would like to understand the best way to convey the overall trends. Item: A B C D E F G H Rater: 1 6 8 1 7 3 4 2 5 2 1 3 8 7 6 5 2 4 3 5 8 7 6 1 4 2 3 4 5 8 7 6 4 2 1 3 5 1 2 8 7 4 3 5 6 6 1 7 8 5 6 2 4 3 7 5 1 8 4 7 3 6 2 8 4 2 8 7 6 1 5 2 9 6 3 8 4 7 1 5 2 10 3 2 8 7 4 1 5 6 11 2 3 7 8 1 5 4 5 12 8 5 6 7 2 3 1 4
