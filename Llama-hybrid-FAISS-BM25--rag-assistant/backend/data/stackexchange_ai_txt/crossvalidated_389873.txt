The approach you are describing sounds like complete subset regression (CSR) by Elliott, Antoni, Gargano and Timmermann, see here . If you are behing a paywall, here is a working paper version. In CSR you first estimate all models with k -parameters. If you have a total of K parameters, this means you estimate n = K! / ((K - k)!k!) models where k . Then, you get the prediction for each of the n models and average them, for instance using the simple mean.
