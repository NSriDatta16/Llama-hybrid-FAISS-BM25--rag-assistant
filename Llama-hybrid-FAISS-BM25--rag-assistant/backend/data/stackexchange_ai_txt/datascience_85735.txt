To clarify the questions raised by the user in response to the correct solution given by Erwan - the solution proposes going back in time to prepare the data across a series of timestamps. There will be multiple points in time 't' where the input would be all the various features on the patients health, medication, reports etc..you need to see how best they can be converted to representational vectors. The labels would be a binary and indicate whether the patient lived after t+N days..where N can be 30,60,240 etc. 't' itself can be taken week on week or month on month. Once data is prepared this way, it becomes a binary classification exercise. The only additional consideration which can be added is - there could be elements of RNN here. The training data is not independent of one another and may contain recurring data of the same patient over multiple timestamps and perhaps there is a scope for capturing this information to model the situation better.
