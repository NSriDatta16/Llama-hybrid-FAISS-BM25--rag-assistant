Since you have only two groups, there is no need to perform an ANOVA. You can perform a TOST procedure by simply building a confidence interval (CI) for a two sample problem, say x and y, where x = MP2-MP1 in the control group and y = MP2-MP1 in the treated group. You need to pay attention to the usual assumptions for the statistical tests: normality, heteroskedasticity, etc. But, once you have your CI, you can see if it is contained within the +-delta region or not. In R you can do something like this: set.seed(12) x = rnorm(100) y = rnorm(70) # for two sample t-test with equal variances tt Here, to illustrate the idea I'm considering three type of tests but there are many others in the literature. Hope this helps.
