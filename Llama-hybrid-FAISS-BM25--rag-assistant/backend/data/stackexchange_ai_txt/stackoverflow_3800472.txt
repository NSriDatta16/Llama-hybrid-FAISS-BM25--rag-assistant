I agree with @Silvo's answer. The AW_Blog extension is written using the preferred Magento approach. Posts, tags, comments and other Blog artifacts are all implemented using Magento models and collections, and accessed through regular Blocks and Views. The blog writing interface is integrated into the Magento back-end, so you have consistency of authentication and authorisation. All of which means that it is much less likely to break in future, unlike Mage_Enabler or other "faux" integrations. I've used the AW_Blog extension and been very satisfied with it's functionality. IMHO, there's no need to integrate Wordpress (insert Blogging engine of choice) for the sake of it. HTH, JD
