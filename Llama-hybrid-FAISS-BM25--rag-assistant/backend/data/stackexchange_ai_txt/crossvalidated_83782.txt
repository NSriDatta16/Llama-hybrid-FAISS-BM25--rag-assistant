Comparing multiple classifiers over a single dataset

Im doing a comparison between 4 classifiers : A linear SVM, a random forest classifier, a multivariate gaussian and a neural network, for a dataset with 50 features and 10000 examples, the observations belong to 2 classes. What is the best way to compare them ? I mean, should I use F-score, Precision/Recall or maybe logloss to see which one performs better on the test subset?
