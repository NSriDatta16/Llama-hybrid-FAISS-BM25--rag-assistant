How would you synthesize it? By using the function. The function would give you the output for given inputs at any pixel. Interpolating two images doesn't make any sense though, you're probably interested in using interpolation for resizing. It also has some interesting properties. A sinc interpolator is equivalent to running the image through a brick wall low-pass filter in Frequency space. For two images, your function would perform some sort of addition or averaging, whatever you're interested in. If you're synthesizing something, interpolation is equivalent to running it through a low pass filter. For instance, if two images are sampled at different rates and you want to put one on top of the other, you'd want to interpolate the lower rate over the higher rate sampled image.
