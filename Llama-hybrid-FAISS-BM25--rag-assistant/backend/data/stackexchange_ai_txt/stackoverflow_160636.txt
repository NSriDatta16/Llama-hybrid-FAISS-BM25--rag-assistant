The underlying problem is that I am developing some Django, but on more than one host (with colleagues), all with different settings. I was hoping to do something like this in the project/settings.py file: from platform import node settings_files = { 'BMH.lan': 'settings_bmh.py", ... } __import__( settings_files[ node() ] ) It seemed a simple solution (thus elegant), but I would agree that it has a smell to it and the simplicity goes out the loop when you have to use logic like what John Millikin posted (thanks). Here's essentially the solution I went with: from platform import node from settings_global import * n = node() if n == 'BMH.lan': from settings_bmh import * # add your own, here... else: raise Exception("No host settings for '%s'. See settings.py." % node()) Which works fine for our purposes.
