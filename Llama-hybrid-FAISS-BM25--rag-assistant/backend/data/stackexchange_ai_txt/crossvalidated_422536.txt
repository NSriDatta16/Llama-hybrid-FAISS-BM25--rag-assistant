How do I predict future scenarios after training and validating my model?

Problem I'm new to machine learning and need a little activation energy to get me past this sticking point. I've trained/validated/tuned, and tested a random forest model. Therefore, I've used my entire data set and now want to use my random forest to predict (this is the whole point of creating a model in the first place). Theoretically and practically, how would I go about doing this? I'd like to use the model output and create a user defined function so that I can run the model on incoming data. I apologize for my noobness.
