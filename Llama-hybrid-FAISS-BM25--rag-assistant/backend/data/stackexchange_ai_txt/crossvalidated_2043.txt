The R psych package includes various routines to apply Factor Analysis (whether it be PCA-, ML- or FA-based), but see my short review on crantastic . Most of the usual rotation techniques are available, as well as algorithm relying on simple structure criteria; you might want to have a look at W. Revelle's paper on this topic, Very Simple Structure: An Alternative Procedure For Estimating The Optimal Number Of Interpretable Factors (MBR 1979 (14)) and the VSS() function. Many authors are using orthogonal rotation (VARIMAX), considering loadings higher than, say 0.3 or 0.4 (which amounts to 9 or 16% of variance explained by the factor), as it provides simpler structures for interpretation and scoring purpose (e.g., in quality of life research); others (e.g. Cattell, 1978; Kline, 1979) would recommend oblique rotations since "in the real world, it is not unreasonable to think that factors, as important determiners of behavior, would be correlated" (I'm quoting Kline, Intelligence. The Psychometric View , 1991, p. 19). To my knowledge, researchers generally start with FA (or PCA), using a scree-plot together with simulated data (parallel analysis) to help choosing the right number of factors. I often found that item cluster analysis and VSS nicely complement such an approach. When one is interested in second-order factors, or to carry on with SEM-based methods, then obviously you need to use oblique rotation and factor out the resulting correlation matrix. Other packages/software: lavaan , for latent variable analysis in R; OpenMx based on Mx , a general purpose software including a matrix algebra interpreter and numerical optimizer for structural equation modeling.
