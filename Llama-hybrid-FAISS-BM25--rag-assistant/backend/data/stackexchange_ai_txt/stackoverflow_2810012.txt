VS 2010 Test Runner error "The agent process was stopped while the test was running."

In Visual Studio 2010, I have a number of unit tests. When I run multiple tests at one time using test lists, I sometimes reveive the following error for one or more of the tests: The agent process was stopped while the test was running. It is never the same test failing, and if I try to run the test again, it succeeds. I found this bug report on Connect , which seems to be the same problem, but it does not offer a solution. Has anyone else seen this behaviour ? How I can avoid it ? Edit I am still experiencing this bug, and so is many of my colleagues on the same software/hardware setup. I have evaluated the answers so far, but they don't resolve the problem. I am starting a bounty for a solution to this problem.
