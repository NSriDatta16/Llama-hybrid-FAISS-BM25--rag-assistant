The group means you are using (41%, 53%) depend strongly on the seed. These appear to be not actually the true marginal average probabilities of your model - note that these were averages of only 1000 samples. I expect if you instead computed group means over a df_cond_cov that had e.g. 1 million rows, this would fix the issue and probably give you a more reasonable-seeming answer -
