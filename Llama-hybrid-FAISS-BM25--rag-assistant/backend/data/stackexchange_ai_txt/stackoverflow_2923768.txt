In none of your choices have you considered whether you wish to be able to search your wiki. If this is a consideration, having the 'live' copy of each page in a database with full text search would be hugely beneficial. For this reason, I would personally go with storing the pages in a database every time - otherwise you'll have to create your own index somewhere. As far as version logging goes, you only need store the live copy in an indexable format. You could automatically create a history item within your 'page' model when an changed page is written back to the database. You can cut down on the storage overhead of earlier page revisions by compressing the data, should this become necessary. If you're expecting a massive amount of change logging, you might want to read this answer here: How does one store history of edits effectively?
