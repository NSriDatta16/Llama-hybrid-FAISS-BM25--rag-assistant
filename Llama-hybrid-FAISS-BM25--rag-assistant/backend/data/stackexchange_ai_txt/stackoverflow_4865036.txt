I finally solved my problem : after moving my pieces of code a bit around, I could see that the javascript console was showing me an annoying error, and that I had several versions of the same object, each time I went back on each tab. error : Error: uncaught exception: cannot call methods on draggable prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'destroy' The initialization: $('#editbox_0').dialog(...) was creating a div in the main frame (with all the tabs) every time it was (re)loaded. But the main thing was related to a single problem : I was using Jquery UI v. 1.8.5, and I found out that there was a bug in this version concerning the method : draggable("destroy") Updating to UI 1.8.9 solved everything... I wasn't wrong, the library was :) Anyway, thanks everyone. (Should I close the question, or let it open in case someone has the same problem?)
