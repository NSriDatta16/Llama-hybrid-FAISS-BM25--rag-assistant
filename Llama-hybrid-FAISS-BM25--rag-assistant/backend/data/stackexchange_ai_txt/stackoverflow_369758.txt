How to trim whitespace from a Bash variable?

I have a shell script with this code: var=`hg st -R "$path"` if [ -n "$var" ]; then echo $var fi But the conditional code always executes, because hg st always prints at least one newline character. Is there a simple way to strip whitespace from $var (like trim() in PHP )? or Is there a standard way of dealing with this issue? I could use sed or AWK , but I'd like to think there is a more elegant solution to this problem.
