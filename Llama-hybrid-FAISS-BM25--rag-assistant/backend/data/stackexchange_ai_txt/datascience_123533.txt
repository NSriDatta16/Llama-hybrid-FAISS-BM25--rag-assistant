The main difference is that Conformal Prediction is a much better framework because it is: distribution free works with any model without ... provided mathematical guarantees of validity for final samples of any size. In comparison Bayesian frameworks produce posterior in the wrong place (unless using synthetic data where the data distribution is exactly known), interfere with the underlying models and do not have any mathematical guarantees of validity.
