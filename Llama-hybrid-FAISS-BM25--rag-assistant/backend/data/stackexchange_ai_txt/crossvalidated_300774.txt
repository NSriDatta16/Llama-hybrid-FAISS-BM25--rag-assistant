The UCI Machine Learning Repository [1] is the first place I look for datasets and dataset related questions. It turns out that, yes, there are in fact 88 datasets listed with fewer than 10 attributes and a good number of these have six or fewer. Some classic examples include: Chess (King-Rook vs. King) - Chess endgame database for White King and Rook against Black King (KRK); Iris - Perhaps the best known database to be found in the pattern recognition literature. From Fisher, 1936; LED Display (seven binary attributes) - LED displays contain seven light-emitting diodes and emit one of the ten decimal numbers; and Yeast (eight attributes) - Predicting the cellular localization sites of proteins.
