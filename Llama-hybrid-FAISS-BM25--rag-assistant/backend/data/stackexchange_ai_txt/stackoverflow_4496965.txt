Best practice around using UIViews as containers for background etc

While designing the views in IB, i find it simple to use the UIVIews as containers for other controls. I use this to give a special background color etc.. Is this a good practice or should i be doing something else ? I guess i could programmatically draw a Rectangle. But i'm trying to leverage IB as much as i can. Thanks
