We're using Capistrano and Integrity for a CI server. Integrity is quite easy to hack on and you could really easily set it up to automatically deploy on a pass of all tests, and I'd recommend all of them as good tools; Integrity has plenty of plugins available. We currently have Integrity spit out each build's pass/fail and code coverage % into an IRC channel and manually deploy.
