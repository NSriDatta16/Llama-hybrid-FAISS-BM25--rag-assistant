ASP.NET file transfer from local machine to another machine

I basically want to transfer a file from the client to the file storage server without actual login to the server so that the client cannot access the storage location on the server directly. I can do this only if i manually login to the storage server through windows login. I dont want to do that. This is a Web-Based Application. Using the link below, I wrote a code for my application. I am not able to get it right though, Please refer the link and help me ot with it... Uploading files to file server using webclient class The following is my code:- protected void Button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) { filePath = FileUpload1.FileName; try { WebClient client = new WebClient(); NetworkCredential nc = new NetworkCredential(uName, password); Uri addy = new Uri("\\\\192.168.1.3\\upload\\"); client.Credentials = nc; byte[] arrReturn = client.UploadFile(addy, filePath); Console.WriteLine(arrReturn.ToString()); } catch (Exception ex) { Console.WriteLine(ex.Message); } } The following line doesn't execute... byte[] arrReturn = client.UploadFile(addy, filePath); This is the error I get: An exception occurred during a WebClient request
