This would be quite a reasonable approach. SQL does not really do recursive structures well, although some systems such as Oracle or SQL Server have a recursive query function. Although you may find a structure that works better for specific search types I don't think you will find an appreciably better structure in the general case. If your application's requirements are limited in this way, such an optimisation may bring you benefit. As a bayesian network is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), a purely recursive parent-child relationship is not sufficient to model the network (i.e. a node can have more than one parent), so a M:M relationship of the type you've described is going to be necessary. Various of the 'SQL for Smarties' books by Joe Celko give a good overview of techniques for implementing and querying hierarchical and graph structures in SQL. These are by far the best resource on the subject that I know of. Highly recommended.
