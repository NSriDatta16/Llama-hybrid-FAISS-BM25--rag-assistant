Positive and Unlabelled data classifier

I have few customers and am supposed to find 'similar' people from a pool of customers and non-customers, what approach would you follow to solve such a problem? The key point here is that non-customer labels are not provided. I have heard of One-class classifier and Positive Unlabelled Classifier, my question is more on the lines of the caveats of using a standard classifier like Xgboost to train over this dataset by using a random set from the pool as 'non-customers'. Would this be a fair approach?
