Implementing IUnknown, unresolved external symbol

I am trying to create a class that implements the IUnknown interface. I have the following code in the header file: #pragma once #include "stdafx.h" #include "Unknwn.h" class Vmr9Presenter : IVMRImagePresenter9, IVMRSurfaceAllocator9 { public: Vmr9Presenter(void); HRESULT Initialize(void); ~Vmr9Presenter(void); STDMETHODIMP QueryInterface(const IID &riid, void **ppvObject); }; I have included the relevant uuid.lib and several others. However, when I attempt to compile, I get the error: Error 2 error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol "public: virtual long __stdcall Vmr9Presenter::QueryInterface(struct _GUID const &,void * *)" (?QueryInterface@Vmr9Presenter@@UAGJABU_GUID@@PAPAX@Z) Vmr9Presenter.obj VmrPresenter This leads me to believe that something isn't getting pulled in. Any suggestions on how to get rid of this error?
