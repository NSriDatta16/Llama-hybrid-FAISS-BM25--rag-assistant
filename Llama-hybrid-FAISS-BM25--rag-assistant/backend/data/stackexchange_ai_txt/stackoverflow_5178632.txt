firefox extension localStorage problem

I tried to save values in localStorage but it does not work. Maybe I forgot something. First I was thinking localStorage was not enough so I extended it to window.localStorage. Do I have to call some special library to access it? My Firefox version is above 3.5. Here is my code: var ID1 = document.getElementById("id1"); var ID2 = document.getElementById("id2"); window.localStorage.setItem("IDF",JSON.stringify(ID1)); window.localStorage.setItem("IDS",JSON.stringify(ID2)); var RUN1 = JSON.parse(window.localStorage.getItem("IDF")); var RUN2 = JSON.parse(window.localStorage.getItem("IDS")); alert(RUN1 + RUN2);
