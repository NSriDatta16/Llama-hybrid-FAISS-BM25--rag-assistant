A cloud-based relational database (SQL Azure, with the Azure platform) is similar to a regular relational database such as SQL Server, except that you don't have to worry about licenses, installation, hardware upgrades, customizations, disk allocations (e.g. where to store your transaction logs), etc. The upside is that you can deploy a new database server in under a minute, add databases in under a minute, and simply work with your application without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. SQL Azure also provides durable storage: All writes are replicated on at least three separate disk areas, so that you don't have the risk of data loss. You still need a backup plan, as a DELETE statement is instantly replicated as well, but you don't have to worry about disk failures. An on-premises database server has more flexibility when it comes to overall disk size, CPU selection, etc. However, SQL Azure offers a high-performance, high-availability database 'as a service' for you to build an application upon. Some of the other answers here are comparing SQL Azure with Azure Storage (a non-relational set of tables, blobs and queues). You can certainly look at those options, but your question was specific to relational databases in the cloud.
