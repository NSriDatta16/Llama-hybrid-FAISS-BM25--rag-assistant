SQL: how to get all the distinct characters in a column, across all rows

Is there an elegant way in SQL Server to find all the distinct characters in a single varchar(50) column, across all rows? Bonus points if it can be done without cursors :) For example, say my data contains 3 rows: productname ----------- product1 widget2 nicknack3 The distinct inventory of characters would be "productwigenka123"
