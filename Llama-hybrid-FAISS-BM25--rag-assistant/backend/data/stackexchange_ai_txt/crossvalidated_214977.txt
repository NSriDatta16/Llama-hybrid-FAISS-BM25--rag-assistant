The residuals from such tobit models will often look non-normal (typically right-skewed) due to the censoring. This makes it difficult to apply standard classic techiques such as graphics or diagnostic tests for linear regression models (like the Breusch-Pagan test). One thing you can do, though, is to fit a heteroskedastic tobit model where the dependence of the variance on some covariates is included. And instead of using a latent normal distribution you could also employ a distribution with heavier tails such as the logistc or t distribution. All these approaches are available in the R package crch (for censored regression with conditional heteroskedasticity). So you can fit models, say with constant variance and with heteroskedasiticy, and then compare these models by means of information criteria (AIC, BIC, ...) or likelihood ratio tests etc. Of course, there are further sources of misspecification problems, e.g., omitted regressors, misspecified functional form etc.
