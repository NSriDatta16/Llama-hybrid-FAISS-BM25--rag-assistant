How does one estimate the number of trees and the depth when using random forests?

I am using random forests for a class. I am predicting weight training. In scikit learn I always used a rule of thumb of a depth of 5, the depth x features rounded. I had 53 features, rounded to 50 x 5 and got 250 for number of trees. I picked 250 trees and 5 node depth and got great results. I got 98% accuracy for my test set (100% for training). The data set is for coursera machine learning. The data set is at d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv I removed seven features that were unrelated. The predictor is classe. Well, it works again, but I have no formal basis. I would appreciate any guidance,
