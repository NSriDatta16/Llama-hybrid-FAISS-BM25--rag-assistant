I don't know the exact context in which you are using this, but you should probably change the LinearLayout to a relative one (it's a simple change in to your textViews adding the following: For the first text: android:layout_alignParentLeft="true" For the next texts android:layout_toRightOf="@id/previous_text" If you are embedding this inside other LinearLayouts, perhaps you should also reconsider whether you can use relativeLayouts there too as per the efficient layout guidelines provided below: http://developer.android.com/resources/articles/layout-tricks-efficiency.html Let me know if this helps with some kudos ;) Thanks and good luck!
