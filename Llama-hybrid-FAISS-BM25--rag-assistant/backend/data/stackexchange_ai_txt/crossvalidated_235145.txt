What constraints does Std Deviation, Mean and Median put on the data?

I know there is no correct answer to this problem, but it seems a very common question among students who receive their own grade and want to be able to understand what it means. They know (with example data): lower bound: 0 upper bound: 100 Std Dev: 23.32 Mean: 87.07 Median: 95 Their own grade: 98 And they want to visualize the data in some way, in order to understand, did I crush it, fail hard, or pretty much do the same as the rest of the class. I understand that I can not render a graph fro the data But I did make some fake data that matches this data. Student score 1 87.07 2 95 3 95 4 95 5 95 6 95 7 95 8 95 9 0 10 90 11 92 12 80 13 95 14 98 15 98 avg : 87.00466667 Median : 95 Std Dev : 23.67277561 My question is, what constraints does standard deviation put on the data? Can that help me understand how many students may have failing grades for instance? I think I completely understand that Median is the middle, so to have a very high median like the sample data would mean most students are scoring very high. I think I understand Mean also, the average of the students is also pretty high. Is that correct?
