WPF: Limiting Valid Control Part for Dragging Operation via DependencyObject

I'm asking this question after reading this answer on StackOverflow. The supplied answer works great for allow you to move a whole control. But supposed I have a Usercontrol I've created like so: I only want the control to move when I'm mouse clicking on the header part of the control, Grid.Row[0] (orange part). I don't want the control to respond to drag operations when clicking on the rest of the control. How can I accomplish this?
