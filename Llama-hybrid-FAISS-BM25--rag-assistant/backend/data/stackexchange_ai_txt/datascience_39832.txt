When creating a classification model, should predictors with little correlation to the response variable be included in the model?

I am building a predictive model designed to predict attrition within my organization. I am trying to decide whether to add certain predictors to my model. I used a Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test to check the correlation between a few of my predictor variables and my response variable and found that the predictors are independent from my response. Should I still include these variables in my model? I am leaning towards no due to the lack of correlation with my response variable but don't want to discard a potential "split" in my decision tree. My data set contains 8,225 observations and 173 columns which I have been using as predictors.
