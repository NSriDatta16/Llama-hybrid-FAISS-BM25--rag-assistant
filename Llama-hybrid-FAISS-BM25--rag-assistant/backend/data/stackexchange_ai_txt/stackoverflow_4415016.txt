How to prevent popping sound when generating iPhone audio with remoteIO?

So, a little while back I was working on a wave generator app and having some problems, but Kenny Winker was a real lifesaver and helped me to basically get everything going. One problem I ended up with, however, is the fact that whenever I change the value of the frequency I'm using (and to a much lesser extent when I change the value of the volume), I end up with these ugly crackly "popping" noises. This is a problem as the whole point is to be able to smoothly alter the frequency and volume of a wave with a slider, and what sounds like crumpling paper can really ruin that effect. Here is the code of my OSStatus that controls volume/frequency. OSStatus playbackCallback(void *inRefCon, AudioUnitRenderActionFlags *ioActionFlags, const AudioTimeStamp *inTimeStamp, UInt32 inBusNumber, UInt32 inNumberFrames, AudioBufferList *ioData) { SlidersViewController *me = (SlidersViewController *)inRefCon; static int phase = 1; for(UInt32 i = 0; i mNumberBuffers; i++) { int samples = ioData->mBuffers[i].mDataByteSize / sizeof(SInt16); SInt16 values[samples]; float waves; for(int j = 0; j mBuffers[i].mData, values, samples * sizeof(SInt16)); } return noErr;} As you might see, the obj-c variables "fr1"-"fr4" control frequency, while "vol1" to "vol4" control amplitude. These values are updated every time - (void) touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event {} or - (void) touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event {} is triggered. Any ideas on how to fix this to make it sound smoother? Thanks!
