Is the average of n independent Laplace random variables a Gaussian distribution?

Does the average $\frac{\sum^n_i X_i}{n}$ converge to a normal when $n \to \infty $ . Here $X_i$ are independently distributed Laplace samples, with zero mean, and different standard deviation $\sigma_i$ . I know this can be applied from the general Central Limit Theorem However, I am not sure if the Laplace distribution satisfies Lyapunov condition ?
