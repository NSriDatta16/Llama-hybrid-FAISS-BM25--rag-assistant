Probably not at all ! Your data might disclose changes in parameters over time or deterministic changes in error variance over time suggesting Weighted Least Squares or the need to identify and incorporate latent deterministic structure like pulses, step/level shifts or local time trends OR the need to incorporate seasonal dummies to deal with seasonal structure (often a good choice ! ). Post your data and let's find out what your data knows. EDITED AFTER RECEIPT OF YOUR DATA: To review , auto.arima in a brute force list-based procedure that tries a fixed set of models and selects the calculated AIC based upon estimated parameters. The AIC should be calculated from residuals using models that control for intervention administration, otherwise the intervention effects are taken to be Gaussian noise, underestimating the actual model's autoregressive effect and thus miscalculates the model parameters which leads directly to an incorrect error sum of squares and ultimately an incorrect AIC. The acf of the original is useful in assessing ARIMA structure ( that's the big print ! ) when there are no deterministic factors/features in play like period # ( that's the small print ! ) . Here is the acf of the original data . Your 301 values are indeed non-stationary BUT there is more than 1 remedy for non-stationarity. Your series has deterministic effects for certain periods in the 43 period cycle . See I have correlogram ACF and PACF below for a temperature time series. Can I say it is MA(2) from ACF? What about AR? for a similar but different but related discussion. I took your 301 values into AUTOBOX a piece of software that I had helped to develop and I asked it to tell me what it could find out by studying the 301 historical values. It hesitated for a very brief amount of time and told me the following. Here is the Actual /Fit and Forecast graph 3 : https://i.stack.imgur.com/lbD0m.png and a less busy Actual/Forecast . The USEFUL equation that was found ( Note all models are "rong" but some are useful and some are very wrong ) is here in two parts. and providing clarity that the arima portion is simply (1,0,0) . The statistics for the model are presented here The residuals look pristine with a very clean acf . A closeup of the forecasts is here .... You said " I therefore applied a seasonal differencing for seasonality=43 " ... and I say that the data says no . Periods 1-8 AND 36-43 ... are definitely non-players as they have little or no impact on what you are measuring. It turns out your data had a lot to say about itself ... With respect to your NON-SIGNIFICANT VARIANCE ... this is probably due to a numerical flaw in the software that you used ...
