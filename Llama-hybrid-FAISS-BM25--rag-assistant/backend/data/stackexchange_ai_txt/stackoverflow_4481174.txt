C# WebBrowser or Normal Browser

I'm getting "banned" message from a forum site cause of my windows application which tries to connect over webbrowser control by this code: webbrowser1.Navigate("http://www.xyz.com"); I can connect without any "banned" message with my normal browsers both IE8.0 and FireFox 3.6. I cannot find any differences between my application and normal browser. It seems "banned" message is not related my IP address, cookies or header info (User-Agent, HTTP-Accept) Please help: How can this forum site realize my request coming from normal browser or application? Note: Sorry for my English. Thank you for your understanding.
