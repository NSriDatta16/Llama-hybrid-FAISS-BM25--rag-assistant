A clean way of adding width boundary in HTML markup

Take the following markup: My test for StackOverflow LOGO_WOULD_BE_HERE The title of my page Blah blah blah Copyright (c) 2011 The World. This is all fine, clean and semantic - however, imagine that the main, wrapping block elements need to have a background which takes up the entire width of the page, and your content needs to be within a width boundary (for example a container of min-width: x; max-width: y to allow elasticity). The 'easy' way would simply be to create a width-boundary class, that you wrap everything in, for example: The title of my page Blah blah blah With CSS similar to: .width-boundary { min-width: 400px; max-width: 960px; margin: 0 auto; } This is an ugly solution though, as you end up with a bunch of wrappers all over your nice new markup. I'm keen to hear of any elegant solutions to this - with as little additional as markup as possible and whatever is added should be semantic. Here is a playground I've setup on JSFiddle .
