A few more options / areas to look at... I have experencied busy Magento installs with lots of products and orders, taking an extended amount of time to redirect to Paypal on clicking "Place Order". This is probably your actual problem and upgrading is the way forward, try upgrading to 1.4.2.0 (final 1.4 stable release)... but normally in this circumstance the process would complete after an extended wait (60sec long and more!!!)... The fact that your checkout redirects to the cart page when you have many items may well be a timeout issue. Magento redirects back to cart from checkout submit when an error occures in the transfer to payment gateway page, so the page timing out or PHP running out of memory would result in you being redirected back to cart... You should check:- Apache: "Timeout" normally set at around 120 (secs) consider increasing PHP: "max_execution_time" 18000 (secs) - Magento friendly figure Also try increasing PHP setting "memory_limit" in the .htaccess file... setup 64, 128, 256 really increasing past 256 should not be an required. Also start logging yopur PHP errors: log_errors On Hope this helps P.s. My original solution is clearly not correct as your failure only happens when you have multiple products in your cart...
