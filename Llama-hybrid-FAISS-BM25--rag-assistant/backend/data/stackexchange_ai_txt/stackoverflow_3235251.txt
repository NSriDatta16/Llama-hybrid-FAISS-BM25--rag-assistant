Just kill'em. No, really, if someone writes boilerplate code and doesn't care to improve it, I doubt we may call him professional. It often happens that management wants to see tasks done fast and only thing that's left is to push out some write-only boilerplate code just to make them happy. If your management encourages such approach - change your job.
