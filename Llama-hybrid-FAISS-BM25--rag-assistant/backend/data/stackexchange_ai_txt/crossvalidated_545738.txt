Definition and Taxonomy of Seasonal Time Series

I want to categorize a large number of time series into non-seasonal and seasonal divide the seasonal ones into a small number of subgroups by type of seasonality Are there any formal definitions/taxonomies of seasonality out there? Or is this an "I know it when I see it" kind of phenomenon (to paraphrase Justice Potter Stewart)? I don't want to reinvent the wheel here, so I am curious if there is existing wisdom on how to do this well. Here are a couple of off-the-cuff ideas: A simple concentration-index definition could be the sum of the squared shares of the total for each time unit: $$\sum_{t=1}^{T} \left(\frac{y_t}{\sum_{t=1}^{T}y_t} \right)^2 $$ When that sum exceeds some threshold, a series would be considered seasonal. A more complicated approach would be to decompose a time series into trend, seasonal, cyclical, and idiosyncratic components and calculate the fraction of total variation due to the seasonal part. A series would be seasonal if that fraction exceeds some threshold. The next step would be to cluster the shares or the seasonal components into groups that are similar.
