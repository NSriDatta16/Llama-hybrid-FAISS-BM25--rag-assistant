You can use a UIPanGestureRecognizer to detect panning/dragging on your parent image view. Then just apply a CGAffineTransform to rotate that view based on the user's finger position. // Calculate the rotation you want CGFloat radians = degreesToRadians(position*totalRotation); [dialerView setTransform:CGAffineTransformMakeRotation(radians)]; You would need to figure out how to calculate the position and totalRotation.
