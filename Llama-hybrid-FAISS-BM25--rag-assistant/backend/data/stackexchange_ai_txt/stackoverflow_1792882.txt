Shader uniforms are typically implemented by the hardware as registers (or sometimes by patching the values into shader microcode directly, e.g. nVidia fragment shaders). The limit is therefore highly implementation dependent. You can retrieve the maximums by querying GL_MAX_VERTEX_UNIFORM_COMPONENTS_ARB and GL_MAX_FRAGMENT_UNIFORM_COMPONENTS_ARB for vertex and fragment shaders respectively.
