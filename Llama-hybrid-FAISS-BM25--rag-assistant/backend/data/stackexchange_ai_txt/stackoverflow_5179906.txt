Embedding Mono vs Google V8?

We want to add scripting to a project. We are hesitating which script engine to use. I have used in the past V8 and it's quite impressive. I have used Mono as well but in toy-projects or prototypes only. The constraints are : speed of execution. easy integration. must work on windows. 64-bit support. compiles under Visual Studio. Which engine fits the best ? (Are there any tutorial for compiling Mono under win64 with Visual Studio? Is there some packages that include Lib files and DLLs ?)
