If you'd prefer that the error messages be attached to the form rather than to specific fields, you can use the key " __all__ " like this: msg = 'The type and organization do not match.' self._errors['__all__'] = ErrorList([msg]) Also, as the Django docs explain: "if you want to add a new error to a particular field, you should check whether the key already exists in self._errors or not. If not, create a new entry for the given key, holding an empty ErrorList instance. In either case, you can then append your error message to the list for the field name in question and it will be displayed when the form is displayed."
