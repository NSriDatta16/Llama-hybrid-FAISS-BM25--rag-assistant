That is an interesting problem. First, I would not make the assumption of a normal distribution. It seems what you are really looking for is some estimate of dispersion that you apply fairly to many different shooters or guns or ammo or whatever. I'd try to turn this around. You don't know exactly where all the bullets went unless you see 10 separate holes (assuming 10 shots). But you do know where they didn't go. This could be used to constrain the distribution assuming Bayesian statistics if you want to start with a distribution. An idea that might be best here is to stop trying to do it mathematically and just do something sensible like this. Take the target and run an image processing routine to mark the shot through area which may be unconnected. Measure the mean and second moment of this and use these are an estimator. If you want to go a little further and try to Gaussianize it, you can run simple monte carlo experiment to get a calibration factor.
