Preeti, You might read on domino principles first, making it easier for you to understand. Notes databases are not password protected. However Notes databases have Access level and can be encrypted. You need an installed Notes client and a Notes.id (or access to a Domino server with the NSF on it). If the database has been encrypted (which is most likely the default for any sensible organization) you must have the exact ID the database was encrypted with. As Ken pointed out db.QueryAccess can be used to check access rights. You might want to check, besides -Default- also the current user's rights.
