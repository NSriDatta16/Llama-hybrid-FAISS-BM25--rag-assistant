Dunno what trackbacks are, all I've noticed of them is that they clutter up websites with messy blocks of text, often interpersed with article comments. But if they allow you to see who is linking to you in real time without log analysis: You could use the HTTP-Referer (sic) header to see if people have linked to your article. Each article would have a map of these referrers (and a count, so you can organise by popularity). You then implement a basic crawler that visits new referrers to scrape content. I'm sure there's a third party implementation available as well. Or a specification. As the other poster has linked to, so, err, ignore this.
