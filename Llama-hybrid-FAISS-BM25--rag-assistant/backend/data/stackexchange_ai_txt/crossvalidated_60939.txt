Classification in time series: SVMs, Neural Networks, Random Forests or non parametric models

My dataset is made of a label, $y_{t}$, which is the dependent variable, and about 20 columns of independent numeric variables, $X_{t}$, $t=1,2,...,T$. These samples are time series and my goal is to classify $y_{t}$ according to $X_{t}$. The dependent variable can get just two labels: "$0$" or "$1$". Probability of belonging to "$0$" or "$1$" label is not needed, although it could bring further value to the analysis. I would like to know which one of the following methods is the best one for my case and why (eventually how should I set methods and parameters if needed): Support Vector Machines : which kernel should I use (linear, polynomial, radial basis, sigmoid)? Neural Networks : how many layer and nodes should I set? Random Forests Non parametric model applied to binary outcome (this provides probabilities of belonging to each class) What can you suggest me?
