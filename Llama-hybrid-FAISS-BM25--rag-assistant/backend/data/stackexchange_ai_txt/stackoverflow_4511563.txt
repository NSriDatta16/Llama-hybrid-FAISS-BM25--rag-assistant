Rohit If you have signed up for an account you should have been given the documentation on this link: https://sandbox-api.paysimple.com/3.00/help/default.html If not, we strongly encourage you to contact our business team to set one up and at that point we would issue a Sandbox account where you can develop. PaySimple cannot provide you with PHP code samples, however our support link posted in Warren's answer may guide you regarding business rules and the structure you wish to establish. The link posted here will provide you with our API objects and their methods. If you can replicate the example calls then you should be well on your way to processing.
