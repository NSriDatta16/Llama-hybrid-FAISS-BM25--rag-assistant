Bootstrapping is not so great when a sample size is actually small (less than 50 say, though it depends somewhat on exactly what you're doing); it works fine in large samples. Bootstrapping works fine on normal data. You seem to be asserting that your data is normal -- on what basis do you say that? If your sample size is 810,000 (as your comment seems to suggest), then you can pretty safely assume the mean is normal, and generally, reasonably safely apply Slutsky as well, so you can construct normal theory intervals for means with relatively little concern about the original distribution. Note that a credible interval is an interval from a Bayesian analysis. If you're going to bootstrap, you need to be clear about how any bootstrap you use relates to that.
