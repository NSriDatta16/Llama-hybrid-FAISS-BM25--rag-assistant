First, a couple of comments on the figure itself. One problem is the broken vertical axis. This exaggerates the variability among the 20 bottom cases and artificially creates two groups that are treated differently. It would probably be better to just use a logarithmic vertical axis. The use of different colors to distinguish different cases is dubious. It could in principle be used to identify cases, but since the colors are not picked up again in other subplots, this identification is not necessary. So the only rationale for the colors would be so we can identify specific trajectories over time. But honestly, there is very little to see here, so the colors only add visual clutter. It would likely be better to just use a light gray so the average stands out. Now to the statistical problem. You correctly identify in your comment that the average goes up when people leave the study, presumably with low counts. This is a kind of selection bias : if we only retain people in our observations who are sick (and therefore have a higher platelet count) and drop individuals who get healthy (and therefore have a lower count), then our estimate of average platelet count will be biased high through the selection effect. Specifically, we have a case of a attrition bias here. Unless we could follow people up after leaving, there is probably no really good way around this. It might be helpful to indicate the number of data points at each point in time, e.g. by adding this as another time series with a secondary vertical axis.
