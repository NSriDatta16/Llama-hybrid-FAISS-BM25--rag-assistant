Tracer Bullets vs Prototypes

I've started reading The Pragmatic Programmer, which I am enjoying and learning heaps form but I'm having difficulty understanding the difference between tracer bullets and prototypes. Are tracer bullets like having all of the views of an application there but not yet adding the entire functionality? Thanks
