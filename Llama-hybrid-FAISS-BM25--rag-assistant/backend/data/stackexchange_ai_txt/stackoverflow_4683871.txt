You may be able to figure out the lpszClass of the program using an inspection tool such as WinSpy++ . It gives you a crosshair that you can drag and position over the desired control. This was able to easily provide me with the "edit" class name for notepad. If things aren't working, click the "More>>" button in the lower right of WinSpy++, then click the "Locate" button to view the control hierarchy; you may need to post the WM_KEYDOWN message to one of the parent or child controls instead.
