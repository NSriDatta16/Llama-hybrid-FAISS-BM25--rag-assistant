Storing HTML markup entered via web rich text editor?

I'm currently working on an admin section for a website. The admin can use the infragistics WebHtmlEditor tool to create markup for pages which will then be loaded into the pages on load. What is the best way to store this markup in the database? Should we just save the HTML generated by the WebHtmlEditor into a varchar field? Is there any issues with this, e.g. will any markup be lost or cause issues with the DB? Thanks
