sample more frequently when there is variation, and less frequently when there is not That could work in sample but would be difficult to use for out-of-sample predictions, unless you figure out how to predict the variability itself (and that need not be impossible). Also, if you encounter regimes with low variation (or no variation at all) followed by regimes of high variation, you would naturally need separate models for the two; having one model for the whole process and sampling at uneven intervals/frequencies would intuitively seem suboptimal. You mentioned regime switching models (when answering my comment), and that is a good illustration what you might need here. I should be sampling as frequently as possible so that I will have a much bigger number of samples, hence my model parameters will have less variation. This is not entirely true. In a time series setting, it is often the time span rather than the number of observations that matters. For example, 120 monthly observations (spanning 10 years) is a more informative sample than 209 weekly observation (spanning 4 years) when testing for presence of a unit root; see this Dave Giles' blog post and the last reference in it. Or consider a limiting case where you sample so frequently that you essentially measure the same thing multiple times. That would increase your sample size but would not bring in new information, leading to a spurious impression of estimate precision. So perhaps you should not spend too much time on increasing the sampling frequency and building some corresponding models?
