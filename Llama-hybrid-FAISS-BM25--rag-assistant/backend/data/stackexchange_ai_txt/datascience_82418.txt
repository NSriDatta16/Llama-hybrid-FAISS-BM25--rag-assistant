What is the best machine learning model to predict a continuous variable where the predictors include categorical, numerical variables and a text?

The variables include categorical variables like (contains video, author) and numerical variables like (average word length) and a text (combination of words). I am confused about this because from what I understand only regression can be used to predict continuous variable. However, I was thinking of forming a bag of words array for the text and title and I do have other categorical variables so i am not sure which model would be ideal. Which ML model would be the best to predict a continuous variable?
