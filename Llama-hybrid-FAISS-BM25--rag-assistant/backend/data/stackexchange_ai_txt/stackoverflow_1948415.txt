There's a couple of ways you can do it elegantly I think. One, is to use send as TK suggested above. The other is to use "method_missing", the method Ruby calls when it can't find an existing method. Metaprogramming Ruby has great coverage of both of these options. Luckily enough, it's in the free sample chapter online (I recommend the book, if you want to learn more). Apologies for not giving you a code snippet but have a read through that and see if it helps.
