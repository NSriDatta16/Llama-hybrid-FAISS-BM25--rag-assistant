Windows 7 requires UAC elevation for VB6 application (Vista did not)

I have an old VB6 application which should run on Windows 7 (with UAV set to the default level, 3 of 4 IMHO). It has the functionality to update itself, and Windows 7 is now complaining that it would modify the computer (At least windows 7 is right here). I was able to run it in Vista with some kind of manifest file, but this does not seem to work anymore (which is the intended behaviour if I think of it). The manifest file is this: IKOffice Starter The manifest can be found near the exe "IKOffice Starter.exe" and is called "IKOffice Starter.exe.manifest", which should be okey. Currently the Shield Icon has gone from my .exe, but when try to start the software, i get the message "Der angeforderte Vorgang erfordert h√∂here Rechte", or translated to english "the requested operation requires elevation". What can I do to stop windows to bug me anymore, so I can install this application on our clients computers. Hey, I already told Windows to run it as Invoker, so why is it still complaining?
