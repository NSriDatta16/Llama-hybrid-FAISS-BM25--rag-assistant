Multiple cookies with javascript, stategies anyone?

LocalStorage doesn't work here. I am looking for more of a theory type answer and not as much code. I already know how to set and delete cookies, that is now what this question is about; here is the question: When I submit an order, I want to place Meal Ingredients Name Phone inside cookies to be later outputted on a div to the right of the page. This I think I can do quite easily. I might put each value into an object of orders... But that isn't the real question, how can I have multiple orders that are unique? I want to have many different orders and have the user delete the order they desire. I was thinking of separating each order with a | character and than playing some string games. But I don't know how I would delete one. My other idea was have a order id and auto-increment it. Any help? website: philipimperato.com/mobileOrder P.S. Only Javascript and I know how to setCookie and deleteCookie :D
