Two points: The posterior distribution in the Bayesian case is a distribution. The ridge regression estimate is simply a vector $\hat{\beta}$ and not a distribution. Thus they're not completely equivalent. It is true that in the case of a multivariate normal prior and multivariate normal likelihood, the posterior is multivariate normal with a mean that is the ridge regression estimate for an appropriately chosen ridge parameter. The proof of this depends on the particular form of the prior and likelihood and doesn't work for more general priors or likelihood functions.
