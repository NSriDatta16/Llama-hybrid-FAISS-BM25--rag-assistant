Can I create a custom summary field in Excel 2007 pivot table?

Is there anyways to create a custom "summarize value field by" function to be used in an XL 2007 pivot table. The standard Sum, Count, Average, Max, etc. are not sufficient for me. I would accept a solution in VBA, or a solution that requires an XLA or XLL. please note that I'm NOT asking about Calculated Field or Calculated Item. Neither serve my purpose - I need to summarize the underlying data with functions such as Median, 1st Quartile, etc.
