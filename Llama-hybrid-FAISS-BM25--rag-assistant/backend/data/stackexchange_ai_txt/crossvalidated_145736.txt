This is a work in progress, and it is meant to answer my own question. (Not complete yet) Common types of Optimal NIST provides ( link ) the following definitions for the types of Optimal Design of experiments. A-Optimality [A] criterion is A-optimality, which seeks to minimize the trace of the inverse of the information matrix. This criterion results in minimizing the average variance of the parameter estimates based on a pre-specified model. The fundamental assumption then is that average variance of the prior model describes overall variance of the actual system. D-Optimality [Another] criterion is D-optimality, which seeks to maximize |X'X|, the determinant of the information matrix X'X of the design. This criterion results in minimizing the generalized variance of the parameter estimates based on a pre-specified model. The fundamental assumption then is that the generalized variance of the prior model describes overall variance of the actual system. G-Optimality A third criterion is G-optimality, which seeks to minimize the maximum prediction variance, i.e., minimize max. [ $d=x'(X'X)^{-1}x$ ], over a specified set of design points. Like $H_{\infty}$ control this minimizes the maximum error given the prior model. V-Optimality A fourth criterion is V-optimality, which seeks to minimize the average prediction variance over a specified set of design points. Requirements and ... NIST says that the requirements include: An a-priori appropriate analytic model A discrete set of samples points as candidates elements of the DOE Working Here are "textbook" statistical analyses. DOE should apply to them, and if there is a healthy connection between "textbook statistics" and "statistical design of experiment" then they should be relevant for the answer of this question. http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section3/4plot.htm The NIST case studies include: Normal random numbers Uniform random numbers Random walk (running sum of shifted uniform random) Josephson junction cryothermometry (discretized uniform random) Beam deflections (periodic with noise) Fitler transmittance (autocorrelation polluted measurements) Standard resistor (linear with additive noise, violates stationarity and autocorrelation) Heat flow (well behaved process, stationary, in control)
