Quick Excel generation

I am building a categorized todo list (not as a feature or anything, just a quick, off-the cuff list). The list should be organized like this: Category1 -----------Item1 -----------Item2 Category2 -----------Item1 (always the same items in each category) -----------Item2 So I have 2 text files, 1 with the categories and one with the items. If this were a database problem, I'd do a cartesian join, and the result would be pretty close to what I'm after. What I want to do is take these 2 files and spew out an Excel file where the first column is the category, and the second is the items. I started writing a little C# program to brute force this, but it just seems like I must be missing something -- is there a macro or maybe even a pithy PowerShell script that I could throw together to do this? It just seems like it should be so easy.
