Why jQuery don't want to style piece of html inserted with Ajax into new page

This is my first post, so first hallo all. I have a little problem with Ajax and jQuery. On one page test.html i have one div with some paragraph and one img. On the index.html page i have only anchor for retrieval of that div using Ajax with jQuery. But all css(which i have set for that div only using jQuery) don't work after the successfully loading of div. On the test.html all works fine(hover, animate... and all css) but on the index page none. My guess is that because of $('document').ready(function) things don't work well. Any help is more then welcome.
