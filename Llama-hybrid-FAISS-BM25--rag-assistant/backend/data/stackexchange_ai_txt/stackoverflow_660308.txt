Thanks all. Found a solution that avoided this altogether. I was attempting to use Infragistics LimitToList feature of a drop down. However, that feature prevents ALL other events from firing--including form closing! As a work around I was thinking of checking for the exit button being pressed inside the LimitToList feature and then disabling LimitToList in order to allow the exit to take place. So I started checking ActiveControl, yada, yada, but ran into tons of problems (what happens if another form is opened up, etc) So I scrapped the LimitToList feature and wrote my own validating event using the standard validating method. Why anyone write a feature that pre-empts form closing is beyond me!
