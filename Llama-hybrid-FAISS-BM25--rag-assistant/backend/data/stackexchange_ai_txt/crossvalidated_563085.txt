You are not going to get out of "weird" results, if you assume a model that is clearly false. I.e. you have knowingly mis-specified the model by assuming the trend 100% must be linear and cannot be anything else and when doing so, you get inference conditional on that mis-specified model. What you'd want to do to get a more sensible model fit is to change what model you assume. There's several options for that: You could use a phsics-motivated model. E.g. modern Bayesian packages (like the rstan or brms R packages) let you fit models specified through (ordinary) differential equations without having to find an analytical solution for the differential equation (see e.g. this blog post ). From your comments about this being a physical system with a pendulum, this could very well fit the situation nicely. When you don't have an understanding of the underlying data generating mechanism, then splines are an obvious option that is supported in most Bayesian regression modeling packages such as brms . There's also Gaussian processes, which could in this setting do similar things to splines, but these seem to be computationally more challenging.
