Embedding of list of objects

I have a dataset where each sample is a list of ordered items, lets say grocery list , and a label from 6 categories . each list can have up to 120 items but the mean items is 12 items in a list. i would like to embed each sample in a similar way to word2vec and maybe average the vectors for each list to get 1 vector per sample. You think that word2vec is the right approach for it ? since the "texts" are very short and the location of each item is not contextual but more like the number purchased
