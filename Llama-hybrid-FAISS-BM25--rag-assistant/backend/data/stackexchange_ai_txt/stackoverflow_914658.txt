mysql: How to free space (innodb)

I have a mysql DB configured with the innoDB storage engine. I dropped the database ( drop database ) but the disk space hasn't be liberated. At /var/lib/mysql there are some "big" files called ib_logfile0 , ib_logfile1 and ibdata1 where the last one is really big. I pressume that these files are in fact the original DB. How can I know if I can delete them. Or a better question is how to drop a database so that the disk space is reclaimed. Clarification I want to drop the complete database and free the disk space. I don't want to perform any restore. Thanks in advance.
