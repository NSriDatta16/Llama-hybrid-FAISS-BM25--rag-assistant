this guide lists the typical values for max_depth of xgboost as 3-10 - how is this range decided on as typical? You guessed it correct. Typical means in most problems, this parameter is chosen something in between 3-10. This is based on experimentation, trial and error and a just rough guide. Another guide could have said 3-12, and it wouldn't be a wrong guide. This is problem and data dependent. And, there are computational considerations as well. Maybe the business problem is not that sensitive and you wouldn't want to wait a whole day just to get a 0.5% improvement. However, although there aren't set in stone rules for choosing max depth candidates (at least to the best of my knowledge), you can choose reasonable values/ranges based on your number of features, and dataset size. For instance, if your dataset has around 1000 samples, and if each split is assumed to split the space into half, in 10 splits, your leaves would be left with only one or two samples, which seems like overfitting (not necessarily but it looks like). You can come up with some bounds following this kind of logic.
