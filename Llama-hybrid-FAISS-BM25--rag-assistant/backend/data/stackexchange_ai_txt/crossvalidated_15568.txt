The normal approximation for the confidence interval of binomial proportions breaks down very badly for rare events and the rules of thumb about sample sizes are inconsistent and unreliable. Better methods are just as easy to calculate (i.e. you click the button!) and so there is no reason for anyone to use the normal approximation. Ever. Have a quick look at the papers below (and then use Wilson's method). Vollset. Confidence intervals for a binomial proportion. Statist. Med. (1993) vol. 12 (9) pp. 809-24 Brown et al. Interval Estimation for a Binomial Proportion. Statistical Science (2001) pp. 101-117 http://www.jstor.org/stable/2676784 See also some previous questions put to this list: How to report asymmetrical confidence intervals of a proportion? and Discrete functions: Confidence interval coverage? and Clarification on interpreting confidence intervals?
