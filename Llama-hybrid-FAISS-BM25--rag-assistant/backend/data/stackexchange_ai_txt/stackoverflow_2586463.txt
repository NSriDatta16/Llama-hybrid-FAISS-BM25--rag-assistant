Is it safe to install .Net 3.5 SP1 after .Net 4.0 RC has already been installed?

I have a Build Agent that was only dealing in .Net 4.0 RC stuff, and so only had .Net 2.0 (natively) and 4.0 (manually) versions installed. It now needs to support stuff compiled against 3.5 SP1. Does anyone know if I'm asking for trouble trying to install 3.5 SP1 after 4.0 RC has already been installed? Thanks in advance.
