"You have N vectors of length M (N>>M). Tell me how you would go about designing a kernel to evaluate the distance matrix. Pay special attention to the way the problem is sub-divided and to the way the thread co-operation can be used to improve occupancy. How would your answer to this question change if M>>N?" The idea here is not to get you writing code, but to get you thinking out loud. This shows that you really know how to use GPGPU technology and are not merely regurgitating the user guide.
