Basic question about Magento Programming

I found many code snippets in Magento such as $variable_name = Mage::app()->function_name(); here's an example $websites = Mage::app()->getWebsites(true, true); What does this function call (calls?) do? The syntax is unfamiliar, and I need some basic explanation so I can better trace code.
