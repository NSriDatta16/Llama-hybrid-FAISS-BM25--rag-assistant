Is CNN shift invariant?

I have seen multiple resources on the web says that CNN is or is not shift invariant. I do think that CNN is shift invariant as the convolution kernel will scan the image to detect the features that it matches, however this paper shows empirical result that this is not the case. This answer says that CNN is locally shift invariant but it can tolerate large shifts. Also, these slides (slide 6) say that if you shuffle face parts like eyes and noise in an image, CNN still classify the image as a face. This means that it is shift invariant. So, what is the correct answer? What is the thing that I did not get from the slides mentioned above?
