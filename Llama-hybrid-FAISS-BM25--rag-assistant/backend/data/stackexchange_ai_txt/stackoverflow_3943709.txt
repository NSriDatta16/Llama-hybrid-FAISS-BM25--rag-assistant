As far as finding the hospitals, I think your going to need some sort of database, either locally as an sqlite file or through a server that you host (rails and php will have lots of tutorials for this specific problem). You will need to scrape together/buy a list of locations of the hospitals to populate your database as well. Check out these resources for building the database. Creating a Store Locator with PHP, MySQL & Google Maps http://code.google.com/apis/maps/articles/phpsqlsearch.html (pay special attention to the SQL search query) SELECT id, ( 3959 * acos( cos( radians(37) ) * cos( radians( lat ) ) * cos( radians( lng ) - radians(-122) ) + sin( radians(37) ) * sin( radians( lat ) ) ) ) AS distance FROM markers HAVING distance Also check out these books (or at least the source code thats posted on the site) for Rails and PHP. I bought the rails book and would highly recommend it for the type of project your doing. http://www.googlemapsbook.com/book/ Sample code to calculate distance between two lat,lng points in in various languages http://www.zipcodeworld.com/developers.htm
