How does RVM achieve sparsity?

I have read several textbook descriptions on RVM and none of them provide an adequate (plain English) explanation of how RVM achieves sparsity. I am left feeling like the authors left out a paragraph of text that would have connected the dots and instead decided to replace (rather than supplement) it with mathematical derivations. Could someone please explain the basic idea as to how RVM works in relation to learning sparse regression models?
