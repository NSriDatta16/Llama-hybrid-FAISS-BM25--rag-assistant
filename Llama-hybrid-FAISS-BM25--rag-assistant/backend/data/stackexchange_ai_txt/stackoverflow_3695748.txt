I agree with Gregoire -- stored procedures are a good way forward, if your language works well with them. Otherwise, ask: What's the difference between storing them in source, XML files, SQL etc.? Storage is storage is storage... The potential damage of misuse and implementing without considering the constraints in relation to your app is what counts.
