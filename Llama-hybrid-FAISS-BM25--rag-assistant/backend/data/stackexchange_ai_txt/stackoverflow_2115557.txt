Not really a memory leak, but it is quite easy to run out of memory when using large objects (greater than 64K if I remember correctly). They are stored on the LOH and that ist NOT defragmented. So using those large objects and freeing them frees the memory on the LOH, but that free memory is not used anymore by the .NET runtime for this process. So you can easily run out of space on the LOH by using just a few big objects on the LOH. This issue is known to Microsoft, but as I remember now solution for this is being planned.
