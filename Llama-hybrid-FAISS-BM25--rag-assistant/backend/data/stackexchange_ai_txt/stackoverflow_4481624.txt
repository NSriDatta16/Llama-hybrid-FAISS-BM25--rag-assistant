Polygon border algorithm?

I have an array set of (x,y) values that define a polygon. The polygon is drawn based on the point's position * a pencil size. The thing is that i want to draw the border of such shape, ignoring the inner vertexes. See this example, the BLACK vertex are the ones i'm interested in, i want to get rid of the YELLOW ones. I'd like to get the X in another array, ordered clockwise. Been thinking about evaluating every point to see if has a neighbor and where (north, south, east, west) but seems like too much crunching to check in every vertex and i believe must be another proven and more elegant algorithm. Any tip?
