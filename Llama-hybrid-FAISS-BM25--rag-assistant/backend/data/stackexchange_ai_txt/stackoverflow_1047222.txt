Is there a reason you can't just splice out the desired character and push a new character onto the array? var characters:Array = ["leo", "raph", "don", "mike"]; characters.splice(1, 1); trace(characters); characters.push("splinter"); trace(characters); If you're looking for storage by reference, checkout AS3's Dictionary object or even Flash 10's Vector (if storage is consistent by type; quite fast): http://www.gskinner.com/blog/archives/2006/07/as3_dictionary.html
