Evaluation of custom SVM on training set

I am trying to build an SVM using libraries from python like cvxopt et al. I am generating random 2D points and adding labels (1/-1)to them. Also, using this prediction function to evaluate points, $\sum\limits_{i=1}^n z_iy_iK(x_i,x)$. So, I decided to try it on the same training set (from which I derived Lagrange mults. and their corresponding support vectors), expecting that I would get back the same label sequence (1/-1). However, although it would get some of them correct, it gave me many misclassifications sometimes it looks even random , but most of the time accuracy looks like 50-65% on the same training set. Is this normal? Shouldn't it be like 100%? I am talking about like 20-25 2-D points, generated by random normal dist.
