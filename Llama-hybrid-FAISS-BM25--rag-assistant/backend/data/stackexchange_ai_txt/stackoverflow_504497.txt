The average angle phi_avg should have the property that sum_i|phi_avg-phi_i|^2 becomes minimal, where the difference has to be in [-Pi, Pi) (because it might be shorter to go the other way around!). This is easily achieved by normalizing all input values to [0, 2Pi), keeping a running average phi_run and choosing normalizing |phi_i-phi_run| to [-Pi,Pi) (by adding or subtractin 2Pi). Most suggestions above do something else that does not have that minimal property, i.e., they average something , but not angles.
