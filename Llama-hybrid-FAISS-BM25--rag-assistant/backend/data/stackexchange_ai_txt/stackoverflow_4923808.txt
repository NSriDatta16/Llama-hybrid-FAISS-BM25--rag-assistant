You can use Storage Procedures beacuse of the amount of data. Or you can create a file with the data, read it line per line, and insert line per line with Linq so the data is not loaded in memory at the same time Why should you use stored procedures? Let's take a look at the key benefits of this technology: Precompiled execution. SQL Server compiles each stored procedure once and then reutilizes the execution plan. This results in tremendous performance boosts when stored procedures are called repeatedly. Reduced client/server traffic. If network bandwidth is a concern in your environment, you'll be happy to learn that stored procedures can reduce long SQL queries to a single line that is transmitted over the wire. Efficient reuse of code and programming abstraction. Stored procedures can be used by multiple users and client programs. If you utilize them in a planned manner, you'll find the development cycle takes less time. Enhanced security controls. You can grant users permission to execute a stored procedure independently of underlying table permissions. In MSSQL the language is Transact-SQL (T-SQL).
