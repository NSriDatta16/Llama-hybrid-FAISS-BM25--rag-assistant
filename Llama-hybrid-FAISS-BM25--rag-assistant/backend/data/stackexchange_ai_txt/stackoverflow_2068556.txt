For "global" resources I'm seconding jspcal's ftok() answer which he got in just ahead of me with :) If you have a bunch of related processes (that is, a parent and a bunch of children) and they should share a queue, then you should call msgget with IPC_PRIVATE which will create a queue with an unused key and return the handle to it.
