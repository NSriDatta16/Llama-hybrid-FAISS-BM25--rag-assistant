Your list is a great start of reasons for sticking with a database. However, I would recommend that if you're talking to a technical person, to shy away from technical reasons in a recommendation because they might come across as biased. Here are my 2 points against flat file data storage: 1) Security - HIPPA audits require that patient data remain in a secure environment. The common database systems (Oracle, Microsoft SQL, MySQL) have methods for implementing HIPPA compliant security access. Doing so on a flat-file would be difficult, at best. Side note: I've also seen medical practices that encrypt the patient name in the database to add extra layers of protection & compliance to ensure even if their DB is compromised that the patient records are not at risk. 2) Reporting - Reporting from any structured database system is simple and common. There are hundreds of thousands of developers that can perform this task. Reporting from flat-files will require an above-average developer. And, because there is no generally accepted method for doing reporting off of a flat-file database, one developer might do things different than another. This could impact the talent pool able to work on a home-grown flat-file system, and ultimately drive costs up by having to support that type of a system. I hope that helps.
