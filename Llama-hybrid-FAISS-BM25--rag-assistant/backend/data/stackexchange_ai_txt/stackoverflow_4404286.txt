How is a paragraph defined in an NSAttributedString?

I see that there is an attribute name ( NSParagraphStyleAttributeName ) for applying paragraph styles to text in Cocoa. Text is stored in an NSAttributedString , but what defines a "paragraph" in that string -- is it the newline character \n ? Other characters? If it's a \n , then how do you create a new line without starting a new paragraph. And lastly, when you attach a ParagraphStyle to the string, do you have to use the exact range of the whole paragraph, or can you put it on any sub-range in the paragraph. If it can be a sub-range, how does the system handle two or more ParagraphStyles on the same paragraph? thanks, Rob
