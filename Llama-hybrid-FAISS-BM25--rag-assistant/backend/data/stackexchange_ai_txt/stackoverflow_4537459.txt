The main one, (for me), really, is that there is no longer a repeating rule for exception dates in vevents. You have to list them individually. The other main one is that the author, 'The Bernard', got a second chance at the whole thing and improved on the TOC and other organizational aspects of the standard. Additionally, there are some better clarifications and some subtle changes as well. There are a total of 11 listed in the links in the other answer above. MAKE SURE to look at the errata pages available on the rfc-editor.org site. Make sure to look at each errata's STATUS before using it. I recently found an issue, wrote it up (backwards for the fix, however), the correct fix was written up by 'The Bernard', and it will be accepted I'm sure. There are about 10 errata, as I remember.
