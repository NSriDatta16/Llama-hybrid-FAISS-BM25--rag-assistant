A few concrete advantages of frequentist statistics: There are often closed-form solutions to frequentist problems whereas you would need a conjugate prior to have a closed form solution in the Bayesian analogue. This is useful for a number of reasons - one of which is computation time. A reason that'll, hopefully, eventually go away: laymen are taught frequentists statistics. If you want to be understood by many, you need to speak frequentist. An "Innocent until proven guilty" Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST) approach is useful when the goal is to prove someone wrong (I'm going to assume your right and show the data overwhelming suggests you're wrong). Yes, there are NHST analogues in Bayesian but I find the frequentists versions much more straight-forward and interpretable. There is no such thing as a truly uninformative prior which makes some people uncomfortable.
