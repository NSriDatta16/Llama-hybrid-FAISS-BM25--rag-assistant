It sounds like you want some form of regression, depending on how your dependent variable (academic achievement) is measured. If it's something like grade point average, then linear regression is a good start. Then the question is how to measure "languages known". Clearly, it's a count variable (that is, it has to be a non-negative integer; in this case, a positive integer) but (depending on where you are doing this) you may have a huge preponderance of 1's. You will also want to include covariates that relate to achievement. You might want to do some sort of matching, possibly propensity scores.
