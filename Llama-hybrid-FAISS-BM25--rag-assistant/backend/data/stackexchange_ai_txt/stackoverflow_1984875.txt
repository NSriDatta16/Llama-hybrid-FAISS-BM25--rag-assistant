Can't you encrypt all your queries and put them to the resource file? During runtime, firstly you would have to: Load your query string from resource. Decrypt it. Then you just run your query as before. That should not be a big problem. Of course if you are not storing your queries in some resource / folder than you need to refactor your application a bit. But you should store them anyway in some organized manner. So you will be hitting a two birds with one stone here ;-) For encryption of the strings you could use a free library called DCPCrypt.
