decrypt an encrypted value?

I have an old Paradox database (I can convert it to Access 2007) which contains more then 200,000 records. This database has two columns: the first one is named "Word" and the second one is named "Mean". It is a dictionary database and my client wants to convert this old database to ASP.NET and SQL. However, we don't know what key or method is used to encrypt or encode the "Mean" column which is in the Unicode format. The software itself has been written in Delphi 7 and we don't have the source code. My client only knows the credentials for logging in to database. The problem is decoding the Mean column. What I do have is the compiled windows application and the Paradox database. This software can decode the "Mean" column for each "Word" so the method and/or key is in its own compiled code(.exe) or one of the files in its directory. For example, we know that in the following row the "Zymurgy" exactly means "مبحث عمل تخمیر در شیمی علمی, تخمیر شناسی" since the application translates it like that. Here is what the record looks like when I open the database in Access: Word Mean Zymurgy 5OBnGguKPdDAd7L2lnvd9Lnf1mdd2zDBQRxngsCuirK5h91sVmy0kpRcue/+ql9ORmP99Mn/QZ4= Therefore we're trying to discover how the value in the Mean column is converted to "مبحث عمل تخمیر در شیمی علمی, تخمیر شناسی". I think the "Mean" column value in above row is encoded in Base64 string format, but decoding the Base64 string does not yet result in the expected text. The extensions for files in the win app directory are dll, CCC, DAT, exe (other than the main app file), SYS, FAM, MB, PX, TV, VAL. Any kind of help is appreciated. here is two more example and remember double quotes at start and end are not part of the strings: word: "abdominal" coded value: "vwtj0bmj7jdF9SS8sbrIalBoKMDvTbpraFgG4gP/G9GLx5iU/E98rQ==" translation in Farsi: "شکمی, بطنی, وریدهای شکمی, ماهیان بطنی" word: "cart" coded value: "KHoCkDsIndb6OKjxVxsh+Ti+iA/ZqP9sz28e4/cQzMyLI+ToPbiLOaECWQ8XKXTz" translation in Farsi: "ارابه, گاری, دوچرخه, چرخ, با گاری بردن" here is the result in different encodings: 1- in unicode the result is: "ᩧ訋퀽矀箖�柖�섰᱁艧껀늊螹泝汖銴岔꫾也捆￉鹁" 2- in utf32 the result is: "��������������" 3- in utf7 the result is: "äàg\v=ÐÀw²ö{Ýô¹ßÖg]Û0ÁAgÀ®²¹ÝlVl´\\¹ïþª_NFcýôÉÿA" 4- in utf8 the result is: "��g\v�=��w���{����g]�0�Ag��������lVl���\\����_NFc����A�" 5- in 1256 the result is: "نàg\vٹ=ذہw²ِ–{فô¹كضg]غ0ءAg‚ہ®ٹ²¹‡فlVl´’”\\¹ï‏ھ_NFc‎ôةےA" yet i discovered that the paradox database system is very complex when it comes to key management and most of the time the keys are "compound keys" and that's why it's problematic and that's why it's abandoned! UPDATE: i'm trying to do the automation by using AutoIt v3 because the decryption process as i understand can't be done in one or two days. now i have another problem which is related to text/font. when i copy the translated text to notepad it will change to some unrecognizable text unless i change the font of notepad to the font of the translation software. if i type something in the notepad in Farsi it will show it correctly regardless of what font i've been chosen. more interesting is when i copy the text to any other program like MS Office Word it'll be shown correctly no matter what font i choose. so how can i get around this ?
