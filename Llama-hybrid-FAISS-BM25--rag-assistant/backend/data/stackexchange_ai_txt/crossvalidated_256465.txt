Subset Sum with Constraints

I'm taking a look at what I have identified as being a subset sum problem. I have around 650 potential values which could form part of my single sum value. I've began looking into the typical theories to solve for this problem, however I have identified a number of constraints which may allow me to confine the problem further. For my single sum, there can only be a total of 60 values that make up its sum. In addition to this each day I receive ~ 650 values again, with a new sum (as they change in size each day +/-). I am looking for exact match, which typically creates exponential computation, however I believe with the additional constraints I can impose I'm wondering whether I can increase efficiency. Looking for pointers and best way forward please.
