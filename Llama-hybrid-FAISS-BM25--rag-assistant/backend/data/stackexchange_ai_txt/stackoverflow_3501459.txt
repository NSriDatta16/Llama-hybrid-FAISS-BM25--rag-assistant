How to set the Don't Fragment (IP_DF) flag in C

I want to set the Don't Fragment flag on a IP packet. Is there a way to do so via the setsockopt() function or via the flags of the sendto() function? Can I do this with "normal" sockets or do i have to use raw sockets and build the entire IP header myself, setting it's offset-field to IP_DF (which is defined in ip.h)?
