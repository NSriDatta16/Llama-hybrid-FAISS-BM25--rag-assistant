You can use Insert( int index, T item ) to insert an item at position 0, but I think you'd be better off doing index arithmetic and referencing as a 0-based collection. This is what most programmers coming after you will expect. @Robert's extension method idea has some value, but I think will end up confusing the eventual maintainers of your code.
