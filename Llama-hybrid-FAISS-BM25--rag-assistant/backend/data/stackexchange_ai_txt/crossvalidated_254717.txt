Why does feature scaling work? I can give you an example (from Quora ) Let me answer this from general ML perspective and not only neural networks. When you collect data and extract features, many times the data is collected on different scales. For example, the age of employees in a company may be between 21-70 years, the size of the house they live is 500-5000 Sq feet and their salaries may range from $30000-$80000. In this situation if you use a simple Euclidean metric, the age feature will not play any role because it is several order smaller than other features. However, it may contain some important information that may be useful for the task. Here, you may want to normalize the features independently to the same scale, say [0,1], so they contribute equally while computing the distance.
