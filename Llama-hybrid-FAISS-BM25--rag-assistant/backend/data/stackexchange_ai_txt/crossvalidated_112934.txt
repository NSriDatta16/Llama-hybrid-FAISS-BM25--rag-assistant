In Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) structure learning, you are trying to learn the directed acyclic graph (DAG). If you learn a partially directed acyclic graph (PDAG), or if a PDAG is the output of your structure learning algorithm, then you need to orient the undirected arcs in some way (e.g. manually) so as to form a DAG. When you see an undirected arc between two nodes, X1 and X2, it means there is a dependency (not as you stated, which is that they are unrelated), however, whatever test (statistical or not) which have been applied to orient that undirected arc has failed to distinguish between X1 -> X2 X1 In general, learning a BBN DAG is a type of feature selection, and many feature selection algorithms have referenced BBN structure learning papers. When you learn the DAG of a BBN, with respect to each node, you are learning its Markov blanket (directly or indirectly); those variables in the Markov blanket are the "features" relevant to the variable of concern.
