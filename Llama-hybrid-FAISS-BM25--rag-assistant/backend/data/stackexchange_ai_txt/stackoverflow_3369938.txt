If you are building your project using Android 1.6 with minSDKVesrion set to 3, you can create only 3 folders drawable-hdpi,drawable-mdpi,drawable-ldpi. I recreated your issue in my project and when I changed the Res folder structure it started working perfectly. You can surely give it a try (There is a Android 1.5 issue you be aware of. Many 1.5 mdpi devices pick up resources from drawable-ldpi folder.)
