How to develop Multistage classification model using deep learning

I am little confused while doing multistage classification using deep learning model. I have data as below: 1st stage classification: Living Things---> Animals/ Birds/ mammals 2nd stage classification: Animals---> Dog/Cat/Horse/Rabbit/Panda Birds---> Peacock, Parrot, Dove, Sparrow Mammals--->Whale, Humans, Goats, Bats, Elephant So, First I have to classify my images into 3 different categories, after that in next stage, I have to classify the output of those 3 into 14 different class. I don't know how to this multi stage classification. If anyone have idea please suggest.
