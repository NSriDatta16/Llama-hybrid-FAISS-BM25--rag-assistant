C#: Cleanest way to divide a string array into N instances N items long

I know how to do this in an ugly way, but am wondering if there is a more elegant and succinct method. I have a string array of e-mail addresses. Assume the string array is of arbitrary length -- it could have a few items or it could have a great many items. I want to build another string consisting of say, 50 email addresses from the string array, until the end of the array, and invoke a send operation after each 50, using the string of 50 addresses in the Send() method. The question more generally is what's the cleanest/clearest way to do this kind of thing. I have a solution that's a legacy of my VBScript learnings, but I'm betting there's a better way in C#.
