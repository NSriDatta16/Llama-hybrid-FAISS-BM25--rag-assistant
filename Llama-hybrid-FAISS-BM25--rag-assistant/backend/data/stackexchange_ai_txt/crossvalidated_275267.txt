What are the assumptions for the Bayesian average?

How does one derive the Bayesian average ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_average ). As I understand it, this should derivable from the prior probability distribution for $\bar{x}$ and the likelihood function of a sample given a particular $\bar{x}$. However, I'm not able to figure out what prior and likelihood lead to formula in the link.
