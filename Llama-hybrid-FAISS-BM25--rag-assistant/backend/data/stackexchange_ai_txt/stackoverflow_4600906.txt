The best thing you can do is avoid reinventing the wheel by leveraging what the OS provides. See the article Calling the Task Scheduler in Windows Vista (and Windows Server 2008) from managed code from Bart De Smet for a very to-the-point usage of the windows task scheduler from C#. If for some reason you must implement your own service (e.g. greater control over dependencies), I'd look at some of the open source Cron implementations in .NET compatible languages. There is an article with code on code project named Implementing a small Cron service in C# that seems to do this. Based on his article An Event Based Cron (Scheduled) Job In C# , it looks like Bob Cravens has done some more thorough work in this area or at least documented his work more thoroughly. I'm sure there are others if you look around, and something based on Cron is a good starting point.
