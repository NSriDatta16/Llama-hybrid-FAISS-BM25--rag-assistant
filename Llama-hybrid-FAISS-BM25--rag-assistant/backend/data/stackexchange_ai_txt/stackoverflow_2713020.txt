Silverlight file download for COM Interop

Is the following possible in Silverlight when a button is clicked? An Excel template is downloaded from a remote server and saved to the local machine An instance of the template is then opened on the client A macro is then executed within the new Excel document I can do everything apart from saving the template to the local machine. I can save this in isolated storage but then I donâ€™t know where this is when trying to open it from the Excel COM interop code. Has anyone any ideas or is this not possible?
