Basic help using Firebug

Just starting using the Firebug console. I have a test script which I'll post below. I open up the Firebug console and type $("p"); this returns null. Its my understanding it should return all my p elements ie p, p.foo, p, p#bar. A conflict maybe or am I just using the console incorrectly? Testing jQuery Hello World! Another paragraph, but this one has a class. This is a span inside a paragraph. Paragraph with an id. And this sentence is in a span.
