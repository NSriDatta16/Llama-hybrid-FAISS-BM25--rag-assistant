Off the top of my head, I would say that this shouldn't be an issue. The rf package in R implements random forests using CARTs. One of the nicest thing about trees is how they are "natively" capable of dealing with categorical and missing variables. Here is the package documentation; you can download the package itself from CRAN. Chapter 8 in James, Witten, Hastie, & Tibshirani's Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R offers a good introduction to tree methods and also covers random forests on page 328. Imputing missing variables is a whole thing in and of itself and, depending on your needs and data, you might be able to get away with not having to do it. If you do have to perform imputation you might want to check here and here for some quick pointers, but you're probably just going to have to read up on imputation methods and make a judgement call on what to go with.
