Gmail-like labelling system

I am looking into a number of ways to implement a labelling system similar to the one in Gmail. Basically I have a Resource at the lowest level and I would like to provide a number of organisational groupings for that resource in the form of labels. If anyone has implemented something like that I would like to hear your views. My idea is to have within the Resource instance a List . I need to have an efficient mechanism in order to do very fast searches based on the labels or based on the resources. Thanks Dimitris
