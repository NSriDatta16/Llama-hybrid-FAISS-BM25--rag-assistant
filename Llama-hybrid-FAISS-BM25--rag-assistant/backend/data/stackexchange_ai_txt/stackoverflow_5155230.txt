I was tried with much of blog but still is not working. so as well as MS Access also not connecting so is there any solution for the outofbroser application I am really getting stuck. beacause I am using Isolation storage but it's still not providing ID so there is no scope to use it. It's really solid problem I am suffering to using silverlight. Is there any solution for this how to connect database with silverlight. Thanks...!!
