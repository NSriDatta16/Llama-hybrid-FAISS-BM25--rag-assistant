istream_iterator is input so your second code fragment isn't correct, you can't do this (second pass). Please look here and pay attention to "single pass" algorithms support (second paragraph under "description" title). First fragment doesn't try to perform 2 passes. Is this explanation OK? BTW SGI STL reference (from where I posted link) is somewhat outdated but very usable for some quick references (by my opinion). I'd recommend it to be bookmarked.
