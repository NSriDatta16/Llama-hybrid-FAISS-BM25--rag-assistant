There are different ways that metadata is stored. For structured storage files created by COM applications, it's embedded directly in the file data. This would change the file's hash if the document properties were changed. On volumes formatted with NTFS 5 (Win2k and later), document properties can be added to any type of file and are stored in alternate data streams. I assume the same is true for the OS X filesystem.
