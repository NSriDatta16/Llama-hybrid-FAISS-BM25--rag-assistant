no you are not increasing the coupling. As others have said - I dont see how the namespace use leaks the implementation out the consumer can choose to do using useful; using useful::Foo; useful::Foo = new useful::Foo(); my vote is always for the last one - its the least polluting THe first one should be strongly discouraged (by firing squad)
