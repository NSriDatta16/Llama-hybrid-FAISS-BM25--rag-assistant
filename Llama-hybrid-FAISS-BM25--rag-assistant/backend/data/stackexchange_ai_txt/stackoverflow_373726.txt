The return value of a grammar action is really no different from a local variable, so you should be able to use C# type inference to do the job. See this paper for some insight into how C# type inference is implemented. The standard way of doing type inference is the Hindley-Milner algorithm , but that will not handle overloading out-of-the-box. Note that even parser generators for type-inferencing languages don't typically infer the types of grammar actions. For example, ocamlyacc requires type annotations. The Happy parser generator for Haskell can infer types , but seems to discourage the practice. This might indicate that inferring types in grammars is difficult, a bad idea, or both. [UPDATE] Very much pwned by Norman Ramsey, who has the benefit of bitter experience.
