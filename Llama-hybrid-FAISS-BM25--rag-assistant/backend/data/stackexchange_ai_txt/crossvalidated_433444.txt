Smoothing time series with non-constant variance

I have a discrete time series $x(t)$ $ t = \{0,\Delta t,2\Delta t\dots\}$ in which every point comes with a confidence value $c(t)$ arising from the measurements. You may think of is as the variance or volatility of the time series that changes over time. I want to smooth this time series such that points with high confidence get weighted more than points with low confidence. One more thing is that the dynamical system generating $x(t)$ is non-linear and this non-linearity is very important for downstream analysis so I want to preserve it as much as possible. Which method do you recommend that can perform this (adaptive) smoothing?
