What is the difference between C and Posix locales on Postgres?

I know that database locales on Postgres are responsible for proper order of national characters, proper lower/upper-casing etc. But why there are two language-neutral locales: posix and c ? Is there any difference between them or is it just one neutral locale with two different names? UPDATE As Magnus Hagander states in his answer, POSIX and C locales are the same locale with different names (no matter if Postgres is installed on POSIX or Windows System). I don't know how to confirm this information - where to look for proper section of documentation? Magnus's explanation seems sensible, but it is strange at the same time that there are two names for the same locale to choose from. What is the purpose of this - only to make confusion?
