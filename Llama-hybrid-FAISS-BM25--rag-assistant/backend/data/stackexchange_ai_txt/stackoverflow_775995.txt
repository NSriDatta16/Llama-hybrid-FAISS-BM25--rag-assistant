Your question is IMHO very broad. Most Spam filters will fit your description. But in general your approach will depend on what the application has to learn and how it should learn. Spam filters for example usually do supervised learning. But if you don't want the user to help your application learning you would have to go with unsupervised learning methods. Of course there are more choices to make. mloss.org has a lot of libraries with ML algorithms that you could use. But for most of the libraries it is helpful if you know at least roughly how their algorithms work. The best is you read an some books on Machine Learning (like Mitchell's Machine Learning ) and AI.
