How to make a chat system on iPhone?

I'm doing research for making a chat based app for the iPhone (it's not really text chat in the regular sense, but the principles are the same). Maximum 6 people can be logged into the same chat room at any one time, and the most basic question is how to efficiently check for new messages? Would I need to simply poll the server periodically? Or is there a way I could trigger an event on the phone from the server whenever there is some new content to pay attention to? If having to poll all the time, I worry about the resulting lag as each participant will have to wait longer for others before they can post their own responses to others. And, potentially it might also be too much to handle for the server to respond to lots of requests all the time. It would also waste bandwidth, which is not free for the user... Unfortunately I will not be able to set up a socket server for this app, it has to be based around a regular LAMP configuration.
