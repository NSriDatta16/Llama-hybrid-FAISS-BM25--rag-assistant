Check out NHibernate . That will give you your 'database-like' storage. If it's human-readability you're after, consider serializing your objects using XML. .Net has decent support for serializing (and deserializing) objects using both XML and binary formats. The tutorial I used for learning serialization in C# is this CodeProject article . Update: I misread one point you made: serialization does not necessarily mean human-readable or not - if you decide to serialize, figure out if you want the data readable or not. Binary serialization is likely to be more compact and less readable.
