Which is the best binary classification model? Train and Test Accuracy are similar

I am building a binary classification model where classes are imbalanced but used SMOTE, I used 4 different models to compare performance and decide which to choose. They have same train and test accuracy.When I tested the models xgboost and logistic regression only on people with credit cards,lr predicted 81% but xgboost and random forest 50% predicted right. Model:(Train Accuracy,Test Accuracy) Random Forest:(0.963,0.961) Decision Tree:(0.962,0.961) Logistic Regression:(0.815, 0.815) XGBoost:(0.813,0.799) Model:(roc_auc_score,accuracy_score) Decision Tree:(0.949,0.993) Logistic Regression:(0.863,0.981) Random Forest:(0.968,0.995) XGBoost:(0.964,0.995) The images attached show the precision,recall and f1 score.
