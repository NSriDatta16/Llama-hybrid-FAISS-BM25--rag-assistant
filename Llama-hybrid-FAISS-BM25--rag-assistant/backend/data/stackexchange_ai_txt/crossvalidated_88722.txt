How do I interpret regression coefficients with autocorrelated residuals?

I am building a regression model of time series data in R, where my primary interest is the coefficients of the independent variables. The data exhibit strong seasonality with a trend. The model looks good, with four of the six regressors significant: Here are the OLS residuals: I used auto.arima to select the sARIMA structure, and it returns the model (0,1,1)(1,1,0)[12]. fit.ar My question is this: based on the parameter estimates and s.e. of the regressors, I believe that none of them are significant - is this correct, and if so, what does it imply if my goal is to interpret the relative importance of these predictors as opposed to forecasting? Any other advice relative to the process of building this model is welcome and appreciated. Here are the ACF and PACF for the residuals: > durbinWatsonTest(mod.ols, max.lag=12) lag Autocorrelation D-W Statistic p-value 1 0.120522674 1.6705144 0.106 2 0.212723044 1.4816530 0.024 3 0.159828108 1.5814771 0.114 4 0.031083831 1.8352377 0.744 5 0.081081308 1.6787808 0.418 6 -0.024202465 1.8587561 0.954 7 -0.008399949 1.7720761 0.944 8 0.040751905 1.6022835 0.512 9 0.129788310 1.4214391 0.178 10 -0.015442379 1.6611922 0.822 11 0.004506292 1.6133994 0.770 12 0.376037337 0.7191359 0.000 Alternative hypothesis: rho[lag] != 0
