User Agent String - provide as variable

I need to find the user agent string, which it looks like UserAgentSTring.com does for me but I need to store that so I can pass it to the server side. I am not sure how to accomplish this? The API docs say this: You can send a ua string as post or get request (form field or in the query string). Use 'uas' as parameter name: ?uas=Opera/9.70%20(Linux%20i686%20;%20U;%20en-us)%20Presto/2.2.0 this will automatically parse the string. To get some data you have to add one more parameter: But if I put that line in my source code, in the header of my page how will the server side recognize it? Any assistance would be great.
