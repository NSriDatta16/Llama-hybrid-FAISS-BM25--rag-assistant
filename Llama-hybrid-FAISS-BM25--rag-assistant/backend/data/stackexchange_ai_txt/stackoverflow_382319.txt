I realized that a more elegant approach is indeed to use a router, but for that you would need to create a custom one by extending the Zend_Controller_Router_Abstract class and implementing the "route" method. You get a Zend_Controller_Request_Abstract object as the parameter of the "route" method. There you can talk to the database and then you can use: Zend_Controller_Request_Abstract::setModuleName(), Zend_Controller_Request_Abstract::setControllerName(), Zend_Controller_Request_Abstract::setActionName() to define your route. I hope it helps!
