DivisionByZorro, First off, I love the name :-) Fear not: WebParts can run asynchronously/multi-threaded without too much extra work. You'll simply need to register the appropriate event handlers via Page.RegisterAsyncTask . You'll specify the method that should be invoked asynchronously, as well as the callback method to which control will return once processing is complete. Daniel Larson provides some nice coverage in his articles here ( http://daniellarson.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!D3543C5837291E93!180.entry ) and ( http://daniellarson.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!D3543C5837291E93!192.entry ). He also covers a handful of watchouts and other concerns. I hope this helps!
