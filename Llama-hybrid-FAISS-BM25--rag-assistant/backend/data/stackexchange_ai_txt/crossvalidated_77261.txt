First, yes, you can get confidence intervals for skewed distributions, or any distribution for that matter. A CI is defined by is exact, lower bound, or approximate coverage properties, not the shape of the underlying distribution. However, you said you are trying to estimate the range of this variable from a sample using a nonparametric technique. This will not be possible. You have an observed range, but to estimate the true range, you need a model of the distribution of ratios, which by your use of the bootstrap, you indicate that you don't know this. Also, keep in mind the differrence between a random variable and a statstic of that random varaible. Bootstrapping is useful for estimating the variability of statistics, but not the actual data, which is what it is. Simple descriptive statistics and percentils should suffice for your problem, as stated.
