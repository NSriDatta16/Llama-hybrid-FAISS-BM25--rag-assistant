There are many techniques. They usually fall within the category of "manifold learning" and "dimensionality reduction" techniques. In both cases, it is assumed that the data lives in a much lower dimensional manifold as the original data. For the purpose of visualization, you look for a mapping of your data to the plane, such that vicinity (topological distance) is preserved. That is, points mapped close to each other, are also close to each other in the original space. One recent, very popular technique is tSNE , but there is a bunch of others .
