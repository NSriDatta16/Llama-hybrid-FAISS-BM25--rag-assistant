DQN with decaying epsilon

I'm new to reinforcement learning. I'm studying DQN with decaying epsilon. I came across such example: EPISODES = 91 GAMMA = 0.2 EPSILON_DECAY = 0.999 MIN_EPSILON = 0.01 MAX_EPSILON = 1 My questions are: Is it correct if epsilon doesn't reach MIN_EPSILON? Is there something wrong with the reward - the reward is not higher and higher but it is behaving otherwise - it decreases in time?
