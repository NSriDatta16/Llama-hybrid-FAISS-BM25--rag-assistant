How to visually format remote server XML query response?

I'll preface this by stating I am a rank amateur when it comes to web dev. I have a web appliance that provides XML data when issued a query string such as: https://example.com/api/reporting.ns?username=name&password=password&generate_report=SupportSession&start_date=2009-04-01&duration=0&limit=all I created a simple form that allows users to modify values of this query and have the appropriate XML returned. Here is that form: Username: Password: Start Date: What I have not been able to accomplish is formatting that XML response so it looks pretty. I have created an XSLT that formats the XML nicely and have used javascript to transform the XML using the XSLT like this: function loadXMLDoc(dname) { if (window.XMLHttpRequest) { xhttp=new XMLHttpRequest(); } else { xhttp=new ActiveXObject("Microsoft.XMLHTTP"); } xhttp.open("GET",dname,false); xhttp.send(""); return xhttp.responseXML; } function displayResult() { xml=loadXMLDoc("Report.xml"); xsl=loadXMLDoc("Report.xsl"); // code for IE if (window.ActiveXObject) { ex=xml.transformNode(xsl); document.getElementById("content").innerHTML=ex; } // code for Mozilla, Firefox, Opera, etc. else if (document.implementation && document.implementation.createDocument) { xsltProcessor=new XSLTProcessor(); xsltProcessor.importStylesheet(xsl); resultDocument = xsltProcessor.transformToFragment(xml,document); document.getElementById("content").appendChild(resultDocument); } } Which works locally but I run up against the cross domain security problem as the web appliance is hardened and I am not able to place any code on it. I have been searching this site and the web for a couple days looking for a method to accomplish this using other means [asp?] and have been largely unsuccessful. The main reason this is so is that I don't know asp so I'm not sure how to attack it. I think creating the query string in a form, then loading the resulting xml response from the web appliance to a string and applying the XSLT that resides on the server to it might be an option but haven't been able to make it work; again because I'm not really sure what I'm doing. Here is my XSLT: --> Sessions Session ID Started Duration Public Site CTS Ticket Number Customer's Name Customer's Operating System Representative's Name Chat Transcript Download Download Chat And a snippet of the XML the web appliance outputs: support 2899 2010-11-17T16:00:08-05:00 2010-11-17T16:00:16-05:00 00:00:08 Default https://mysite.com/session_download.ns?lsid=l%3Dfef672741e025ffda1acb3041f09252d%3Bh%3D9bd6081f0b7fee08dcc32a58ef4cb54c7a0e233d%3Bt%3Dsd%3Bm%3Dchat&amp;dl_action=chat&amp;view=1&amp;sessionType=sd https://mysite.com/session_download.ns?lsid=l%3Dfef672741e025ffda1acb3041f09252d%3Bh%3D9bd6081f0b7fee08dcc32a58ef4cb54c7a0e233d%3Bt%3Dsd%3Bm%3Dchat&amp;dl_action=chat&amp;sessionType=sd 0 Smith, John Smith, John xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx DESKTOP Windows 7 Enterprise x64 Edition (Build 7600) 1 Further information: I found a way in asp to retrieve remote xml that works for URL's like http://example.com/file.xml but doesnt work for my URL. Maybe because it is a query? I've looked at way to encode/encapsulate my URL but haven't found anything that works. http://asp101.com/samples/xmlxsl_remote.asp Any help you could provide would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!
