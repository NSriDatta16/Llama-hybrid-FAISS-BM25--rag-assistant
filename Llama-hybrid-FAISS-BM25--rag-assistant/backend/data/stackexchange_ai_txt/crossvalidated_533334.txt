Is it correct to apply standard techniques for a confidence interval calculation to the result of a neural network?

so I have a binary classier from which I can evaluate on a test set and get a proportion (p) of which the classier has correctly gotten right. I then apply the following function to determine the 95% confidence interval. $$ CIBounds = \pm 1.96 * \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}} $$ Although my first initial thought was I believe this assumes the underlying distribution is normal. In my lectures this was never really addressed, how would I go around justifying using this approach (or not using it) for my neural network.
