Passenger apache default page error

I asked this a couple of days ago on Server Fault but am getting no responses and little interest. Since it is related to setting up a dev environment I thought the SO community might be able to help me out... I just installed Passenger and the Passenger Pref Pane on OSX. However, when I try to browse to one of my Rails applications I just get the default Apache "it works!" page. I've checked the vhost definitions and they seem ok so I can't seem to figure out whats wrong... I've tried reinstalling passenger and the pref pane and restarting apache but to no avail. Anyone know how to fix this? My vhost definition looks like this: ServerName boilinghot.local DocumentRoot "/Users/ganesh/Code/boilinghot/public" RailsEnv development Order allow,deny Allow from all
