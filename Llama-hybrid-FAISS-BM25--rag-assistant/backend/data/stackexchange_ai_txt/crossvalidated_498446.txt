As @DWin says in a comment, this is a standard application of survival analysis. That has the advantage of evaluating not only event occurrence but also the times to events. If you do proceed with your train/test split (even 5000 patients might not be enough for that to be reliable; model evaluation by resampling might be better) you say that you have time-to-event data. In that case, even with an all-or-none logistic regression model, you can evaluate 28-day mortality by ignoring deaths that occur after 28 days from your start time. The rms package in R, also noted by @DWin, provides a well developed infrastructure for combining survival analysis with resampling-based model validation and calibration, and providing predictions for specified combinations of covariate values. There's no reason why the approaches used there can't be extended to analysis with more of a "machine-learning" or "data-science" flavor. Just be aware that models provided by those latter approaches can be harder for mere human beings to interpret.
