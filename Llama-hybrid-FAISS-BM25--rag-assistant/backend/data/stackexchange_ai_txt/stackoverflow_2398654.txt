How to not allow parts of sortable jquery list to move?

I made a sortable list: milk eggs cheese However, I want to make everything with class food not draggable. Since they are links, sometimes when people click them, they accidently reorder the list. Does anyone know how to make just the "food" class items not "draggable"?
