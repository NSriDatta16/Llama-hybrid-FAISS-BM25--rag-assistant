I have never heard of this browser, but chances are that there are no CSS specific hacks to target it. You would have to detect it using the USER_AGENT string (either on server side or in JavaScript) and serve the appropriate CSS rules. Related: How can I detect the browser version with JS? What is better: CSS hacks or browser detection? not really related but good reading Any php code to detect the browser with version and operating system?
