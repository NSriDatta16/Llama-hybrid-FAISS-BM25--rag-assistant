AICc results in R

I used the model: Model1 I then used the dredge function to obtain an AICc results table. Model selection results for models predicting the effect of various predictor variables on disease (presence or absence) in birds in 10 research sites. Site was used as a random term. Predictor variables were classification of Urban / Rural (categorical - either labelled as urban or rural), distance to the urban edge (continuous), population density (continuous), altitude (continuous), average temperature (continuous) and average precipitation (continuous). The issue I have is that in the results table there is no parameter estimate given for classification of urban or rural which is the categorical variable - it only gives a $\pm$ sign (please see image below for the results table). Is this normal? Why is it doing this?
