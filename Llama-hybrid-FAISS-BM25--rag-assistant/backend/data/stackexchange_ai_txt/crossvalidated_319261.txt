The "randomForest" function in the "randomForest" R package supports the Balanced Random Forest. One need to specify the "strata" and the "sampsize" parameters to enable the balanced bootstrapping resampling. strata A (factor) variable that is used for stratified sampling. sampsize Size(s) of sample to draw. For classification, if sampsize is a vector of the length the number of strata, then sampling is stratified by strata, and the elements of sampsize indicate the numbers to be drawn from the strata.
