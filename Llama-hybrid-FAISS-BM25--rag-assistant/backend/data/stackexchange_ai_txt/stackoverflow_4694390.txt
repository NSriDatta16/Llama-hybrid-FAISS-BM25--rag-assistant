How to get the variables from an Array built by parsing a HTML file

Hi I wanted help in a situation where I have a folder called 'slides' and I have multiple text / html files in it like: slide1.html slide2.html slide3.html and so on..... The structure of these files is like this: Title of the Slide Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s. 3 properties Title, Image and the Description. One in each line . ----------- UPDATE --------------- I tried as suggested by @MATT but I am getting a blank screen: Here is the script of the entire page for reference. I am working on a Joomla template. get('enabled')) { $gantry->addScript('tabs.js'); $gantry->addInlineScript($this->_tabs()); } } function render($position="") { ob_start(); foreach(glob("/tabs/*.html") as $fileName) { $fname = basename( $fileName ); $curArr = file($fname); $slides[$fname ]['title'] = $curArr[0]; $slides[$fname ]['image-links'] = $curArr[1]; $slides[$fname ]['description'] = $curArr[2]; foreach($slides as $key => $value){ ?> ">
