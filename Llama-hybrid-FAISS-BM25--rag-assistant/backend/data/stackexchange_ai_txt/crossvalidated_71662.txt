It's a bit of an odd kind of homework question. I hate it when they have no relation to real life. In a real lawsuit you'd just claim that all, or x% of these secretaries are below average. That's sufficient. Some claim about statistical significance is pointless. Yes, you could generate a CI around the sample. It looks like they're assuming the 41.2 is a parameter, not a sample estimate, and therefore itself has a CI of 0. So, you just need to check if the city value is outside the sample CI.
