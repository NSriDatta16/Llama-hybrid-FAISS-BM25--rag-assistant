If the program is not running in the same folder as the image, it will not find the image. For example, if the program is running in c:\temp\MyProgram\, the image should be located in this same folder. Also, some IDEs allow you to specify the folder that the program will run when running or debugging from the IDE, you can set this path to your desktop or copy the image to the program folder. Another option is to specify the full image path in the load_bitmap call, but this is the worst solution in my opinion, because the program will only works when the image is exactly in this location. Also I suggest adding a check for null: red = load_bitmap("frago.png", NULL); if(red == NULL) { printf("Cannot load frago.png\n"); return 0; }
