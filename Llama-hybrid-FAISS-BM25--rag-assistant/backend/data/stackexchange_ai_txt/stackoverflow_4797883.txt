Kohana 3 ORM: Getting most repeated values, ranked, and inserting into new object / array

So, another in my series of Kohana 3 ORM questions :) I have, essentially, a pivot table, called connections . The connections table connects a song to a keyword . That's all great and working (thanks to my last two questions!) I want to output the most connected songs by keyword. So, to somehow query my connections table and output an object (with an arbitrarily limited number of iterations $n ) that ranks songs by the number of times they have been connected, ie. the number of times that particular song_id appears for that particular keyword_id . I have literally no idea how to achieve this, without querying every single row (!!!) and then counting those individual results in an array.... There must be a more elegant way to achieve this?
