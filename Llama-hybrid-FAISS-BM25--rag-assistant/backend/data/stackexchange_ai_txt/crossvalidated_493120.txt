Checking parallel regression assumption in ordinal logistic regression

I have tried to build an ordinal logistic regression using one ordered categorical variable and another three categorical dependent variables (N= 43097). While all coefficients are significant, I have doubts about meeting the parallel regression assumption. Though the probability values of all variables and the whole model in the brant test are perfectly zero (which supposed to be more than 0.05), still test is displaying that H0: Parallel Regression Assumption holds . I am confused here. Is this model perfectly meets the criteria of the parallel regression assumption? library(MASS) table(hh18_u_r$cat_ci_score) # Dependent variable Extremely Vulnerable Moderate Vulnerable Pandemic Prepared 6143 16341 20613 # Ordinal logistic regression olr_2 Extremely Vulnerable] b[>Moderate Vulnerable] Chisquare df Pr(>Chisq) Overall 168.9 4 Kindly suggest whether this model satisfies the parallel regression assumption? Thank you
