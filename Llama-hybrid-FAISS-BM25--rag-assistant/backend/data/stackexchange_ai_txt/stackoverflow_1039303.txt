No, there is nothing like that in the .NET framework. I would like to suggest that you build your interface a bit differently to leverage the power of inherited interfaces. Try something like this: interface ISelectionList : IList { T Selected { get; set; } } This will allow you to still use your ISelectionList as an IList where needed.
