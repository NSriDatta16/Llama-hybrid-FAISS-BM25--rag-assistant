Deep learning based Resume Parser and Scoring

I want to know if Deep learning can be used for Resume Parsing and scoring of the resume. Currently what I am doing is extracting the text from pdf or image using OCR/tesseract and finding the features like Email, Mobile No, Skills, Tenure, No of Companies, Awards etc from the text. So I have close to 100 features which are important for scoring the resume. Can we do similar thing using Deep learning and will the accuracy be better ? Any starting point/document/blog/github link which can help me get started on this. I have gone through this link but this doesn't not have code to start with.
