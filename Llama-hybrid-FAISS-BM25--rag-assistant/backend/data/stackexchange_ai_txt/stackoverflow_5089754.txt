it's surely possible, but not so automatically... i guess you should implement the UIScrollViewDelegate protocol method: - (void)scrollViewDidEndDragging:(UIScrollView *)scrollView willDecelerate:(BOOL)decelerate{ } it's the method called when the user stop to move the finger on the scrollView, you can check inside it the coordinate of your content: yourScrollView.contentOffset and then check which one of your page.x ( register them in an array when you create them, or check the origin of all your view added to the scrollView) is closer to it, then go to the offSet of your page (with animation) calling: - (void)setContentOffset:(CGPoint)contentOffset animated:(BOOL)animated
