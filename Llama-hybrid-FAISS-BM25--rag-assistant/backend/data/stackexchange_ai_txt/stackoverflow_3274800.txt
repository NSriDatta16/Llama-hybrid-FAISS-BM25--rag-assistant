Don't forget that with Jetty you can actually have the web server embedded into your application, which for some users can be extremely practical, but probably won't suit a project that is large. It's not as fully featured as other options (incl. Tomcat), but as you mention it is small and fast. If you can see advantages of embedding it and it's a small project, use it.
