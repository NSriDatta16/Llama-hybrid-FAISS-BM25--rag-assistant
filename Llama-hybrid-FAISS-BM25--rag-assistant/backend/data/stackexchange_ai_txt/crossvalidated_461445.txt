Using SVM on datasets with different number of features

I'm working on building SVM classifiers on single cell sequencing data. The number of features here depends a lot on the protocol used to sequence data as well as other effects which are hard to control. As a result, I often get datasets with variable number of features. I'm trying to train my model on a dataset that has 2201 observations and 9853 features and predict on a dataset that has 1753 observations and 17539 features. I tried something like using the first 50 or 100 PC's to train and predict but the main sources of variation do not seem to be captured. Any suggestions as to how I may be able to do this?
