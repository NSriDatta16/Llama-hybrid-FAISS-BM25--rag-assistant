As I know, there is currently no standard way. Each company/organization will have their own template to doc the copyright information. If this is your personal project, then just feel free to doc it in the way you feel most comforable. Adding a LICENSE file is a very common way for projects with many source files. Even in Python, there is currently no standard on the structure of docstrings. Python provides a lot of freedom, so just let it be dude ;)
