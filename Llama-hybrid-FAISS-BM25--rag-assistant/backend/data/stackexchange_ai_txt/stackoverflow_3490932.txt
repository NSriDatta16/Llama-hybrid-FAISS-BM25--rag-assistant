You often find this sort of behaviour when you measure elapsed times. That's because elapsed times depends on all of the other things that your computer may be doing. See for example: pax> time sleep 1 real 0m1.012s user 0m0.004s sys 0m0.000s pax> time sleep 1 real 0m1.002s user 0m0.004s sys 0m0.000s pax> time sleep 1 real 0m1.007s user 0m0.004s sys 0m0.000s In all those cases, the elapsed real time varies but the actual use of the processor, user+sys is remarkably consistent. For timing, you should use the most accurate measurement you can (such as user+sys ) to remove external influences. You should also use statistical techniques to get a more accurate picture. For example, I tend to do twelve runs, throw away the outliers (fastest and slowest), then average the remaining ten.
