.NET compact framework and memory management: OOM Exception

My .NET CF 3.5 application receives an Out of memory exception when DOM processing an xml file of size 2MB. Now I understand that this should be changed to SAX processing, but I was wondering why this error is received. From http://blogs.msdn.com/b/mikezintel/archive/2004/12/08/278153.aspx , "Windows CE creates one additional virtual address space, 1G in size, for large allocations." "The 32MB application virtual address space can come under a lot of pressure by a large application, and if it becomes sufficiently fragmented, can lead to OOM errors even when there is free physical memory." Does this mean that if my application's heap size, including the DOM, takes up more memory than 32 MB, the application will crash, but then can't it use more of the the 1GB virtual address space for this allocation?
