The second approach based on a correlation won't tell you anything about the direction of the trend. At its base it is the same as the first approach - fits a simple linear regression - but it is giving you one of the least useful bits of output from fitting that model. So of the two, the first approach, based on linear regression, is definitely the best. However, it will still be highly flawed. First, the linear model seems unlikely to be appropriate. What happens when the heart rate starts low, goes high, and returns to a low point? Your regression will show a horizontal line. Second, even if were, ordinary least squares as interpreted in a usual regression situation (with standard F statistics and standard errors of coefficient estimates etc) gives misleading estimates with time series data. This is because classic regression modelling inference assumes the observations are independent and identically distributed, which is obviously not the case - each observation in a short time period such as this adds only limited extra information to what you got from the previous observation/s. A recommendation on a better approach would depend more on what your underlying interest is in the trend or tendency. A locally weighted scatterplot smoother to describe the trend may be a possible solution if it is a matter of describing the trend in each time window - or it may not, depending on what you're interested in.
