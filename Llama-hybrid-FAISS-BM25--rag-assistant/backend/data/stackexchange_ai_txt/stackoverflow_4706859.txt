You're talking about a standalone app, not a django app. This can be done with javascript (jQuery, Sproutcore, JavascriptMVC, Pyjamas ...) or Adobe AIR, or... Pulling data from Django is just a matter of setting up a syncing method, most probably using JSON, to fill up the browser local storage. So this is not django-specific at all. If you want a standalone django app, this can be done if you bundle in a python desktop app django with a built-in server, that's another question
