Compiler generated code in code coverage

I am using Intel code coverage tools on Linux using g++ compiler. For a particular class, the coverage tool shows 2/3 extra functions than those actually present in source code. What are these extra functions? Are they compiler generated functions? I am excluding header files from code coverage. My classes are simple with empty ctor and dtor. I guess following functions are generated by compiler. Copy Constructor Assignment operator Macro (Not in my case) Signal slot connection mechanisms (e.g. in Qt moc compiler generates these)
