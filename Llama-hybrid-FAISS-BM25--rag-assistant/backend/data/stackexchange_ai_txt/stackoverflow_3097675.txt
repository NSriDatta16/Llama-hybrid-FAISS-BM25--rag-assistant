Maintaining the member's hours spent in the organization : Drupal Website

I am running a Drupal powered website of my college. Each student has a certain (fixed) number of hours to complete in any kind of sport. Now, I am maintaining various sports on my website using CCK and Views. Now, if a student plays some sport say A, he will go to the website and check out A's details. Also, after specified period of time a link appears on the A page where student can check out his hours. He can then log in and check his hours for A. And similarly, for others. Important point here is for different sports he will see differently managed hours. There will also be a point where he can see his total hours that have been approved. Most of the hours in my website are uploaded using .csv file. So, I am trying to do this mainly without the Drupal Modules. When someone uploads a .csv file I take the page title as a parameter and create a table with name as page title which is nothing but my event name. And, when some student queries his hours, I send it as a hidden parameter the title of the page and then return the hours of the student. But, now I want to do this using a Drupal Module because this approach is somehow not working. Can anyone suggest me a Drupal Module for the above? I tried using many modules for above, most close being User Points, in which I perceive points as hours. But this had some problems.
