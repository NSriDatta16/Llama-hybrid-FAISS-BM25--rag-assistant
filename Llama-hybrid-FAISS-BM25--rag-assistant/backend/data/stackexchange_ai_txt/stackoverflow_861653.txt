Here is the gmail uploader clone . This is the exact clone of gmail uploader with some extra facilities. You can see the thumbnails of images after uploading, Drag the thumbnails to change the order and replace any thumbnail. It is done using jQuery . You can see the demo here . The source code is free to download in a single zip file . I hope you can easily remove some code and get the desired thing. You may leave comments on the ABCoder blog if you need further help.
