I'm going with Jeff on this one and assuming that since you mention the registry, you're referring to Windows. I'm also going to assume that you're talking about a desktop application (otherwise you could just use the builtin browser cookies to store the user's session). Off the top of my head, I'd engineer the application so that when the user logs in to the server, the server returns a unique session id that identifies the authenticated user. I would then store than id along with an salted/encryped timestamp (which gives you the option of expiring the cached credentials). The storage mechanism is up to you. You could store them in the HKEY_LOCAL_USERS section of the windows registry, or the Application Data folder in Windows. Both give you the option of user segmented storage.
