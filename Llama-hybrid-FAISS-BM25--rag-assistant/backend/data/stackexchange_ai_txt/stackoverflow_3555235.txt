How can I redirect 7z-compressed content using LWP::UserAgent as an attachment

I have a perl script which accepts incoming POST and PUT requests from other command line clients, gets the data (gzip) associated with each request and writes out to a seperate file. I want to extend the script by adding redirect functionality. Here is what I'm planning to do * Once the data file is written, forward/redirect the file with the same headers(which we received from clients ) to another URL using LWP. Please let me know about how to do that.
