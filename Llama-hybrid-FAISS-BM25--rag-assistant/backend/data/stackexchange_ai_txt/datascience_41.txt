Is the R language suitable for Big Data

R has many libraries which are aimed at Data Analysis (e.g. JAGS, BUGS, ARULES etc..), and is mentioned in popular textbooks such as: J.Krusche, Doing Bayesian Data Analysis; B.Lantz, "Machine Learning with R". I've seen a guideline of 5TB for a dataset to be considered as Big Data. My question is: Is R suitable for the amount of Data typically seen in Big Data problems? Are there strategies to be employed when using R with this size of dataset?
