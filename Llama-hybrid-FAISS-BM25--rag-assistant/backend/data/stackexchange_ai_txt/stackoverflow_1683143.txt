It sounds like the best option for you would be to develop your applications in Silverlight and make use of the Out Of Browser (OOB) feature. The OOB feature allows you to install a Silverlight application on your desktop so that it can run in offline mode. You can make use of .NET RIA Services which includes the Business Application Template allowing you to very quickly create CRUD types of applications. Brad Abrams blog series on RIA applications Brad Abrams MIX Presentation on RIA applications You will need to have a web services layer in front of your sql databases for this approach. However, that should be there regardless. For data in offline mode you can use Isolated Storage (as Nate mentioned in the comments). Here are a few links on that topic: Save and Load objects in Isolated Storage as Xml Client side database via Linq and Isolated Storage On my current project we cache the lookup tables as collections in Isolated storage for offline mode. When the user comes online we refresh that data. For transactional data (like an order) we don't cache them, but we allow the user to create new ones offline and then add them to the system when they come back online. It is working well for us right now.
