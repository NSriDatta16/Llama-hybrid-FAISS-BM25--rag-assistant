In JS, what is this feature called?

I'm trying to learn about this feature of javascript I keep seeing in code, but I don't know the name of the construction to google for... var Stats = { onLoad: function(e) { // content this.variable++; }, variable: 1 }; Is this way of organising functions and variables based on JSON?
