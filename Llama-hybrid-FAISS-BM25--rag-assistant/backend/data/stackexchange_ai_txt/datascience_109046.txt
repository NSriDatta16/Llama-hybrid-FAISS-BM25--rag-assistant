Cluster tabular data with text in some columns

Let's say I have a following features in the my dataframe: user_id user_age is_student is_graduate salary resume integer integer binary binary integer text (up to 1000 symbols) And also a few more categorical and numeric features. I want to cluster my data based on the given data. I could've just use K-Means, however I want to include resume column in my data. Is there a way to include text column in any clustering algorithm? One idea I have is to get vector embeddings for each resume observation, then cluster them, and then add those cluster_id to the initial data. This way the text data will be somehow used. Another idea is to use TF-IDF. Let's say I will create 100 more binary features (words from TF-IDF). This way I can run K-Means straightforwardly on the new data, but this way my dataframe increases dramatically and the clustered data might be hard to interpret.
