You can set shipment status - there's a field for it that's set to NULL for me when you query via the shipment.list API Here's a dump: Array ( [0] => Array ( [store_id] => 1 [total_weight] => [total_qty] => 1.0000 [email_sent] => 1 [order_id] => 3 [customer_id] => 1 [shipping_address_id] => 6 [billing_address_id] => 5 [shipment_status] => [increment_id] => 100000001 [created_at] => 2010-11-11 15:41:41 [updated_at] => 2010-11-11 15:44:05 [shipment_id] => 1 ) It doesn't look like you can set it via the WS API, which means that you'll need to include mage.php in your external script and then update the shipment via magento (as silvo has shown above). Sorry, I don't have the syntax to hand but I suspect you would update based on the shipment ID as opposed to the order. This means that you will need to create a shipment first (again, this can be done via the webservices API via the shipment.create method (details on the same page as the prior link). I hope this sets you on the right path. If anyone has any working code for doing this (which brought me to this post originally) PLEASE feel free to share. :)
