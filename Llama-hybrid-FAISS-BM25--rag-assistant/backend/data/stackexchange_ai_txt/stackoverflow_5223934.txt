I have posted a sample of dragging and resizing transformed SVG rects in my answer here: SVG coordinates with transform matrix You can see the working example on my site here: http://phrogz.net/svg/drag_under_transformation.xhtml The key is to: When you start dragging ( mousedown ) record the mouse location (in SVG global space). During dragging ( mousemove ) calculate the offset (in SVG global space) for the drag, and then Transform that offset from global space into the local space of the object, and use that to inform your changes. This works regardless of the transformation hierarchy applied (as shown in my example).
