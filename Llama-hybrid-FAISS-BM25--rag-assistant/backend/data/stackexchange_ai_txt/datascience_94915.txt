You can try using dependency parsing for that, e.g., as implemented in Spacy or any other NLP toolkit. The details should be adjective modifiers (dependency label amod ) of what you call attribute that you detected using a NER-like approach. Alternatively, they can form compound nouns as "airy cotton" in your example. In this case, it is a word that depends on the entity with the dependency label compound . But I guess this will be rarely the case because such compounds will be more often recognized as one entity. Spacy has an online demo for dependency parsing .
