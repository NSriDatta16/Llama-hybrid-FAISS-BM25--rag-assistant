Survival analysis for different diseases on same patients

I want to apply survival analysis on UFC-fights. Each fighter represents a "disease" and each knock-out is a "death". Each UFC fight consists of a number of rounds and the number of rounds corresponds to the time alive. There are basically three different possible outcomes per fight: Fighter KO’s opponent in round r - event is observed in round r Opponent KO’s fighter in round r - event is right-censored in round r Fighter or opponent wins by jury decision - event is right-censored in round r = 3 ( normal fight) or r = 5 ( title fight) This looks for a single fighter as follows: The goal is to determine the conditional probability of opponent o getting KO’ed when fighting against fighter f in round r give that he/she has survived until that round (a.k.a. the hazard rate): The person period data looks as follows: I assume that because fighters are fighting against each other within their weight classes, there is a lot of information that can borrowed between the opponents. Therefore, I intend to use (bayesian) discrete survival analysis. Singer and Willet (1993) show the likelihood function of this is the same as logistic regression / likelihood function for N independent Bernoulli trials with parameter λ (the hazard rate). Is anyone aware of similar papers where the methodology consist of different diseases and more or less same patient pool? There are no competing risks between the fighters / diseases because there is enough rest between the fights (sometimes months). Although, I understand that it is difficult to die more than once, can please someone point me out how to determine the "deadliest" fighter?
