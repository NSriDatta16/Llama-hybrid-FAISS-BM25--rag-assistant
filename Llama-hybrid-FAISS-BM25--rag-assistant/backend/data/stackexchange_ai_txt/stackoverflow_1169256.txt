How to programmatically drag and drop a Sprite in Flex?

I need some actionscript code to simulate the dragging and dropping of a Sprite, I was wondering if it is possible to do so? if it is how? For example to simulate a click on a Sprite I can achieve with the following line of code. sprite.dispatchEvent(new MouseEvent(MouseEvent.CLICK));
