I hear that semantic hashing achieves excellent results. However, deep belief nets are prettyhard to implement. You might want to try min hashing (that's a probabilistic approach, though) or locality sensistive hashing for euclidean spaces . In general, clustering in such high dimensional spaces is difficult due to the curse of dimensionalty and the fact that most items have similar distances to each other. Standard approaches like K-Means might work if you reduce the dimensionality beforehand via SOMs or PCA.
