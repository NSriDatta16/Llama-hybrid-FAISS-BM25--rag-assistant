Dragging an image in WPF

I'm trying to create a WPF application where I can drag an image around. Currently I have an image placed in the center of the window, and I'm thinking of using the three mouseevents MouseDown, MouseMove and MouseUp to calculate the new position when dragging the image. Are there any other good ideas on how to do this? I'm totally new to WPF so my mindset is still in the Windows Forms world. As far as I can see I need to use a in order to have absolute positioning available.
