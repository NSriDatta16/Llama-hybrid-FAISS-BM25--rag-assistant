You could the use the principle of the Watts-Strogatz model ( Watts'98 ): in the article, they show empirically that randomly rewiring a very few links in a lattice allows largely decreasing the average distance while keeping a relatively high clustering coefficient. In this model, a parameter p allows controlling the (expected) proportion of rewired links. For each rewired link, one randomly selects one of its end-points, then exchange it for a different (randomly drawn) node. You can find an implementation in igraph, see file igraph/src/games.c#igraph_watts_strogatz_game on their GitHub . You could implement this simple mechanism, apply it to your own data, and study how playing with p affects the other topological proporties of interest. But intuitively, it seems hard to completely control one topological property without changing the others. For instance, in a previous work I studied how a different rewiring process (designed to produce a community structure) affects the average distance, degree correlation and average distance of a network, and the effects were very different, and sometimes very strong.
