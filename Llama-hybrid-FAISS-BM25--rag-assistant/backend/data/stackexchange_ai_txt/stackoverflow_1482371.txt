Flash AS3 CS4 Project Organisation

I have a large .fla file with all my movieclips (and associated classes) for an entire site in the library. The whole thing is getting unmanageable - compiling very slowly - and not getting any smaller so I would like to know the simplest way to manage my assets in other fla files to be brought together when the main fla is published. I would prefer not to load external swfs at run time - I have heard the suggestion to load external SWFs into a ByteArray using URLoader - but would like to know if this is the best practice. I would appreciate any advice you could offer.
