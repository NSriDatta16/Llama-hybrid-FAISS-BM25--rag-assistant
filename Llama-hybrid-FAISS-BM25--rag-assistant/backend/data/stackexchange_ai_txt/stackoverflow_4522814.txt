I don't know of any way to do this in JPA. But you could add a trigger to the database which catches attempts to insert NULL into the column in question, and rewrites the insert to insert the default? Essentially, you move the default-generation behaviour entirely down into the database, rather than splitting it between JPA and the database. However, as bert points out in his answer, this would leave the object and the database inconsistent, which is almost certainly a bad think.
