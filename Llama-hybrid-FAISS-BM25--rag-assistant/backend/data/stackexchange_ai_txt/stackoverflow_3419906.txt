First, a method named like saveTempImage:: is to be discouraged. Make it saveTempImage:fileName: or something. Your guess is probably good; saving the file is probably where the pause is coming from. Could also be the rendering itself, if complicated, but doesn't look like it is. However, guessing is generally an unproductive way to analyze performance problems. Use the provided tools. The CPU Sampler instrument could tell you what is really going on. To fix? First confirm the problem. If it is the file I/O, move it off the main thread (I haven't looked at UIImage 's documentation to know if it is thread safe in such a context).
