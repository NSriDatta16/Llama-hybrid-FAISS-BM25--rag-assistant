@tonfa, hgdebuginstall produced no errors, which is why the problem I was having was so weird. Thanks to your response, I did some digging and found the module in ~/lib/python/mercurial , so I copied the osutil.so file over to my ~data/mercurial-1.5/mercurial directory and that was that... but then more and more modules couldnâ€™t be found so I decided to copy the entire contents of one directory over to the other, like so: $ rm -R ~/data/mercurial-1.5/mercurial/* $ cp -r ~/lib/python/mercurial/* ~/data/mercurial-1.5/mercurial Now, everything works fine. I don't understand why it seems that mercurial was installed in two directories, or why one directory ( ~/data/mercurial-1.5/mercurial ) didn't get the same files as the other ( ~/lib/python/mercurial ). Anyway, this is the solution I came up with. If you (or anyone) can think of something more elegant, I'd be all ears, but as it is... this one works for me. Thanks for your time.
