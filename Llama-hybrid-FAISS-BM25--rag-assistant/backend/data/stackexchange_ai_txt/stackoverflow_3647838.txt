Map CodeIgniter Validation class to Jquery validation

I am using the CI validation class to do server-side validation and Jquery validation to do client-side validation. Is there some way I can leverage the CI validation and form building, so that when it is creating the form elements it creates them with class=" " ? This way, if I change the valiation rules for an element I only have to do it in the CI rules and it automatically changes for Jquery. Thanks, Lemaint
