Bayesian modeling is different from frequentist modeling in many ways, one of the most important being that binary decisions (normal/non-normal; equal vs. unequal variances) are not required, and parameters can be added for things you don't know. These extra parameters don't always require full degrees of freedom because we often use priors that favor smaller values for the extra parameters. The result of adding extra parameters is that uncertainty intervals will be accurate, whereas in the traditional frequentist world if you assess residuals for normality or constant variance and make decisons from that the resulting confidence intervals will be falsely narrow. An easy way to allow for non-normality is to use a $t$ distribution instead of Gaussian for residuals, and to include heteroscedasticity. All this is quite easy with the R brms package. Start with the Bayesian $t$ -test . It appears that you are using the rstanarm package in R which is also excellent. It may have options to limit assumptions as well.
