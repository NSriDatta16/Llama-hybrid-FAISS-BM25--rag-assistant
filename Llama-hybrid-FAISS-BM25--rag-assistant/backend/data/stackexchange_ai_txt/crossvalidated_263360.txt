forecast with auto.arima in R

I am trying to forecast a time series analysis based on auto.arima() function in R. I have a time series with 35 data points and 3 different regressors. auto.arima() gives me the following output library(forecast) fit.auto.arima Now I want to forecast the 36th time point for Z_value time series. forecast() provides the following forecast(fit.auto.arima,xreg=cbind(1.578,0.273,4.771)) Point Forecast Lo 80 Hi 80 Lo 95 Hi 95 36 -0.2654575 -1.217922 0.6870074 -1.722127 1.191212 But I don't understand what this function does. When I try to calculate the forecast manually, the results are different. I would use 0.5405*Z_values[35] + 0.1407*1.578 + 0.0418*0.273 - 0.1163*4.771 0.5405*(-0.09605174) + 0.1407*1.578 + 0.0418*0.273 - 0.1163*4.771 =-0.3733473 So I manually get -0.3733473 and forecast provides -0.2654575 . What am I doing wrong when I calculate it manually / what does forecast() do? Here's my data Z_values
