With the Bayesian approach it is easy to simulate from the posterior distributions of $A$ and $B$ and then to get simulations of the posterior distribution of $A/B$. Using the standard noninformative prior for the Gaussian linear model, we do not need MCMC techniques and we probably obtain a good frequentist-matching property: a $95\%$-posterior credibility interval is approximately a $95\%$-confidence interval in the frequentist sense.
