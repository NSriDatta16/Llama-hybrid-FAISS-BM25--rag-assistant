Textured points in OpenGL ES 2.0?

I'm trying to implement textured points (e.g. point sprites) in OpenGL ES 2.0 for a particle system. Problem I'm having is the points all render as solid black squares, rather than having the texture properly mapped. I have verified that gl_PointCoord is in fact returning x/y values from 0.0 to 1.0, which would map across the entire texture. The texture2D call always seems to return black though. My vertex shader : attribute vec4 aPosition; attribute float aAlpha; attribute float aSize; varying float vAlpha; uniform mat4 uMVPMatrix; void main() { gl_PointSize = aSize; vAlpha = aAlpha; gl_Position = uMVPMatrix * aPosition; } And my fragment shader : precision mediump float; uniform sampler2D tex; varying float vAlpha; void main () { vec4 texColor = texture2D(tex, gl_PointCoord); gl_FragColor = vec4(texColor.rgb, texColor.a * vAlpha); } The texture in question is 16x16. I am able to successfully map this texture to other geometry, but for some reason not to points. My platform is a Motorola Droid, running Android 2.2.
