Is it reasonable to use sqlite for a low traffic web application?

I've always thought of and used SQLite as a tool for client side storage. But I am developing a low traffic web application, with simple storage and querying requirements. Is it reasonable (and/or at all common) to use SQLite on the backend of a web application, where I would generally use MySQL? Thanks in advance for any thoughts on this subject. UPDATE: Thanks for responses. 1) Yes, it would remain low traffic as it is being designed for a small, predefined group of users. 2) I would be using an ORM and no SQLite specific features, so switching to MySQL, as you say, should not be a big issue if it became necessary. 3) @stealthyninja: Would you say 100 insert/updates per day would qualify as very infrequently?
