I am not quite sure what you mean by sending an array to a httpservice. If you mean to send an array to a httpservice with the same field name, you can pass an array as field value. var service:HTTPService = new HTTPService(); service.useProxy = true; service.destination = "myservicet"; service.resultFormat = HTTPService.RESULT_FORMAT_XML; var fields:Array = ["categories", "organisation"]; var params:Object = new Object(); params.q = "stackoverflow"; params.rows = 0; params.facet = "true"; params["facet.field"] = fields; service.send(params); The HTTPService will convert this to the url parameters: facet=true&q=stackoverflow&facet%2Efield=categories&facet%2Efield=organisation&rows=0 Hope this helps! Added for more clarity. When there is only 1 argument in the array, do not pass the fields as an array. For some reason, flex will not send this to the http service
