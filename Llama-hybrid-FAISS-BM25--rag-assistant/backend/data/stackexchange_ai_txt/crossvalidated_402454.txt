Let's plot the data points you use. plot(c(rep(1,4),rep(2,4)),c(m1,m2,m3,m4,m5,m6,m7,m8),pch=19,xlim=c(.5,2.5), xlab="",xaxt="n",ylab="",las=1) lines(c(.8,1.2),rep(mean(c(m1,m2,m3,m4)),2)) lines(c(1.8,2.2),rep(mean(c(m5,m6,m7,m8)),2)) The horizontal lines give the group means. Your calculation is almost correct. Your calculation of the pooled standard deviation is slightly wrong. You need to square the groupwise SDs to get groupwise variances, then take the average of those and finally take the square root. You forgot to take the square. Here is how it should look like: pooledSD However, that doesn't make all that much of a difference. The correct calculation yields a Cohen's $d$ of $d=-0.01673617$ . Recall what Cohen's $d$ is: it is the difference between the group means, standardized by the pooled standard deviation. In your case, this means that the group means differ by only 0.01673617 pooled standard deviations. So, essentially not at all. See the picture above, especially the horizontal lines (the group means). A negative value for Cohen's $d$ is fine. It just depends on how you take the difference in group means. Unless you have a one-sided hypothesis, this doesn't make a difference. A large sample size in your original calculation, or a tiny power using your sample size of $n=4$ per group, are two aspects of the same problem: you are trying to detect an infinitesimally small effect, namely a difference in group means that is no more than 0.01673617 pooled standard deviations. To detect such a small effect with power 0.5, you need a huge sample size. Or conversely, if you have a small sample size, you have essentially no chance of detecting it. (Note that the power will not drop below your alpha level. Which just means that if you do get a significant result, it's more likely to be a false positive.) Bottom line: it's good that you are thinking about your power before starting your study. Unfortunately, if your effects are truly this minuscule, you will not be able to detect them with a small sample.
