From what I have found out, transplant is the best extension to use. It applies a changset to any other revision you want it to. http://mercurial.aragost.com/kick-start/tasks.html#transplanting-changes The solution to my problem was to update to the branch where the two changes should have been applied, transplant the two changesets in and then use mq to strip the changes. All do-able within tortoisehg too.
