Is Gaussian Process Regression and Bayesian kernel Machine Regression similar?

I was reading Bobb et al. "Bayesian kernel machine regression for estimating the health effects of multi-pollutant mixtures" (2015) about Bayesian kernel machine regression. I was wondering if it is the same method as Gaussian Process Regression, just under a different name. Can you elaborate please?
