If you're really asking what the best tool for the job is, then you are going to have to give a little more detail than "first small web project." If what you are asking is more along the lines of you want to learn web application development and what you already know is C++ and python so what would be a good web application stack where you can leverage your current skillset, then here are some more suggestions. Django is pretty cool. Every one has already talked about it here. As mentioned earlier, the google app engine is sort of based on Django. Also, consider zope which is another python based web application container. If you wanted to leverage your C++ knowledge instead, then consider Wt . Why don't you take a look at the hello world examples for all three and decide which one looks the most interesting to you?
