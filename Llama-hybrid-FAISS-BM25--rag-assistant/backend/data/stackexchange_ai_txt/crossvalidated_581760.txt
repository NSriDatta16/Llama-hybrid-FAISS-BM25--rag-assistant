How to model multinomial output given one categorical input?

I have climate and vegetation data by latitude longitude. The vegetation data is a categorical variable with 20 possible options. The climate data is relative frequency of occurrence (RFO) for a dozen climate states - adding up to 100%. Lat, Lon, Veg, CS1, CS2, CS3, CS4, CS5, CS6, CS7, CS8, CS9, CS10, CS11, CS12, 39.5, 178.5, 2, 0, 0, 33, 17, 20, 10, 0, 0, 0, 0, 12, 8, 39.5, 179.0, 1, 0, 0, 23, 20, 17, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 10, 20, ... What I want is a model where I can input the vegetation data classification and it gives a most likely RFO for each climate state. As this will then be applied to past fossil sites, I do not wish to use the longitude and latitude as input data. Using Random Forest models I already know that the climate data can predict the vege classification ~80% of the time, with quite a lot of 'near-misses' according to the confusion matrix, but what I need is the flip-side of this - if I input the vege data, can I get the RFO of the climate states. I have been looking at K-means clustering, Linear Discriminant Analysis and Multiple Nominal Logistic Regression, but I am unsure if these apply to what I am trying to achieve. I also thought about producing probability densities for each climate state for each vege type, but I am not sure if there is already a method that would do that in a more functional way, or perhaps a simpler way. Are their existing statistical or machine learning techniques that achieve what I am trying to do?
