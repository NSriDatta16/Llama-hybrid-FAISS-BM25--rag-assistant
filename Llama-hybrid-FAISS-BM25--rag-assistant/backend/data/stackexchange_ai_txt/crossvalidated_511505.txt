Here's a collection of datasets which I occasionally use in my courses: Epina DataLab repository The datasets at this site are available both as text files and as IDT files (which is DataLab's internal format, most convenient to be load in Epina DataLab). The datasets are suitable for a wide range of statistiscal methods, such as regression, LDA, PCA, HCA, PLS, etc.
