The OO mindset is based on principles that lie at a much more basic level than design patterns. Design patterns are somehow fashionable these days (and have been for a while), and they are useful, but they are just one more layer that you can put upon more basic stuff that you absolutely must learn and master if you want to do OO properly. In other words: you can do OO perfectly without design patterns. In fact, many of us did OO well before the phrase "design patterns" was even coined. Now, there is stuff you can't do without. I suggest you start at the basics. Read and understand "Object-Oriented Software Construction" 2nd edition by Bertrand Meyer . It's probably the best book on OO programming around, both in width and depth. That is if you're interested in programming .
