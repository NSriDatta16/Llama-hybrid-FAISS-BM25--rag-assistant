Machine learning - Normalize or Standarizing

When prepocessing continuous and integer data, is it better to normalize to $[0, 1]$ (i.e., $\frac{x-\min(x)}{\max(x)-\min(x)}$ ) or normalize via z-score (i.e., $\frac{x-\bar{x}}{s_x}$ )? Is doing both a bad practice? Would you suggest other normalization techniques?
