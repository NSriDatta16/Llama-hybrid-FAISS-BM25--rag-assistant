That depends on what you mean by leaving out factors that aren't significant, and how your logistic regression is coded. If one level of your factor is being treated as the reference group (it always has effect estimate = 0), and other levels of that factor are coded as dummy variables (1 for subjects in that level, 0 otherwise), removing the dummy variables for some other levels is equivalent to combining those levels with the reference group. In R, the default reference group is the value that comes first in alphabetical order, so think about whether that makes sense. This is exactly the same thing as recoding your categorical variable. However, if you're comparing several different codings (or, parametrizations) to see which one fits best, you need to account for this when reporting your results, because the probability of observing "significant" results by chance increases with the number of different models you try.
