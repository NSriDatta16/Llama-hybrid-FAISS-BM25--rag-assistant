If you could provide the community with literature resources or a graphic/sketch of your problem formulation and thoughts, then you will receive more specific answers. And to answer your questions as it stands: Is the above a realistic representation of the weights along the edge of a bayesian network? No. Or is a probabilistic representation more suitable? If so, what is the best representation? Yes. Bayesian networks do not have weights associated with their edges. An edge in a Bayesian network represents the conditional probability for a corresponding random variable, which is represented as a node/vertex in the graph. Finally, the edges refer to conditional probability distributions, whereas the components of mutual information are based on joint probability distribution and marginal probability distribution.
