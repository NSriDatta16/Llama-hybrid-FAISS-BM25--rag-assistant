Clearly the assumptions required for the usual normal-theory tests don't hold. However, the question is not so much "are the assumptions actually true" -- I find it doubtful that they ever really do hold -- as "how much does it impact the inferential procedures of interest?" This question is equally applicable to nonparametric procedures; they're not assumption-free either and a similar question of amount of impact will arise. In respect of some assumptions common nonparametric procedures may even be more sensitive. When we speak of impact on inference, in relation to hypothesis tests this will generally be consideration of the effect on actual significance level and on power. The two are intimately related; moving the true type I error rate will move the power curve. The impact of the normality assumption in ANOVA tends to reduce with sample size and under some mild conditions might be effectively ignored at very large sample sizes; the impact of unequal variance or dependence does not tend to go away in the same fashion. One option you might look at is to model the DV as ordered categorical and tailor the model (and subsequently, the formal hypotheses) to that. You might consider ordered logistic regression (ordered logit, proportional odds) Another potentially suitable model is the stereotype model which is related to multinomial logistic regression (which itself is suitable for nominal data but is also at least sometimes used with ordered data).
