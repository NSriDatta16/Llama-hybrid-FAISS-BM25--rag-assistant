Adding a parameter to the URL in ASP MVC

I need to have a parameter as part of my ASP MVC URL before Controller and Action: http://www.mydomain.com/ company1 /Home or http://www.mydomain.com/ company1 /Clients/Detail/1 (Ideally I would like to have this as a sub-domain like this: http:// company1 .mydomain.com/Clients/Detail/1 so any answers solving this one is also appreciated) I call this parameter Account. I tried adding something like this to the routing map: "{account}/{controller}/{action}/{id}" but it gives me a 404 error when trying something like http://www.mydomain.com/company1/Home Here is the RegisterRoutes in Global.asax: public static void RegisterRoutes(RouteCollection routes) { routes.IgnoreRoute("{resource}.axd/{*pathInfo}"); routes.MapRoute("TestRoute", "{account}/{controller}/{action}/{id}"); routes.MapRoute( "Default", // Route name "{controller}/{action}/{id}", // URL with parameters new { controller = "Home", action = "Index", id = "" } // Parameter defaults ); } Is there anything special I have to do when organising my Views folder or Controller actions?
