Is there a faster way to retrieve a message using zend framework libraries?

Hi guys I'm building a simple mail interface for my application but I've noticed that its really slow especially when the user has to list out a number of emails. I've traced the time taken for code to execute and found that just the $mail->getMessage function takes around 0.6 seconds to execute. My code is as below: $mail = new Zend_Mail_Storage_Imap(array( 'host' => $current_dept->incoming_server, 'ssl' =>($current_dept->imap_ssl == 'Y' ? true : false), // $current_dept('imap_ssl'), 'port'=>$current_dept->incoming_port, 'folder'=>$options->box, 'user' =>$current_dept->email, 'password' =>$current_dept->email_psd)); ..... $one_message = $mail->getMessage($i); // COnsider that this code is running in a loop i.e the fetch message part and for each message an overhead time of 0.5 seconds is too much. Is there another way to do this?
