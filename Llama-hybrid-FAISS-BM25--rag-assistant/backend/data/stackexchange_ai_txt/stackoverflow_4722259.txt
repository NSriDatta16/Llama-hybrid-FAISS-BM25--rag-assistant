I hope you'll find an elegant solution to this problem, but AFAK one instance of browser simply shares one identity. To deal with this situation we use HIDDEN on master page, that is a part of main form. Its value is randomly generated when first page loads. Later, the value is kept between requests. Session values are stored with HashTable key of hidden value. 2 more hacks needed to get it work. Response.Redirect is done with simple form that uses POST method to pass HIDDEN value to the new page. All hrefs clicked with left button also posting HIDDEN value (if user uses 'Open in new TAB/Window' direct redirect without post simply creates new HIDDEN value - new subsession.)
