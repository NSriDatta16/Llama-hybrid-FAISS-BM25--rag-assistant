Pythonic way of checking if a condition holds for any element of a list

I have a list in Python, and I want to check if any elements are negative. Is there a simple function or syntax I can use to apply the "is negative" check to all the elements, and see if any of them is negative? I looked through the documentation and couldn't find anything similar. The best I could come up with was: if (True in [t I find this rather inelegant. Is there a better way to do this in Python? See also How to check if all elements of a list match a condition? for checking the condition for all elements. Keep in mind that "any" and "all" checks are related through De Morgan's law , just as "or" and "and" are related. Existing answers here use the built-in function any to do the iteration. See How do Python's any and all functions work? for an explanation of any and its counterpart, all . If the condition you want to check is "is found in another container", see How to check if one of the following items is in a list? and its counterpart, How to check if all of the following items are in a list? . Using any and all will work, but more efficient solutions are possible.
