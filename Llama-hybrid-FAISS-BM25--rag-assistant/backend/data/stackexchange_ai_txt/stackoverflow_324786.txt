How do you store your personal snippets database in order to use it everywhere (work, etc)?

I've read the several discussions about storing code snippets but I did't find the info that I'm looking for, so let's define it: At home, I have several side projects, most of them quite small, one large, and numerous little examples that demonstrate a specific language feature (for example, some template trick in C++). Since I think that these examples will be useful to be available when I'm at work for a reference instead of trying to remember the exact details of this or that particular snippet that was tried and worked at home, I want to have it available for example on a USB flash drive. The problem is that most of the snippets/small programs/examples are organized, written, compiled and tested in Visual Studio, it will be duplication if I have to put them in some code snippet organizer application. I can copy to the flash drive the source of the Visual Studio solution with all the examples, but it is not so convenient for searching compared with a dedicated snippet repository organizer. Or maybe I can change this if I write better comments and description of the examples, and that will do the job. Any ideas, best practices, solutions, and experience with similar stuff are appreciated.
