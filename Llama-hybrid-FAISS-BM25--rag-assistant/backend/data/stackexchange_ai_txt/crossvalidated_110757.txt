Residual autocorrelation versus lagged dependent variable

When modeling time series one has the possibility to (1) model the correlational structure of the error terms as e.g. an AR(1) process (2) include the lagged dependent variable as an explanatory variable (on the right hand side) I understand that their are sometimes substantial reasons to go for (2). However, what are the methodological reasons to do either (1) or (2) or even both?
