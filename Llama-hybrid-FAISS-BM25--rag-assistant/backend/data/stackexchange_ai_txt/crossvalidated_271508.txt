Test of stationarity Vs. stl in R

I have a weekly time series with approximately 2 years of data. I wanted to check whether my series is stationary or not. To check stationary, I used two test,Augmented Dickey-Fuller test,here is the code I used adf.test(data, alternative = "stationary") I got p value as 0.01 & a warning message is saying that p-value smaller than printed p-value. Secondly I used Priestley Subba Rao Test,here is the code stationarity(data) & I got p-value for T : 0.1717033 . Both of the test are suggesting that my data is stationary. But when I used plot(stl(data_ts,52)) where data_ts to check it visually,I got following chart & it is showing an increasing trend in my data.Which is suggesting a violation of stationarity. I'm completely confused with these contradicting outputs. Can you please guide me?
