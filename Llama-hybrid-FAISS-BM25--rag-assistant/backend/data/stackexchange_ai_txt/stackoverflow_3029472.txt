How do I make the "back button" work with jQuery hide/show functions?

I'm looking for a way to append text to the url with jQuery so that the back button is not broken when a user loads new content with jQuery. For example, I have a three step form - the first step is (www.xyz.com/form-1). When the user clicks next step, jQuery slides in the next page. I would like that page to be (www.xyz.com/form-2). I know websites like hypem.com do this, I'm just looking for an elegant way to handle it.
