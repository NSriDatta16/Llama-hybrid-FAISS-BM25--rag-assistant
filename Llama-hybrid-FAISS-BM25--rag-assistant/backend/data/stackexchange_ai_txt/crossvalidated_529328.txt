How to tackle a problem where dataset has high variance involved

Suppose, If I have twenty confidence scores for twenty different images as defined below object classified as cats, and its average is 58.9%. For first image, the confidence score is 25.9% and for the second image it's 93.3% and for the third image it's 92.8% and so on. So there is a high variance involved in these data. cat [[0.2596674 ]] cat [[0.9336238 ]] cat [[0.9280105 ]] cat [[0.40792587]] cat [[0.29937932]] cat [[0.7761701]] If I have to decide between two different systems for classification, system-I and system-II, based on the average score, I retrieved 58.9% for system-II (Neural Network model), I am deciding to go for system-I (Neural Network model) for classification, and provide my input image to it, but I am deciding based on average which is wrong since high variance is involved, maybe for the first-time system-I will provide 76.5% and on next time it may provide a poor performance 23.1%. How to tackle a problem like this help is highly appreciated. Thanks
