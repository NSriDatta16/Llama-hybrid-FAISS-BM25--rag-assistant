The most likely reason the code worked on your development machine but not on the server is because your development machine probably has the Office/Word Primary Interop Assemblies installed on it but you do not say whether these are installed on the server or not. I am assuming they are not. If your users are on Microsoft Office XP (2002) or Office 2003 AND have the Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack installed, then your best option is to use the Open XML SDK to generate a .docx file on the fly, which your users will be able to open by having the compatibility pack installed. Once your users have opened the document, they can then save it in the normal .doc format. If your user base includes users of Office 2000 or earlier, you are out of luck as there is no compatibility pack for these versions of Office. You will not be able to generate the .doc format on the web server without having the Office assemblies installed and, as others have pointed out, this is strongly discouraged by Microsoft.
