Does overriding OnNcPaint() affect the painting of the client area of a window?

I want to change the appearance of a window's caption bar, so I decided to override the OnNcPaint() method of CMainFrame . But when I did this, I found a problem. If there is another window covering my window, and I drag the window quickly, the content of the client area of my window disappeared, which came to sight only when I stopped the dragging. My overridden OnNcPaint() is like below: void CMainFrame::OnNcPaint() { CDC* pWinDC = GetWindowDC(); //do some drawing ReleaseDC(pWinDC); } Is there something wrong with my approach? Thank you!
