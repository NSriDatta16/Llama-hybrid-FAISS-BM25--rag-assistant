When you are trying to estimate parameters, you always want there to be a closed form solution. However, one does not always exist (I suppose it is possible that in some cases there may be one but it is unknown at present). When a closed form solution does not exist, some heuristic strategy must be employed to search over the parameter space for the best possible parameter estimates to use. There are many such search strategies (e.g. in R , ?optim lists 6 general purpose methods). The IRWLS is a simplified version of the Newton-Raphson algorithm . Unfortunately, the answer to your [ 1 ] is that no heuristic search strategy is guaranteed to find the global minimum (maximum). There are three reasons why that is the case: As noted on slide 9 of your linked presentation, no unique solution may exist. Examples of this might be perfect multicollinearity , or when there are more parameters to be estimated than there are data . As noted on slide 10 (that presentation is quite good, I think), the solution may be infinite. This can happen in logistic regression, for instance, when you have perfect separation . It can also be the case that there is a finite global minimum (maximum), but that the algorithm does not find it. These algorithms (especially IRWLS and N-R) tend to start from a specified location and 'look around' to see if moving in some direction constitutes 'going downhill' (i.e., improving the fit). If so, then it will re-fit at some distance in that direction and repeat until the guessed / predicted improvement is less than some threshold. Thus, there can be two ways to not reach the global minimum: The rate of descent from the current location towards the global minimum (maximum) is too shallow to cross the threshold and the algorithm stops short of the solution. There is a local minimum (maximum) between the current location and the global minimum (maximum), so that it appears to the algorithm that further movement would lead to a worse fit. Regarding your [ 2 ], be aware that different search strategies have different tendencies to be caught in local minima. Even the same strategy can sometimes be adapted, or commenced from a different starting point to address the latter two problems.
