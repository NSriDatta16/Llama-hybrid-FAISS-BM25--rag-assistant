The information is not sufficient. You only know that the mark of the 55-th percentile is 58/100. But you do not know anything about the spread. Below you see the distribution of different normal distributions that have the same 58 score for the 55-th percentile (the score where 45% do better than that), but different scores for the 99-th percentile (the score of the best 1%). The image below shows the cumulative distribution. It gives on the x-axis the score, and on the y-axis the percentage that has this score or lower. Sidenote: even if you knew two points, the an estimate based on the assumption that the distribution is a normal distribution can be very wrong. Normal distributions might be good models for an average, but distributions like scores on a test involve different processes that generate the distribution. E.g. you can have students that studied and students that did not study, splitting the distribution into two groups and making the distribution bimodal.
