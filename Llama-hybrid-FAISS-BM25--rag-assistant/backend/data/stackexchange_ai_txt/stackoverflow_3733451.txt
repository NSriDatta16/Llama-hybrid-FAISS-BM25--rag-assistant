How to display a view when webview is touched continously for 10 sec?

I am displaying a pub or a pdf file in webview. But I am not able to detect the touch on the webview. - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event above method is called when I touch any text of the pdf or pub file. How can I detect the click on the webview which is displaying a pdf or a pub file. This is my code: - (void)viewDidLoad { [super viewDidLoad]; NSURL *url = [NSURL URLWithString:@"http://dblog.com.au"]; NSURLRequest *request = [NSURLRequest requestWithURL:url]; [webView loadRequest:request]; UILongPressGestureRecognizer *longPressGestureRecognizer = [[UILongPressGestureRecognizer alloc] initWithTarget:self action:@selector(handleLongPress:)]; longPressGestureRecognizer.minimumPressDuration = 6.0; [self.webView addGestureRecognizer:longPressGestureRecognizer]; [longPressGestureRecognizer release]; } - (void)handleLongPress:(UIGestureRecognizer *)gestureRecognizer { NSLog(@"Long press detected"); } - (BOOL)gestureRecognizer:(UIGestureRecognizer *)gestureRecognizer shouldRecognizeSimultaneouslyWithGestureRecognizer:(UIGestureRecognizer *)otherGestureRecognizer { return YES; } Please check it, did I make any mistake?
