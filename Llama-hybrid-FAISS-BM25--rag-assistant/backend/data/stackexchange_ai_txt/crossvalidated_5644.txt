I worked on it and thought this Bayesian equation will be useful. Rating TM = SR TM /(1 + AWD/WD TM ) + MSRT/(1 + WD TM /AWD) The variables are: SR = Team member's self rating AWD = Average work done by team WD = Work done by team member MSRT = Mean self rating of team (TM: TeamMember) Please comment if you think this is not right. Thanks!
