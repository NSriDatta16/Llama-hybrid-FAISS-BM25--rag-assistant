How do I determine which item(s) are causing an event?

I have been keeping a daily log of foods and activities and also recording a symptom, say a headache. I'm trying to determine if something I am eating or doing is contributing to the headache. How can I do this? I was going to put all my data into excel and try creating a correlation matrix but I'm not sure if that is the correct approach. Also I don't know how to structure my columns. In the end I don't want to make a prediction like in machine learning where you feed it a new set of foods/activities and it tells you if you will get a headache or not. I just want to know the foods/activities that are causing the headache. It's possible none of the foods/activities I kept track of cause it and I'm lacking some variable in my data like barometric pressure , temperature, stress level, etc, that I did not record. I'd also like to know that too. (i.e. if nothing I recorded cause the symptom)
