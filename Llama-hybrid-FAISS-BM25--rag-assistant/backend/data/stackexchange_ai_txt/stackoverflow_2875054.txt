Making Infragistics UltraWinGrid's Specific Columns Read-only

I am stuck in a situation where I need to disable a few columns in each row, except for the newly added row. That is, I have 10 columns in the grid and the first 3 columns are databound and come from the database as disabled or read-only. The rest are editable. If I add a new row, then all the columns of the new row must be enabled until it is saved. I don't have any DataKey or primary key for my existing row or the new row. I have to check for some boolean value like IsNewRow . In my current scenario I am using this code block: Private Sub dgTimeSheet_InitializeRow(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As Infragistics.Win.UltraWinGrid.InitializeRowEventArgs) Handles dgTimeSheet.InitializeRow ''if either column key is Project, Class or Milestone '' Activation.NoEdit = Disable and Activation.AllowEdit = Enable Dim index As Integer = e.Row.Index If e.Row.IsAddRow Then dgTimeSheet.Rows(index).Cells(PROJECT).Activation = Activation.AllowEdit dgTimeSheet.Rows(index).Cells(SERVICE_ISSUE_CLASS).Activation = Activation.AllowEdit dgTimeSheet.Rows(index).Cells(MILESTONE).Activation = Activation.AllowEdit Else dgTimeSheet.Rows(index).Cells(PROJECT).Activation = Activation.NoEdit dgTimeSheet.Rows(index).Cells(SERVICE_ISSUE_CLASS).Activation = Activation.NoEdit dgTimeSheet.Rows(index).Cells(MILESTONE).Activation = Activation.NoEdit End If CheckRows() End Sub The problem is that if I click on disabled/read-only rows, then newly added rows also get disabled, which I don't want.
