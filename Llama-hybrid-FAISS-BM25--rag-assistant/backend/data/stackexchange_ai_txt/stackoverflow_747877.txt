The critical determinant, imho, is whether the applcation will need to do numerical arithmetic calculations on the values, if not, then the only reason to use integers is to reduce the storage requirements, (which "May" be important for performance in a critical application - by reducing the width of a table index to increase index performance, for example) but otherwise, is generally not important... If there's no need to do arithmetic with the values, then a string is best.
