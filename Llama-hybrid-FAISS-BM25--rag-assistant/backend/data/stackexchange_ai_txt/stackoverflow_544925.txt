1) Yes we do use code coverage 2) Yes it is part of the CI build (why wouldn't it be?) 3) The important part - we don't look for 100% coverage. What we do look for is buggy/complex code, that's easy to find from your unit tests, and the Devs/Leads will know the delicate parts of the system. We make sure the coverage of such code areas is good, and increases with time, not decreases as people hack in more fixes without the requisite tests.
