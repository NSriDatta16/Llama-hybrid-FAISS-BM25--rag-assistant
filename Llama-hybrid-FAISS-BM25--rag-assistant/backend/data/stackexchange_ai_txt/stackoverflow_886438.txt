I think you should read a bit about rails' MVC architecture . It seems to me that you are neglecting the M(odel) part of it. The models should hold the data, thus being the most important part of your application. These are a few interesting thoughts on better organizing your models and controllers ( fat models, skinny controllers is a rule of thumb. Since you said you are using other API's (like lastfm and twitter), you might want to take a look at this railscast about creating non ActiveRecord models (models that are not tied to a database) If you also provide an API for your users, I suggest using a RESTful approach, as it can really be easy to develop and maintain once you get the hang of it. You should read more about resources , as your localhost/lastfm and localhost/twitter are resources and not views. Hope this helps. Good luck
