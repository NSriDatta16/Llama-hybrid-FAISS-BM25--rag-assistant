Reading files from clipboard in Javascript

In chrome, when I paste files into text areas, I end up with the path, e.g /home/antimatter15/sha1.js . The paste event includes a .clipboardData object, with stuff like the standard getData / setData methods. There's also a .files but it's length is always 0 . Is there any way to get the file that's being pasted, possibly with FileReader like how files can be dragged.
