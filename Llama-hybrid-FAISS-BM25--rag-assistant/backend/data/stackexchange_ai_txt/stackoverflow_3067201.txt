Any idea what this code might be useful for - some kind of server-side client charset detection? Apparently so. The Euro sign is useful for charset detection because there are so many ways of encoding it: E2 82 AC in UTF-8 88 in windows-1251 80 in the other windows-125x encodings A4 in ISO-8859-7, -15, and -16 A2 E3 in GB18030 85 40 in Shift-JIS etc. As far as I know, browser charset is being transmitted in HTTP request anyway (an "Accept-Charset" header). It's supposed to transmitted in the HTTP Content-Type header, but that doesn't mean that user agents actually get it right.
