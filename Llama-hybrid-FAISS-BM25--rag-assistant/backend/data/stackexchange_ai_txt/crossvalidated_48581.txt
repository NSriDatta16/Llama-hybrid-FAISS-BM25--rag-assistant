Testing the race model inequality in R

Lets say we have hypothetical participant that is presented with 3 stimuli conditions: a flashing dot ($C_x$), a sound blip ($C_y$) and combination of both ($C_z$). We ask this participant to respond as quickly as possible to the onset of the stimuli and we measure the reaction time (RT). It's been observed that responses are often observed to be substantially faster when both stimuli are presented simultaneously ($C_z$), compared to condition when they are presented separately ($C_x$ and $C_y$), and this effect has been labeled redundant signals effect (e.g. Hershenson, 1962). Different models account for this effect, one of those models being race model (Miller, 1982). Quoting Colonius et al (2006) definition: Raab (1962) was the first to propose a race model for simple RT such that (a) each individual stimulus elicits a detection process performed in parallel to the others and (b) the winner’s time determines the observable RT. This model suggests that RSE is generated by statistical facilitation: If detection latencies are interpreted as (nonnegative) random variables, the time to detect the first of several redundant signals is faster, on average, than the detection time for any single signal. Urlich et al (2007) continues that: According to race models, the observed RT distributions should satisfy, for every value of $t$, the so-called race model inequality (Miller, 1982): $F_z(t) \le F_x(t) + F_y(t), t > 0$ where $F_x$ and $F_y$ are the cumulative density functions (CDFs) of RT in the two single-stimulus conditions $C_x$ and $C_y$, respectively, and $F_z$ is the CDF of RT in the redundant-stimulus condition $C_z$. I wanted to test this model, but I found it hard to translate available Matlab code into R. Matlab code is available in the appendix of this paper by Urlich et al (2007), which can can be downloaded here , in case you don't have access to Behavioural Research Methods journal. To summarize Urlich et al (2007) approach, his algorithm goes through the follwing steps: Step 1: Estimating empirical cumulative density functions (CDFs) for every participant (we got just one in the example here) and every stimulus condition ($C_x$, $C_y$, $C_z$). As Urlich et al (2007) points out: these CDFs will be denoted as the individual CDFs. Specifically, let $G_x$, $G_y$, and $G_z$ be the individual estimates of two single-stimulus CDFs, $F_x$ and $F_y$, and the redundant CDF, $F_z$, respectively. I thought I managed to compute $G_x$, $G_y$, and $G_z$, but I might be wrong: #example reaction times for single hypothetical participants for 3 experimental conditions #this is the same dat set as one used by Urlich et al 2007 cx Step 2: From $G_x$ and $G_y$, one computes the bounding sum $B(t) = G_x(t) + G_y(t)$ (for each participant), which provides an estimate for each participant of the upper bound on the right side of race model equation above. But then, I'm not sure how to compute the race model bounds, which seems trivial, but doesn't really work. The authors simply show the equation as , and I applied it in R as: b = gx + gy but then when I visualize it, it's wrong: xyz Step 3 and 4: Percentile values are computed from $G_z$ and $B$ for each participant at certain prespecified probabilities that must be the same for all participants. Finally, the percentile values are aggregated across participants, which is omitted in Urlich etal (2007) example. I hope my explanation is a bit clearer now then it was before. References Miller, J.
