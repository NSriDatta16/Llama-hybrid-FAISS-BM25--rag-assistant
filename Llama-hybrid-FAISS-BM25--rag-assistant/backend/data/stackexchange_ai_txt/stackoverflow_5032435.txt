New C++11 range-for (foreach) syntax: which compilers support it?

I saw this c++11 code fragment in this BoostCon presentation by Jeremy Siek : deque topo_order; topological_sort(g, front_inserter(topo_order)); for (int v : topo_order){ //line 39 cout Upon trying to compile in gcc there is the following error: main.cpp:39: error: expected initializer before ‘:’ token which then got me wondering, which compilers actually support this syntax?
