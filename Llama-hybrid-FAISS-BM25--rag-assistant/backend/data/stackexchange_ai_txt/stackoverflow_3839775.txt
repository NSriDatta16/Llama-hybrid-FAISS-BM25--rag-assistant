I don't full understand your question. Do you want two have two map widgets which are synchronized? Something like that is displayed in http://apps.geomajas.org/showcase-beta/ (indicate layers, google layer in the left menu - you will see that when you drag/zoom one of the maps, the others follow). If you want one a widget where any operations in that widget change to display of a map, that also sounds pretty easy to do by having a event listener on the one widget which sets the bounds on the map widget. If you want to use Java+GWT, this would be easy using Geomajas.
