Rendering multiple views from multiple controllers on a single page

On the main page of my site, I would like to show several views which rely on their own controllers for data retrieval. I do not want to retrieve anything from the DAL in my Home controller. For example, I want to show view listing top 5 news, a view with random quote from the database, another view with the users shopping cart contents, etc. After Googling around, I found RenderAction method which is almost perfect, but it's not available in RC1, only in Futures, and apparently, it has some issues. I found RenderPartial as well, but that relies on the main controller to pass data to the view. Additional clarification: The main reason I do not want data access logic in the Home controller is to avoid repeating the code and logic. I will use top 5 news view in several pages/controllers. I do not want to repeat data retrieval in every one of them. I already did separate a lot of logic and validation to business layer. The solution I'm after is RenderAction or UserControls as in classic ASP. I know i can use them in MVC as well, but... whats the point? I mean, if what i'm asking is too complicated or too absurd (reusable UI components), then MVC is definitely not for me, and I'd consider it seriously inferior to classic ASP.NET, because this requirement is really simple.
