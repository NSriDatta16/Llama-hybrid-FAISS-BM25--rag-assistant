Why is a parametric classifier faster to train than a non-parametric one?

In the tutorial Parametric and Nonparametric Machine Learning Algorithms it says that parametric classifiers are faster than non-parametric classifiers. The reason that non-parametric classifiers are slower is because they often have far more parameters to train. What else could cause this to be true?
