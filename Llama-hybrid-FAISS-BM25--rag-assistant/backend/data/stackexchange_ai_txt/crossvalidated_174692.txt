Ways to test accuracy of auto.arima in R

I have around 10000 time series showing one particular metric over 5 hours. I used auto.arima function In my previous question, people suggested that I have to use auto.arima for each time series, hold off some of data points and test the prediction with my hold off points. I am holding off 20% of data points (if you see sample out of 40 I will hold off 8) and then let auto.arima predict. Then I can compare generated 8 values with actual 8 values. But is there a formal way to test accuracy in ARIMA model? Is my approach correcT? Is there a prebuilt function to test the accuracy of Arima. Here is the code, I can always use x as my time series. y=auto.arima(x) plot(forecast(y,h=30)) Sample time series 1 0.0003748,0.0003929,0.0003653,0.0003557,0.0004463,0.000349,0.0003099,0.0003395,0.0003157,0.0002871,0.0002604,0.0002422,0.0001917,0.0002117,0.0002689 time series 2 0.0003977,0.0003481,0.0002413,0.0002069,0.0002127,0.0002108,0.0002003,0.0002174,0.0002098,0.0002069,0.0001955,0.0001926,0.0002108,0.0002146,0.0002079 Both have 40 points. I can hold off 20% of them (8) and compare after auto.arima predicts. But is there a simpler way I can test accuracy?
