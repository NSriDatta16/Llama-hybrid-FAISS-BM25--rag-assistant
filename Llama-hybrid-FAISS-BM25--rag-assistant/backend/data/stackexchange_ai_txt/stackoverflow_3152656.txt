The swf format has internally a special format for 32 bit PNGs (those with an alpha channel) where they get split up into a 24bit png and a greyscale alpha mask, whereby the alpha mask gets JPEG compressed. No totally sure if Flex Builder does that kind of optimization since I remember that at least in an older version embedded PNG where not at all optimized. Nevertheless, if you are looking for a tool that can optimize embedded images in swfs you should check out Joa Ebert's "Reducer": http://blog.joa-ebert.com/2009/08/08/reducer/
