I think that Rob Walker has nailed the problem. If the documentation for KeyCapture_Config.lib says no linkage to MFC, check the source for directives that require linkage to MFC. Something like this: #pragma comment(lib, "nafxcwd.lib") would cause a dependency on MFC, and the KeyCapture_Config.lib doc may be out of date.
