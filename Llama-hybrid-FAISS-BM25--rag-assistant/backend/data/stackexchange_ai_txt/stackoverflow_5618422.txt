ClientAbortException, knowing the origin

I keep getting this exception repeatedly on my logs and it's affecting performance: ClientAbortException: java.net.SocketException: Software caused connection abort: socket write error the problem is that this began after a recent update we've done to the application, in which only very minor modifications were made (no one that could be directly linked to the exception). The most reasonable conclusion is that something in the update started this up, but I really cannot find the piece of code, so I was wondering if I could configure tomcat's logfile to print more information about the exception, like the ip address of the client that raised the error, the time when the exception ocurred, etc. Any help please? Thanks in advance.
