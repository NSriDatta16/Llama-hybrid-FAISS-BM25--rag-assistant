this should work as long has your anchor href is to a url, not sure what would happen if it was a javascript method call - guessing would not be good. $("#the-div").live('click', function (e) { var tag = e.target.tagName; if (tag === "A") { window.location.href = e.target.href; return false; } // else do the div click handling }); seems like there is probably a more elegant way to do this, but I have no clue.
