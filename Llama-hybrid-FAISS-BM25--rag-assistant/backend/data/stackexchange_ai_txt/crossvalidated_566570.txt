Unbalanced groups in repeated measures anova

I am analysing metabolomics data (~1,000 measurements) across 30 samples from 10 subjects. The samples are from 2 treatments groups of 5 subjects from whom 3 muscle samples were taken from 3 locations (2 from top and bottom of one muscle (A) and the other from a different muscle B). The initial hypothesis was that the treatment*muscle location effect on metabolite levels. This was to be tested using a repeated measures two-way anova. However, initial analysis shows that the 2 samples from muscle A differ minimally compared to difference between A vs B. So I am worried in an ANOVA using all 3 locations the two samples from muscle A would function as replicates and this may lead to over estimation of significance of location effect. I was wondering if my concerns are correct and whether I should just take average from the samples from A and then go with that.
