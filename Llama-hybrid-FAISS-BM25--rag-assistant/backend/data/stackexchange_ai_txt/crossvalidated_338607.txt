You can do a lot of things. For instance, you could run PCA to see whether all curves move together contemporaneously. You could also run cross correlations or coherence analysis. This will run correlation of two series with different lags, so that you can see that one series might be correlated to another when the latter is lagged in time. The crosscorrelation plot will show what is the lag with highest correlation. You could do nonlinear analysis using Kendal correlation if you suspect that the relationships is nonlinear or prone to outliers.
