Self-Organising Maps and missing data (NAs) in R

The SOM algorithm should be able to deal with some datapoints containing NAs: to find their Best Matching Units, it would be possible to compute Euclidean distances with the neurons ignoring the variables which are Not Available. E.g., if datapoint $i$ is such that $x_k^{(i)}=\mathrm{NA}$, then compute its Euliddean distance with neuron $\mathbf{y}^{(j)}$ through $||\mathbf{x}_{-k}^{(i)}-\mathbf{y}_{-k}^{(j)}||$. In R , I usually employ the kohonen package to derive a SOM, but it doesn't seem to have this functionality. Do you have some advice to deal with NAs when computing a SOM in R?
