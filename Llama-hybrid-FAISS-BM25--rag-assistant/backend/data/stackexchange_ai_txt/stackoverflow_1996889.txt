GWT/Maven/Eclipse - Development Mode: URL not showing in Eclipse (only JavaEE version!)

I followed instructions on how to setup a maven gwt project using the gwt-maven-plugin. It works nicely, and under a 64-bit version of eclipse downloaded for Windows, with Java packages added later via EPP update sites, it works beautifully. However, on my mac, with eclipse downloaded directly from website as a pre-built, JavaEE bundle, the URL never shows in Development Mode (though I can still launch with maven gwt:compile gwt:run) and I get the following warning message in the eclipse console: Loading modules com.dharma.greg.Home Validating tags for module 'com.dharma.greg.Home' [WARN] Module declares a servlet class 'com.dharma.greg.server.ServicesImpl', but the web.xml has no corresponding declaration; please add the following lines to your web.xml: servicesImpl com.dharma.greg.server.ServicesImpl servicesImpl /com.dharma.greg.Home/services
