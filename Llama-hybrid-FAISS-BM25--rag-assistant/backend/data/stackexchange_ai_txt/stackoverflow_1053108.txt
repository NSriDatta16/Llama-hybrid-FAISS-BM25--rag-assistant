I know you want a small compiler, but it is best to just download and install Xcode. It is a great IDE. From there, you don't have to use it if you don't want to . Once it is installed, you can use something like this in terminal: gcc myFile.c -o myFile And that would build a source file called myFile.c which contains C code and the output module (executable) would be myFile . You'd execute it by running: ./myFile Update : What is your reason for not wanting Xcode? Furthermore, is GCC itself ok (disregarding Xcode for a moment)? It's important to know that GCC is not a part of Xcode. Apple made use of GCC , which is an open source C/C++ (and more) compiler. I just can't find binaries of GCC for mac so downloading Xcode is an easy way to get some... Update 2 : It also just came to my attention that NetBeans will compile C / C++ Code. It also uses the GCC compiler . I'm not sure if it using GCC from my Xcode installation but I thought I'd mention this. Best Regards, Frank
