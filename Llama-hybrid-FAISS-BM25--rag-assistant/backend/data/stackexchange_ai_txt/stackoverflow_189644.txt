What are some common things to consider when developing a web-based application to be sold

I'm developing an application for an internal customer. One of the requirements is that it be developed in such a way that it could potentially be sold to other organizations. The application is a tracking application for a fund-raising organization that will manage their donations, donors, participants, and events. I already know that I'll need to develop a plugin architecture for authentication (authorization will be handled internally) and to derive demographic data from an external directory. The application will be built on ASP.NET/C#/Linq/SQL Server. At this point I'm not really open to supporting alternative databases, but I'm thinking I could do this in the future via different Linq drivers, if necessary. All of the web applications that I've built to date have been custom implementations so I'd like to know if there are other things that I need to address via plugins and/or configuration items. Any input would be helpful. Thanks.
