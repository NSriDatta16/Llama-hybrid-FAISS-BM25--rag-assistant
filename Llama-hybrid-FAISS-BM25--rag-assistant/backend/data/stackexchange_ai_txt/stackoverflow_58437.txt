The most elegant solution i found for problems like this is something like this (in pseudocode) separator = "" foreach(item in stringCollection) { concatenatedString += separator + item separator = "," } You just run the loop and only after the second time around the separator is set. So the first time it won't get added. It's not as clean as I'd like it to be so I'd still add comments but it's better than an if statement or adding the first or last item outside the loop.
