Tricky issue with using xslt with badly formed html

I am fairly new to xslt (2.0) and am having some trouble with a tricky issue. Essentially I have a badly formatted html file like below: text 1 text 2 Here is a list ListItem1 ListItem1 dl item dl item2 I was here And I am trying to put it into a nicely formated XML file. In my xslt file I recursively check if all children of a p or div are other p's or div's and just promote them, other wise I use them as stand alone paragraphs. I extended this idea so that if a p or div with a child list show up properly but don't promote the list children. A problem that I am having is that the output xml I get is the following text 1 text 2 Here is a list ListItem1 ListItem1 dl item dl item2 I was here "Here is a list" needs to be in paragraph tags too! I am going crazy trying to solve this ... Any input/links would be greatly appreciated.
