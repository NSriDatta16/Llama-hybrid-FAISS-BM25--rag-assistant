Just to add to the comment above, see this example for how to make your intent unique: http://developer.android.com/resources/samples/StackWidget/src/com/example/android/stackwidget/StackWidgetProvider.html It seems like a really dumb design and an even worse workaround, but I guess that's the way it is. It took me a long time to find the simple example above. Pay particular attention to the intent.setData(Uri) call. I cut and pasted those lines into my onUpdate() method and it finally worked.
