I agree with iDevelop but with 1 extra table. Here is how I would model it. Tables: Artist, Song, Album, AlbumSongMap, SingleInfo If the song was a released as a single on a different date, you can get that from SingleInfo. The single may have been released with some cover art that is different from the album art. You would store the singles art in SingleInfo. MAYBE a song can be released as a single multiple times, with new cover art or something so it could possibly be a 1-many relation. Otherwise it is 1-1. If you can join Song with SingleInfo that means it was released as a single. If you can join Song with Album (using the map) then you will find all the album's it was released under. A digital enhancement to an old song is a new song. (or at least a different binary). You may want to further normalize Song to allow storage of digital enhancements without duplicating songName, etc.
