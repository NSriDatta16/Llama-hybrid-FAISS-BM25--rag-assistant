Which HTML version should be chosen for a public website

I am currently working on a website. After studying HTML5 and its features I want to go ahead with it. I want to use features like offline storage, data- attribs, simple chat support etc. but because HTML5 is not well-supported yet, I am a bit confused. I have always used XHTML 1.0 transitional until now; should I continue using it or should I use HTML5? I have seen the web giants like google have completely shifted to HTML5.
