Pixel Bender is not the right tool for this task, since it does not support loops and thus cannot search through an array of data to return you single values. It can also not pass values over to the next processed chunk, which would be nice since then you could just compare the current chunk with the previously found maximum, like in a bucket chain. Instead I recommend you to have a look at Alchemy and use its fast bytearray opcodes to quickly search through your data. Joa Ebert and Burak Kalayci have both build helper tools that allow you to use these opcodes even without the need to program in C: http://philippe.elsass.me/2010/05/as3-fast-memory-access-without-alchemy/
