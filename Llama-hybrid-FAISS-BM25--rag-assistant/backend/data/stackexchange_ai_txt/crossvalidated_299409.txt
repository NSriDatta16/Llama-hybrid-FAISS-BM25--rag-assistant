How long should I observe a period of no behavior in order to conclude a problem is repaired?

A recurring objectionable event is observed over a period of time. It could be a signal failure in TV reception, for example. We can assume that it is a Poisson process with a time varying wait between events. There is no significant clustering of events in time. For whatever reason, somebody declares the problem solved. How long would you wait before you feel confident the problem has been actually fixed? That is what method do you use to define a "clean period". Obviously the longer the problem has persisted, the longer you'll need before you believe that the new process is now 0. The item may break again, but that will assumed to be a different process. This assumes that the expected lifetime is sufficiently long that we wouldn't see the same problem again for a significant period of time. How would the approach differ if we are looking at behavior change in a human being? For example, a student is missing handing in homework over a K day period. Q percent of days have a missed assignment. An intervention occurs, and M days then pass with no incident. How would you set M to feel confident that some change has occurred? I don't think the traditional 95% confidence tests are what is needed here. I've tried an approach based on Poisson regression, but I think it gives very long wait times compared to practical heuristics. My Question What are some good initial lines of research to understand existing work on the problem? I also tagged this as Bayesian b/c of my belief that Bayesian methods are useful in credibility problems. Note This is closely related to "How long should I wait before I assume a software problem is fixed" but the assumptions are different. In a software problem, the appearance of an error, or class of errors, may be a function of how it is used and tested. In this problem, though, no user intervention is needed to observe the signal if it is still present, except to turn the device on or off.
