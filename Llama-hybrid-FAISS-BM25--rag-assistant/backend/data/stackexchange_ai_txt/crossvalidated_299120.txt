Relationship between logistic regression and Softmax Regression with 2 classes

Suppose we have data matrix $X$ which is $n\times p$ matrix ($n$ data points, and $p$ features including intercept), i.e., we already add the intercept term (append $1$ column) to $X$ For logistic regression (binary classification), the model parameters / regression coefficients $\beta$ is a length $p$ vector. For softmax regression (multi-class classification), the model parameters $W$ is $p \times m$ matrix, where $m$ is the number of classes. Now, suppose we set $m=2$, then $W$ is a $p \times 2$ matrix. They are the same model, so the number of parameters CANNOT be doubled and we should be able to derive one from another. So, my question is What is the relationship between $\beta$ and $W$?
