Literature on discriminatory model VS discriminatory feature

I have a dataset with 200 individuals, 50 features and an outcome variable with 2 levels. The majority of features are not (statistically) significantly different (T-test, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). I want to argue, however, that even though individual features lack differences, when considering all together there might exist a region in the hyperparameter space in which both groups are (clearly) separated. I think this is fair to say and I'm looking at these questions for arguments: Distinguishing between two groups in statistics and machine learning: hypothesis test vs. classification vs. clustering Discriminatory model but no discriminatory features? (especially like the counterexample provided here by user Dave ) To finally cement this, I would love to include an academic reference, paper or book that discusses this or at least takes this into account. Does anything come to mind?
