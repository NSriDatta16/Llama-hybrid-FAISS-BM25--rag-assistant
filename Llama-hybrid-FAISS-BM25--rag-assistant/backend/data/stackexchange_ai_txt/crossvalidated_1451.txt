The list in the presentation that you reference seems fairly arbitrary to me, and the technique that would be used will really depend on the specific problem. You will note however that it also includes Kalman filters , so I suspect that the intended usage is as a filtering technique. Wavelet transforms generally fall under the subject of signal processing , and will often be used as a pre-processing step with very noisy data. An example is the " Multi-scale anomaly detection " paper by Chen and Zhan (see below). The approach would be to run an analysis on the different spectrum rather than on the original noisy series. Wavelets are often compared to a continuous-time fourier transform, although they have the benefit of being localized in both time and frequency. Wavelets can be used both for signal compression and also for smoothing (wavelet shrinkage). Ultimately, it could make sense to apply a further statistical after the wavelet transform has been applied (by looking in at the auto-correlation function for instance). One further aspect of wavelets that could be useful for anomaly detection is the effect of localization: namely, a discontinuity will only influence the wavelet that is near it (unlike a fourier transform). One application of this is to finding locally stationary time series (using an LSW). Guy Nason has a nice book that I would recommend if you want to delve further into the practical statistical application: " Wavelet Methods in Statistics with R ". This is specifically targeting the application of wavelets to statistical analysis, and he provides many real world examples along with all the code (using the wavethresh package ). Nason's book does not address "anomaly detection" specifically, although it does do an admiral job of providing a general overview. Lastly, the wikipedia article does provide many good introductory references, so it is worth going through it in detail. Xiao-yun Chen, Yan-yan Zhan "Multi-scale anomaly detection algorithm based on infrequent pattern of time series" Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics Volume 214 , Issue 1 (April 2008) G.P. Nason " Wavelet Methods in Statistics with R " Springer, 2008 [As a side note: if you are looking for a good modern technique for change point detection, I would suggest trying a HMM before spending too much time with wavelet methods, unless you have good reason to be using wavelets in your particular field. This is based on my personal experience. There are of course many other nonlinear models that could be considered, so it really depends on your specific problem.]
