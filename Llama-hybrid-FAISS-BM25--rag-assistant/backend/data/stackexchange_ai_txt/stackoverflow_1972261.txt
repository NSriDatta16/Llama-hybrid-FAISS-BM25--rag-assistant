First, there is a registered application that has consumer_key and consumer_secret . When users authenticate and "allow" your registered application, you get back: an access_token that is considered the user's "password" and would allow JUST YOUR application to act on the user's behalf. So, getting just the user's access_token from your database won't help much if they don't also have the consumer_key and consumer_secret for complete access. The service provider compares all 4 parameters on request. It would be smart to encrypt these 4 parameters before storage and decrypt them before response. This is just when you need to update or make changes to the user's resource owner on behalf of a user. To keep a user logged-in on your site, use sessions.
