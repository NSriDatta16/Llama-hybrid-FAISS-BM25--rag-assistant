The LATE framework assumes that there is a continuum of types, say $U \sim [0, 1]$, that may all react differently to the treatment. Only a subset of all types reacts to the instrument by changing their treatment status. Under the monotonicity assumption this will always be an interval, say $[a, b]$ with $0 The LATE gives you the average treatment effect averaged over types $[a, b]$, whereas the ATE will give you the average treatment effect averaged over all types $[0, 1]$. The LATE is "local" in the sense that it looks only at the treatment effects in the neighborhood of the types that are affected by the instrument.
