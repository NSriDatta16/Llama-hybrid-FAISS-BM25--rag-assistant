Should I denormalize properties to reduce the number of indexes required by App Engine?

One of my queries can take a lot of different filters and sort orders depending on user input. This generates a huge index.yaml file of 50+ indexes. I'm thinking of denormalizing many of my boolean and multi-choice (string) properties into a single string list property. This way, I will reduce the number of query combinations because most queries will simply add a filter to the string list property, and my index count should decrease dramatically. It will surely increase my storage size, but this isn't really an issue as I won't have that much data. Does this sound like a good idea or are there any other drawbacks with this approach?
