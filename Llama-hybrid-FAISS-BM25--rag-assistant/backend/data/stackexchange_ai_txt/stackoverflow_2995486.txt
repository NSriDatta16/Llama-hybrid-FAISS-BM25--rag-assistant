If your software can make an SSL connection on port 443, then you are 99% of the way there. Typically HTTP proxies are set up to proxy SSL-on-443 (for the purposes of HTTPS). You just need to teach your software to use the HTTP proxy. Check the HTTP RFCs for the full details, but the Cliffs Notes version is: Connect to the HTTP proxy on the proxy port; Send to the proxy: . CONNECT your.real.server:443 HTTP/1.1\r\n Host: your.real.server:443\r\n User-Agent: YourSoftware/1.234\r\n \r\n Then parse the proxy response, which will start with a HTTP status code, followed by HTTP headers, followed by a blank line. You'll then be talking with your destination (if the status code indicated success, anyway), and can start talking SSL. In many corporate environments you'll have to authenticate with the proxy - this is almost always HTTP Basic Authentication, which is pretty easy - again, see the RFCs.
