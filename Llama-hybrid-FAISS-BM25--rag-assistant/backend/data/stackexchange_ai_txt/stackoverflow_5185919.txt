Getting Started with Android Development with Honeycomb

I recently purchased one of the nifty Motorola Xooms and I'd really like to take a shot at developing some applications for it. I work as a .NET developer using C# and it has been about 6 years since I have looked at Java. In my research I haven't really found and good tutorials or learning resources about Android 3.0 and how to leverage its uses in Android development. So my question(s) is this, does any one know of any good resources? books? whatever for learning Android development or would tutorials say involving 2.2 or 2.3 be acceptable?
