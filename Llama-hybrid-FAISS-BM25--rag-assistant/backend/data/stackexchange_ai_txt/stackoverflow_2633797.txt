I wonder if you could use a read-only account to perform a get from TFS2008 and then do a check-in to your TFS2010 with a more-privileged account. I'm sure those two things and a little clever PowerShell scripting could get you what you're looking for. I would encourage you to write a second utility to monitor that this script continues to work and to notify you if it detects a failure or something.
