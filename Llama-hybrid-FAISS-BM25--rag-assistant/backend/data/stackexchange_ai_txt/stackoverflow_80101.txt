iCal Format - storing the event creator

I am currently programming a scheduling application which loosely based on iCalendar standard. Does anyone knows in which property can I store the event creator's information? By browsing through the iCalendar RFC 2445, I find this property: Organizer . can I store the event creator's information in the property even if he/she is the only person involved in the event? or there is already a field to store the event creator's information???!
