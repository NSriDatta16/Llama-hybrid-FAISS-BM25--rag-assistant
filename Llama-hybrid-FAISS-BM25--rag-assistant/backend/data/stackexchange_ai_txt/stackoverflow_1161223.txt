Looping through XML in .NET?

I have some XML that looks something like the one below I need a way to go back through the XML and add the attribute storageTier to each individual Drive node. Is there a way to loop through each drive node and grab the VolumeGroup then get the cooresponding storageTier out of the XML in the VolumeGroup node? I then need to inject the correct storageTier back into the XML drive node. I'm using the System.XML that's in C#. Thanks Any help would be greatly appreciated
