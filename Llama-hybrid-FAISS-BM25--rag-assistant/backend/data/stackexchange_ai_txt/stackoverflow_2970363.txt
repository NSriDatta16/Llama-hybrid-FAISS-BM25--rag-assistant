Reading binary data into memory structures, weird effects

I've been at this for a while now and it really puzzles me. This is a very distilled code fragment that reproduces the problem: uint8_t dataz[] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 }; struct mystruct { uint8_t dummy1[1]; uint16_t very_important_data; uint8_t dummy2[3]; } *mystruct = (void *) dataz; printf("%x\n", mystruct -> very_important_data); What do you expect should be the output ? I'd say x302, but nope. It gives me x403. The same as if using this structure: struct mystruct { uint8_t dummy1[2]; uint16_t very_important_data; uint8_t dummy2[2]; } *mystruct = (void *) dataz; How would you explain that?
