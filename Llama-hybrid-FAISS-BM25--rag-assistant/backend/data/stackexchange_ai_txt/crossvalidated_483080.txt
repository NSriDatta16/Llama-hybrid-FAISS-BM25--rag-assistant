Correlation with high weight to single features

I am a statistics newbie, so not sure how to appropriately frame this question or if it is too naive. Essentially, I have a matrix of 500 items and each item has 8 numerical properties associated with it. I want to calculate all-vs-all pairwise similarities between these items such that even if one of the properties is significantly different for Item A vs Item B, then their pairwise similarity should be substantially reduced, regardless of how close the other properties are. I know that traditional correlation metrics like Pearsons and Spearman won't be able to do that, and as far as I understand unsupervised clustering methods like PCA/Hierarchical clustering using all 8 properties also will not downgrade a single metric. So what would be the appropriate way to go about doing this?
