Is it possible to use GIT for UUID like identifiers?

I need to create unique "immutable" ids for code fragments in my repository - that cover all the revisions of a given object / chunk of code. The aim is that if someone sends in a code fragment I can quickly map it to the object using the sha1 of the code (if it or a previous revision of it is in the senders repository). From there I can use this unique id to extract metadata about the code chunk. The sha1's in git seem a starting point to construct a UUID (Version 5), and it is possible to search a git repository starting with the sha1 and then traverse the tree to find the original sha1 of file when it was first commited. Does it make sense to use this number for a unique identifier for the code chunk in all it's revisions?
