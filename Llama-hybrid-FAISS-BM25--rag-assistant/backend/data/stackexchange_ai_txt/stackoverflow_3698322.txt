Your layout seems sufficient for an application that is expecting moderate number of users and images. That said, the solution may prove insufficient once the following factors come into play: The number of user-image combinations grows large. Your users are spread across the globe. You need to version the images. You find that a lot of bandwidth is being spent on hosting the images. In such a case you might want to look at storing and serving these images outside using something simple as Amazon S3 or using a full fledged content delivery network (CDN). I believe there are several plug ins available to support S3 storage with minimal fuss. S3Storage is one such (caveat: I have used S3 but not S3Storage). Hope this helps.
