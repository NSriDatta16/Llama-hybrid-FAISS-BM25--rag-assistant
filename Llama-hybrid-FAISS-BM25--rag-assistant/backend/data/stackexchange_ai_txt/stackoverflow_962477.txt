How to disable [marquee] tag with CSS? Is this possible?

I have inherited an app where users can insert their own HTML responses. I can only set a global CSS file and a global JS file for this app. Recently, some of the users have awakened an ancient evil, known as the and tags. I can't strip the tags out on input or output, could I at least disarm them with a CSS rule? blink { text-decoration: none; } The above gets rid of the blinking effect, is there a similar way to disable the marquee effect with CSS? If worst comes to worst, I could use marquee { display:none } , but sometimes the users put useful information in that tag; I don't have enough leverage there to argue "if it's marquee, it's unimportant by definition" (which has been a good enough approximation elsewhere). Or am I trying to solve a non-technical problem by technical means, and should I educate the (internal) users on the Evils That Shall Not Be Invoked? As it turns out, there is no CSS-only, cross-browser solution; I'll have to go the harder, JS way - probably replace marquee with span.
