Detect iPad Safari or Zoom

If I use the following to detect iPad Safari user, will it work if in future, I try to detect a Motorola Xoom or other tablet user, which might have similar widths. I mean how exactly will I identify the other tablet and use xoom.css or othertablet.css I know the user-agent approach, but would want to avoid that. Please let me know if it is possible to implement using media queries only?
