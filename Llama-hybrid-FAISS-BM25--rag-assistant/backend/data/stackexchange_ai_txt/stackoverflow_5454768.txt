UID can be read via PC/SC 2.01 compliant function call against winscard.dll . For iCLASS cards it is typically 8 bytes long. Other cards return a 4 to 8 byte UID (it acts like a telephone number to identify multiple cards in the field and ultimately select one). The APDU can be exchanged via standard SCardTransmit() with CLA=0xFF to indicate access to the contactless storage card. Marc http://www.smartcard-api.com NOTE: The UID does NOT reflect the card number printed on the card. The card number is part of the Wiegand data stored in the HID PAC application of application 1 on page 0 of that card.
