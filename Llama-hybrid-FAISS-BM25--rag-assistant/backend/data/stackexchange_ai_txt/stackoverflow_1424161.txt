Rails app stuck

I am running a rails app on Dreamhost. Today, a strange thing happened. A page is almost loaded (it seems to be fully loaded but the status is not 'Done') and after that, the app didn't respond on any page. I checked out the log and even the log was not complete. How do I know it? There are 3 missing images on the problem page and the log showed only 2 missing images and stopped there. So I guess that something happened between the 2nd and the 3rd missing images. I couldn't even start 'script/console production'. After 14 minutes, it began to behave normally. I asked the hosting company and they said that the process was killed due to over-use of memory. Probably something was running heavily during the period. The same thing happened one more time. I had to kill the process to unlock the stucked app. Passenger version is 2.2.4 and rails version is 2.3.2. I am afraid that I can't give more specific info. What do you guess cause such a problem? Thanks. Sam
