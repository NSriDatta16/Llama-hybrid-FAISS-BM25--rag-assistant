Since the type of beginner is not specified in the question, here is my advice for beginning statisticians: Andrew B. Lawson and Emmanuel Lesaffre (2012): Bayesian Biostatistics This book was used in the first year of our statistical science master and I found it relatively easy to understand for such a difficult subject. As with the majority of 'biostatistics' books, the examples are mainly clinical biology, but the methods are not restricted to those useful in clinical science. We had had about half a year of statistical education prior to this and besides Bayes theorem, Bayesian statistics hadn't been introduced yet. What's also nice is that the entire 649 slides of accompanying presentations are available online .
