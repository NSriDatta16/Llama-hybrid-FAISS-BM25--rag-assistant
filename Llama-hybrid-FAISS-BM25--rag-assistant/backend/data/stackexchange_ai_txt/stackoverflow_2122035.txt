is it possible to set up drag/drop tabview tabs in qooxdoo?

I would like to allow re-ordering of tabs in a tabview, preferrably using drag and drop of the tab buttons. The example drag/drop code for lists, modified for tabs simply doesn't work (the dragstart event is never fired). Is this even possible?
