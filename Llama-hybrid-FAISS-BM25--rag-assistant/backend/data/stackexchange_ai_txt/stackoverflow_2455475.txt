NSDecimal multiplication

I have a core data-based app that stores several properties in the decimal and float data types. I'm writing some transient properties / virtual accessors that run calculations and return some derived numbers, but I can't seem to get NSDecimalNumber multiplication to work. Why does this not work: - (NSDecimalNumber *)discountedPrice { return ([self.orderCost decimalNumberByMultiplyingBy:self.discountPercentage]); } // Error: Incompatible Objective-C types 'struct NSNumber *', expected 'struct NSDecimalNumber *' when passing argument 1 of 'decimalNumberByMultiplyingBy:' from distinct ... When this does: - (NSDecimalNumber *)orderCost { return ([self.orderCost decimalNumberByAdding:self.taxes]); } I assume that my object gets an NSNumber from core data regardless of the storage type specified in the data model, so why does this puke and how can I make it work? Am I completely misunderstanding this here? Thanks a bunch!
