You can do two logistic regressions. The first is a standard logistic regression with the two-option outcome as the response and the demographics as the predictors. This would allow you to answer the broader question of what kind of people prefer to save formally or informally. The second logistic regression would be a multinomial logistic regression with all the possibilities as the response and the demographics as the predictors. From this model, you could compare how different demographics predict choosing one option versus another or make predictions about how certain combinations of demographics choose to save.
