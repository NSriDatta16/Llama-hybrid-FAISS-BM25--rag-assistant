Your algorithm might suffer from variance problem due to very low bias. I recommend you to act with regularization. And By this I mean using L1 regularization and adjusting other tuning parameters, especially the tree depth. There are actually some approaches belonging to explainable machine learning like the one you used( changing a bit a feature). Try the LIME approach.
