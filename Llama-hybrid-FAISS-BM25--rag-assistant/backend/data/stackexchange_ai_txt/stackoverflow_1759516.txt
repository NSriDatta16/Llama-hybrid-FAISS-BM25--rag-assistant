I'm not sure on how your data is structured, so I'll assume a list of dicts for duck typing purposes. I'm also assuming the real primary key of your dataset is Start. for i in range(len(dataset)-1): #Detect duplicates, assuming they are sorted properly if dataset[i]["Start"] == dataset[i+1]["Start"]: #Merge 'em dataset[i+1] = merge(dataset[i], dataset[i+1]) #Deleting items from the array you are iterating over is a bad idea dataset[i] = None dataset = [item for item in dataset if item != None] #so just delete them later ...where merge would be the function that actually does the merging. Not elegant, C-ish, but probably better than what you are currently using. They're not sorted? dataset.sort( (lambda x,y: return cmp(x["Start"],y["Start"])) ) Now they should be.
