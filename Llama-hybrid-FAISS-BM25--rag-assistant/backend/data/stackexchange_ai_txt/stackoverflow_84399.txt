Your users have lots of needs that aren't taken care of. They are suffering. They need attention, and they need you . I think feature creep is something that happens when you don't implement the right features already. Cultivate a close relationship with your users. Let them know you are always interested in their input. Periodically give them a call and ask how your software is treating them. Get to know their work habits, standard practices, how they use your software, and how they use their other software. As that information comes in, collect it. When feature requests come in, your users won't really know what they want. You know what they want, though, because you have expertise and you've been listening. So, work with them to clarify the problem they're having, then use your collected knowledge to generalize the problem as best you can. Write a solution that solves that problem. On the other hand, "feature creep" is often the response of a software product to an evolving business. If your customer's business is growing, you're fortunate, because they will spend more money on your work. So relax, they'll pay you! They just need to understand that, the bigger a system gets, the harder it is to change, and sometimes a new small feature necessitates a big rewrite, or a whole new user interface, in order to keep everything working smoothly.
