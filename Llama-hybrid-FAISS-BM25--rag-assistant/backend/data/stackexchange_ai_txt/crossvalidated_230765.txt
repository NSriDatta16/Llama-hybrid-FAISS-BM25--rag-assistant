Regression with zero inflated continuous response variable using gradient boosting trees and random forest

I have a data set with a lot of 0 values for the continuous response variable (about 50%). I want to understand how well gradient boosting/random forest deals with this problem. My colleague suggested doing a two part model with classification as the first step to predict the 0's and second step doing regression. Is this necessary? p.s. I'm using xgboost in R.
