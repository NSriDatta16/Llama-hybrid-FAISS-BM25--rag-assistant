Regression with dependent observations

Suppose I have the following dataframe: id time sale_yn number journey_nr "nVariables with observation specific variables" abc 10 0 1 1 abc 11 0 2 1 abc 12 1 3 1 abc 13 0 1 2 def 10 0 1 3 def 15 1 2 3 def 16 0 1 4 def 17 0 2 4 def 18 1 3 4 Every row is an observation from a particular person (distinguished by ID). Every person visits a shop a number of times (see number). After some while it is possible that a customer makes a purchase (in that case sale_yn == 1). The regression model needs to take into account the different journeys a customer has made in order to predict whether a sale happens or not. With logistic regression, each observation should be independent of eachother, but the visits that occurred earlier, also contribute to the purchase. What form of regression can take this into account?
