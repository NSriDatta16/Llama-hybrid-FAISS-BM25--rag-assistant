priors for Gamma shape and scale parameters

I have a random variable $X$ that is Gamma distributed with unknown parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$: $$ X\sim \text{Gamma}(\alpha, \beta) $$ I now want to estimate $\alpha$ and $\beta$ from samples $x_i$ in a Bayesian setting using STAN. What is the recommended (weakly informative) prior distribution for these parameters? In STAN $\alpha$=shape and $\beta$=inverse scale. I read that the half-Cauchy distribution should be used for scale parameters, so is shape ~ cauchy(0,2.5); scale ~ cauchy(0,2.5); the recommended prior for both?
