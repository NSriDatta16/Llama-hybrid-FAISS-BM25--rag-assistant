Something like StrTok() or Sscanf()?

So, I am reading from ModBos over serial port and get readings something like the following : '+0020.8+0022.8-00.046-00.002-00.005-001.99+00.000+00.003'; Basically, there will always be 8 floating point readings, preceded by a plus or minus sign, although they may be of varying character length. What's the most efficient way to get the values an array of float (or array of string or TSringList)? I am not certain, but this might be time critical, so efficiency probably has way over elegance.
