Should probably use a TableLayout, it'll be the easiest method. TableLayout only does columns, the TableRow elements are what do columns, so the difference in columns between rows won't matter. You don't have to use TableRow elements in it though, any subclass of View can go in, so you can easily use a LinearLayout set to flow vertically for the top row. And unless you're going to do some sort of dragging to move to screen, you'll want to place it all within a scrolling layout too, but you've plenty of them to choose from depending on exactly how the table could turn out.
