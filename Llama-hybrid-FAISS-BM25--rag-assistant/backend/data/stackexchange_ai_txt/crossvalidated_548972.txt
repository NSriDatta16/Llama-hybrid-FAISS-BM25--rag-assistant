How are Bayesian Priors Decided in Real Life?

I always had the following question: How are Bayesian Priors decided in real life? I created the following scenario to pose my question: Suppose you are researcher and you are interested in studying if the age of a giraffe can be predicted by the weight and height of a giraffe (e.g. linear regression model : age = b_o + b_1 height + b_2 weight). You arrive at a national park to record measurements on giraffes - but after only taking measurements on a few giraffes, a terrible storm happens and you have to stop your study. You only had time to measure 15 giraffes: weight height age 1 2998.958 15.26611 53 2 3002.208 18.08711 52 3 3008.171 16.70896 49 4 3002.374 17.37032 55 5 3000.658 18.04860 50 6 3002.688 17.24797 45 7 3004.923 16.45360 47 8 2987.264 16.71712 47 9 3011.332 17.76626 50 10 2983.783 18.10337 42 11 3007.167 18.18355 50 12 3007.049 18.11375 53 13 3002.656 15.49990 42 14 2986.710 16.73089 47 15 2998.286 17.12075 52 Unfortunately, this is not enough information to complete your study. However, you do some research and find these kinds of measurements have been taking on giraffes in the past. For example: Study 1 : A study was done in the 1800's which measured 1000 giraffes and found that that average height of those giraffes was 17ft, the average weight was 2800 lbs and the average age was 35. However this was done in the 1800's and you are doubtful that measurement might not have been as accurate back then, and issues in the environment (e.g. poaching) might have causes giraffes to change in size. Study 2 : A study was done in 2010 were 50 giraffes in zoos across the world and their height was 16ft, weight was 300 lbs and age was 50 years. This study is more recent, but you are skeptical that giraffes in zoos might be different from giraffes in the wild. Study 3 : An expert on giraffe strongly believes that the age, height and weight of giraffes have bell shaped distributions. The expert also believes that giraffes keep growing their whole life, i.e. as age increases, so does weight and height. He does not have any concrete numbers, but he is considered the leading expert. etc. Question: In this problem, is it possible to complement the limited measurements you have, along with the prior knowledge available on giraffes (while taking into consideration their reliability)? Is this problem an example of how Bayesian Models (e.g. Bayesian Regression) can be used in real life - or does this problem fundamentally lack enough data to work with? Suppose you consult several studies where the heights were recorded and manually assess the credibility of these studies (assigning "low weights" to studies deemed not credible, e.g. adjusted_height = credibility_score * average_recorded_height_in_study ): head(my_data) average_recorded_height_in_study credibility_score study_number adjusted_height 1 13.74253 1.0000000 1 13.742525 2 20.08053 0.3222523 2 6.470999 3 13.25037 0.5132335 3 6.800532 4 15.74946 0.2625349 4 4.134783 5 11.68657 0.5966327 5 6.972592 6 17.27276 1.0000000 6 17.272759 There are many tools/packages (e.g. using the R programming language) which can attempt to explore this "prior information" and fit distribtuion library(fitdistrplus) library(patchwork) library(ggplot2) fg $adjusted_height, "gamma") fln adjusted_height, "lnorm") fg $adjusted_height, "gamma") fw adjusted_height, "weibull") par(mfrow = c(2, 2)) plot.legend The above analysis could be repeated for the other variables in the study. Here, we could see which distribution fit the data the best (e.g. using the - likelihood), and record the parameter estimates for this distribution. Is this the right idea behind how priors are incorporated into Bayesian Models in the real world? In this example that I have created, can the information from previous studies be analyzed and used to create priors for a Bayesian Linear Regression? Thanks Note: Suppose the 15 giraffes you measured happened to be diseased giraffes and their height/weight measurements are not representative of the general population of giraffes - but perhaps the information encoded within the priors represent a wide range of giraffes. Thus, combining your measurements with the prior information could result in a more realistic model that could generalize to a larger population of giraffes (this fact being unknown to you at this time).
