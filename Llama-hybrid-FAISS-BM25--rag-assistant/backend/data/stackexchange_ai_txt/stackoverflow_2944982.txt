After doing a bit of digging in the Flex source, it seems like they use the SandboxMouseEvent.MOUSE_UP_SOMEWHERE event. Some limited testing suggests that this is one way of correctly detecting mouse-ups outside of Flash (albeit using Flex): var sbroot:DisplayObject = Application.application.systemManager.getSandboxRoot(); sbroot.addEventListener(SandboxMouseEvent.MOUSE_UP_SOMEWHERE, handleDragComplete);
