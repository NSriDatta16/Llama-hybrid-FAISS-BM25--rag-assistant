How can I detect which listbox item another item was dropped onto?

I have two listboxes. The listbox1 contains a list of the DB names. Listbox2, on the other hand, has a list the titles of the content associated by the DB on listbox1. Basically you click on listbox1 and it loads into listbox2 all the titles for the content of the DB. I want to implement now a drag and drop feature. I know how to drag between two listboxes; that's not the problem. What I am trying to implement is the following: click on a title in listbox2 drag item INTO an item in lisbox1 the title is now part of the DB pointed by the item in listbox1 Now, all the backend code to move the actual data is already in coded. How can I make the listbox1 select (and know) the item where the mouse is about to drop the item from the listbox2? By implementing a simple drag and drop between the two listboxes will result on the item from listbox2 being added into listbox1 since I cannot select an item in listbox1 while i am dragging something. I hope I explained this the right way. Code is appreciated.
