In difference-in-difference setting, why do I have coefficient for (treatment==0)*(post==1) when running regression

Background information: The investigation is under event study framework. The topic is on how the conversion to academies affects students' KS4 performance. The dataset is at school-level. Conversion before 2009 would be in the treatment group while schools converted after 2009 would be in the control group. I have school-level students' performance from year 2002 to year 2009. From year 2006 to year 2009 every year there were conversion taking place. Therefore, in my dataset, there are two groups: the control group contains schools didn't convert to academies up to the year 2009; the treatment group is those converted to academies before (including year 2009) , but the conversion took place in different years. Variable explanation: year is the year when the data is observed schstdks4_cappedpts is the average KT4 performance of a school earlyconverters =1 for those converted to academies up to 2009; =0 otherwise Suppose year=c is the year when the conversion took place; afterconversion =1 if the $year\geqslant c$ Problem: I was hoping to get DID coefficient by regress schstdks4_cappedpts i.year earlyconverters#afterconversion, r What I found puzzling is: Linear regression Number of obs = 816 F(9, 806) = 7.81 Prob > F = 0.0000 R-squared = 0.0679 Root MSE = .39251 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | Robust schstdks4_cappedpts | Coef.

If the model set up is correct, (earlyconverters==1#afterconversion==0) is supposed to measure?
