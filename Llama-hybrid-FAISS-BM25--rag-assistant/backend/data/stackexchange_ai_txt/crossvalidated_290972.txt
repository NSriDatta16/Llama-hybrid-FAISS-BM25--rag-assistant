You can use H2O for time series, and you would normally do some data engineering to create time-based features. In my book (Practical Machine Learning with H2O) one of the three main data sets is prediction of football match results, so that shows some of the techniques. I normally do things like arima and adf.test in R, and use the outputs as features I load into H2O. Though that is not ideal if your data set is one that won't fit in memory (one of the key advantages of H2O over R). There are two feature requests, which you could comment on or vote for: https://0xdata.atlassian.net/browse/PUBDEV-2590 and https://0xdata.atlassian.net/browse/PUBDEV-4153 , but it appears no-one is working on them yet. LSTMs should be available from H2O using DeepWater (i.e. using TensorFlow or MxNet as a back-end). I'm still hunting for a tutorial specifically on this, myself.
