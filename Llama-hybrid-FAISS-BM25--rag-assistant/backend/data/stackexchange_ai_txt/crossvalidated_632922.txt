As explained by @Richard Hardy above. The time series, $x_t$ is first decomposed into the conditional mean process $\mu{_t}$ and residual/error part $u_t$ . The conditional mean process can be modelled by zero, constant or ARMA. The residual $u_t$ by GARCH. Actually, you can start by assuming a constant or a zero conditional mean process (instead of ARMA) if you are using financial returns time series. Then subtract the fitted conditional mean process, $\mu_t$ from the original series, $x_t$ . Then square this residual term and plot it to get a sense of the variance (squared volatility) in the series. Let's call this series $u_t{^2}$ . The GARCH model is trying to model this new series. The ACF/PACF of $u_t{^2}$ will help to choose the order of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ Note the stochastic nature of the conditional variance term, $\sigma_t$ due to the random variable, $\epsilon{_t}$ term.
