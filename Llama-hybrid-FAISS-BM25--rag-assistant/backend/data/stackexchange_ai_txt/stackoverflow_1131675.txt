jQuery UI Draggables - Change Revert Position?

Is it possible to edit the revert position of a jQuery UI draggables helper? For example, I have icons the user can click and drag into groups on the page. When the user clicks an icon and starts dragging, a helper message appears right under their cursor and follows the cursor so long as they continue to hold the click. If the helper is dropped into a group, it disappears. If the helper is not dropped into a group, it returns to it's original position using revert: 'invalid'. My question is, can I edit that original position of the helper? It appears to always revert back to the absolute position of left: 0 and top: 0 but I can't figure out how to edit these values. I need to edit the return position to be about 300px more to the left.
