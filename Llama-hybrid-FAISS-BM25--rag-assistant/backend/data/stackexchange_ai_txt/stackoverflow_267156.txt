Coming at it from an oblique angle, I'd ask if the user needs to have all the columns "loaded" at one time? If the users would be happy to have a subset of columns displayed at once (say, 100 at a time, or specfic sets at a time), then I'd use a some kind of data grid (the built in one, or a ListView, or maybe a third party one) to display the subset, with a CheckedListView docked to the side, allowing the subset of interest to be displayed. Alternatively, could you display some kind of summary data showing the count/average/xxx for groups of 100 columns?
