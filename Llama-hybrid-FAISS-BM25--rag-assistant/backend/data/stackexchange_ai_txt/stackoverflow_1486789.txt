My advice = take a look at the manual for Adrian Thurstons Ragel . There are simple, ways to generate a DFA directly, but I believe they only support a limited range of operators - basically the EBNF usual suspects. Ragel uses non-deterministic methods to compose complex automata from simpler ones, then uses epsilon elimination and minimisation to create efficient deterministic automata. No matter how many wierd operators you need, the conversion to a minimal deterministic automata is always the same, and each operator implementation is kept simple by using nondeterministic methods.
