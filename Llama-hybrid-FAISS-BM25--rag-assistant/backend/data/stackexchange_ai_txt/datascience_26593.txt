SVM is not fitted when tried to fit it into a model

I was trying to apply SVM into a dataset to find its accuracy. I also applied bagging and boosting on the same dataset and they worked properly. But when I tried to fit SVM into a model its not working. I couldn't understand whats the problem. I'm providing the sample of my dataset train_new.head() # define X and y feature_cols = ['age','workclass','fnlwgt','education','education-num','marital-status','occupation','relationship','race','sex','capital-gain','capital-loss','hours-per-week','native-country'] # X is a matrix, hence we use [] to access the features we want in feature_cols X = train_new[feature_cols] # y is a vector, hence we use dot to access 'label' y = train_new['label'] from sklearn import svm model = svm.SVC(kernel='linear', C=1, gamma=1) and while trying to fit with model it's almost minutes passed and it's just look like, What's the actual problem and could I solve it ?
