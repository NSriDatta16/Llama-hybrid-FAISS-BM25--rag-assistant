If you have a local repo (with its working directory), you shouldn't need to ' git init ' anything. git remote add origin blah@blah git pull should be enough. If you have made a git init , that should be in an empty repository, where you then imported the master content of ' origin '. I didn't have a local repo, just the local files. Then you need to add them first (see r-mercado 's answer ). From the git pull man page : Warning: Running git pull (actually, the underlying git merge ) with uncommitted changes is discouraged: while possible, it leaves you in a state that is hard to back out of in the case of a conflict.
