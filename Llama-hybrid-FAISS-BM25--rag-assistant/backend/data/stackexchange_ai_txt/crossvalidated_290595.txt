How to use features for training neural network?

I downloaded a dataset for intrusion detection. It's from the honeypot systems of Kyoto University (2013 dataset). I'll be using the dataset for training a neural network. My problem is how to process the dataset. Am I going to use vector space model or what? A sample from the dataset: 0.000000,other,0,0,0,0.00,0.00,0.00,1,37,1.00,0.00,0.00,RSTOS0,0,0,0,1,fd75:41fb:cf76:971a:0b40:03a2:4ab7:0f81,38581,fd75:41fb:cf76:dc4c:7d2c:2705:07b2:0f45,25,00:00:00,tcp The specifications of the features are as follows ( further details ): Duration Service Source bytes Destination bytes Count Same_srv_rate Serror_rate Srv_serror_rate Dst_host_count Dst_host_srv_count Dst_host_same_src_port_rate Dst_host_serror_rate Dst_host_srv_serror_rate Flag IDS_detection Malware_detection Ashula_detection Label Source_IP_Address Source_Port_Number Destination_IP_Address Destination_Port_Number Start_Time Duration
