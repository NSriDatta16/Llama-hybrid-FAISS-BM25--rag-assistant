How to calculate the loading matrix from the score matrix and a data matrix X (PCA)?

When doing the Principal Component Analysis, how can I calculate the loading( $V$ ) from the score( $U$ ) and a data matrix( $X$ )? Is it correct to say that the relationship between $X$ , $U$ and $V$ is $X=UV^T$ ? If so, how can I derive this relationship? Thanks,
