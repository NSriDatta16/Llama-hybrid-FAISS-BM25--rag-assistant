I would strongly discourage storing the images in source control, especially if they are going to change frequently. Additionally, adding each of these images to your project/solution is probably going to kill performance in VS. I think the idea of pulling in a dummy image for devs is good. As part of your deployment process, you could add something to your build script that will copy the images to the correct location.
