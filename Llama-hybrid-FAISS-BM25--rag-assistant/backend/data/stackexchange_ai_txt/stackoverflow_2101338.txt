You need to download the Objective-C Google API source code from http://code.google.com/p/gdata-objectivec-client/ and compile it from the included xCode project. The included documentation explains in detail how to either link statically, include framework or reference the Google API code directly from your project. I choose to include all the source code I need directly in my project by reference to the original Google files. Include the source files by dragging them into you xCode project. I wouldn't recommend the Google API's for learning to program the iPhone. It would be complicating the learning process unnecessarily.
