print a modal window not the rest of the page

I have seen some answers to this but I think I am actually having a CSS issue. Here is a sample fragment of my HTML: children children If I pop open the modal there is a print button. When I click it I use jQuery to apply a .noprint to #container and .print to #modal . But the .print to modal is disregarded, no matter what selector I apply I can't get the modal content to appear. What's worse, I cant use firebug, it is not showing me what print styles are being applied. I have tried #container #modal.print {display: block; } etc... thanks!
