You essentially are describing a binary output (two levels). Neural networks can do that, and other types of outputs. Neural networks accept either categorical (including binary) or continuous inputs. These different types of inputs and outputs can be mixed. You can do manual encoding, however the implementations of neural networks I'm familiar with do the encoding automatically. There are many implementations of neural networks from different vendors and open sources. The encoding method won't increase accuracy, however a different encoding may address a different question, or it may give the same result depending on the specifics. Manual encoding can be done incorrectly, so be sure you know what you are doing, and how the model works.
