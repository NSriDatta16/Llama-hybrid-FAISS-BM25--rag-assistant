Comparing Coefficients of Two Time Series Models

I am estimating a time series model. For simplicity, let it be: $y_t=\beta_0+\beta_1y_{t-1}+\epsilon_t$ . I estimate this model for a whole panel of $n$ sections, i.e. I end up with a tuple of coefficients $\beta_{1,1},...,\beta_{1,n}$ . I also have a slightly adjusted version of the same panel. The adjustment is not of statistical nature. I am dealing with accouning data and the adjusted version is simply some accounting adjustment that is being introduced. More specifically, the adjustments occur at specific points in time, i.e. not every quantity of a time series is adjusted. I again estimate a time series model: $p_t=\gamma_0+\gamma_1p_{t-1}+\omega_t$ , where $p$ denotes the adjusted $y$ and $k$ denotes the adjusted $x$ . I thus get a tuple of coefficients $\gamma_{1,1},...,\gamma_{1,n}$ . I now want to test wether the independent variable has a significantly larger effect on the dependent variable in the adjusted panel than in the unadjusted panel, i.e. I want to compare the persistence (coefficient of an AR1 model) of the two panels. How do I do this? That is, how do I determine which coefficient of the two models applied to different sets of data is of significantly higher value. Specifically, two issues have to be considered: (1) I dont have two values which I want to compare. I have two tuples of values. I was thinking about a decision threshhold. For example, if more than half of the $\beta_{1,1},...,\beta_{1,n}$ are higher than their adjusted counterpart $\gamma_{1,1},...,\gamma_{1,n}$ , the effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable seems to be higher in the unadjusted dataset. Is this reasonable? (2) I need to test wether the the proposed difference between the coefficients is significant. How do I test wether the regression coefficients from two models applied to different data are significantly different? Is the Chow-Test appropriate here? How do I tackle these issues at once?
