How to deal with TcxCustomGrid-TcxCustomGrid Drag and Drop when I drag an object to the outside of the window?

I have a TcxGridDBTableView in a window, and dragmode is set to dmAutomatic. When I drag and drop a row above another, it works fine. But when i drag and drop a row to the outside of the window, I'm not getting to the TcxGridDBTableView's 'OnEndDrag' event. Ex.: procedure TfrmMyForm.cxGridDBTableViewEndDrag(Sender, Target: TObject; X, Y: Integer); begin ShowMessage('ClassName: ' + Sender.ClassName ); end; I'm debuggin it, and i have a breakpoint at the showmessage line, but when i drop a row outside of the window, the program dont stop at the line. I'm using the express quantum grid to implement that.
