What is the best way to handle updates to an ecommerce website?

I have an e-commerce website (Magento) I will be publishing soon. My current setup consists of a development, staging, and production site each with their own database. Pushing from development to staging is easy but what about from staging to live where there's constantly new customers and orders being created? Do I go the Apple route and post a "Inventory being updated" message. Any insights? Thanks Update: I guess I wasn't clear enough on my actual question. For those of you managing larger e-commerce websites, do you bring the site down momentarily for updates or is there another method, common or otherwise, that I am overlooking?
