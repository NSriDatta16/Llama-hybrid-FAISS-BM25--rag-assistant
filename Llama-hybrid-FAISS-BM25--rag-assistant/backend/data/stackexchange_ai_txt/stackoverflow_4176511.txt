Embedding JSON objects in script tags

EDIT: For future reference, I'm using non-xhtml content type definition I'm creating a website using Django, and I'm trying to embed arbitrary json data in my pages to be used by client-side javascript code. Let's say my json object is {"foo": " "} . If I embed this directly, JSON={"foo": " "}; The first closes the json object. (also, it will make the site vulnerable to XSS, since this json object will be dynamically generated). If I use django's HTML escape function, the resulting output is: JSON={&quot;foo&quot;: &quot;&lt;/script&gt;&quot;}; and the browser cannot interpret the tag. The question I have here is, Which characters am i suppose to escape / not escape in this situation? Is there automated way to perform this in Python / django?
