scikit-learn is a powerful and a very very simple ML library for Python. Your doubt is about a Classification Problem, where you're going to predict a class (True or False) given some input data. There are many classifiers that you can use. In this example I've used Logistic Regression from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression # Input data data = [[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0], [6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, 10.0]] # Target values for input data target = [True, False] # Define the model (default parameters) model = LogisticRegression(C=1.0, penalty='l1', tol=1e-6) # Train the model model.fit(data, target) # Once the model is trained, we make a prediction model.predict([[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]]) If you execute this code, the prediction for that data is False
