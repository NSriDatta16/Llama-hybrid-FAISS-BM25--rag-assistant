It's been my experience that some spam bots are actually not bots at all but rather humans from 3-world countries paid to sit there and fill out all kinds forms for whatever reason. This means that while email confirmation and captchas help, you're still bound to get some spam. There's a few other things you could consider: If the site is social, implement a flagging system which causes the community to become the moderator. Have all users disabled by default, then require an admin to approve or delete them. Require a credit card to sign up. Some of these may or may not work depending on your case. I've found that #3 pretty much eliminates spam all together, but it may also discourage real potential customers.
