As far as I know SelectedIndex is a readonly property in Panorama ( Weired why WP7 SDK made it readonly). So you will get only UI change back to your VM, and you cant update UI through the VM propertychange. And DefaultItem is the property which used to set the index programatically. Again the issue of programatically setting an already instantiated Panorama is that, the alignment of the Title and Panoramaitem wont be in sync. Anyway I am not discouraging but there is still some chance of hack there.
