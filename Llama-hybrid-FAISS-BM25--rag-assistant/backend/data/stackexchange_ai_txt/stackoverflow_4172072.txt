The problem that you have is that the Textfields are mouseEnabled. The label field mouseEnabled property should be set to false , as for the other TextField I can think of two solutions. The simpler approach (as you already mention ) could be to create a draggable hitArea within your mc , similar to the top of a window on a desktop , you could add your event listeners to this area so that the mc can only be dragged from there. A second approach could be to set your mc's mouseChildren property to false on a MouseDown and back to true on a MouseUp. This shouldn't interfere with a user entering text in your input textfield.
