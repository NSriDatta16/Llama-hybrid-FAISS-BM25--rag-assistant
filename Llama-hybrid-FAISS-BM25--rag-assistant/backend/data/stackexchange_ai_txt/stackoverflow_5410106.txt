From cplusplus.com : But vectors, also have a capacity, which determines the amount of storage space they have allocated, and which can be either equal or greater than the actual size. The extra amount of storage allocated is not used, but is reserved for the vector to be used in the case it grows. This way, the vector does not have to reallocate storage on each occasion it grows, but only when this extra space is exhausted and a new element is inserted (which should only happen in logarithmic frequence in relation with its size).
