GWT (formerly the Google Web Toolkit) is a development toolkit for building and optimizing complex browser-based applications. Its core feature is the Java to JavaScript compiler. The official docs cover all the basics and advanced topics â€“ it's a great place to start and you'll often come back to it when you want to expand your knowledge of the framework. The docs are sprinkled with example code, but if that's not enough for you, there are always the samples that come with the GWT bundle. For more esoteric topics the GWT Google Group might be of help. Latest stable version of GWT is 2.8.2 (2017-10-19) Interesting links Project website Project source code Official GWT blog (also: Best GWT blogs? ) Google IO GWT session videos 2013 (search for "gwt" on the page) , 2012 (under Chrome tracks) Google Web Toolkit Wikipedia Article Useful libraries google-gin - the DI framework for GWT, built on top of Guice GWTP - a popular and active MVP framework for GWT mgwt - a mobile library for GWT gquery - a jquery clone for GWT, and much more gwt-dnd - adds drag & drop functionality to GWT Errai - a web app framework using java-ee and HTML5 gwt-exporter - export GWT Java classes as a JS API without writing a single line of jsni gwt-bootstrap - based on Bootstrap 2 gwtbootstrap3 - based on Bootstrap 3 google-web-toolkit-incubator (deprecated) - a set of widgets and ideas for GWT, most of them have been added to GWT, the rest are deprecated gwtchosen - a port of the jquery-chosen for GWT gwt-webcam - a GWT wrapper for the jpegcam JavaScript library gwt-evenbinder - automates away the boring details of using EventBus gwt-mockito - makes pure Java unit test possible based on mockito restygwt - a GWT generator for REST services and JSON encoded data transfer objects gwt-maps-v3-api - GWT bindings for the Google Maps JavaScript API. gwt-streamer - an easy-to-use library for serializing objects, can be used on both server and client sides. gwt-material - A Google Material Design wrapper for GWT gwt-test-utils - Java testing framework for GWT applications
