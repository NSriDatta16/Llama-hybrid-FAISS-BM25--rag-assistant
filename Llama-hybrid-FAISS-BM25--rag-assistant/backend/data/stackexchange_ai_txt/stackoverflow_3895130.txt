Mimic file IO in j2me midlet using RMS

I want to be able to record audio and save it to persistent storage in my j2me application. As I understand j2me does not expose the handset's file system, instead it wants the developer to use the RMS system. I understand the idea behind RMS but cannot seem to think of the best way to implement audio recording using it. I have a continuous stream of bits from the audio input which must be saved, 1) should I make a buffer and then periodically create a new record with the bytes in the buffer. 2) Should I put each sample in a new record? 3) should I save the entire recording file in a byte array and then only write it to the RMS on stop recording? Is there a better way to achieve this other than RMS?
