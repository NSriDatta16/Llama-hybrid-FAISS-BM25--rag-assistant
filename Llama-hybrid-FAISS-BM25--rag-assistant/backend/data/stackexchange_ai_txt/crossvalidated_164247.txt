$P(x|\dots)$ gets a Dirac on the real $x_{\rm true}$ if the $P(z|x)$ is parameterized by $x_{\rm true}$. It is not parameterized, then the Bayesian filtration finds only the closest projection in terms of the Kulback-Leibler divergence (i.e. the closest projection of $P(z)$ on the class $P(z|x)$). The only assumption on prior $P(x_0)$ is that it is nonzero for $x_{\rm true}$. For details and the proof, see this .
