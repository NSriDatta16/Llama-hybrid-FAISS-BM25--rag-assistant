My application icon is corrupted (problems in the compiler?)

The "Application Icon" of my application is wrong. My application shows in taskbar a different icon than the classic Delphi icon. Instead is shows the icon of one of my VCL's. That specific VCL from which the icon was "stolen" is not used in my application but other VCL's in the same package are used. Related info: - The icon looks ok if I drag and drop my app on Desktop. - The icon looks ok in Windows Commander when I put the cursor on it. - The icon does not look ok in Windows Commander when I drag and drop it in "Button Bar". Conclusion: the icon is not accidentally changed at the runtime (the problem is there even if the application is not running). I use Delphi 7. I disabled EurekaLog and FastMM just to be sure, and rebuild the application. The problem still persists. I have not even the slightest clue why the compiler inserts the wrong icon. I really need some hints. Thanks.
