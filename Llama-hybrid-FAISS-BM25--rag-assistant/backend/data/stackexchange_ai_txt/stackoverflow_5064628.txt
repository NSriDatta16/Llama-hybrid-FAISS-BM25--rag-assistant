I don't know, what do you mean by more elegant. If you are writing some parsing script, than it seems that using built in structures is ok. So are you asking about used data structures or your code? One thing I see is that you can use setdefault instead of checking if you have certain key in dictionary: for item in data: if item["parentId"] != 0: parents.setdefault(item["parentId"], []).append(item['id'])
