memcached or APC However, I notice that you're not giving any reason why you want to cache the results of a search. "Because it's faster, and I read that it makes my app more scalable," is the usual reason for this. This smells like premature optimization. I recommend you build your application and profile it. How costly are these "searches"? Why are they costly? Is it poor schema design? Is it poor indexing? Is it poor choice of storage engine? You do realize that MySQL has a query cache , right? In many cases this may be all you need. Try running one of your expensive "search" queries using the mysql client and note the time, then run it again. See?
