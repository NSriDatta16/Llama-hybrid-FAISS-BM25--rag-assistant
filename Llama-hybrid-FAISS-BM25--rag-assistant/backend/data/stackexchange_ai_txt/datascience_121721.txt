What are the approaches for extracting an injury and its description from a paragraph?

Suppose I have a paragraph which explains the injuries and its descriptions. I want to extract the injuries and its corresponding descriptions from the text. How can I do that? For example, the paragraph will be as follows: In my opinion the neck pain is due to the soft tissue injury. The fracture on the hand will be resolved in 2 months. The pain in the shoulder and neck is due to the soft tissue injury. There is a stiffness and discomfort around the hip. the expected output is : { "neck": ["soft tissue"], "hand": ["fracture"], "shoulder": [ "soft tissue"], "hip": ["stiffness", "discomfort"] } Which NLP techniques can be used here? We have two txt files for injuries and descriptions. But how will we relate or match the description with its corresponding injury? I tried the dependency parser but the problem is we have to write a number of patterns for each injury, we have more than 100 injuries and more than 100 descriptions. So if we are writing patterns for all the injuries there will be a large number of patterns and I think it will take too much time and power. Are there any other ways to do this kind of extraction? The paragraph doesn't have a common structure. I'm using python and spacy for this.
