What would be the best word/way to describe the differences in two deep learning models (deep, wide, shallow, big or small model?)

I did experiments using a backbone deep network. I took it as it is and then I decreased the number of filters and did some other experiments. Note that, I did not change the number of layers of the original backbone network. Note that the original model requires a very high number of parameters while the new one (in which I changed only the number of filters in convolutional layers) requires very less parameters. Say that the original model is model A , and the new model is model B . While trying to report/write experiments, I think I can not say that model A is a deep model and model B is a shallower model since I did not change the deepness of model A to design model B. What word should I use to describe model B? Saying small model sounds weird I think but I could not find the right word. Could anyone help with this please? To be more precise, suppose that this is my original model, model A architecture (designing the model, before training) I decreased the number of filters in convolutional layer of model A from 24 to 12 to obtain model B architecture(designing the model, before training). Then, model B is Model images are created using online tool Thank you.
