I would say there is no statistical difference in the average scores of the wines. But it must be said (discussion in the last alinea) that this does not need to mean that the wines are not different. Different wines score (significantly) very different in different groups (see for instance the score of wine F in group b and the score of wine B in group h). What worries me is the discrepancy between the groups 'a' to 's', and I imagine that the scoring has not been consistent. In that case, the comparison of the high scores of wines A, C, and E with a model where they get random scores may not be entirely fair. This way of scoring may not reflect the actual distribution of the scores when the wines are equal. Possibly the discrepancy is large because, even when the wines are similar the wines will not get random independent points. In the extreme case a judge assigns all of the six points to a random single wine. In this case the inconsistency is only apparent and the large differences between groups might be due to the random behaviour of the judges being very coarse. points With such scoring the observed extremes are not so 'special' anymore. Another reason for the inconcistency could be that the scoring of the judges in the same groups is correlated. For instance the judges have somehow similar taste or possibly the wines score different among different groups due to different bottles or other variations that occur from serving to serving. A more realistic simulation might be to use the actual data from either the 193 judges or (since we do not have that data) the grouped data in order to simulate the distribution of the scores. Then the simulation is done by some resampling method. n.groups Then analysis will look more like: The observed variations of the max and min scores are consistent with there being no differences (on average) between the wines. There might actually be large differences between the wines (considering the lack of consistency between the groups this might be likely even when the average scores shows no big difference). It is only the average score that has no difference. This is in my opinion a problem with many competitions that are based on esthetics. There is no good way to define a ranking when wines score differently among different people, and the only score that gets 'published' is are very simplistic order or score that is greatly influenced by the subjectivity of the judges and may not have any bearing on the tastes of the general public and especially subgroups and individuals.
