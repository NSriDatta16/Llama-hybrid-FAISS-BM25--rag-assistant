the audit will pick up unchanged fields that were submitted as part of the Update message. For example, the following code will result in the audit record recording the change to the lastname attribute though submitted value is identical to the value in the database. In other word, auditing is performed on the message level and without actually comparing values with the database (which, as I understand, would be quite expensive exercise). var connection = CrmConnection.Parse("Url=http://localhost/acme;"); var service = new OrganizationService(connection); // create new entity Entity e = new Entity("contact"); e["firstname"] = "Foo"; e["lastname"] = "Bar"; Guid id = service.Create(e); // change just the first name and submit unchanged last name as well e = new Entity("contact"); e["contactid"] = id; e["firstname"] = "FooChanged"; e["lastname"] = "Bar"; service.Update(e); // remove the entity service.Delete("contact", id); Hope this helps.
