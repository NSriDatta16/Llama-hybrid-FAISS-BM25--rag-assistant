Wouldn't you just change your XML repository to have a SQL backend. It really shouldn't matter what yopur repositories do they are just meant to be 'black boxes' for the storage and retrieval of your data. Keep you secret XML knowledge in the XML repository and just backend it with SQL. You could chain it to your SQL repository or keep it seperate.
