On checking with Firebug, it appears that the site you mentioned is getting the data in XML format with simple AJAX requests such as: http://reiseplanlegger.skyss.no/scripts/travelmagic/TravelMagicWE.dll/mapxml?x1=4.85321044921875&x2=5.8282470703125&y1=60.150391714056326&y2=60.524184817591276&loc=1 The (x1, y1), (x2, y2) parameters define the (longitude, latitude) parameters of the viewport. Everytime the map is dragged, a new AJAX request is issued, which returns fresh data. This is a sample response from the AJAX request: Note that the x attribute is defining the longitude, while the y attribute is defining the latitude. Apart from the technical answer, I would suggest seeking permission before scraping such data.
