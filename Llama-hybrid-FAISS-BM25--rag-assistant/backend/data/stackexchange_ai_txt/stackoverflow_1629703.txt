I agree with phoenix... But one thing is the page would get already displayed when back button fires, from the cache and hence you can check for session validity only during postback... and remember, isPostBack will be true in that scenario. You can use the following code to set the page expiry. This if included in a page, will display a page expired message when the user hits back button after going out of the page. But beware, he can always hit refresh and can perform the post back again. Caution : using it in every other page, will frustrate the application users... Response.AppendHeader("Pragma", "no-cache"); Response.AppendHeader("Cache-Control", "no-cache"); Response.CacheControl = "no-cache"; Response.Expires = -1; Response.ExpiresAbsolute = new DateTime(1900, 1, 1); Response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.NoCache);
