Are there any worse sorting algorithms than Bogosort (a.k.a Monkey Sort)?

My co-workers took me back in time to my University days with a discussion of sorting algorithms this morning. We reminisced about our favorites like StupidSort , and one of us was sure we had seen a sort algorithm that was O(n!) . That got me started looking around for the "worst" sorting algorithms I could find. We postulated that a completely random sort would be pretty bad (i.e. randomize the elements - is it in order? no? randomize again), and I looked around and found out that it's apparently called BogoSort, or Monkey Sort, or sometimes just Random Sort . Monkey Sort appears to have a worst case performance of O(∞) , a best case performance of O(n) , and an average performance of O(n·n!) . What is the currently official accepted sorting algorithm with the worst average sorting performance (and there fore beeing worse than O(n·n!) )?
