Can this be considered overfitting?

I have been trying to use the LSTM model for a monthly time series with a length of 404 (384 for training and 20 for test). I created 4 pairs of training/validation sets, trained different models, and chose the model that performed the best on the validation sets. The selected model was constructed on the training set to forecast the test set. I am trying to determine whether my model is overfitting. I have shared a plot of the training and test loss: Could someone help me to understand whether this plot illustrates signs of overfitting?
