finding winning strategy

For a given asset, I have simulations of the price and implied volatility for T periods in N scenarios. Furthermore, assuming that I know the value of the risk-free asset (and the dividend yield), I can calculate the price of the calls and puts options on different maturities and strikes (at least with Black-Scholes). I would like to build a program that autonomously selects a winning strategy on average in the N scenarios - combining the underlying, call and put so that -the expected profit in the different scenarios is maximized. The aim is to have a rule of this type: 'when the volatility is under 15% and the stock had fallen in the last 3 days, buy the put X (maturity, moneyness) and the underlying'. Could you suggest any technique?
