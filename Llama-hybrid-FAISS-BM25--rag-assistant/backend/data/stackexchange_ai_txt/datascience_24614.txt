Keras: LSTM unit nums vs timesteps

I am using Keras LSTM (Tensorflow backend) to fit a time series model. Here is my model: model = Sequential() model.add(LSTM(LSTM_nums, input_shape=(timestep,data_dim))) model.add(Dense(2)) model.compile(loss='mean_squared_error', optimizer='adam') model.fit(trainX, trainY, epochs=100, batch_size=1, verbose=2) I am wondering is there a constraint or rule of thumb (or best practice) for setting the LSTM_nums value with a given timestep? I.e. should there be a relationship between LSTM_nums ~ timestep ? Thanks!
