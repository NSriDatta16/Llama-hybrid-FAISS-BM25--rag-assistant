Splitting a string with no line breaks into a list of lines with a maximum column count

I have a long string (multiple paragraphs) which I need to split into a list of line strings. The determination of what makes a "line" is based on: The number of characters in the line is less than or equal to X (where X is a fixed number of columns per line_) OR, there is a newline in the original string (that will force a new "line" to be created. I know I can do this algorithmically but I was wondering if python has something that can handle this case. It's essentially word-wrapping a string. And, by the way, the output lines must be broken on word boundaries, not character boundaries. Here's an example of input and output: Input: "Within eight hours of Wilson's outburst, his Democratic opponent, former-Marine Rob Miller, had received nearly 3,000 individual contributions raising approximately $100,000, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee said. Wilson, a conservative Republican who promotes a strong national defense and reining in the size of government, won a special election to the House in 2001, succeeding the late Rep. Floyd Spence, R-S.C. Wilson had worked on Spence's staff on Capitol Hill and also had served as an intern for Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C." Output: "Within eight hours of Wilson's outburst, his" "Democratic opponent, former-Marine Rob Miller," " had received nearly 3,000 individual " "contributions raising approximately $100,000," " the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee" " said." "" "Wilson, a conservative Republican who promotes a " "strong national defense and reining in the size " "of government, won a special election to the House" " in 2001, succeeding the late Rep. Floyd Spence, " "R-S.C. Wilson had worked on Spence's staff on " "Capitol Hill and also had served as an intern" " for Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C."
