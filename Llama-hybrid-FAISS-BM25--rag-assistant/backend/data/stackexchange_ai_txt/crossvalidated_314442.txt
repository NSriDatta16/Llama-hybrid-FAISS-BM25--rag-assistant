There is no guarantee that any approach to checking only a subset of all possible ARMA(p,q) with say, $p\leq p_\max$ and $q\leq q_\max$ will yield the AIC-minimal model. If you truly want to get the AIC-minimal model, you will need to look at all $(p_\max+1)\times(q_\max+1)$ possible orders (don't forget pure AR(p) and MA(q) models). That said, a heuristic like yours may make sense and work well on average. Whether a particular piece of time series modeling software uses this heuristic (or a different one) may be documented. Or more often, it isn't, and you will need to look into the source code.
