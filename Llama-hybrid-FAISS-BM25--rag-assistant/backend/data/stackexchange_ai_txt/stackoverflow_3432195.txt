If you want to put all your executable files in a subdirectory called "bin", then you can use the following line in the top CMakeLists.txt file: SET(CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY "${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/bin") Just remove /bin and executables will be created in the root directory. A similar variable exists for libraries: CMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY . PS. Adding per-directory logic is fine. It seems to be the common way to do things and keeps things nicely organized.
