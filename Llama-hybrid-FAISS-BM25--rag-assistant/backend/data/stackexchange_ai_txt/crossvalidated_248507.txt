How to calculate the F1-Score for a NLP research?

I have conducted a research about extracting words from a sentence (on natural language processing (NLP) ). I would like to know the best way to compute the F1 score for this research. I have categorized the data as follows, Total number of words identified by the machine = 9 Total number of words identified by the human = 8 Instances when the words identified were same for both = 5 Words missed by the machine = 1 Words missed by the human = 0 How do I use this data in order to calculate the F1 score?
