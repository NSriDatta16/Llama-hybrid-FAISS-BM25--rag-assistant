How do I incorporate personalization to a Bayesian ranking engine?

I'm looking to quickly get smart on how to add personalization into a Bayesian-based recommendation system. I'm using clickstream data and Bayesian statistics to estimate probabilities of purchase to rank a list of products on. How do I incorporate user-specific history to modify my generic probabilities for a specific user? For example, a user clicked a product in a previous site visit. How do I estimate the purchase probability during a successive visit? What is the standard approach here? Looking for papers, blogs, people that can help illuminate.
