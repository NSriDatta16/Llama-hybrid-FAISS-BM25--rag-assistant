It is important to use the Precision Recall AUC as opposed to ROC AUC for imbalanced datasets. I use glmnet with my logistic regression models, but I do my own cross validation and select the minimum lambda with the maximum PR AUC. Make sure to stratify the folds to ensure you have at least one member of the smaller class in each fold. Weight your classes according to the imbalance ratio. It also helps to create multiple models assuming your cross validation folds are different each time and then average the lambda across all your models to get a final lambda.
