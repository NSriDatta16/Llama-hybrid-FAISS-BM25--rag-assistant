more elegant way to compare string attribute for Entities

Dear all. Currently i need to extract necessary objects from core data but i have just attribute name in entity. TO setup reverse relationship, i find just one way to loop around all objects in managed objects, compare strings for checking necessary attributes accordance and setup relationship. May someone have better way. relationship carrier is part of NamesTranslationRules Entity and connect to Carriers Entity NSManagedObjectContext *moc = [self managedObjectContext]; NSFetchRequest *request = [[[NSFetchRequest alloc] init] autorelease]; [request setEntity:[NSEntityDescription entityForName:@"Carriers" inManagedObjectContext:moc]]; NSArray *carriers = [moc executeFetchRequest:request error:&error] ; for (NSManagedObject *carrier in carriers) { if ([[carrier valueForKey:@"name"] isEqualToString:[tempRules valueForKey:@"carrier"]]) [namesTranslationRules setValue:carrier forKey:@"carrier"]; } A parent object's is create at application startup as carrier's name with some attributes. Later user have to choice a name from another source and based on user's choice we have to add appropriate entity, which have already present parent entity carrier.
