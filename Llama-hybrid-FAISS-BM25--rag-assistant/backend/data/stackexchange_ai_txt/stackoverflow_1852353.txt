Use Core Data For Storage for an existing Iphone project?

According to the Apple Core Data Tutorial, in order to use Core Data you have to: In the Options section, select the switch to use Core Data for storage. How do it for an existing project? Do you have to import some files? Can that setting be activated later on? Thanks
