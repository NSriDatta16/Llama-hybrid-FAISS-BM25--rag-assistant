Significant advantages of ASP.NET MVC

I'm slowly getting into MVC, but it's still relatively new to me. From what I've discovered by doing a few tutorials, MVC provides an interface for communication between the database and the website and in general allows for better organization of the code. Are there other significant advantages to using an MVC structure? What would be an example of a time when you wouldn't want to user MVC, even if you are communicating with a database? Thank you!
