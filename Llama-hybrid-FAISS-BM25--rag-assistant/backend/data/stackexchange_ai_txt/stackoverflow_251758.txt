A singleton is a global variable. You making it a global encourages you to reference your controls all over your other classes (Imagine your data abstraction layer grabbing a name/addresss pair from the Database, and just for convenience, updating your name/address textbox right there) The resulting code is brittle and the dependencies become hard to resolve. Much easier just to have responsibility limited to a certain subset of classes.
