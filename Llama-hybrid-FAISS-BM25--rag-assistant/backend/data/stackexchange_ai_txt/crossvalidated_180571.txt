Suport Vector Machines optimization â€“ why multiply by 1/2?

In the primal version of the SVM problem, the term $\|w\|^2$ is divided by 2 for mathematical convenience. I fail to see this so called mathematical convenience caused by this change. If one were to ignore this division by 2, the resultant dual form of the problem would have a coefficient with a value of 1/4 somewhere. By dividing by 2 in that earlier step, one instead has a coefficient of 1/2 in that same position. I fail to understand why this slight change from 1/4 to 1/2 is considered a major source of mathematical convenience.
