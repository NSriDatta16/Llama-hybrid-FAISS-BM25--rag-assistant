Rectangle functions in emacs

I've read in several places that the rectangle functions in emacs are very useful. I've read a bit about them, and I can't quite figure why. I mean, when you want to kill a paragraph, you mark the first row/column and then the last one, and that's actually a rectangle, right? But you can still use the normal kill... So what kind of transformations would you do with them?
