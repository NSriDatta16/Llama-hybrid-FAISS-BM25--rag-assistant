Hi: The equation results from a recursive argument. If Bird and Magic both miss their first throw, then the game is essentially starting over right because Bird is now shooting ( and he shot first according to the rules of the game ). So, if $x_b$ is the probability that Bird wins the game, then $x_b = p_b + (1-p_{m})(1-p_{b}) x_b$ in words is just saying that The probability of Bird winning the game is equal to the probability of Bird making his first foul shot + [probability of them both missing their first shot] * the probability of Bird winning the game. The argument ( heuristically speaking ) is that, if they both miss their first first free throw and and then a new spectator comes in the gym to watch them shoot, then from the perspective of the new spectator, the game is starting off from the beginning as if neither of them has taken any free throws. This recursive argument is used often when dealing with Markov Chains.
