For uncertainty concerning an unknown fixed true parameter the frequentist would construct a confidence interval. This can be viewed as the inversion of a hypothesis test to identify the set of plausible values for a parameter given the observed data. The frequentist can use these parameter estimates (slope and intercept) to estimate the unknown fixed true mean revenue and construct a confidence band. This is also based on the inversion of a hypothesis test. Most of the time it is a Wald or t-test that is inverted to form a confidence interval. When dealing with non-normal data a proper link function (transformation of the parameter and the estimator) will yield an estimator that approximately follows a normal distribution. The Wald test can be safely inverted for the transformed parameter, and the confidence limits back-transformed to the scale of interest. Think of logistic regression where the estimator for the log odds is well-approximated by a normal distribution. By using the inverse link function we can obtain confidence limits for the population proportion. Let me know if you need more details. This link function approach is also used in Bayesian inference so that a normal distribution can be used for the prior and posterior. Here is an answer providing a couple of ways to construct a confidence interval for a binomial proportion and to visualize this inference using a confidence curve, analogous to a Bayesian posterior. Here is a discussion of hypothesis tests and confidence intervals, and how they are all approximations to the likelihood ratio test.
