Okay, I am not an econometrician, but if I hear econometrics and time-series, my first reaction is using Time-Series Regression . Here is a short example that appears to be comparable to your goal (Take note of the warning in the link and the other answer to your question about autocorrelation). Now to your questions: Regardless of what method you chose, 14 observations might be a bit low to get a useful model. If possible, try to get a bigger sample size. If that's all the data available to you, you still can use it, but point the lack of data as possible problem out when writing your thesis. Some discussion on how to estimate the usefulness of your model can be found here depends on what you want to find out. I would assume that the effect depends on the country you examine. So it might be interesting to look at those time series separately and compare them Sure, looking at different industries should give interesting results. as answered above, I would look into such kind of models using distributed lag (a deeper explanation can be found here ). they return coefficients that can be analyzed for the effect of each variable Edited to fix some misunderstanding of the used terminology
