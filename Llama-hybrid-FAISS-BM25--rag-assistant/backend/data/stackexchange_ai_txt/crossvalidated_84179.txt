Differing definitions of Matrix Condition Number

When describing the condition number of a correlation matrix I have seen is described as the ratio of the singular values (from singluar value decomposition). I have also seen it described as the ratio of the eigenvalues (from PCA analysis). Can both be correct (under say different norms)? If so which one would be considered standard?
