The Windows user accounts that you are trying to access SQL Analysis Services with need to be added to the Roles in the Cube that would allow the permissions you want. If you are connecting over HTTP using msmdpump.dll through IIS you need to turn on Authentication for that site and allow the Windows user account to access the site. If the IIS site using msmdpump is on another machine and you aren't using a domain then the accounts would need to exist on both servers with the same password.
