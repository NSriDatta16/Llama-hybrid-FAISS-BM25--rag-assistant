I've not personally done this, but you will probably need to use the low-level FLASH driver IOCTLs to do this correctly. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa927166.aspx I think IOCTL_FMD_RAW_WRITE_BLOCKS looks particularly useful. -PaulH Another possibility that may work would be to erase the file normally, then use the defragment APIs to wipe ALL of the freespace on your flash. Since you're wiping everything, it won't be necessary to know exactly where on the disk your file was. But, this will wear out your flash drive more quickly. The C# method is detailed in this blog post: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/jeffrey_wall/archive/2004/09/13/229137.aspx
