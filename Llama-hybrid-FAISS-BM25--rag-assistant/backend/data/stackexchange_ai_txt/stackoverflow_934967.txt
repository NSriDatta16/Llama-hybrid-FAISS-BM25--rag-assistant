UIScrollView in UITableCellView, cell doesn't update

I have a custom UITableViewCell with a UIScrollView in it that is wired to the cell controller. When I assign text to the scrollview, some cells get the correct text, some are blank, some redisplay old text and others have the scrollview clipped around the 2nd or 3rd line of text. It seems random on what will happen. I followed the suggestion here of using a timer to fix blank cells, http://www.bdunagan.com/2008/12/08/uitextview-in-a-uitableview-on-the-iphone/ , but that didn't help. I placed the timer code in the cellForRowAtIndexPath method. I've also tried calling [cell.textview setNeedsDisplay]; after text is assigned to the textview but it doesn't have any affect. When I use a textfield or label, everything looks fine. However, I need something that can scroll text. Any suggestions on a fix or better way?
