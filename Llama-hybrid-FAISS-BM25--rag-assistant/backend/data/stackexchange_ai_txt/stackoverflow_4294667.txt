you just need to call draggable() on the items that are in your tree. Your existing code does this already for all items having the class drag . From your code ('custom.js'): //Make element draggable $(".drag").draggable( ... ); This doesn't affect the items in your tree, because they don't have the class drag . An easy fix would be to simply add the class drag to your tree items. Alternately, you could specifically select your tree items somehow, and then apply draggable to that selection.
