How to describe time-varying covariates by group (averages)?

I want to start my survival analysis with some descriptive work of my variables. I have an unbalanced survival dataset with time-fixed and time-varying covariates. I want to compare those covariate values between groups. I can imagine comparing averages of time-fixed covariates but how am I supposed to do this with time-varying values? For example I measure xy on a continous scale between 0 and 1. This value changes on various time points. How do I compare this variable between men and women? Example: ID Gender xy t event 1 m 0.4 2 0 1 m 0.2 4 1 2 f 0.8 3 0 2 f 0.1 5 0 2 f 0.3 7 1
