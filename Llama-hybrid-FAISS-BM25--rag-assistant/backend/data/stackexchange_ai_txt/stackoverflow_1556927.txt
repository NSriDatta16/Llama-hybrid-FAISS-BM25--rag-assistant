Joomla - "paragraph permission" within an article

I have several articles on a Joomla (1.5) site. These articles are public -- one does not need to register to see their content. I would like to add a paragraph (i.e., custom HTML) to some of these articles (the paragraph would be different for each article), and I would like that paragraph to only be visible to registered users. Non-registered users would just see the article without the paragraph (or possibly with a teaser text instead of the paragraph, like "Register to see additional info"). What's the best way to achieve that? I suppose one way to do this would be to add a custom HTML module that's only visible to registered users. But since I want to display different HTML for each article, I think I would need to create a different module for each article where I want to display the paragraph. Is that unreasonable? My preferred way, conceptually (I'm making this up just to illustrate what I'm looking for), would be to just write the paragraph in the article editor, highlight it with the mouse, right-click and select "Make highlighted text visible only to registered users". But this doesn't exist (unless someone knows of a plug-in that achieves something similar?). Is the one-module-per-article approach the closest thing available? Thanks!
