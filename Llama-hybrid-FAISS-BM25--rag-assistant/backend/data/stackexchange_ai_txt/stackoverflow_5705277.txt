You should always store the data in the data size that matches the data being stored. It is part of how the database can maintain integrity. For instance suppose you are storing email addresses. If your data size is the size of the maximum allowable emailaddress, then you will not be able to store bad data that is larger than that. That is a good thing. Some people want to make everything nvarchar(max) or varchar(max). However, this causes only indexing problems. Personally I would have gone back to the person who make this requirement and asked for a reason. Then I would have presented my reasons as to why it might not be a good idea. I woul never just blindly implement something like this. In pushing back on a requirement like this, I would first do some research into how SQL Server organizes data on the disk, so I could show the impact of the requirement is likely to have on performance. I might even be surprised to find out the requirement made sense, but I doubt it at this point.
