Is Support Vector Machine sensitive to the correlation between the attributes?

I would like to train an SVM to classify cases (TRUE/FALSE) based on 20 attributes. I know that some of those attributes are highly correlated. Therefore my question is: is SVM sensitive to the correlation, or redundancy, between the features? Any reference?
