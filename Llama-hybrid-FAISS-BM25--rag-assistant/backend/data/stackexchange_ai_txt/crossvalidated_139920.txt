If you are specifically interested in neural networks, then this is what you do: you train the network with whatever many features you want, and then look at the magnitude of the weights in the first layer; the larger the magnitude is, the higher is the impact of that feature. But, if you're interested in knowing what features are the better ones to be constructed and then used in a model, then you're asking a question which is known as "structure learning". Structure learning problem is not completely solved yet, but there are many progresses towards some solutions. For example, this paper uses decision trees for structure learning: http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume15/lowd14a/lowd14a.pdf
