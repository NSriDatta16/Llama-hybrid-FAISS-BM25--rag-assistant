Mathematics is simply a tool in machine learning. Knowing the maths enables one to efficiently approach the modelled problems at hand. Of course it might be possible to brute force one's way through, but usually this would come with the expense of lessened understanding of the basic principles involved. So, pick up a maths book, study the topics until it you're familiar with the concepts. No mechanical engineer is going to design a bridge without understanding the basic maths behind the system behaviour; why should this be any different in the area of machine learning?
