Can someone explain Ripley's proof (1996) of the splitting of categorical variables?

Specifically I am referring to this theorem: 1) Suppose there are two classes. For a categorical feature , order the levels in increasing $p(1\mid x = x_i)$ . Then a split of the form $\{x_1, ... x_{\ell}\}, \{ x_{\ell+1}, ... , x_L\}$ maximizes the reduction in average impurity. I am looking for some basic intuition on this proof since I don't understand the mathematics very well. For the entire proof please refer to page 218 in his book which can be found here: https://dmitry.ai/uploads/default/original/1X/9dc03a6a9bd420ffcdee1b576ef28ff326555e19.pdf At a high level, I think I understand that ordering the categories by the proportion of a label (any label) is somehow equivalent to splitting the node to minimize entropy/tree impurity.
