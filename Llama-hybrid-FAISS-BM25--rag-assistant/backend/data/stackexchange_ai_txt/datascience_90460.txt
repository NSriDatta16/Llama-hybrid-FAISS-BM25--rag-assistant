You can model it as a binary logistic regression. The target is the probability of default. One of the features is credit card limit. Logistic regression allows an odds ratio to be calculated. The odd ratio will give the effect of increasing credit card limit on wether a default is predicted to happen. Logistic regression allows a threshold to be set to "minimize the probability of default".
