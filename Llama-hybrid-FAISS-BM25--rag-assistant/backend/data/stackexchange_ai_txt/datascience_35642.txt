Ensemble models - neural network input both original data and predictions of other models?

From my understanding in order to improve accuracy with ensemble models you need a wide range of independent ensemble methods. I was wondering whether using the ouput of a random forest model as one of the inputs for a neural network where the other input is the original data and the targets remain the same could improve the model? Why add extra complexity? basically the problem is a multi-dimensional regression problem and although the random forest gets a smaller MSE the neural network is bette at preservering some of the properties of the target labels. Therefore, I was wondering if by putting these two models together I would get a lower MSE while preserving some of the properties. Is it worth a shot? or will it just drastically overfit?
