Try the following: #pragma omp for private(i, l, j) for(j=1;j While Googling for the GCC compiler switch to enable OpenMP, I actually came across this blog post that describes what happens better than I could, and also contains a better example. OpenMP is supported on most reasonably relevant compilers for multicore machines, see the OpenMP web site for more information.
