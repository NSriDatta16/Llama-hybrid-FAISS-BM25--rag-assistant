@Transactional is applied to the Spring-managed beans only (unless you have configured advanced features), whereas in your case FormatDaoTest isn't managed by Spring. I guess you can do the following as a quick fix: public static void main(String[] args) { FormatDaoTest test = context.getAutowireCapableBeanFactory() .createBean(FormatDaoTest.class); test.doTransaction(); } As a more elegant solution you can use Spring TestContext framework, which supports transaction-aware tests out of the box, see 9.3.5.4 Transaction management .
