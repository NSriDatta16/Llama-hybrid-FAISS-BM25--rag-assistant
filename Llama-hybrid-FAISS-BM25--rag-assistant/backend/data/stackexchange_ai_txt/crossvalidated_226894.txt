Plotting predicted MSE as a function of the training sample size for choosing $K$ in $K$-fold CV

From Principles and Theory for Data Mining and Machine Learning , Clarke et al.: One strategy for choosing $K$, if enough data are available, is to plot the predicted MSE as a function of the size of the training sample. Once the curve levels off, there is no need to increase the size of the portion of the data used for fitting. Thus, the complement gives the size of the holdout portion, and dividing $n$ by this gives an estimate of the optimal $K$. I don't understand this. MSE is dependent on the training sample and test sample: training sample is used to build the model, test sample is used for the points for the MSE comparison. So if I want to choose a training sample of, say, 5 from some large data set, obviously, the MSE I compute will be dependent on what points I choose and not solely the training sample size. So that makes me wonder, how in the world would I compute that curve?
