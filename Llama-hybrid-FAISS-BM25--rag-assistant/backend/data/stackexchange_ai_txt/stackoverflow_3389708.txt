How can I "look behind" the bash command line argument expansion?

I want a Perl script to accept wildcards (foo-*.ba?) for file names (which are then processed for a whole directory subtree). Of course, I can tell the users of my script to quote the argument ('foo-*.ba?'), but this is not really elegant - the wildcard method is meant as a user-friendly alternative to passing regexes (which are accepted, too, and which, of course, must be quoted). The trouble is, that the shell (bash, in my case) expands the command line to the files matching the wildcard pattern in the current directory, so my poor script gets @ARGV preset with whatever the bash found (typically nothing, or a bunch of foo-lotsof.baz etc.). Is there a copy of bash's unexpanded command line anywhere?
