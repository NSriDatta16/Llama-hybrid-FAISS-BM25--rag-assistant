I hear good things about Tensor Flow for applications such as this. Here is someone's blog where they do something similar: https://towardsdatascience.com/using-tensorflow-object-detection-to-do-pixel-wise-classification-702bf2605182 They have helpfully provided their code on github here https://github.com/priya-dwivedi/Deep-Learning/blob/master/Mask_RCNN/Mask_RCNN_Videos.ipynb They first do 'instance segmentation' where they detect boundaries of an object, and they use 'FASTER R-CNN' (a convoluted neural network approach) to generate the mask.
