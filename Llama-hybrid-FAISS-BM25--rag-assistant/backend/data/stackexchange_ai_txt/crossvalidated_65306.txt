LIBSVM parameter search in time series

I try to predict values for regression in LIBSVM. My data is in time series. I use gridregression.m file in LIBSVM to find optimal parameters c, g and p. Gridregression.m file use cross validation to find optimal parameters, but is it ok to use cross validation in time series? When I use parameters from gridregression.m, sometimes the MSE is not better then the default values. ( cmd= '-s 3 -t 2' is sometimes better )
