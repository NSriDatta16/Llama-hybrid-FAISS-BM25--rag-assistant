Relationship between big-Oh and little-Oh

I'm reading Wu, J. (2014), Restoring monotonic power in Wald/LM-type tests. At a certain point in his derivations, an expresion turns out to be $=O_p(\frac{1}{T^{3/10}h^{5/10}}+T^{2/10}h^{20/10})$, where $T$ is the sample size (the paper is about time series tests) and $h$ is the bandwidth of a kernel estimator he is proposing. Earlier in the paper, the author makes the following assumptions: $h \rightarrow 0$, $T^3h^5 \rightarrow \infty$, and $Th^{10} \rightarrow 0$ as $T \rightarrow \infty$. From the $O_p$ order and these assumptions, the author concludes that the expression is actually $o_p(1)$. Why?
