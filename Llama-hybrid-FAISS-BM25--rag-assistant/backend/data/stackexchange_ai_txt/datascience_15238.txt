Though there can be a very detailed explanation for this question but I will try to make you understand much minimal words. 1) Cropping the images to a particular size isn't a necessary condition and neither is scaling. But put this way, it doesn't matter whether a dog is represented in a B&W image or RGB image because a convolution network learns features in the images which are independent of colors. Scaling and resizing help to limit the value of pixels between 0 and 1. 2) Once you have trained your CNN model, it has learned all the features like edges,etc. to recognize a dog in the image. Because the model has learned the features, it acquires certain properties like translation invariance which means that no matter where you position a dog in the image, it's still a dog and have the same features. How the model recognize it? It checks for the features of a dog, learned during training, no matter what the size of the new image is or where the dog is in the image or what the dog is doing.
