This table structure sounds like it was intended to be part of a data partitioning scheme . This is not bad design. This is a very good thing! Time based data like this is always being added to in the front and dropped off the back as it expires. Using one huge table would result in large amounts of index fragmentation as the data updates and in very large maintenance times for operations like VACUUM. If you follow the link I included in the first paragraph and read all about partitioning, you'll be able to use CHECK constraints to make date searches very fast. Any SELECT that includes a WHERE timestamp > x AND timestamp Now, if these tables don't include any timestamps then the partitioning with CHECK constraints won't work and you will just have to write scripts to write the clumsy UNION queries for you.
