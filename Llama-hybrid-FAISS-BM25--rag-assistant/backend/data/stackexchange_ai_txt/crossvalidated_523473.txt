Trouble identifying what data analysis to use

I am currently undergoing a soil research project in which 3 soil samples was taken from 3 different depths each (30cm, 60cm, 90cm) therefore totalling 9 samples overall. With these samples, I am looking if soil pH changes as depth increases and if soil nutrient levels changes as depth increases. For the pH tests I gained these results: 30cm (1) 6 pH, 30cm (2) 6 pH, 30cm (3) 7 pH, 60cm (1) 6 pH, 60cm (2) 6 pH, 60cm (3) 6 pH, 90cm (1) 6 pH, 90cm (2) 6 pH, 90cm (3) 6 pH, From this I calculated the averages from all samples at different sites, giving each depth it's own pH average: 30cm = 6.33pH 60cm= 6pH and 90cm 6pH. Which I have put all the averages in a bar chart including error bars with the standard deviation (really there is only one standard deviation for 30cm which is 0.57. I'm including in a separate table underneath the bar chart the standard error for all of them (which again only 30cm samples have and it is 0.33) and I'm including a grubbs calculation to determine if the outlier pH result of 7 for 30cm was an error in the table as well. I'm wanting to compare the the mean pH values at all the different depths but I'm not sure what method to use and I'm not sure what data analysis I can do with quite a small sample size, I've stated the dispersion is normal via the standard deviation error bars, I've stated the uncertainty of my method of testing (which was by test strips as I can't get into a lab right now) by my standard error calculations and I've I'll be investigating the outlier pH result. Please help I'm really at a loss when it comes to small sample sizes as there's a load of inferential stats methods I can't really use because the small sample size violates them.
