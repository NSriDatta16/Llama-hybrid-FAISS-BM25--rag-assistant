It sounds like you need to have the JavaScript create the DOM sections rather than just changing CSS styles. Instead of changing the display property of the "I'm hidden" paragraph, have the JavaScript create that element when you want it to display, and remove it whan you want to hide it. If the elements are complicated enough, then perhaps you can have them at the bottom of the document with "display:none", but then move them into the place where you want them visible.
