Organizing memcache keys

Im trying to find a good way to handle memcache keys for storing, retrieving and updating data to/from the cache layer in a more civilized way. Found this pattern, which looks great, but how do I turn it into a functional part of a PHP application? The Identity Map pattern: http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/identityMap.html Thanks! Update: I have been told about the modified memcache (memcache-tag) that apparently does do a lot of this, but I can't install linux software on my windows development box...
