Difference between inferential and predictive statistics (In one of the Coursera Datascience toolbox lectures)

I think I understood nuts and bolts about the difference about inferential and predictive statistics, but it got me confused after looking at one of the lectures on data science @ coursera. I copypasted the part where got me confused. This excerpt came from experimental design lecture of Datascience Toolbox . The image the lecturer is referring to is attached below. So for a prediction study, you actually have slightly different issues that come up from the inferential case. So again, you might have a population of individuals, and you might not be able to collect the data on all those individuals but you want to predict something about them. So for example, we might get individuals that come in and we measure something about their genome, and we want to predict whether they should get whether they're going to respond to chemotherapy or not. So what we do is, we collect these individuals and we might collect observations from people that did respond to chemotherapy, and did not respond to chemoptherapy. And then what we want to do is build a predictive function so that if we get a new individual, we can predict whether they're going to respond to chemotherapy up here, as an orange person, or not respond down here as a green person. So the idea here is that we'll still need to deal with probability and sampling and potential confounding variables, because, when we're building this prediction function, we want it to be highly accurate. Another issue that comes up is that, prediction is slightly more challenging than inference. So for example, if you look at these two populations, the, the population for the light grey curve has a mean, value about here, and the population for the dark grey curve has a mean value about here. If you look at the distribution of observations from these two populations, and so what you can see is, there's a difference in the P value of these two populations. But if I tell you, for example, that I've observed the value that comes, say, right here. It's very difficult to know which of these two populations it came from, because it's relatively likely that it came from the light gray population. But it's also relatively likely that it came from the dark gray population, so it's very difficult to tell the difference. For prediction, you actually need the distributions to be a little bit more separated, so these also, these two distributions also have a different mean, but now, they're far enough apart based on their variability. That if I give you an observation that lands right about here, you know it probably came from the dark grid population. Where if I give you an observation here, it probably came from a light grid population. So it's important to pay attention to the relative size of effects when considering prediction versus inference. I have commonly seen such slide when people explain the mechanism of inferential statistics but am not familiar with using such image to explain the difference between prediction and inference. What is the lecturer getting at in terms of the difference between prediction versus inference by using the slide?
