Replacing values in multiple columns of a data frame in R

for example consider this dataframe : dam the dataframe looks like this name re1 re2 re3 a yes yes yes b no no no c yes yes yes d no no yes e yes no yes I would like to replace the yes & no's in re1,re3 with 1 & 2. to get something like this - #>the output should look like this name re1 re2 re3 a 1 1 yes b 2 2 no c 1 1 yes d 2 2 no e 1 1 yes I know i could do something like : replace_re % mapvalues(replace_re,with_this) dam$re2 %>% mapvalues(replace_re,with_this) and I know I could use a for loop for many columns. but what I want is how do you accomplish this in a functional way ,say with pacakage "purrr" (map,invoke_map functions)and does the job,in an elegant way for n such columns i.e replacing my categorical variables with some other values. also, how would I do that with base R apply functions ? this might be a very trivial question but I'm unable to come up with a more tidy way of doing this. Recoding the factors seems to be a bane for me,any help would be much appreciated .
