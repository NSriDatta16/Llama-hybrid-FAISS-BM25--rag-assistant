How to prepare masks for multiclass semantic segmentation?

It's very straightforward for binary semantic segmentation: black color (0s) is responsible for background, whereas white color (1s) is responsible for objects of interest. But what about multiclass semantic segmentation? As far as I understand, these masks must be RGB images since we use more than two colors. Is it correct? Or should I have a separate binary mask for every class? If I can use RGB images with multiple colors as masks, should I use some specific colors for masking? If not, should I specify colors I chose somewhere in a network as class parameters? Or will any CNN automatically detect any number of different colors in my masks? These questions may seem naive and primitive, but I was unable to find any clear explanantions of thus aspect of multiclass semantic segmentation.
