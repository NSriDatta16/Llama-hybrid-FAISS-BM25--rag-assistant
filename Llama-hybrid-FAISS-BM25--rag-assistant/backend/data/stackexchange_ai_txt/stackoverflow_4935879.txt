The entire reason Microsoft added the error providers was to avoid the "message box hell" your client seems determined to banish themselves to. Modal dialogs disrupt the user's flow and cause extra, unnecessary UI interactions. After they've seen the message a few times, they won't even read it anymore anyway. Now, I agree that they user should be given immediate notification that the validation failed when they tab off of the field, or perhaps it should even keep them in the field. Infragistics has some good guidance on this: http://quince.infragistics.com/html/PatternView.aspx?id=efb68767-0c0d-48da-9dab-d398ae1d7e8c (In order to do timely validation, I think you need to use the error providers like this http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/f6xht7x2.aspx )
