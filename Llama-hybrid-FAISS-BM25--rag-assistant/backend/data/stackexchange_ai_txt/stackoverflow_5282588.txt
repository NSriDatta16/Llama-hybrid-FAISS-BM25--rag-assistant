How can I bring my application window to the front?

How to bring my application window to front? For example whan my app needs attention. This is for my personal program. I need that functionality. This is what I got. But it's NOT working 100% times. public void BringToFrontToEnterCaptha() { if (InvokeRequired) { Invoke(new Action(BringToFrontToEnterCaptha)); } else { this.TopMost = true; this.Focus(); this.BringToFront(); this.textBox1.Focus(); this.textBox1.Text = string.Empty; System.Media.SystemSounds.Beep.Play(); } } public void BringToBackAfterEnterCaptha() { if (InvokeRequired) { Invoke(new Action(BringToBackAfterEnterCaptha)); } else { this.TopMost = false; } } And I call them from background worker. BringToFrontToEnterCaptha(); while (!ready) { Thread.Sleep(100); } BringToBackAfterEnterCaptha(); Thread.Sleep(300); And after pressing "Accept" button bool ready is set to true. I works great but not always.
