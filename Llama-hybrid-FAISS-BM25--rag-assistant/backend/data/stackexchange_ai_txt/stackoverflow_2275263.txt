Tweaking the Fill Factor to reduce fragmentation

I have an non-clustered index that has ~1000 pages, 95% fragmentation and a FillFactor of '0'. I rebuilt the index on Sunday. A week later, the index has 95% (or so) fragmentation again. Is this an indication that I need to change the FillFactor to say 80-90%? Should I be tweaking the fill factor each week to see if I can reduce the fragmentation from week to week? Is there a target level I shoot be shooting for? Thank you.
