observational data for rainfall Well, clearly temperature, cloud cover, and dew point are going to matter, as well. I assume you can readily obtain such figures. CNN regression approach Given the timeseries nature of precipitation followed by vegetation growth and evaporation, it's unclear why this would be the winning tool to draw from the (Polya?) toolbox. Various folks systematically gather the sort of data you are interested in. You may find this article on soil moisture measurements helpful. In the Sierra Nevada range, snowpack measurements are invaluable for predicting summer reservoir levels. But putting vegetation specimens in a desiccating oven can also be helpful, for assessing what summer wildfires will look like. Mass of sample before versus after desiccation indicates how much water the sample originally contained. Such measurements have been conducted in a standard way for many years. LANDSAT and similar imagery is available for the subject areas for many years. So you may be able to exploit this ground truth to train a "pixels to liters" model of how much water is visible within the orbiting camera frame.
