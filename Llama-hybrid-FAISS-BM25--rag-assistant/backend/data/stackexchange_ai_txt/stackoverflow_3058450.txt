Use the GPS and hope that you got good coverage. Other than this, you can deploy several wifi hotspots that can measure the signal strength for each packet and do a triangulation to calculate the iPhone position with regards to three or more of these hotspots based on the signal strength each of them measured. A quick search for "signal triangulation" on the internet reveals a Wi-Fi Based Real-Time Location Tracking technology from Cisco. I have not used it, so I can't vouch for it; and I suspect it's rather expensive. There might be other solutions as well. The alternative would be to buy several wifi routers or access points and flash them with your own version of the firmware. You can probably use OpenWRT or DD-WRT as a base for this.
