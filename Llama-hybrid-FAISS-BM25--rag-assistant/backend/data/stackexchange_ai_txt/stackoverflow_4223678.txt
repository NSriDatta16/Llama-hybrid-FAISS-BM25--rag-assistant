you are all wrong.... not sure why we are coding CM server api..this guy wants to use rlcleartool out-of-the-box...and why shouldn't he... try this.... cd C:\Users\_\ccpath\lkw_projects_ac08099_view\vobs\PMOoffice dir rcleartool update -server http://192.168.225.205:12080/TeamWeb/services/Team -username ac08099 -password password cd into the vob storage location on the host first... many things don't work well in rcleartool "interactive" mode...in addition full statements can be triggered easily from automation utilities... you don't need clearcase albd daemon to support simple update, check-in, check-out... Rcleartool is a good idea...
