How to find dynamically loaded modules (the static ones) programatically in windows

I'm trying to port the unix utility ldd to windows, because dependency walker and cygcheck don't quite give me the usage I'm looking for. (also for the learning experience) Ive been looking all over MSDN, for a windows API that lists dll dependencies of an executable, or even the storage format in the complied exe (just to filter it out), but I've been unable to find anything. If anyone knows what API call windows uses for listing modules to load, or what patterns I can search for in an executable to find modules to load, please help me out :) thanks! -note: I'm not looking to profile for dynamic modules, just list the ones that are required at runtime
