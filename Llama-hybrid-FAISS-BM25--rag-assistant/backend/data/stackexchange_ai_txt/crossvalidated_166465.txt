Multiple (not independent) response variables in machine learning

Question: How to predict the percentage of people with age 65 who visit a webpage using machine learning in R? Since these percentages sum to 100 for all observations, they are not independent. Data: Contains 400 observations of 16 independent variables (TF-IDF values of 16 keywords for all pages) along with % of people with age 65. This can be split into test and train set. My idea: Recode the output variable as a factor (1: percentage of The problem: Variance of the output variable decreases on recoding. This may give inaccurate results.
