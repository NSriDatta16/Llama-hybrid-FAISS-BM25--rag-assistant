DC = Douglas Crockford RMP = Revealing Module Pattern Difference between DC and RMP is mainly organizational/readable Example is presented in the article itself? And what exactly are you asking because those things don't have anything to do with files but rather to closures. You put everything in a closure (function) and expose only those part that you wish to be accessible. The difference between DC style and RMP is that in the first one functions are defined in different places while in the RMP they're always defined in the same place and then afterwards revealed in the public object literal. So in the DC and RMP you have: closure that makes it possible to define private parts (variables and functions) private part public result that defines publicly visible functionality and variables (state) These two patterns differ only in readability. In DC case you can't always know where certain functionality will be defined, but in the RMP you always know everything is in the private part.
