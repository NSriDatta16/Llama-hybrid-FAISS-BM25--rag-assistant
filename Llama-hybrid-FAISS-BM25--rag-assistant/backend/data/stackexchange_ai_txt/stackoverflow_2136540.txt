Scott Hanselman has a complete walkthrough here for binding lists of items. In short, your controller method needs an array of MachineLicenseBillback , not an IList . public ActionResult TrueUp(int id, MachineLicenseBillback[] machinePts) { // ... } Looking at your code, if you want to bind to an IDictionary (not an IList), you can use key/value pairs in the view instead. Or can keep the code you currently have in the view, and use an Array as the parameter in the controller method. Pay special attention to the naming conventions. If there is a mismatch in naming, the model binder won't pick up the data.
