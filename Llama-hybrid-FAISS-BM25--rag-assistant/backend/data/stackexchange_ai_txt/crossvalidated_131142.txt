How to choose a kernel for kernel PCA?

What are the ways to choose what kernel would result in good data separation in the final data output by kernel PCA (principal component analysis), and what are the ways to optimize parameters of the kernel? Layman's terms if possible would be greatly appreciated, and links to papers that explain such methods would also be nice.
