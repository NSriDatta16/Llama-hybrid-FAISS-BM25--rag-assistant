Edit: The first two paragraphs answered the wrong question as I misread point #1 and thought they meant user specific data. On rereading the original question I do agree with #1 regarding application specific data. I disagree with #1 and keeping any local settings in the FE. There is no advantage to keeping a local table vs a table with the network user ID as a unique index in the BE database file. The idea is that replacing the FE database file when you make changes should be absolutely as easy as possible. Having to import settings every time there is a new version of the FE is simple some more work. Yes, you can create queries and code to do the work but why even bother. That said I only ever kept one setting locally and that was the location of the backend database file. For that I used an INI file and API calls. I could've used a registry key or something else. Now when I'm doing custom work for clients on their network then this isn't really required. This was more for shrink wrap software which folks could download from my website. Which had my datasbase location in the linked tables connect string. I agree with #2 because that's what I do. As David as stated #3 shouldn't be done because it doesn't do you any good. You need those queries in the FE where you will be using them
