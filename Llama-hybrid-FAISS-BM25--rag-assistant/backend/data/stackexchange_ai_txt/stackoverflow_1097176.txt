To be honest I never faced such a problem using Visual Studio. Your CPP should be rebuild as well if it includes the header. The only reason I can come up with: same include file is taken from 2 different sources. You can try do debug this at compile time, by enabling the preprocessor to output preprocessed files. Click on the CPP file go to properties and then to C/C++->Preprocessor and select in "Generate Preprocessed File" the item with or without line numbers. Go to you include file put the pragmas around your newly added definitions like: #pragma starting_definition_X ... #pragma ending_definition_X Now compile everything. There will be a newly created file with the same name as CPP but with extension .I (or .i). Make a search if your pragmas are there. If not, your include come from another place. If you use pre-compiled headers, you cpp should rebuild. There is also a pragma once statement in MS VC, which parses the include file only once, but that should still recompiler you cpp-file. Hope that helps, Ovanes
