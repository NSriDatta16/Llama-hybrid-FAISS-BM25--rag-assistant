.999 signifiance query

I am getting the following result for one of my variables after running a logistic regression. Basically I have a set of binary dependent and one independent variable. One of the dependent variables is never 0 when the independent variable is 1. I believe that is why I am getting the above result. How would you interpret this? The .999 indicates that it's not significant but surely it should be? Also, what would you say about the odds ratio? EDITED: Yes, my bad. I have one DV and about 10 IVs. All of the other IVs display normal ORs and 4 have significant p values. The 'endoc' one I included in the screenshot above is the only 'outlier'. Here is the rest of the regression table: . and this is part of my data I am basically writing a report for this, so I just need to know what to say about this occurence?
