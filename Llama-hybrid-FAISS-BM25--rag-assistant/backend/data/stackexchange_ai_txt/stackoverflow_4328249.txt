What you've described is pretty much the way to go. There may be more elegant things you can do with locks and mutexes, but your counter will work. It has the bonus that you can see how many operations are still "in progress" at any one time. You could dispatch your events sequentially but that would defeat the whole purpose of asynchronous operations. If you analysed what each part of your UI needs you might be able to do some operations before all of your async events have finished. Making sure you start the longest running operations first might help - but there's no guarantee that the other shorter operations will finish first. It all depends on what resources are available on both the client and server at the time the call is made.
