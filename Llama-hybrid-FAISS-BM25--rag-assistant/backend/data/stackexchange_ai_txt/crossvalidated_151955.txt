I would recommend Andrew Ngs Machine Learning course on Coursera, it does a brilliant coverage on all the basics. If you are studying anything to do with probabilistic graphical models Daphne Kollers course would be good to have a look at too. This is a treasure trove for self-study resources too http://ragle.sanukcode.net/articles/machine-learning-self-study-resources/ Herb Grossman's lectures are awesome. I've also been recommended this book https://www.openintro.org/stat/textbook.php as I'm always still learning myself and stats is not my background! My two cents re the maths side of things and papers though is don't get too caught up on the background maths. Learn the basics and reference the papers that those papers you mentioned are built on and see are they easier (maybe you'll have to go back a few papers to get something you can understand -it's what I do myself) there are a lot of different elements of maths in ML and it's easy to get sucked down a rabbit hole (again something I've done myself more than once!). Best of luck, it's a really interesting field!
