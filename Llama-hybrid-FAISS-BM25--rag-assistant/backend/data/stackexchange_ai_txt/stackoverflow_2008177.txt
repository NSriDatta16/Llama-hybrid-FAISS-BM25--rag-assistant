ajax wordpress posts

I am using Wordpress for this design portfolio website: http://onomadesign.com/wordpress/identity-design/shleppers-moving-storage/ Now, on this single.php page, you can see the thumbnails on the right which link to each different post. What I would like to accomplish is that the thumbnail navigation with scrollbar, stays in the same position when people click on one to view a project. Now the whole page refreshes, so that the scrollbar is viewed from the top again. I don't want that. So, I think I have to 'ajax' some stuff, right? Preferrably using jQuery, because I use that library through the website allready. Can I make that div on the right side with the thumbnails not to refresh while the rest of the page does? Or fetch the single posts so that it 'ajax refreshes'? I hope I made myself clear, thanks in advance for any help! Joshua
