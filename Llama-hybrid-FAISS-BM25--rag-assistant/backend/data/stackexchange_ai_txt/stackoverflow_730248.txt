A map, like HashMap. It can be set up in code, or the pair can be read from a file using any of several classes for this purpose (e.g., in Spring). But in the larger picture, your plan is fragile. You have to parse a string, you have to assume you'll never use a class in another paxckage with the same name, etc. You probably need to rethink what you're doing, or maybe post your goal , not your implementation, as a question. Comment from OP: But since I would control the mapping from the SimpleName to the ClassName, would that really be a problem? â€“ cloutierm (2 mins ago) In a very simple toy app, this might work. In a real app, you'll find that you're using library classes that have the same simple name. Or to put it another way, by doing this you're saying, "I'll never use Spring clasess, or Apache Commons classes or even java.lang classes without having to grep through my code looking for name clashes." It's to avoid such inevitable classes that packages were designed.
