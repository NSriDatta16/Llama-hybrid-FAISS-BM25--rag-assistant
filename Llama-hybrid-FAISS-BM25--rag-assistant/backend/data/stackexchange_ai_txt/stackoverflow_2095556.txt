The silverlight runtime operates inside of a security 'sandbox'. You can access files from the computers hard drive only via the Open file dialog. You can read and write from Isolated Storage using Silverlight 2 and up. Coming in Silverlight 4 you will have the ability to access files from "special directories" such as My Documents, My Music, My Pictures etc. ( http://weblogs.asp.net/nmarun/archive/2009/11/27/local-file-access-silverlight-4.aspx )
