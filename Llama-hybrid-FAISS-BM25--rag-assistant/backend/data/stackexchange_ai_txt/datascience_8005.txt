Develop a “Credit Risk Scoring System” with R

I want to achieve during my internship a credit risk scoring system based on "credit german dataset". I develop a model with R using logistic regression and i validate it. Now i must use this model to calculate a new applicant score and deduce whether good or bad. I don't know how to proceed?
