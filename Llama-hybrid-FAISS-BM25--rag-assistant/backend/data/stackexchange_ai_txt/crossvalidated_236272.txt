Probabilities Classification using R

I am going to implement Random forest probabilistic classification using R. Earlier my code was as follows: data(iris) attach(iris) # alternatively the traditional interface: x But I have found in some places the code as follows: data(iris) attach(iris) # alternatively the traditional interface: x I don't know why they put [,2] into the code for calculating probability for each class. In my case dependent variable may have two class or multi class. I have tried by adding [,2] into my code and its only gives second class probability information and that is not sufficient for probabilistic classification Can you suggest, which is correct, why many of programmer add [,2] into their code when calculating probabilistic classification.
