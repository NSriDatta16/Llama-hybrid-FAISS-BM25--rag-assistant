Your question is unclear to me, but I think you are asking, "How can I indicate that A, B, and C can be document roots but item cannot be a document root?" There's not a way to indicate which global elements can be document roots. However, you can make your "internal" element declaration local to a model group and ref that model group. Maybe something like: ... BTW, if I've understanding correctly your goal, you don't actually need the Fragments elements. Just the existence of "top-level" declarations for A, B, and C make them candidates for a document room.
