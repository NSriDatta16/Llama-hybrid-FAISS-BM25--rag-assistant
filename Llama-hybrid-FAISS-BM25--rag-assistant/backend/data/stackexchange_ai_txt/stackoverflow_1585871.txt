Two tables means 40% of your queries have joins and 60% don't have joins. You don't save storage overall. 40% of your queries are slower. 60% of your queries are faster for two reasons. 1) no join. 2) fewer physical data blocks. Is this performance different "important"? Does this make things "better"? Until you more clearly define the time spent on each query -- and run benchmark tests to measure the difference -- it doesn't matter. You have to actually build and measure the performance before you can decide which is "better".
