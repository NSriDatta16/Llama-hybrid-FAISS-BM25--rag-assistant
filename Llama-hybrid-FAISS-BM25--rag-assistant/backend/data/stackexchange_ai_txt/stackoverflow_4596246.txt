You can set an empty onclick handler for the div, but then dragging will be prevented for the entire content of the element, not just the scrollbars. The best approach is to create your own scrollbars or use an existing library out there ( this one , for example). This way, you can apply the appropriate event handlers to the scrollbar controls which will automatically prevent dragging when they are clicked.
