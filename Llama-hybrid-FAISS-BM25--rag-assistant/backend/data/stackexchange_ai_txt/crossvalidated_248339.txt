Can principal component analysis be applied to datasets containing a mix of Ordinal and binary variables?

I'm going to build a PCA for a set of binary variables and a ordinal variable. The binary variables values are 0 & 1 ordinal variable value is in a scale of 1 to 50 Is it possible to do PCA with this data set?
