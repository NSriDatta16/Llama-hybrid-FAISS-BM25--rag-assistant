how to estimate epidemic real infection data from partially observable new infections

I am not a Statistician and I would like to ask for help in understanding how to model the Italian Covid-19 infection data. In particular, in Italy, every day t the number of new detected infections I(t) is reported. Thus a daily time series I(t) is available for a number of months. For instance: Jan 1, 2021 11,000 I(Jan 1, 2021), Jan 2, 2021 10,500 I(Jan 2, 2021), Jan 3, 2021 10,850 I(Jan 3, 2021), and so on. Each I(t) value for a generic day t is the sum of the number of people who feel sick, goes to the hospital to be tested, and result positive, plus the number of their close contacts (relatives/friends) who also test positive. I(t) is not obtained by random sampling over the Italian population. Also I(t) is an under estimate of the real daily infections. Assuming that the number of True Infected people on day t, is represented by TI(t), is it possible to estimate TI(t) from I(t)?
