Discrete-Time Event History (Survival) Model in R

I'm trying to fit a discrete-time model in R, but I'm not sure how to do it. I've read that you can organize the dependent variable in different rows, one for each time-observation, and the use the glm function with a logit or cloglog link. In this sense, I have three columns: ID , Event (1 or 0, in each time-obs) and Time Elapsed (since the beginning of the observation), plus the other covariates. How do I write the code to fit the model? Which is the dependent variable? I guess I could use Event as the dependent variable, and include the Time Elapsed in the covariates. But what happens with the ID ? Do I need it? Thanks.
