Because it is returning a collection of FooImpl while you like it to return a collection of its supertype. You need to define that a bit more explicitly: public class FooImpl implements Foo { /* ... */ } public class Main { public static Collection getList(Class itemClass) { /* ... */ } public static void main(String[] args) { Collection foos = getList(FooImpl.class); } } Update : I had to mention that there's a JLS/javac bug related to this which caused it not to compile when using "plain vanilla" javac. See also javac bug 6369605 , JLS bug 6369608 and this related question . It works fine in Eclipe however. If you insist in using the javac over Eclipse, then your safest bet until the Java guys get it fixed is indeed to manually force the return type in the method call as demonstrated by Colin Hebert.
