In the code fragment below, the numbers are filtered before they are inserted into the vector . The divisors come from the vector. I'm also passing the vector by reference . This means that the huge vector won't be copied from the function to the caller. (Large chunks of memory take long times to copy) vector primes; void calc_primes(vector & primes, const unsigned int MAX) { // If MAX is less than 2, return an empty vector // because 2 is the first prime and can't be placed in the vector. if (MAX This not the most efficient algorithm, but it follows the Sieve algorithm.
