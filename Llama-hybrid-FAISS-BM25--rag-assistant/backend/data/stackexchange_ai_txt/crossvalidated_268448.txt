Before using logistic regression make sure you intensively study the subject. You started the analysis on the wrong foot. A few things to study: keeping continuous variables continuous how to specify interaction terms in the model (and not split the data and fit two models) how to interpret interactions how to determine if $Y$ is truly binary or represents an oversimplification of liver disease severity how to compute the sample size needed for reliable modeling These are covered in my course notes and book - see http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/rms
