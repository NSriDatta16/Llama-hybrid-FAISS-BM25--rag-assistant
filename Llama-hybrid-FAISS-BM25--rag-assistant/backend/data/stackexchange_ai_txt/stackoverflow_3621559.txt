If space is not a constraint and you are not going to have duplicates, go for Set datastructure, in particular Java's HashSet . The power of this data structure is the insertion and deletion are done in O(1) time which would best suit you if performance is 'the' criterion. Moreover, whenever you speak of Arrays besides their fast retrieval, you have the serious limitation of numerous array copies that might happen which not only is going to take up space (for array growth) but also the efficiency will be poor as each of Insert/Delete might take O(n) time.
