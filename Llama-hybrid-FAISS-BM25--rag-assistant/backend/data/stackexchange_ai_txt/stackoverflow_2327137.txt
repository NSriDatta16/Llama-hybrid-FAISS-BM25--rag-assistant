Multiple WCF services referencing the same data contracts

I am building a set of WCF services that share common data contracts (or entities if you prefer). These are simple data transfer objects that are decorated with DataContract and DataMember attributes. I am explicitly specifying the name and namespace. In trying to follow the principles of IDesign's recommendation of averaging 12 members per service contract, I am breaking my service project into multiple services. My data contracts are in a separate assembly that I can provide to our clients if they are using .Net. They can tell their service reference to reuse types in referenced assemblies. However, if they are not using .net and they use 2 services that both use the same entity then they will, I assume, get an ambiguous reference message. I can see this in Visual Studio if I don't reference the data contract dll. My question is, is there anything I can do in my services, or they can do in a client app to get around having to qualify which proxy the data contract came from?
