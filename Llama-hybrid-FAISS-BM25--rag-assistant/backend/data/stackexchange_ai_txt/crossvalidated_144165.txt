1) State 2) Action and then 3) Reward diagram: Which ML approach to use?

It is looks like a reinforcement learning diagram however it's slightly different. I'll explain the numbers. 1) The environment first gives the agent a state 2) The agent does it's magic and then returns an action 3) The environment decides if this action is to be rewarded or punished for that action which depended on the state first sent Is there a ML approach that satisfys this?
