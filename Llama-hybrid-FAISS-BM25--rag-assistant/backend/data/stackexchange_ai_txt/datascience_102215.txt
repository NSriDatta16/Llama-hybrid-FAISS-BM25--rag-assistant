This looks like a sequence labelling problem, the most common such problem in NLP being Named Entity Recognition (NER). You'll find a lot of libraries and tutorials about NER. It can be done with Conditional Random Fields but there are also neural methods nowadays. Assuming your problem is not about standard entities (like persons names, organizations, locations), you'll need to train a custom NER-like model. To do that you will need a large amount of data annotated for your specific task.
