Your question is not properly thought out. There are many different neural network models, but all I know of require a real-valued objective function to optimize for. That means you can't ask that specific question. To maximize $\sum w_i x_i$, simply set $w_i=\infty\cdot sign(x_i)$ or something comparable. A basic neural network training algorithm for the multilayer perceptron network is gradient descent for the objective function, averaged over the training set.
