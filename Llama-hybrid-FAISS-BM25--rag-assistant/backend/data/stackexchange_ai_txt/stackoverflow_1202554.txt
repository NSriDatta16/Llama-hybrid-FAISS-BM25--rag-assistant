You might want to rephrase your question, as the only answers I can conceive aren't too illuminating: Q: What kind of implementation would cause this behaviour? A: One in which user input is allowed to control internal, trusted behavior. If you're asking for "why would someone do this", I've usually seen it as a misunderstanding. The code author generally doesn't realize that the user can (a) control the value and/or (b) even discover it exists. Most often, I've seen this implemented as a redirect - you click a button, the server determines the amount then redirects the browser to a new page that maintains the value Q: How would you modify the page to hide such sensitive parameters from the end user? A: Don't store the value in a manner by which it is editable by the end user. If you have storage available on the server (like a Servlet engine) store it in the session context. If you don't have a good session mechanism, you could store it in a signed or HMAC'd cookie.
