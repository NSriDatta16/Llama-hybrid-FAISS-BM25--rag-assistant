In my experience, the issue of the correlation of predictors / exposures with the random effects only becomes a problem when the correlation is very high - typically in the region of 0.8 or higher. when the cluster sizes are small. when the goal of the analysis is inference rather than prediction. Regarding 1, in healthcare settings, this is fairly implausible. Regarding 2, even with small cluster sizes, mixed models are quite robust as we will see from the simulations below Regarding 3, you specifically mention prediction as the goal of your analyis so again, we will see below that predictions from mixed models with correlated fixed and random effects are not greatly affected by the degree of corelation. It is also worth noting here, that in this kind of applied setting, we are not talking about a problem of confounding - it is mediation. The exposure causes the outcome, and also the group (hospital) assignment, and the hospital has a causal effect on the outcome. So, in a causal framework if we were interested in the total effect of the exposure on the outcome we would not adjust for the hospital effect, either as fixed effects or random effects, but we would do so if we were only interested in the direct effect. Again, if we are interested in prediction instead, rather than inference, then this problem wanes. So here is a simple simulation were we look at varying levels of correlation between an exposure E and grouping variable X from 0.5 to 0.95 and we look at the impact of this on the estimate for E and the mean squared error of predictions: library(MASS) set.seed(15) N So here we see that the estimates for E (simulate with a value of 1) are largely unbiased up to correlations of around 0.8. Even at 0.95 the bias is only 6% Here we see no marked effect on mean squared error of prediction. As mentioned above, small cluster sizes exacerbate the bias. In these simulations each dataset has only 100 observations with 35-40 groups, so the cluster sizes are small. We can easily create more clusters by increasing N to 1000 which results in around 50-60 groups Here we see that the bias is smaller. And here again we see no discernable impact of correlation on mean squared error of prediction. I would encourage you to play around with these or similar simulations, there are many parameters that can be changed, as well as changing the way the data are simulated to better reflect your actual use case.
