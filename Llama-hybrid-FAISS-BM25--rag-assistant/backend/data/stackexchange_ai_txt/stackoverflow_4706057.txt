Add a link to Magento's My Account Page Conditionally

I would like to create a link on the My Account page that only get displays under certain conditions. Right now I have the link display all the time by adding the following entry to my layout XML file: nie nie NIE Admin I am assuming there is a way to code this so that it only displays under certain circumstances.
