CASE inside GROUP BY

How can I selectively choose the columns for group by? Can I use CASE inside it. It compiles alright but doesnt seem to work at run time. example: GROUP BY o.organization_name ol.org_level_name, work_date, CASE WHEN @org_level_type = 'Department' THEN jd.job_code ELSE jd.job_department_id END Thanks.
