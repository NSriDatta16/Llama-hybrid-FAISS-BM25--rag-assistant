If you had more data points and more type categories, then a multilevel/mixed effects model estimated on data A would be the way to go. You could do this with your 12 data points, but this is an exceedingly small amount of data to estimate a multilevel or mixed effects model with. You can do so, but you will want to use a small sample size correction , specifically the Kenward-Roger degrees of freedom: require(lmertest) library(lme4) m1.lmer Even if you had more data points in each type , you only have 3 types. That is a very small number of groups for a multilevel/mixed effects modeling approach. Thus, unless you were prepared to use a Bayesian approach (completely reasonable if you know what you are doing), some people might say that a better frequentist option to use with the long data, what I called dat.A , is to estimate an OLS ( lm ) with a fixed effect of type : m.lm1 In this model, type is a 3 category dummy variable. The coefficient on type is an adjusted mean y value for the plot relative to the hold-out category. It is adjusted based on the plot's x values. The intercept in this case is the adjusted mean value of y or the hold-out category. You could leave out the intercept and get the adjusted mean for each group directly by running the lm model as follows: m.lm2
