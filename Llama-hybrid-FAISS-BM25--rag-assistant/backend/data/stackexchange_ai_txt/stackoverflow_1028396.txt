JavaEE Design ... InfoHolders or direct Database connection?

I am a part of a student programming group an we are programming a social networking site. I have a Session bean and for every User i create a UserInfoHolder Class and my Session bean has an Instance of it. So 1 User = 1 UserHolder Instace = 1 Big Database query .. when logging in. Another Design Approach would be : No Holders. Direct Connection to Database in every Session Bean Method => 1 User = 40 Database queries, no JavaClasses in Backgroud My Question is : Which One is the better Choice ? I think .. having 5000 InfoHolder(5000 Users simultanously logged in) Classes might be a little bit too much. :/ What do you think ?
