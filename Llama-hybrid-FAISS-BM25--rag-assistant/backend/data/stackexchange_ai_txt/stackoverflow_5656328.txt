Passing value from code-behind to Javascript

I am using a jQueryUI ProgressBar to show users how much allowed file storage they have used. The percentage is calculated in code-behind and should be passed to Javascript. Aspx Code $(function () { var pct = document.getElementById("filesPercentage").value; $("#progressbar").progressbar({ value: pct }); }); ... ... Code Behind protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) { filesPercentage.Value = "85"; } It seems like it can't get the percentage number from the hidden field. Any help would be appreciated.
