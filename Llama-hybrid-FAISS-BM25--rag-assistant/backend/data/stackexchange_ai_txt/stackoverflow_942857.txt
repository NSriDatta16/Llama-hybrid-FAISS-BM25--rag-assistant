Does Django development follow the Bazaar Model of development?

Some would argue that Bazaar Model of development can lead to a tangled mess of cowboy code . I'm wondering, which model does Django follow? At first glance it seems to be a highly organized bazaar model, with vetting and triage stages and such. However, the source is available at all times, but not every patch or suggestion gets randomly added to the code base. Likewise, major versions (0.96, 1.0, 1.0.2, 1.1, etc.) are somewhat cathedral in their presentation. Which is it and why?
