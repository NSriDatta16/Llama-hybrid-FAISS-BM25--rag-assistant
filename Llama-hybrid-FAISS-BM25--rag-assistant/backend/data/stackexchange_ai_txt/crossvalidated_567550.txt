Discover a pattern in a set of spectrograms given a real rating

I'm trying to find patterns in a sorted set of spectrograms, each with a rating. The main idea is to train the CNN in such a way that it understands how the pattern "evolves" at each step, taking into account changes in the rating (try to find changes proportional to the rating). I do not fully understand whether such an approach is possible, given that the pattern is not necessarily located locally on the spectrogram and, in fact, can take any form. At the same time, different patterns most likely exist for a different number of steps. The only approach that I found is to use a 3D convolution with a batch of spectrograms. However, then it is not clear what the output values ​​should be. Is it possible to reduce the problem to seq2seq and predict a series of ratings? Or is it better to switch to unsupervised approaches?
