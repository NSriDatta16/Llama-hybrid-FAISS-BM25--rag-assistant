Should navigation logic be in the controller or the view?

In an MVC web app, where is the "right" place to put the code/logic to display a url link to a "next page" navigation control, the controller or the view? If I put it in the view, I have to pass to the view not only the data to be displayed on the current page but also data relating to the next page aka the page id of the next page. If I put it in the controller, the controller has to be aware of the navigation that the particular view is going to display. Neither approach seems very elegant to me. Is there another way?
