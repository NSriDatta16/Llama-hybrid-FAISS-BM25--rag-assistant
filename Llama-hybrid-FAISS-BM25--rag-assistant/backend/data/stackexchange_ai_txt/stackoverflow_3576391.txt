There's a high probability of failure here. It starts with inserting the RTF in the right place. The true problem is likely to be the exact format you generate. Images are embedded OLE objects for RTB, they need a metadata header that describes the object. There is no support whatsoever for this in .NET, OLE embedding went the way of the dodo a long time ago. One thing I know that works is to get an image into an RTB through the clipboard. Like this: private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) { using (var img = Image.FromFile("c:\\screenshot.png")) { Clipboard.SetImage(img); richTextBox1.Paste(); } } Adjust the SelectionStart property as necessary to determine where the image gets inserted.
