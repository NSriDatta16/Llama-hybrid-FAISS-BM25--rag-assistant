How do I reference a file stored in internal storage from a WebView?

I have some files stored in the app's "internal storage", which is located on the device here: /data/data//files/ Here's the problem: I want to reference these files from the webview. How do I do this? What should I use as the baseUrl? I need something similar to file:///android_asset but for "internal storage" instead of for files in the assets directory.
