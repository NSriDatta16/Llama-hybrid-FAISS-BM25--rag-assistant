They do not provide any scientific/mathematical justification for doing so. Most of the developers do not work on this kind of priors, and they prefer to use more pragmatic/heuristic priors, such as normal priors with large variances (which may be informative in some cases). However, it is a bit strange that they are happy to use PC priors, which are based on Entropy (KL divergence), after they started working on this topic. A similar phenomenon happened with WinBUGS , when the developers recommended the $Gamma(0.001,0.001)$ as a non-informative prior for precision parameters since it resembles the shape of the Jeffreys prior. This prior became the default prior for precision parameters. Later, it was shown ( by Gelman! ) that they can be highly informative.
