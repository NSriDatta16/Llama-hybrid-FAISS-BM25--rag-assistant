Well, if the problem is due to NTFS permissions being read-only for the user, there isn't a thing you can do to make the MDB writable. You don't specify where the MDB is stored, on a server or on a local hard drive, but in either case, for a user to have WRITE permissions on the MDB, NTFS permissions have to be set to allow it (for a share on a server, it has to be allowed both on the SHARE and on the underlying file). If it's a local file, the best solution is to make sure that you're storing the file in a location in which user-level logons have full WRITE permission. This would be anywhere in the user profile, and just about nowhere else. That said, I'm not really suggesting that this is the source of your problem (I really can't say one way or the other), just pointing out that if it is the cause, then there's not a damned thing you can do programmatically to work around it.
