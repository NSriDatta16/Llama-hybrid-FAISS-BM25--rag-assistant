You can start with no notion of "support vectors" -- only with the max-margin objective / constraint. Then you run an appropriate optimization procedure to optimize the objective. The SVM constraints are $y_i(w^Tx_i+b) \geq 1$ for all $i$ . After you run your solver, some of these constraints will be "tight" -- the $\geq$ will actually be an exact $=$ . And it is exactly those points which lie on the edge of the margin, and are called "support vectors".
