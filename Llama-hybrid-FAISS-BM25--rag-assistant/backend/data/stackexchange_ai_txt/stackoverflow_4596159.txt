How to detect BlackBerry Model in ASP.NET

Is there a way to detect BlackBerry Model in asp.net, I have made some search on the net but i have not find a solution I try to use userAgent information , but it seem's that the format change from one version to another, for exemple for BlackBerry 8900 , Request.UserAgent = "BlackBerry8900/5.0.0.681 Profile/MIDP-2.1 Configuration/CLDC-1.1 VendorID/-1" for BlackBerry Torche : Request.UserAgent = "Mozilla/5.0 (BlackBerry; U; BlackBerry 9800; en-GB) AppleWebKit/534.1+ (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/6.0.0.141 Mobile Safari/534.1+" Thank's in advance for your Help
