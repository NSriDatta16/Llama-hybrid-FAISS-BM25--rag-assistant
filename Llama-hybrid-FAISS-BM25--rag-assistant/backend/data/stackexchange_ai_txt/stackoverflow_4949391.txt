can Ext JS do snap-to-grid for drag/drop/resize UI?

Currently planning for a time-line application. Each elements on the time line will need to be resizable and draggable with a snap-to-grid positioning similar to jQuery UI's http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/#snap-to http://jqueryui.com/demos/resizable/#snap-to-grid (the snap to 20x20 kinda thing) Is this feature available with Ext JS? Been googling around without any results. Can anyone point me to some examples please?
