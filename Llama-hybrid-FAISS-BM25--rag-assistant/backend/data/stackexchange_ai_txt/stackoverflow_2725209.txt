Cut off text before read more

I have texts that most of the time fit in a div, but sometimes it doesn't fit. There is no way to determine how many characters/words/paragraphs fit in the div, so I can't cut it off that way. The div had a fixed height and width, so can we do something with that? Or do you have any suggestion how to get everything in the div, the correct way?
