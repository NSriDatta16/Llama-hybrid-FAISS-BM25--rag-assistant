One way MANOVA or Two way MANOVA

I have done statistics many times at Uni at both Undergraduate and Postgraduate levels but as they say “if you don’t use it, you lose it” and that is certainly the case. I am trying to assist my daughter in her final year assignment by advising her on which statistical test to use but am getting confused between whether I need a two-way MANOVO and a one way MANOVA (or maybe neither if I am completely off track) and I am not finding any similar examples on the internet when I look to answer my dilemma. Study aim: To investigate the effects of nitrogen on the growth of Salvinia Molesta Outcome and explanatory variables Growth is assessed as change in leaf size and leaf number = 2 dependent variables which are related as an increase in size in linearly related to an increase in leaf number The effect of nitrogen is investigated by looking at two forms of nitrogen (nitrate and ammonium) and for each of these types of nitrogen there are several different concentrations of nitrogen and +/- salt in the growing environment(total conditions tested for each of the nitrogen types = 9 and each condition is tested on 5 plants). I am not sure if there are 2 x IVs or just one. I think it is 2, one for each type of nitrogen being tested- each of which has several levels (concentration of nitrogen source and addition of salt) but if that is the case I cannot work out how to set up the spreadsheet and there will be empty cells. For each nitrogen/growing medium there was 5 samples. Nitrate Ammonium Leaf size Leaf number N1C1T1 x x N1C1T2 x x N1C1T3 x x N1C1T4 x x N1C1T5 x x N2C1T1 x x N2C1T2 x x N2C1T3 x x N2C1T4 x x N2C1T5 x X Etc for each condition and trial Where Nitrate = results for nitrate environment Ammonium = results for ammonium environment C = condition – 1-8 different composition of growing environment T = trial number – 1-5 Which leads me to think there is only one IV - nitrogen, which has 2 types with each type having several levels but this is where it gets too complex for me to know if this is right as I can’t find an example that matches it. For this scenario I would set the spreadsheet up as follows: Condition Leaf size Leaf number N1C1T1 N1C1T2 N1C1T3 N1C1T4 N1C1T5 N1C2T1 N1C2T2 N1C2T3 N1C2T4 N1C2T4 etc etc Where N = nitrogen type – 1 or 2 C = condition – 1-8 different composition of growing environment T = trial number – 1-5 ++ I am not sure if each individual trial result is recorded in the sheet or just the mean of the 5 trials I hope you can provide some guidance. Specifically are you able to advise if MANOVA is the correct test and if so, is there one IV or two IVs and lastly do I record each trials result of only the mean for each condition (average of all 5 trials).
