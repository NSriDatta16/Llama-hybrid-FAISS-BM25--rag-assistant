training's loss/accuracy are not calculated for the whole dataset every time. It is calculated for the current batch and averaged successively. test's loss/accuracy is calculated at the end of an epoch for the whole test data. Check these references Keras FAQ SO Answer You may put the validation data same as the train data to check it. ann=model.fit(x_train, y_train, batch_size=batch_size, epochs=epochs, validation_data=(x_train,y_train)) # Evaluate the trained model print("\n") score = model.evaluate(x_train, y_train, verbose=0) Or, you may write a custom callback to print appropriate logs as suggested in the SO answer.
