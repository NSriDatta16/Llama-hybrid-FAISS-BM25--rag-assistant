I get this exception any time I can't reach the server to make the request. That might be understandable, but I also see this error for any long-running requests, even when I can reach the server. Requests that take longer than 10 seconds consistently cause the client to fail with this exception. It might have something to do with the environment in which Silverlight is running. You state that in IE, the error doesn't occur, but it does in Firefox and Chrome. My application is running out-of-browser. From this I can only assume that the client stack still leverages IE in some way if it is running in IE.
