I don't think it's as necessary to know how a compiler works as it is to continually improving ones knowledge about programming. Now, it just so happens that learning to write a compiler (or the principles behind it) happen to be a great way to expand one's knowledge. If you interested, I would recommend getting the Dragon Book, also known as Compilers: Principles, Techniques and Tools . It may be a bit heavy going the first time, but it will certainly make you think. If you don't make it all the way through or get stuck on some parts, I would suggest shelving it for a bit and returning later - it's much easier to get through the second time around.
