Errors loading tensorflow (.pb) model into c# (Tensorflow.NET)?

I'm new to tensorflow.NET and I am currently following the documentation online ( TF.NET / Example ) to import my trained CNN model from python into c#. So far I've imported my protobuf (.pb) file into c#, but I get errors when trying to set the input and outputs of the model (lines 23 and 24). Unhandled exception. System.Exception: Can not convert a String into a Operation. at Tensorflow.Graph._as_graph_element_locked(Object obj, Boolean allow_tensor, Boolean allow_operation) at Tensorflow.Graph.as_graph_element(Object obj, Boolean allow_tensor, Boolean allow_operation) at Tensorflow.Graph.get_operation_by_name(String name) After looking online it appears to be something to do with multi-threading or parallelism, however, I've yet to find a solution to it. Can someone point me in the right direction? Thanks. Here is my current code implementation:
