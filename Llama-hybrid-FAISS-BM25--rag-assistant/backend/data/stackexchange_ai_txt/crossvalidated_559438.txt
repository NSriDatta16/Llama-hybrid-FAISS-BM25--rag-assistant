Binning time series values

how would you choose bin sizes / the amount of bins for a time series? There seem to be several ways and some academic papers even say that they just chose bins based on visualisation. My time series looks like this: timestamp value 0 2016-01-01 00:00:00+00:00 168.409707 1 2016-01-01 01:00:00+00:00 178.316160 2 2016-01-01 02:00:00+00:00 231.811009 3 2016-01-01 03:00:00+00:00 218.932619 4 2016-01-01 04:00:00+00:00 159.493899 ... ... 8758 2016-12-30 22:00:00+00:00 291.019066 8759 2016-12-30 23:00:00+00:00 275.181294 [8760 rows x 2 columns] standard deviation: 86.979259 min value : 34.635974 max value: 582.499458 mean: 228.99427 Is there a common best practice that is commonly used for time-series binning?
