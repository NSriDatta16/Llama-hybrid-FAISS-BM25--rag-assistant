OK. This is my second attempt at an answer to your fascinating question. I scratched the first one. If I understood the problem correctly, your raw data consist of sets of proportions - you have 7 proportions, representing the distribution of time spent at different depths over a 6 hour period. These vectors of proportions are possibly functions of season, day/night, and maybe other factors. If so, you have a Dirichlet regression. This is a generalized linear model with Dirichlet "errors" - i.e. the response is a vector of proportions adding to 1. The parameters governing the Dirichlet distribution are functions of your covariates. A package has recently been added to R-cran that does this. It's called DirichletReg. It would be a shame to lose sight of the fact that your data are sequential in time. You could fit the Dirichlet regression, allowing for diurnity and seasonality - then plot the residuals against time to see if there are additional time effects. If nothing shows up, then you can ignore the fact that you have a time series. A Dirichlet model, in your case, would let you model the 7 proportions as a function of 7 parameters. It is not super clear how one would relate the 7 parameters to your covariates. Maier offers 2 different approaches in his package. See here There is not a lot of work done on the Dirichlet as a model of interest in its own right. It tends to be used in Bayesian statistics as a prior for the estimation of multinomial parameters. Anyway .... This is bleeding edge stuff. I am sure that Marco Maier, the maintainer of the package, would be happy to hear from you if you have good data that is suitable to his model. His contact information is on r-cran. By the way, just to be clear, I am not talking about the data presented here. You need to go back to your raw data for the Dirichlet Regression. Ignore all that averaging that you did. Just model the stuff directly, as well as you can.
