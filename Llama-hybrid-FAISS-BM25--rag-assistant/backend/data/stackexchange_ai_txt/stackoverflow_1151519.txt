I would suggest learning to program in JavaScript and understanding the various peculiarities of the different DOM implementations, then writing just the code necessary for your application. If you really don't want to have to deal with re-creating all the event handling shenanigans and so on, then nick the relevant techniques from the libraries. You'll learn a lot more about what you're doing that way, as you'll need to actually understand how it all works to be able to integrate those techniques with your application. Having worked professionally with JavaScript since 1996 I, like many, was initially tempted by the apparent ease of use offered by libraries; but if I see one more answer on here that says "use jQuery" (followed by some code that isn't even optimal in jQuery) when the correct answer is to use an existing and well-documented feature of JavaScript that works on every single implementation since Netscape Navigator 3, I'll scream ;-)
