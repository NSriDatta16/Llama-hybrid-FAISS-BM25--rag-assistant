Thanks, radek-k, for the examples! In the meantime I came up myself with a somewhat similar idea, namely I added a static method to the enum to which I then pass the resource-handle during the Activity's onCreate()-method. That allows the toString()-method then to access the resource strings. IMHO not very elegant, but it works... Cheers, Michael
