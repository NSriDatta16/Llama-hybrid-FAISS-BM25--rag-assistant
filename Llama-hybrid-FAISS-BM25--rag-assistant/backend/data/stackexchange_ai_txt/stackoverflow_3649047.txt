I believe the problem is that the your Absolute Positioned box is being set some distance away from the top left corner of your screen, far away enough such that the image doesn't show in the box at all. See if this demo will help: http://jsfiddle.net/9LLwX/2/ Try dragging the box around. Notice that the position of the background never changes, even when the div containing it is moved. Backgrounds with background-attachment: fixed are positioned relative to the viewport.
