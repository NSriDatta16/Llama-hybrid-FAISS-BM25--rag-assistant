Best way to calculate accuracy and display meaningful results

My current method allows me to determine the most accurate array but I cannot figure out a good way to display informative results. Here’s my situation … I compare X amount of integer arrays to a static integer array. For each position in the array I calculate the position’s accuracy result by comparing to the equivalent position in the static array. After the array’s last position accuracy result has been determined I store the sum of all accuracy results for that array for comparison at a later time . Once each array’s sum of all accuracy results has been saved they are compared to one another. The array with the lowest sum is deemed the most accurate . Pseudo code … foreach (ComparableArray as SingleArray) { for (i = 0; i Accuracy is determined by taking the absolute value of the difference of the SingleArray value from the StaticArray and dividing by some constant. If accuracy result is , then the result is deemed accurate. If result > 1 , then it is inaccurate and results = 0 are perfect. Here's a scenario ... let's use two arrays for simplicity S = [ 56, 53, 50, 64 ] A = [ 56, 54, 52, 64 ] B = [ 54, 52, 51, 63 ] Looping through each array starting with A . Compare position [1] of A( 56 ) and S( 56 ) for accuracy. Determine accuracy (I'll use two for my constant) |56-56|= 0 , 0 / 2 = 0 ; Perfect accuracy Continue to compare each position and compute accuracy |53-54|= 1 , 1 / 2 = 0.5 ; Accuracte because |50-52|= 2 , 2 / 2 = 1 ; Accurate |64-64| = 0 ; Perfect Now compute the sum of all accuray results for array A 0 + 0.5 + 1 + 0 = 1.5 If we do the same operations for array B the final result will be 1 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 = 2.5 Now if we compare array A to B we can see that array A is more accurate than B because the sum is lower . The problem is 1.5 and 2.5 are not very meaningful when trying to display how much more accurate A is to B. What would be the best method to display these results? I thought about displaying percentages … such as A is 17% better than B. Or the BestArray is 6% better than average. How would I compute those results? Do you see any logic problems in my way of computing accuracy or know of a better way? Thanks for any insight you can provide!
