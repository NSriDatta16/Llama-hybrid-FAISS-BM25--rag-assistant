Don't try and get too clever and combine pivoting strategies. If you combined median of 3 with random pivot by picking the median of the first, last and a random index in the middle, then you'll still be vulnerable to many of the distributions which send median of 3 quadratic (so its actually worse than plain random pivot) E.g a pipe organ distribution (1,2,3...N/2..3,2,1) first and last will both be 1 and the random index will be some number greater than 1, taking the median gives 1 (either first or last) and you get an extermely unbalanced partitioning.
