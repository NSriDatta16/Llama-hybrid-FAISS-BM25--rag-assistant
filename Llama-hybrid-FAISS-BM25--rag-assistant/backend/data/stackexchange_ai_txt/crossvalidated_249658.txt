I've been dealing with this same issue. Importance rankings change when I randomly stratify on the dependent variable. I looped through 10 to 500 trees random forest models. I get convergence but when I randomly select a training data set the importance rank changed dramatically. So this methodology seems to work well in identifying the top feature selection but it's not stable if you're trying to standardize a methodology for relative importance. Covariance can be measured better in other ways. Random Forests are really good at giving you suggestions. I wouldn't rely solely on a single random forest
