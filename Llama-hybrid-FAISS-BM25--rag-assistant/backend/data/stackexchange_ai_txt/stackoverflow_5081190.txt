How to write a mark_as_deleted method in Ruby on Rails?

I'd like to write a method which should work like the destroy method in any Rails default controller but shouldn’t really delete the data. Rather it should set a flag or something which I can evaluate in my views to not show this data any more. So when the user clicks on ’Delete’ the corresponding action should mark the data as deleted but not purge the data from my database. What’s the most elegant way of writing such a method? I’m using Rails 3.
