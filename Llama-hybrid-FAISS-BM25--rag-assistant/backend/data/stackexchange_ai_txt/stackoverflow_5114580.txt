I'd recommend checking out the OWASP Top 10: http://owasptop10.googlecode.com/files/OWASP%20Top%2010%20-%202010.pdf The OWASP Top Ten provides a powerful awareness document for web application security. The OWASP Top Ten represents a broad consensus about what the most critical web application security flaws are. Project members include a variety of security experts from around the world who have shared their expertise to produce this list. To verify your SSL configuration, you can try https://www.ssllabs.com/ssldb/index.html . If you're curious about the sheer variety of attacks, check out Jeremiah Grossman's post titled Top Ten Web Hacking Techniques of 2010 and scroll down until you see "The Complete List". If you want to fire off a few web app vulnerability scans tools to catch the low hanging fruit you can try: skipfish: http://code.google.com/p/skipfish/ (free) netsparker community: http://www.mavitunasecurity.com/communityedition/ (free) look here for more https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/32/what-tools-are-available-to-assess-the-security-of-a-web-application/ If you're really concerned about security then adopting a secure development plan and working with someone trained in app security would obviously boost your confidence things are being done right. Regarding development, you may like the ideas presented in Microsoft's simplified SDL: "The Security Development Lifecycle (SDL) is a security assurance process that is focused on software development." "The process outlined in this paper sets a minimum threshold for SDL compliance. That said, organizations aren’t uniform – development teams should apply the SDL in a way that is suitable to the human talent and resources available, but doesn’t compromise organizational security goals." Also it is important to note automated vulnerability scan tools fail to identify most logical vulnerabilities so don't rely solely on automated tools. For example (taken from OWASP): "Setting the quantity of a product on an e-commerce site as a negative number may result in funds being credited to the attacker. The countermeasure to this problem is to implement stronger data validation, as the application permits negative numbers to be entered in the quantity field of the shopping cart." Human intelligence is key to spot logical issues. Security is also all about maintenance. Assigning someone or a team the responsibility to astutely play continuous defense is important. Note : Encrypting the passwords doesn't imply infallible security. Dictionary/password lists/brute force attacks work all the time to reveal weak passwords. A very common attack is to use SQL injection to dump the user table (with password hashes) then use a password cracker to discover legitimate user/password pairs.
