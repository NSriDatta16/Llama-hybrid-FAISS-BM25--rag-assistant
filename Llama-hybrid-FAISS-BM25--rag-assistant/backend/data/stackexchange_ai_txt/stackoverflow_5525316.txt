In fact it is fully possible, and we will se such games. We can expect libraries like O3D to take care of the browser quirks. We already have these problems on desktop platforms and libraries takes care of multi-platform portability there. Browser cache can be a slight problem, but not a big one. It is possible to assign more cache to games, and we also have proxy servers like squid that can cache very large resources. If a group of players on a LAN share a proxy server they will also share large resource objects, if the game are well designed (ie the resource cannot have multiple generated names, but be have a common URL for all players.) Also there are discussions about adding local storage possibilities for web applications. And "ready to be hacked" is not a mayor issue. There are nothing to stop hackers from manipulating Flash or C++ applications, anti-cheating tools are already rendered useless. Blizzard is already relying on spotting "bot-like behavour" rather then try more anti-hacking measures. However, I do not think that WoW will be the first flash-based games. In fact it will be Quake (http://playwebgl.com/games/quake-2-webgl/) as there is already a Quake-port for WebGL... There will be web games that makes use of WebGL, but do not count on Blizzard supporting it in the near future. IE is the only browser that does not support WebGL and to be honest that does not matter. All other browsers do, and users will not mind running Chrome or Firefox. Or running both and choose the one that is faster for their game. Who cares of marginalized browsers like IE and Opera. They are equally unimportant. Unless you count IE6 which will never support any of the stuff we are discussing, as it is discontinued and unsupported.
