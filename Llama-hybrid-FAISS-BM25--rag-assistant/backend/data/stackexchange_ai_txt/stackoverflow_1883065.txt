How do I copy an android app to an actual device?

I have written a simple android app and it runs in the emulator. Now how do I actually copy it to my phone? I have HTC's Eris. When I attach it with USB it asks me If I want to mount it as a USB mass storage device. I then see it in my drive list. the directories on the device are: albumthumbs amazonmp3 com.google.android.apps.listen ComicReader data DCIM download media music rosie_scroll Now what should I copy from my Project directory and where should I put it? And is there any other process I need to run to "install" my app?
