What is object-storage wrt cloud computing

I've been googling for ages trying to find information about what object storage is in relation to cloud computing but have been unable to find anything. Can anybody provide any links with succinct overviews of it? Its not the concept of cloud storage in general I'm looking for information on, its specifically object storage, what is object storage and how does it differ from other types of storage.
