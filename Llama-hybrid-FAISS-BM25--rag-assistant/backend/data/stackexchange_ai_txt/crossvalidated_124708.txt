Let's start saying you can use this tool to check whether you answer is correct or not. You should get a confidence interval of $\pm 1.13$. That said, the correct formula to use is: $$\bar x \pm z \frac{s}{\sqrt n}$$ Where the $\bar x$ is your average, the $z$ is a constant, $s$ is the standard deviation and $n$ is your sample size. The $z$ varies depending on the confidence interval you are trying to calculate. In your case, because 99%, $z$ is equal to $2.58$. Plug all the numbers in the equation and you should get 1.130633169350857 which rounded gives you the $\pm 1.13$ I mentioned before. And that's it.
