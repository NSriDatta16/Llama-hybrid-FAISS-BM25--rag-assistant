Just wanted to chime in: you are referring to "obfuscation" not "compilation" since PHP is interpreted. This was said by the other answers. It is a bad idea, generally, to not want to release your source code. This is because instead of forcing your client to rely on you because only you have the source, you should try to get the client to rely on you because you're the smart person who wrote the source in the first place. That said, that's business stuff, and so it it not programming related. Does obfuscation protect your source code? Yes, of course. Your source code is worth something because it does what it's supposed to well. If they deobfuscate, they will also have source that does what it's supposed to well. However, code is also worth money because it is well-organized, well-written and therefore maintainable. Deobfuscated code is never good code, though it does work. It will never be well-written (from a human standpoint) nor maintainable (by humans). So if you've chosen to not release your source to a client, obfuscation is great way to do this.
