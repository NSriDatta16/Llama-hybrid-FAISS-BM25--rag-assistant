Estimators should be judged as normal (so biased estimators are not ruled out), but with appropriate experimental protocols to deal with causality I disagree with some of the other answers here. When conducting causal analysis, there is still a distinction between attempting to make inferences about unknown parameters, and attempting to make predictions for new instances of data (presumably subject to some intervention, since this is causal analysis). This means that we could be conducting causal inference or we could be attempting to predict new outcomes, taking account of causality. In either case, I see no particular reason why we would restrict ourselves to unbiased estimators/predictors, particularly if there are superior estimators/predictors with some bias but much better MSE (or other properties that make them superior estimators). Texts in econometrics include discussion of unbiased estimators and MVUEs, etc., for the same reason that standard statistics books include these --- because they are ueful parts of estimation theory. That does not mean that they are the only admissible estimators, nor that causal analysis has some special requirement to restrict to these estimators. When undertaking causal analysis, the only real difference to regular (non-intervention based) statistical analysis is that we make an effort to make inferences about causal effects that account for the underlying causal structure of the problem (e.g., colliders, confounding, etc.) and we impose additional experimental protocols to sever certain problematic causal effects that might exist (e.g., confounding) to allow us to interpret statistical associations as causal effects. Aside from that, all of the standard distinctions and principles of statistics apply to the estimation of the underlying model from the data. An unbiased estimator is not always a superior estimator, and when you compare it to a estimator with small bias but much smaller MSE, the unbiased estimator will usually be further away from the true parameter of interest (i.e., it will usually have more error ). There may be cases when an available unbiased estimator has poor performance (e.g., high MSE) but another available biased estimator has good performance (e.g., low bias, low MSE), but to be clear, neither do we need to choose the estimator with minimum MSE; all estimators should be on the table and should be considered based on the totality of their properties and relevant trade-offs. On this matter, it is also noteable that if biased estimation were ruled inadmissible in causal analysis, this would effectively rule out Bayesian methods in this field. Bayesian estimators are almost always biased, due to the incorporation of prior information. Nevertheless, Bayesian models are known to have many good estimation properties --- their estimators are admissible, consistent (under correct model specification), and they incorporate prior information according to the principles of probability. Estimators from Bayesian analysis (e.g., the posterior mode) may have superior performance to unbiased estimators in various circumstances.
