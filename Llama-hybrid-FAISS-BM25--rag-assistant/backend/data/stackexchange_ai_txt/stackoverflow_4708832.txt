I think there are two approaches to what you want to accomplish: Simply cache with fragments and actions so that on the first hit of the page the database is accessed and the page loads normally, but every subsequent hit is from the cached version. The major upside of this approach is that you don't need to deal with delayed jobs and rendering your pages outside of the regular flow of things. Create a delayed job that renders your page or the individual fragments that get cached. During the rendering in the delayed job the page fragments will actually get cached as if a user were viewing them (provided you have implemented fragment and action caching normally). Once the delayed job is done, populate a column in your database that indicates that this record/page is ready for viewing.
