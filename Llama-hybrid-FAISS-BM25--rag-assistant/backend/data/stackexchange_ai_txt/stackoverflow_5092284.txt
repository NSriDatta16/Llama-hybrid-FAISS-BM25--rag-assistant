Android project Refactor greyed out

I renamed a project in Eclipse via 'Refactor > Rename' as suggested in this answer . I now want to rename it again, but the Refactor menu has only one menu item now (Android > Extract Android String...) which is also greyed out! I am using Eclipse 3.6.1 with the latest Android SDK 9. Why is that and how to I restore this to normal? Update (1): After following Sankar Ganesh's suggestion (selecting a string), the Refactor menu appeared again. I then selected the Rename... menu item again and I received the following error message box: This is much better than the previous situation, in which I had no idea why the Refactor menu had been disabled and what to do. Still, I don't understand why this is and what rules I should follow when using the Refactor function. I only wanted to rename a project... that's all. :) Update (2): I just tried the same exact operation again again (Refactor > Rename while the project is selected in Project Explorer) and it worked! (without issuing the message box shown above). What's going on? Must be a bug, because this is clearly inconsistent .
