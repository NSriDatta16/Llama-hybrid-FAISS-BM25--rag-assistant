robust::glmRob (method 'mallows') vs robustbase::glmrob (method 'Mqle') - very different estimates

I want to apply a robust logistic regression in R and I tried the functions robust::glmRob (using the method mallows ) and robustbase::glmrob (method Mqle , which fits a generalized linear model using Mallows or Huber type robust estimators, according to the authors). I don't understand much about those estimators, but I would assume that the estimates would be similar. However, I came quite surprised with the results I get with each function for the same model. Using robust::glmRob : rm1 |z|) (Intercept) 0.4245 0.4189 1.0133 0.3109 X1 0.1621 0.4646 0.3489 0.7272 X2 -0.1290 0.4700 -0.2745 0.7837 X3 -0.4512 0.4891 -0.9225 0.3563 X4 0.5052 0.5248 0.9626 0.3358 X5 -0.2555 0.4867 -0.5249 0.5997 X6 -0.1752 0.4476 -0.3914 0.6955 (Dispersion Parameter for binomial family taken to be 1 ) Null Deviance: 30.97 on 27 degrees of freedom Residual Deviance: 29.33906 on 21 degrees of freedom Number of Iterations: 4 Correlation of Coefficients: (Intercept) X1 X2 X3 X1 0.057559 X2 -0.040466 -0.144392 X3 -0.012770 0.013950 0.272322 X4 0.125793 0.027971 -0.003343 -0.170828 X5 0.008357 -0.128829 -0.125688 0.281676 X6 -0.006110 -0.030635 -0.037557 0.162867 X4 X5 X1 X2 X3 X4 X5 0.015556 X6 -0.049577 0.359670 car::vif(rm1) X1 X2 X3 X4 X5 1.061469 1.183564 1.282676 1.044061 1.324446 X6 1.157015 Using robustbase::glmrob : rbm1 |z|) (Intercept) 86.29 608.89 0.142 0.887 x1 179.83 1291.67 0.139 0.889 x2 -90.82 661.93 -0.137 0.891 x3 -78.10 562.45 -0.139 0.890 X4 104.47 763.18 0.137 0.891 X5 -111.49 799.05 -0.140 0.889 X6 28.25 219.70 0.129 0.898 Robustness weights w.r * w.x: 4 observations c(4,5,15,28) are outliers with |weight| Some questions: Why are the estimates (and vif) so different? How to know each one is the better method? It is possible that the number of IV (n=6) are too much for such a small sample (n=28)? I'm so confused that any explanation would be appreciated Any help is appreciated!
