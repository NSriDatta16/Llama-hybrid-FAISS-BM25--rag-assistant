This is a job for ordinal regression, which seeks to find the relationship between an ordinal outcome and a set of predictors of any scale. The most common example is ordinal logistic regression, which models the log odds of being in the next higher category as a linear function of the predictors. See BÃ¼rkner and Vuorre (2019) for a tutorial.
