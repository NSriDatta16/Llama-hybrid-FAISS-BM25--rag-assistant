You could always write up some code that opens a connection to your server and time it. Something like: StopWatch timer = new StopWatch(); timer.Start(); for(int i=0;i That would get the average time to open and close 100 connections. Note, I did not run the above code EDIT: Disabled connection pooling per Richard Szalay's comment. Otherwise, the results would be skewed
