Removing the Label From Django's TextArea Widget

How do I remove the label that comes attached to the TextArea I am trying to use with Django? I'm trying to find ANY information about this issue but I cannot seem to find anything relating to my problem. This is what I'm doing in my code: class CommentForm(forms.Form): comment = forms.CharField(widget=forms.Textarea()) This is the HTML that it produces: Text: That label is no good and I'd like a way to remove it. That code was produced via: {{ form.as_p }} (I removed the paragraph tags because they are irrelevant) EDIT: I added the class CommentForm part for further clarification. Anyone have any suggestions?
