I have calculated the correlation coefficient between the series. However, for significance test I want to calculate the effective degrees of freedom. How to calculate the effective number of degrees of freedom for this data? Bivariate normality assumption . Putting aside for a moment both the time-series and the "effective degrees of freedom" issues, a standard t-test of the Pearson correlation coefficient wouldn't be appropriate here. That test assumes bivariate normality of the two variables. Many precipitation values are 0 and they cannot be negative, so you can't make that normality assumption about precipitation. As an example, I obtained 10 years' data starting from 2012-08-21 at Houston International Airport (IAH) via NOAA . Under an independence assumption, the Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.04 was "statistically significant" at p = 0.017, but the Kendall correlation test (under the same independence assumption but not assuming bivariate normality) showed p = 0.56. For this particular application, the normality assumption might be much more of a problem than the "effective degrees of freedom." Stationarity . As @ClosedLimelikeCurves correctly notes, the notion of "effective degrees of freedom" or "effective sample size" (ESS) strictly holds only for stationary data (constant distribution over time). When you work with time series data you need to understand the issues and use appropriate tools. The Hyndman and Athanasopoulos text and its associated fpp3 and fable packages in R provide a good way to start. Effective sample size (ESS) . Even when an ESS value is appropriate you can't always use it as a simple correction for significance testing. Thiébaux and Zwiers examined this problem decades ago. They noted: regardless of the extent of time coherence, a sample of N observations from any nonsingular Gaussian stochastic process has N degrees of freedom. A suitable linear transformation of the observation vector, for which the transformation is determined by the covariance structure of the process, has N independent components. The phrase "effective sample size" is less troublesome; it manages to convey the notion that the N pieces of information are "smeared" across the N observations by the time durations of their influences. They evaluated several ways to estimate the ESS for a stationary process.* When you find the ESS, however, you can't always plug that into the degrees of freedom for a t-test and get a valid result. Thiébaux and Zwiers illustrated this with simulated data, and showed why in their Appendix. It is possible to use the ESS to estimate the variance of the estimate of sample mean. A t-test, however, assumes that the numerator (normal distribution) and denominator (chi-square distribution) are statistically independent. To meet that assumption with serially correlated data you must take the variance/covariance matrix of the data into account. What is the correlation estimating ? This page describes why it can be difficult to interpret correlations between time series. This page and this page discuss the related issue of so-called "spurious correlation." Read those pages to see how, depending on the situation, a correlation between time series can be anywhere between completely misleading and highly informative. In your situation, there are presumably underlying seasonal patterns and long-term trends, around which there is random variability that might in turn be correlated in time. You might, for example, be most interested in long-term trends after subtracting out seasonal patterns and accounting for the time-correlated random variability. Tools for time-series analysis can allow you to tease apart those three contributions to the observations in a way that is much more informative than just calculating the raw correlation between the series. H. J. Thiébaux and F. W. Zwiers, " The Interpretation and Estimation of Effective Sample Size ," Journal of Climate and Applied Meteorology 23(5): 800-811, 1984. *As the page recommended by @usεr11852 illustrates, even today there isn't complete agreement about how to do this. The papers to which you linked are for evaluating spatial degrees of freedom, not temporal.
