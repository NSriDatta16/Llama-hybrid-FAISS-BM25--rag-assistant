Serializing OpenCV Mat_

I'm working on a robotics research project where I need to serialize 2D matrices of 3D points: basically each pixel is a 3-vector of floats. These pixels are saved in an OpenCV matrix, and they need to be sent over inter-process communication and saved into files to be processed on multiple computers. I'd like to serialize them in an endian/architecture-independent, space-efficient way, as quickly as possible. cv::imencode here would be perfect, except that it only works on 8-bit and 16-bit elements, and we don't want to lose any precision. The files don't need to be human-readable (although we do that now to ensure data portability, and it's incredibly slow). Are there best practices for this, or elegant ways to do it? Thanks!
