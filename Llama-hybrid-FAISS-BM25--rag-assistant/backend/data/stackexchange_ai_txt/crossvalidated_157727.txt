Meaning of MATLAB logistic regression coeficients

Suppose that I'm using this function to implement logistic regression in MATLAB R2015a : [coefs,~,stats] = glmfit(TrainInputs,TrainTargets,'binomial','logit'); % Logistic regression I have ten continues inputs and a binary output (1 and 0). This is the coefs output of above function: coefs = 2.04869088486007 -4.66230054501349 0.355690380077187 -1.87230109681715 6.85763253382301 3.46437006313075 -0.282766819896174 -1.08763387246821 -1.94250600133904 1.46621342829667 -2.83661766065114 What is meaning of the coefs in logistic regression of MATLAB ? Suppose that input names are X1 to X10 . If we have 1 % increase in X1 , We have -4.66% increase in probability of being class 1 ?
