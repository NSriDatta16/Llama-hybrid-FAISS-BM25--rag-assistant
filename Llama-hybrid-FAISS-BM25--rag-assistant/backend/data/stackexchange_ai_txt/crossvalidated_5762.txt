What logistic regression is best to use?

My project is about whether early language scores (on a reading task) can predict later scores on a social attribution task. I have to conduct a logistic regression for my project but I am stuck on which one is appropriate. This is because I have conducted a binary logistic and multinomial logistic regression but I always get warnings and I do not know what to do. Any help will be much appreciated. It's just that my supervisor specifically instructed me to use a logistic regression, sorry I forgot to add that there are three groups involved autism, language impaired and typically developing kids and I need to look at whether langauge scores of the autistic kids and language impaired kids are also a signifcant predictor of scoring low on a social attribution task in later life. Please can you help with this??
