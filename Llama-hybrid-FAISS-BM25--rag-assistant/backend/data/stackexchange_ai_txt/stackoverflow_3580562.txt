It's definitely possible. This is a really nicely organized tutorial that walks you through the XmlHttpRequest object, how to set it up, and how to consume it on the server. The server-side code is PHP, and I'm more of a C# guy, and it made total sense to me. (Maybe I should switch to PHP??). I hope this helps! Good luck. EDIT: In response to a previous SO question, I put this jsfiddle together to demo how to use XmlHttpRequest. Hope this also helps.
