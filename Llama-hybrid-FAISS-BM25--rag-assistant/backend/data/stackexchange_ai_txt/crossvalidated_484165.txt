Appropriate effect size to report for permutation tests (Anova specifically)

Original question, with explanation of outcome and explanatory variables included. Suppose I have a neuroimaging dataset, e.g. diffusion tensor-derived measure for multiple white matter bundles (or tracts) of interest, that I wish to compare between two groups while controlling for biological factors such as age. The outcome variables are: Tract Volume, Fractional Anisotropy (FA), Mean diffusivity (MD), Radial Diffusivity (RD), and Axial Diffusivity (AD). FA quantifies the degree of anisotropy of diffusion in a given voxel (0 for completely isotropic diffusion, 1 for completely anisotropic). MD, the average of all 3 Diffusion Tensor eigenvalues, quantifies “bulk diffusion” in a voxel. RD, the average of the 2nd and 3rd eigenvalues, quantifies average “perpendicular diffusivity” in a given voxel. Finally, AD, the value of the first eigenvalue, quantifies the amount of “parallel diffusion” in a given voxel. FA, MD, RD, and AD values are derived from quantitative maps, averaged across the entire tract of interest. Explanatory variables are: Measure quantifying in-scanner motion, Version of the MRI acquisition protocol used (categorical, 2 levels), De-meaned age at scan, and Diagnostic status (categorical, 2 levels). A sizeable portion of the models I run have either non-normal residuals or display heteroskedasticity. Therefore, I chose to run permutation Anova/Ancova. I wish to additionally report an effect size. Would partial eta squared be appropriate for permutation Anova/Ancova, or is there a more suitable (non-parametric?) effect size I can report? Addressing specific comment: I am running an Ancova model using the formula: 1 + Motion + Protocol + Age_centered + Diagnosis. I have 14 tracts (white matter bundles) of interest, of which I have 5 dependent measures for, so 70 individual Ancova models are ran. Around 10-25 models display either nonnormal residuals or heteroskedasticity. I experimented with weighted least squares and Anova/Ancova with white-correction as well. I finally decided on permutation Anova/Ancova, which a colleague suggested I do for all other models.
