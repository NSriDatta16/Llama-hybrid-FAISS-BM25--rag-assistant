Label X Axis in Time Series Plot using R

I am somewhat new to R and have limited experience with plotting in general. I have been able to work get my data as a time series object in R using zoo, but I am having a hard time having the xaxis be labeled correctly, if it all. When I plot my zoo object plot(z) The x-axis only shows one label, the year 2010. when the series is weekly spanning from April 2009 to October 2010. I tried to convert my series back to a ts object, and even a data frame (only one column and doesn't include the dates). Simply, how can I control the x-axis labels generally, and with time series objects? Thanks in advance!
