Here's how I did it: Got a Mac, started using it as my primary off-hours workstation for experimental side projects: iPhone apps, Automator scripts, Cocoa stuff, Ruby. Installed Mono on MacOS, started writing the ASP.net stuff I was already comfortable with in the Unix environment. Little by little, I began to use Windows less. I made sure all of my .net projects were Mono-compliant, so I could shuttle code back and forth between the platforms. Profit? It's not so much about how you learn Unix as it is how do you, a regular person with a full-time job and a life, slowly wade into Unix without going insane.
