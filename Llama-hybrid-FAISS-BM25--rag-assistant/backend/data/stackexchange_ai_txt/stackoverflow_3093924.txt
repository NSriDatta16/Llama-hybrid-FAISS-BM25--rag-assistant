Select all months within given date span, including the ones with 0 values

I'm trying to write a MySQL query to get an average value per month, for all months between to given dates. My idea is this: Query, something like SELECT AVG(value1) as avg_value_1, AVG(value2) as avg_value_2, MONTH(save_date) as month, YEAR(save_date) as year FROM myTable WHERE save_date BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-07-01' GROUP BY YEAR(save_date), MONTH(save_date) avg_value_1 | avg_value_2 | month | year 5 | 4 | 1 | 2009 2 | 1 | 2 | 2009 7 | 5 | 3 | 2009 0 | 0 | 4 | 2009 You see, no values were entered during April 2009, yet i want it to show up as a 0, 0 value in output. Any ideas on how to achieve this? Can it be done within MySQL?
