"inputstring" is just a char * - it is unassigned, and has no storage associated with it. You have to pass it a pointer to an array of sufficient size, of use the "a" modifier and pass a pointer to a pointer to a char for scanf to allocate for you. See the man page on scanf http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man3/scanf.3.html
