I would try www.oscmax.com - it is a osCommerce fork which has all of the functionality most shop owners would need. There is a new release coming out now (currently Release Candidate going through final testing and bug fixing) Why oscmax? It is truely open-source ... no purchasing of extra modules etc. The 6,000+ modules coded for osCommerce will install into it which gives the average user an almost unlimited ability to tailor the store to their specific needs. Friendly and active forums and an active development cycle. I would avoid Magento - it has a very complex code structure (especially the templates) and is very resource hungry (you will need a dedicated server to run it). PrestaShop and OpenCart are probably the next best but I prefer to use the work already done on the osCommerce community and not having to pay for additonal module (which tend to come with very poor support) So all in all - I would give www.osCmax.com a go ... test the new v2.5 RC1 not the old version.
