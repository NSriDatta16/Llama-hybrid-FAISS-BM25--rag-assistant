website structure and division? Who plans that?

I want to know, In an organization who handles planning of the website structure and function for every section? What are the Steps or Workflow? I am sometime amaze with big sites that are well structure and is easy to access. As a freelance designer I have created some small sites but doesn't really need a big planning. The client just give me the section they need or they suggest then I give them how I would think divide them. I need some advice how to structure a website. Here are some of my question in my head: How do you plan the navigation structure and divide the pages while keeping in mind that It's should be accessible and would fit to the design? (Is there a tips you can give?) My problem sometimes, A client will give me a long and descriptive title for the a menu and wouldn't fit to design? how do you deal with that? Is there a freelance person for this job? (you just give them the scenario and they will plan for that) Some sites/book you can recommend worth reading? Thank You!
