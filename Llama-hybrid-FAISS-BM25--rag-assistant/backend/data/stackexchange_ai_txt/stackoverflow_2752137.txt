How to extend methods to a class not to its instances

Extending methods to any instance is really easy: public static string LeaveJustNumbers(this string text) { return Regex.Replace(text, @"[\D]", ""); } ... string JustNumbers = "A5gfb343j4".LeaveJustNumber(); But what if i want to extend methods to a sealed class like string, to work like: string.Format("Hi:{0}","Fraga"); Is there any way to do it?
