Why not put that fragment in a standalone Widget created via UiBinder? (if you know how the structure will look beforehand and just want to insert MyLabel and a TextBox ) Don't be afraid to split your widgets like this - the GWT Compiler is great at optimizing and UiBinder templates are processed at compile time so there shouldn't be any performance penalty (benchmarking is still strongly recommended - YMMV). I'd even say that it'd be faster then trying to add this structure via the DOM package - with UiBinder, the compiler knows what it's dealing with, with DOM you are basically saying: "I know what I'm doing, don't touch my code!" (at least that's my view on this :)). HTMLPanel could be an alternative, but you'd have to assign an id to every element you want to modify/attach stuff to... :/ Bottom line: use UiBinder for this, that's what it was built for.
