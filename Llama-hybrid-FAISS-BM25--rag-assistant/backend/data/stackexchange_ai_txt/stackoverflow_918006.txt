Internal SMTP relay

internally, our organization limits what servers and applications can send emails. I would like to be able to have scripts that could be run on any server send an email when done. Is it possible to install IIS SMTP on a single server and have that relay all mail the servers send to our standard relay servers? All the advice I see on the internet talks about configuring relays for outbound connectivity, but this would be for internal use only. the flow would be something like this, I believe [any server] --> My SMTP relay --> corporate SMTP relay --> Internal Mail system Is this doable? if so, any links on how to configure? I have nearly zero SMTP knowledge.
