The proportional hazard model assumes hazard rates of the form: $h(t|X) = h_0(t) \cdot risk(X)$ where usually $risk(X) = exp(X\beta)$ . The xgboost predict method returns $risk(X)$ only. What we can do is use the survival::basehaz function to find $h_0(t)$ . Problem is it's not "calibrated" to the actual baseline hazard rate computed in xgboost . What we can do is find some constant $C$ that minimizes the ibrier score between the sample observed death/censorship times and $h_0(t) \cdot risk(X) \cdot C$ . I've implemented this approach in a tiny R package I've written .
