pragma and including headers/libraries

VS C++ 2008 I am just working through a DirectX tutorial. In the source code had this line: #pragma comment (lib, "d3d9.lib") When I compiled everything linked ok. However, I commented out this line and tried to include the header and library myself under properties, like this: C/C++ - General Additional include directories: "C:\Program Files\Microsoft DirectX SDK (August 2009)\Include" Linker - General Additional library directories: "C:\Program Files\Microsoft DirectX SDK (August 2009)\Lib\x64" Linker - Input: d3d9.lib However, I got this linker error: 1>main.obj : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol _Direct3DCreate9@4 referenced in function _initD3D However, when I just use the pragma I didn't get any linker errors. Only when I try and include them with the properties as above. What is the real difference in using pragma and including the header/libraries using the properites? Many thanks,
