How to Use Neural Networks to Forecast Time Series Data with Predictor Variables?

I have browsed a lot of topics here, but the ones I see were all about forecasting a single variable, depending on its historical values. Whereas I want to predict a variable, by estimating a relationship between multiple predictor variables as well. So I'm trying to find a function $f(x_1,x_2, ... , x_p) = y$ -How- Can I apply a neural network approach for such a task? If not, what alternatives can I use for this? Edit : I am trying to implement this in MATLAB, so I would really appreciate some MATLAB implementation of such methods.
