Some ideas: rolling average instead of plotting the number of posts plot the time (or rolling mean time) between posts if it's something that may have an annual / seasonal component, try plotting it on a circular / spiral plot where r is the datum and theta is the month, day of month, day of year, or whatever scaled appropriately. Some interesting things to plot for r might be number of posts in an interval cumulative posts (giving you a spiral) length of post, (giving each theta it's own exact value, not aggregating) you might also want to look at a scatter plot, with something like length of post on x, time since prior post + time to next post on y, and the age of the datum as the size, gray level or color of the point (fading out the oldest ones)
