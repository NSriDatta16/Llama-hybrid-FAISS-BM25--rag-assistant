Causal Network Graph

I've been reading this blog ( https://deepmind.com/blog/article/Causal_Bayesian_Networks ) and am just getting into Causal inference. I have a question regarding causal network graphs. Let's say given data, how exactly are causal network graphs generated? How does it know which features are causal to other features?
