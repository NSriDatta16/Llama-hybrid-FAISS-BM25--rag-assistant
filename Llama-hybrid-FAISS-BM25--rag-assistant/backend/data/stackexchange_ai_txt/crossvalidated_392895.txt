Regarding your questions: 1.) No, only stationary time series have invertible AR polynomials, and 2.) the AR(1) model is stationary iff the polynomial $\phi(z) = 1-\phi z$ doesn't have a root equal to plus or minus $1$ . For higher-order AR(p) models, with $p > 1$ , this $z$ can be a complex number. But in the case of an AR(1), this condition is the same as $\phi$ not being equal to plus or minus $1$ . As long as this isn't true, there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that $\frac{1}{\phi(z)} = \sum_{j=-\infty}^{\infty} \phi^j z^j$ for all $1 - \delta , and $$ \sum_{j=-\infty}^{\infty} |\phi|^j This condition is called absolute summability, and it is needed to even define linear processes. Why? Intuitively, you can see that if $\phi = \pm 1$ , then the above sum wouldn't be finite, and it doesn't make sense to write $$ \lim_{n \to \infty} X_t^n = \lim_{n \to \infty}\sum_{j=-n}^{n} \phi^j \epsilon_{t-j} = \sum_{j=-\infty}^{\infty} \phi^j \epsilon_{t-j}. $$ The limit would not exist in either the mean square sense or the almost-surely sense.
