What is the Bayesian counterpart to a two-sample t-test with unequal variances?

I am looking for the bayesian counterpart of the two-sample t-test with unequal variances (the Welch test). I am also looking for a multivariate test, like Hotelling's T statistic. References appreciated. For the multivariate case, suppose that we have $(y_1,\cdots,y_N)$ and $(z_1,\cdots,z_N)$, where $y_i$ (resp $z_i$) is a shortcut for a sample mean, sample standard deviation and number of points. We can assume that the number of points is constant across the whole dataset, the standard deviation the same for all $y_i$ (resp $z_i$) and that the sample means of the $y_i$ (resp $z_i$) are correlated. If you plot the sample means, they follow each other and by connecting them, you get a smooth varying function. Now on some parts the $y$ function agrees with the $z$ function, but on others it doesn't, because $\frac{mean(y_i)-mean(z_i)}{std(y_i)+std(z_i)}$ becomes big. I would like to quantify this statement.
