Here you go... public void Gridview1_RowCommand(Object sender, GridViewCommandEventArgs e) { lblStatus.Text = e.CommandName; } I see that there is more to this question than is answered here, bear with me. One way would be to delegate the OnCommand event of each button to its designated event handler, as follows: '/> public void MyWinButton_OnCommand(Object sender, CommandEventArgs e) { var label = ((Button)sender).Parent.FindControl("MyStatusLabel") as Label; label.Text = e.CommandName; } Also, as Alison suggests, you won't see the desired output of this unless you use !IsPostBack in Page_Load . Furthermore, on doing so this does in fact enable you to use the one row command event handler as initially suggested, albeit with a slight change in the label retrieval: public void MyGridView_OnRowCommand(Object sender, GridViewCommandEventArgs e) { var label = ((Button)e.CommandSource).Parent.FindControl("MyStatusLabel") as Label; label.Text = e.CommandName; }
