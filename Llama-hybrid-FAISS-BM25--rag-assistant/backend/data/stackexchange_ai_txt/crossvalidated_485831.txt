I am going to assume your dataset also has descriptive variables of the products and cities? You should have, for each city, variables related to demographics and population, for example ratio males/females, distribution across age groups, education level, etc etc (there may be more specific variables that make sense to add that I can't 'guess' because I don't know what are your products); for each product, you should have variables descriptive of the product (I am not going to give suggestions of examples of these variables, as those require prior knowledge of the product and, therefore, you have to be the one to define them. Then, you can train a model that allows you to analyze the relationship / weight of each variable to the output (the two models I've used that allow you to do this are Random Forest and Partial Least Squares, but I'm sure there are many more).
