If this is a many-to-many link table, just use (col1, col2) as a PK . Foreign keys in MySQL imply InnoDB which is index-organized, this means that the table itself will be the PRIMARY KEY and it's records will be ordered. If you are also going to search for col2 and use col1 in joins, you'll need to create an additional secondary index on (col2) . This index will implicitly include the PRIMARY KEY values as the record pointers, and, hence, will in fact be and index on (col2, col1, col2) .
