How reliable must a regressor be for data imputation?

I have a dataset that seemingly has missingness not at random and am thinking on using regressor to fill the missing values. I know that complete case analysis is on the table; however almost 20% observations of the variable of interest is missing and therefore excluding them entirely seems to be a bad choice. I run Random Forest for this and obtain R-squared score of 0.82, which is pretty high. However, I'm not sure whether this will be adequate enough to fill the missing data. Any opinion on this?
