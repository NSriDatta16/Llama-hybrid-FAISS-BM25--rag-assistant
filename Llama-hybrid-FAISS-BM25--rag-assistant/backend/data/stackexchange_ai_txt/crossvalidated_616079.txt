Can we estimate ATE (average treatment effect at the population level) using both marginal or conditional models?

If I understood correctly, in principle when we estimate an unconditional/unadjusted treatment effect, it means marginal effect and vice-versa. If so, I wonder if the average treatment effect (ATE) at the population level is the marginal effect estimate only? Can we estimate also conditional ATE by conditioning on covariates. I searched a variety of resources, but still not sure about these. So, I really appreciate your clarity. I look forward to receiving your support.
