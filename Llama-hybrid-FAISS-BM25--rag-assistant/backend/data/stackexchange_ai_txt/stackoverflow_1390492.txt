Is there a way you can partition the data, ie return a small subset of it? If there's no absolute requirement to return all the data at the same time, then dividing up the data into smaller pieces will make a huge difference when reading from the database, serializing, and transporting through the webservice. Edit: I had deleted this answer since you already mentioned partitioning. I'm undeleting it now, maybe it will serve some use as the starting point of a discussion... As for your point about how to work with paging: I think you're on the right track with the "Show next 100 results" approach. I don't know how XtraReport works, and what its requirements for a datasource are. There are 3 issues I see: Server support for partitioned data (eg your webservice should support returning just "page 3"'s data Summary Data - does your report have a row of totals or averages? Are those calculated by the XtraReport control? Does it require a complete dataset to display those results? Can you provide the summaries to the control on your own (and find a more efficient way to calculate them without returning the entire data set?) XtraReport support for a datasource that uses paging.
