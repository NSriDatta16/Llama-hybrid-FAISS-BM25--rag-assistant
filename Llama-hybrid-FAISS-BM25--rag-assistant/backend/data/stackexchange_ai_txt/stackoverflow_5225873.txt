opencv build problem ("_cvLoadImage", referenced from)

I am trying to integrate opencv into my project and I am having problems. I have installed opencv on my mac and have added libopencv_imgproc.dylib, libopencv_highgui.dylib and libopencv_core.dylib which i am instructed to do so by this webiste :- http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/Mac_OS_X_OpenCV_Port under the title :- Using the OpenCV libraries in an Xcode OS X project (opencv 2.1 since SVN r3060) The header search paths has also been set and that does not seem to be an issue as I am able to import the individual header files. However when i try to build the project I am getting this error:- "_cvLoadImage", referenced from: that is associated with:- IplImage *imagetest = cvLoadImage("background.png",1); Now I am beginning to think it may be to do with the operating system (32 or 64 bit) or the version of opencv/xcode but I am unsure. The project is for an iPhone/ipodTouch and is therefore in objective c. Has anybody had this problem? and if so how was it solved.
