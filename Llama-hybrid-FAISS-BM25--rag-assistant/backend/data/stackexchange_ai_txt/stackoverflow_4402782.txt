For AJAX you might find FirePHP for Magento helpful. For all situations you can use Mage::log() as long as you remember to turn it on first in System > Configuration > Developer . It works a lot like print_r except it outputs to /var/log/system.log . I often tailf that file and have code like this in lots of places: Mage::log(__METHOD__); // prints My_Module_Model_Class::method Mage::log($object->debug()); // $object is any model or block descending from Varien_Object
