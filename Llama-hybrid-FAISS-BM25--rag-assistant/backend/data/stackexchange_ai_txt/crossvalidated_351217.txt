Interpreting logistic regression results when explanatory variable has multiple levels

When an explanatory variable in logistic regression is binary, the interpretation is relatively straightforward. For example, when your response variable is college admission (binary: yes or no) and explanatory variable is gender (with two levels: female and male), you can say that being male increases (or decreases) the odds of being admitted by a factor of n, holding other variables constant. But what is the explanatory variable has multiple levels / categories? For instance, your response variable is college admission, but explanatory variable is ethnicity (with levels: Caucasian, African_American, Hispanic, and Asian). R (or any other software) will still run the model, automatically choosing one one of the levels as reference (in R it will be African_American unless specified otherwise). The results will tell us how not being African_American (or vide versa) affects the odds of admission, but says nothing for being Causasian, Hispanic, or Asian. What's the best way of dealing with this problem? Should one create dummy variables for each ethnic group, or is there a better way?
