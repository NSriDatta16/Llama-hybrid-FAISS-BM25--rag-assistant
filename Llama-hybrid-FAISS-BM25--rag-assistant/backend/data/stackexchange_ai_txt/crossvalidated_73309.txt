Propensity Score

What are the various methods used for binary classification other than logistic regression? What are the advantages of logistic reg. model in developing Propensity score w.r.t. other methods? Actually I have been asked why? I backed it by saying its binary classification, so logit is perfect. Then I was asked why specifically logistic regression when there are various other binary classification methods?
