This is solved by using a GUID for the PK instead of a auto-incrementing int. This guarantees that each row inserted by the server or any client will be unique and works very well. There are some disadvantages such as additional storage space and time it takes to search etc but this is something I am willing to live with (and I will filter the data that the client gets which will help to improve performance). Thanks everyone for your help.
