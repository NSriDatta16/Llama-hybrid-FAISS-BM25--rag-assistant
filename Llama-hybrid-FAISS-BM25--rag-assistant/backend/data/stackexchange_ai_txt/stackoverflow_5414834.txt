It's best to think of Akismet as a giant Bayesian spam filter with some other heuristics. It works on the contents of a post, the timing of a post, and most importantly, how frequently it's seen similar content that has been reported as spammy. The string you're feeding to it is somewhat unique, so others will not have educated it on spammyness. Even if you did somehow mark that string as spammy, you'd end up with a whole bunch of false positives because you're just feeding all of the user accounts through it. If you believe that you may have illegitimate users on your site, and they have not participated, simply delete the registration. If they are legitimate, they can simply re-register. If the users are participating, simply look at their contributions. Their spammyness should be obvious.
