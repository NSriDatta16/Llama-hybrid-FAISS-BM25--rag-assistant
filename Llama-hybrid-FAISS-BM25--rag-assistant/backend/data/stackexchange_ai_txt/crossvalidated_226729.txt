Training Neural Networks on variable length vectors

(Please note I have read through "How to handle changing input vector length with neural networks" but somehow this is different) As most of us know, financial trade data exhibit different volume and velocity depending on predictable and unpredictable factors, from national holidays to wars. The fine detail of these financial signals is mostly considered "noise" and a lot of conclusions can be drawn by so-called timeframes, i.e. averages and aggregates over 1 minute, 1 day, or even 1 year. I would like to hunt for the "signal in the noise" with some deeplearning package, but variable length vectors do not seem to be an option. I can think of workarounds, and simply adding the length of the vector (the number of ticks) to a standardized timeframe is not bad at all, but I am not happy with my workarounds. Certainly a spectral parametric description would go a long way towards capturing the waveform in a fixed vector length, but I would be happy to hear of a "natural way"-
