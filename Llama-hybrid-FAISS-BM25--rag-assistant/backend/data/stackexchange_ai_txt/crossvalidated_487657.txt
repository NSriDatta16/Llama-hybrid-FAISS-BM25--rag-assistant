If you have an established cohort, and assuming the demographic covariates of interest between the time points are static, why not try a multi-class classifier? In this case, you would have four classes of interest between individuals: Using services T1, using services T2 No services T1, no services T2 Using services T1, no services T2 No services T1, using services T2 Something decision-tree based like a random forest would help accelerate the exploratory data analysis, potentially finding complex non-linearities or interactions among the available covariates. Your point around looking how cluster prevalence changes over time brings up the possibility of something like a latent transition analysis , but I am not sure that is the most effective technique given how you laid out the original question.
