Don't bother with custom MCMC code; just use Stan. I coded your model up in rstan (the R interface to Stan) with 100 data points and it runs in seconds. Here's the R code: model_code N; vector[N] x; vector[N] y; } parameters { real a; real b; real sigma; } model { b ~ normal(1, 0.5); a ~ normal(50, 20); sigma ~ exponential(0.01); { vector[N] mu; for (i in 1:N) mu[i] This returns a stanfit object containing posterior draws and various diagnostic results.
