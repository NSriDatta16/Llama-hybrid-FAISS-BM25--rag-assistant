As the other answer points out, total anonymity is difficult to accomplish especially when considering an adversary who is trying to break your data privacy scheme. But, that might not be what you're really trying to do. Ask yourself exactly what you are trying to accomplish. Do you believe your data is valuable and someone is going to try to steal it? Are you trying to comply with a specific data privacy law? Are you trying to satisfy ethical requirements set by an internal or external review board? Are you just trying to do a good job and sleep well at night? You can only provide "reasonable anonymity" after you commit to a specific threat model or objective. What is reasonable for protecting data in a lawyer's office or health data under HIPAA is different from what is reasonable to protect someone's operating system and hardware revision number. One point in particular to make: most data privacy laws require some kind of adherence to best practices. This is challenging because best practices change over time. If someone comes up with a new differential privacy attack tomorrow, and data handling standards change in response to that, then a company might find themselves in violation of the law simply by not keeping up with recent developments. Complying with such laws really require someone in the organization to own the data handling process and ensure that the company is staying current. Best practice compliance can also mean regular outside audits or other forms of external verification. There's no simple technical solution here like k-anonymity: this is really an organizational and process problem more than a technical problem.
