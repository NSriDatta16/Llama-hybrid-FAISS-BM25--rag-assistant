Embed contents of a RTF file into a DOCX file using OpenXML SDK

In our old MSWord-97 based system we use COM to interact with a .doc file, and embed an OLE object, so the embedded document is visible in the parent (not as an icon). We're replacing this with a system using OpenXML SDK since it requires having Word on our server, which generates .docx files. however we still need to embed the contents of RTF files into the generated DOCX... specifically we replace a bookmark with the contents of the file. I found a few examples online but they all differ. When I create a simple example in Word and view the XML, there's a lot of stuff to position/display the embedded object's visual representation, while the embedding itself doesn't seem too horrific. What's the easiest way to do this?
