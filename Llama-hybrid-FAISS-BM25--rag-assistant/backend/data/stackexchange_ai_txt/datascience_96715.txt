As far as I know it's very unlikely that a categorical variable with billions of possible values could be a good predictor for a ML model, but there is certainly some underlying information related to the IP address which are good predictors. So it's a problem of feature engineering not in an technical sense but in a design sense, i.e. using expert knowledge in order to provide the most relevant information to the model. I don't know the task or the data but you could study what makes the IP useful: location: maybe using a feature representing the country or a more specific location based on the IP would work. historically known IP: for example some boolean features could represent whether this IP connected in the past hour/day/week/... third-part info: features representing whether this IP belongs to some whitelist/blacklist ...
