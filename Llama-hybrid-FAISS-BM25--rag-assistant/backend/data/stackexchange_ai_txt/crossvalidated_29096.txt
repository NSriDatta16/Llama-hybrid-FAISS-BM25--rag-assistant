Correlation between two time series

What is the easiest way / method to compute the correlation between two time series that are exactly the same size? I thought of multiplying $(x[t]-\mu_x)$ and $(y[t] - \mu_y)$, and adding up the multiplication. So if this single number was positive, can we say these two series are correlated? I can think of some examples however where a linearly another exponentially growing time series would have no relation to eachother, but the computation above would report they were correlated. Any thoughts?
