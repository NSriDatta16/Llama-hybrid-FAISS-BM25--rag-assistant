Best way to organize the files in my project

What is the best way to organize the files in your project? For example do you put all user controls in a separate folder or do you place them in a sub folder? Do you have business logic folder? A helper classes folder? I used to organize my projects like this: Project/User Controls/Module Name/ Project/Classes/Module Name/ Now I am learning more towards something like this: Project/Module Name/User Controls/ Project/Module Name/Classes/ What is the best way? Especially if the project gets really big? What type of folder structure should exist?
