Trouble with using layout-large with 160dpi large screen emulator (Android)

I'm having trouble getting a 160dpi, 480x800 emulator to display the contents of my main.xml in a layout-large folder. It seems to still be using the main.xml in my regular layout folder. Are there any common reasons it wouldn't be reading this file correctly? To put it into context, I have a .png called "back_large" in my drawable-mdpi folder. I also have a .png called "back." Both are 160dpi, but "back_large" is roughly twice the size of "back." In the main.xml within the layout-large folder, I have an ImageView that points to "back_large". In the main.xml within the regular layout folder, I have an ImageView that points to "back." When I run both the Normal- and Large-sized 160dpi emulators, they both pick up "back," which leads me to believe layout-large is not being implemented properly. I just don't know why. Thanks.
