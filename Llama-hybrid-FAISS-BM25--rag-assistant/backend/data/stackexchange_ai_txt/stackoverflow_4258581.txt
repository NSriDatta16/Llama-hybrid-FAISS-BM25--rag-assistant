In C++0x you can explicitly prevent use of special member functions like this: struct NonCopyable { NonCopyable & operator=(const NonCopyable&) = delete; NonCopyable(const NonCopyable&) = delete; NonCopyable() = default; }; See here for more details. Still manual unfortunately, but more elegant than now.
