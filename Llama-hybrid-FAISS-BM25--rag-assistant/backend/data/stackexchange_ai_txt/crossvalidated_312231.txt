Monte Carlo methods are techniques that make use of random numbers. The goal is to find samples $x$ that are distributed according $P(x)$ and it is assumed that $P(x)$ is complex. This means that we cannot evaluate it directly. If this is not the case, you can just compute it analytically. As in your example this would be $P(D)$. What you propose is essentially a grid search through the space of $x$ and $y$. This can be very exhaustive if $x$ and $y$ are high dimensional and infeasible if they are continuous. Another problem is that you have to compute the cdf in each step. MCMC methods try to solve this by proposing candidate samples $c_i$ and then accepting or rejecting them depending on some measure. This can in theory be faster then going through all possible combinations. so basically you find samples that are drawn from the prior $P(D)$. A theoretical problem here is that this is only the case in the limit number of samples drawn, i.e. after $\infty$ samples. So you don't know when to stop the Markov Chain.
