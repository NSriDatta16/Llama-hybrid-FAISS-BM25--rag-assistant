Adding Days to a Date but Excluding Weekends

Given a date how can I add a number of days to it, but exclude weekends. For example, given 11/12/2008 (Wednesday) and adding five will result in 11/19/2008 (Wednesday) rather than 11/17/2008 (Monday). I can think of a simple solution like looping through each day to add and checking to see if it is a weekend, but I'd like to see if there is something more elegant. I'd also be interested in any F# solution.
