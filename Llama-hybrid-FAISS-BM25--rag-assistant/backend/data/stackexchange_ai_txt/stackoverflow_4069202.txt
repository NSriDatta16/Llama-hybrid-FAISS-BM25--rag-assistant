How to get instance of SessionFactoryImplementor?

As in title: how can I get the instance of SessionFactoryImplementor ? What I hacked in the code is: SessionFactoryImplementator sfi = (SessionFactoryImplementator) session.getSessionFactory(); I don't like it too much and I was wondering if there is any other, more elegant way of acquiring the instance of implementator.
