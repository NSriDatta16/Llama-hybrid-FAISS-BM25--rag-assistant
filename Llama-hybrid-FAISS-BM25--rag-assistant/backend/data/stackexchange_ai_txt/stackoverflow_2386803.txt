You would first need to understand what is a comet application like. The concept involved in building a comet application are explained at wiki at Comet (programming) What you need to understand is that you can use any programming language to build a comet application as long as it follows the concepts explained at wiki 1.Ajax with long polling 2.Streaming You can check some sample code at Simple “Long Polling” example code Now coming to the problems - 1.You use ajax long polling then the browser(ajax request) would keep polling the server for data. This may eat up memory on the server or slow down the browser after some time. Few Suggestions JQuery PeriodicalUpdater (AJAX long polling/server polling) Handling Long Polling RobertFischer / JQuery-PeriodicalUpdater What you need to check to implement this - a) How often do you expect data to be updated on the server. b) How much time the server side script would run to check, fetch and process data before sending it to the client side. 2.You can implement streaming by using the following - How to implement COMET with PHP Lightstreamer Dojo Dojo Charting + Lightstreamer Comet Demo Demo Ajax Push Engine or The APE Project What you need to check for this - a) Will your hosting provider allow you to install these on hosting servers b) Your RAM and Bandwidth utilization (You will need a dedicated server with package that gives you lots of RAM and Bandwidth) It depends on what and how your requirements are. You will have to analyze and approach. If what you are implementing is a small application you can go for Ajax Long polling given the fact that you analyzed and handled the negatives of this approach. If you have a large application you can go for steaming.
