How to calculate variance of Gaussian given mean and average deviation

I want to calculate the variance sigma of a Gaussian (normal) distribution given its mean mu and average deviation d (i.e. average of absolute value of difference from the mean). How can I do this? If it makes any difference, for the particular case I'm looking at, the mean is 0, and I do know the number of observations n, though I suspect neither of these pieces of info is needed.
