javascript viewstate problem

I have a situation that I am stuck with, and hoping someone can help. I am building a .NET/C# web application in which I have a tabbed panel layout, and when the user clicks on each of the tabs the display panel is updated using javascript to hide and show some divs. None of these clicks cause postback, it is all client-side, so I can't use viewstate or session. What I want to do is somehow remember which panel was last visible when the page is refreshed, yet without posting back to the server I am unsure how to do this. I have tried a hidden field but obviously its value is reset every time because the form is never submitted. I do know that I can achieve this using cookies but its a little annoying to implement for such a (seemingly) trivial operation ... but maybe this is the only way? Does anyone have any more elegant solution to this problem? Using a function like this to show and hide tabs): function makeCurrent(tab) { if (tab.title == 'Manage orders') { document.getElementById('panelOrders').style.display = "block"; // Hide others document.getElementById('panelAccounts').style.display = "none"; document.getElementById('panelProducts').style.display = "none"; document.getElementById('panelSettings').style.display = "none"; // Remember last viewed panel document.getElementById('hdnCurrentlyViewing').value = "orders"; } The panels are just divs with style.display controlling their visibility. Not sure if its useful to post HTML code because its fairly self explanatory ...?
