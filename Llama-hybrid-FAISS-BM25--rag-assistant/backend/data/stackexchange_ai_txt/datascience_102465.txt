Which ML algorithm is best works on text data and the reason behind it? Also, which metrics is used for testing performance of model?

I am working on a project - 'sentiment analysis of tweets.' There are 5 different sentiments - extremely negative, negative, neutral, positive, and extremely positive. So it is basically the NLP problem as I have to work with text data. Which algorithm works best on this data and the reason behind it. Also, which classification metrics I can use to check the performance of the model and the reason to choose the particular metrics?
