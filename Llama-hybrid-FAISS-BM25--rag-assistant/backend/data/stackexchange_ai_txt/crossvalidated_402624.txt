You seem to be confused, and really need to read a good elementary introduction to logistic regression (or generalized linear models). On this site, you could start with Interpretation of coefficients in logistic regression output and Understanding R output in Logistic Regression . In short, sums of squares in normal-distribution based linear regression is (a transformation of) log likelihoods, but in generalized linear regression models (glm's) such as logistic regression, log likelihood can take very different forms. I take it that with variance you refer to these various sums-of-squares. Deviance is a generalization (replacement) for these used in glm's. For the details you need to read a good intro or tutorial.
