WPF UserControl Binding for Position in Parent

I'm already familiar with property bindings in XAML. Now I've created a custom UserControl which is dragable within a DragCanvas . How can a create a binding for the position (left/top) within the DragCanvas? Kind regards. 1 : Dragging Elements in a Canvas
