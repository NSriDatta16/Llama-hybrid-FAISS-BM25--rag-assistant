There should be a DataGrid Asset (defined in System.Windows.Control.Data.dll -Might need to add a reference?) which I think is what you're looking for. The first thing you need to do is create a datasource. You can create a data source by choosing the data tab in the top right corner and clicking on the "define new sample data" icon. Under the collection you should be able to add/edit the field properties for the data source. The data source will have auto-generated data for you (a very cool feature!). This can be replaced by selecting the "Edit Sample Values" icon beside the collection if desired. Next you can drag a data grid onto your screen and set the data source by choosing the ItemsSource property on the grid (the data binding option should be chosen). On the data field tab you can choose your data source. Make sure to select the actual "Collection(array)" option on the right hand side. By default it should auto generate the columns for you. This can be changed if you want more control the column header names, etc. Hope this helps.
