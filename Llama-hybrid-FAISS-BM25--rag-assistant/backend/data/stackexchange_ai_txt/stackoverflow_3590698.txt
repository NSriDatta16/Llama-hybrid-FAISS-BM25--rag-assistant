Jquery .trigger('stop') method for .draggable

$('#element').draggable ({ stop: function () { alert ('stopped'); //do some action here } }).trigger('stop'); nothing happens, thought #element is draggable now and event does execute after drag is complete. I tried .triggerHandle as well as 'dragstop' as eventtype, no luck
