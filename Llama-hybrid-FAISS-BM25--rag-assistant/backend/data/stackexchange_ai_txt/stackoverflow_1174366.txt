You cant reacolate manualy. You can do some tricks wich i was uning when i was working aon simple data holding sistem. (very simple filesystem). typedef struct { int index ; char x[250]; } data_ztorage_250_char; typedef struct { int index; char x[1000]; } data_ztorage_1000_char; int main(void) { char just_raw_data[sizeof(data_ztorage_1000_char)]; data_ztorage_1000_char* big_struct; data_ztorage_250_char* small_struct; big_struct = (data_ztorage_1000_char*)big_struct; //now you have bigg struct // notice that upper line is same as writing // big_struct = (data_ztorage_1000_char*)(&just_raw_data[0]); small_struct = (data_ztorage_250_char*)just_raw_data;//now you have small struct //both structs starts at same locations and they share same memory //addresing data is small_struct -> index = 250; }
