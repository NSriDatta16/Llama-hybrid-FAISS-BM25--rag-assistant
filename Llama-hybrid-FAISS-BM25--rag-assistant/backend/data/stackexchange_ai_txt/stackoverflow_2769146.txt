HTML5 Offline Storage on iPad and iPhone BUG

I created a manifest file with 1000 items. Safari, Mozilla browsers are saving the files offline successfully and even Android saves the files correctly offline. On iPad and iPhone when I am trying to save more than 300 items in some point the applicationCache returns "error". When I am trying to save less (e.x.: 200) it saves the files correctly and the applicationCache returns "cached". Any ideas? Thank you.
