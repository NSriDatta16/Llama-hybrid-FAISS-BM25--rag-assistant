How to pass an XML document as a parameter to an XSL transform in java (oracle xdk)?

I'm trying to pass an XML document to an XSLT stylesheet as a parameter. I believe the code is using the oracle XDK for transformations (it's using JDK 1.4.2, and Spring, and I'm new to the codebase, so I'm not sure what is getting loaded in the end). In my first attempt, I just created a document object and set this as the parameter on the transformer, but attempts to copy the variable into the tree give no result. Questions that come to mind are: is this even possible in the general case of XSLT transformers? (it seems like it should be, as generally XSLT variables/parameters can contain nodesets) is it possible specifically with the oracle XDK (or xalan, which is also in the classpath)? If so, how do I make it work?
