The company I work for sells data center automation tools to assist with exactly this. I'm not going to say who I work for, nor how much it costs (but it's distinctly NOT cheap). The basic approach we take with that tool (used by hundreds of large companies) is to integrate LDAP/AD authentication against the corporate directory server. Then, as agents are deployed to the managed servers, permissions control can be setup in the product, which then manages access based on your user/group permissions to a given device group / server class / facility / etc. As for how we , internally, manage credentials - I'll second @ irixman 's comment - we do it very very poorly :)
