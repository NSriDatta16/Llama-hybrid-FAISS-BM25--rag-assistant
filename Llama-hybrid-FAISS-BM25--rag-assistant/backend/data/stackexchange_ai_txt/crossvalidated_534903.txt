Some addiotnal remarks on the "yet-unknown interactions among the features" mentioned by @edm. If you have highly (multi-)correlated features, then Lasso or Random Forest can just take arbitrarily one of them and downgrade the others. If you do this several times in a randomized process, it might be that at different instances a different representant from the correlated group is chosen. Your suggestion to pick the features most often selected can thus be misleading in such a case. To avoid such a situation, you can check for highly collinear features, e.g. by a hierarchical clustering on basis of the correlation matrix, i.e., which a distance measure $1-r^2_{ij}$ removing variables with a high variance inflation factor (VIF) These methods will only detect linear feature interactions, though.
