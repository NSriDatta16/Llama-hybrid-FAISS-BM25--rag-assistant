Keep in mind that the purpose of OpenSIPS vs. Asterisk or FreeSWITCH is very different. OpenSIPS is a SIP proxy, not a user agent of any kind. It cannot function as a call endpoint and it is used exclusively for call routing and low-level SIP mangling, as well as some other miscellaneous UAS-type features (i.e. registrar). Asterisk and FreeSWITCH meanwhile can function as PBXs, IVR servers, media servers, etc. So, it really depends on what the objective of the project is. If it is simply to make calls from one phone to another, you do not need anything in the middle at all. If it is to tinker with certain high-level telephony applications, use Asterisk or FreeSWITCH. If it's simple routing and signaling intermediation (no media involvement), use OpenSIPS and whatnot.
