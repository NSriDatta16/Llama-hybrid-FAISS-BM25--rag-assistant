Binomial distributions?

Research has shown that people are likely to bypass tomatoes that weigh less than 70 grams. a produce company produces tomatoes that average 78 g with a standard deviation of 5.2 g. The company claims that the goal of 2% undersized tomatoes is reached. To test this, a random sample of 20 tomatoes is taken. What is the distribution of the number of undersized tomatoes in this sample if the company's claims is true. Explain your reasoning. So for this question do I just need to state the assumptions for a binomial distribution? So are the assumptions that there are two outcomes, there is a constant probability, there is a fixed number of trials and that the trials are independent? Is that how you answer this type of question?? THANKS
