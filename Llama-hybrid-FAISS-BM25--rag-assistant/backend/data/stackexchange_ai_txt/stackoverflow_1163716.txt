If you're looking for a free/open source tool to achieve this, you could try: DBDesigner From the website: DBDesigner 4 is a visual database design system that integrates database design, modeling, creation and maintenance into a single, seamless environment. It combines professional features and a clear and simple user interface to offer the most efficient way to handle your databases. DBDesigner 4 compares to products like Oracle's Designer©, IBM's Rational Rose©, Computer Associates's ERwin© and theKompany's DataArchitect© but is an Open Source Project available for Microsoft Windows© 2k/XP and Linux KDE/Gnome. It is release on the GPL. And it supports the following features: Available on Linux / MS Windows User Interfaced based on industry standard layouting software Design Mode / Query Mode Reverse engineering MySQL, Oracle, MSSQL and any ODBC databases Userdefined schema-generation Model-To-Database syncronisation Index support Automatic foreign key placement Weak entity support Standard Inserts storing and sync Full documentation capabilities Advanced model printing Output as image All MySQL datatypes with all options User defined datatypes Database storage, ability to save model within database Network-/Multiuser access through database storage Version control* SQL Query Builder SQL Command History SQL Command storage within model Plugin interface I think the bolded ones above (my own emphasis) should give you what you require (i.e. effectively two-way database/model synchronization). I have used the tool in the past to reverse engineer an existing database to an ER diagram. From what I remember, it wasn't the most stable software I'd ever used (I seem to recall it crashed a couple of times) however, this was a little while ago so it may be more stable now.
