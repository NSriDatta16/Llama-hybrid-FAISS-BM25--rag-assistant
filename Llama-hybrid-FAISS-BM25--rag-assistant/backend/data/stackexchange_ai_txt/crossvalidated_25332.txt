Not sure if this is what you are looking for but: There could be many things that cause your predictions to be off, some are: The values you are predicting are outside the scope of your regression. When predicting values it is good practice to keep the predictions within (or at least around) the values of x that you used in your model. Model specification. Make sure the model is really linear. Use your fitted values and the residuals, plot them on a graph with the line. They should be linear, otherwise you may need to rethink your model. Ttry looking at the correlation between your $x$'s. A dirty way (not too good) is run the regression by omitting one of the variables, take out $x_2$ or $x_3$. See if you get a better fit. Check for unusual data: plot your data and look for outliers, then check for high leverage. There are tons of others, but this should be a good start.
