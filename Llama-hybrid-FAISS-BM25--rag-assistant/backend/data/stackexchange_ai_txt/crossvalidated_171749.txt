Context suggests the broader term "model," prefixed with relevant description. See for example the wikipedia articles for some common learning methods, like artificial neural networks : In machine learning and cognitive science, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are a family of statistical learning models [...] Similarly for support vector machines : In machine learning, support vector machines (SVMs, also support vector networks) are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data and recognize patterns, used for classification and regression analysis. When being fully precise, I myself would only use "algorithm" in reference to the actual algorithm that trains a model. Using the neural network example, the network itself is a model; back-propagation is an algorithm used to train it. In sum, "learning model," "machine learning model," etc. are likely to avoid objection. As an aside, the term "regressor" is sometimes used as one would use classifier (e.g. this sklearn documentation .) Though this may invite confusion, as the same term can be used for explanatory variables.
