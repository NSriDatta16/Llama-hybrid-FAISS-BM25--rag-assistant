The point is not to write fast Haskell code, but to write Haskell code fast. When you get there and you need to make your code fast(er), start optimizing (or use the FFI, you don't have to forget your C++ skills). In Haskell you are looking for elegance, reliability and maintainability first. I'd add profiling to my Haskell-fu, so you don't waste time optimizing that which is not used. And remember not to optimize prematurely.
