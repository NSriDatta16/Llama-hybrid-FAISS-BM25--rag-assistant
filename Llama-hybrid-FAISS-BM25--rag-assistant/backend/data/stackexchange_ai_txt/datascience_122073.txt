Time series prediction problem with other parameters

My data looks like this: time series of average house prices per day in 100 cities (maybe more) over a two-year period, each with a set of characteristic variables that do not change over time, such as land area, greening rate, latitude, and so on. By training the forecasting model, we hope to predict the housing price in the second year given the characteristic variables and the housing price series in the first year. Is there a professional term for this kind of data? Can deep learning algorithms such as LSTM and RNN be used to make predictions? If the answer is yes, how should the characteristic variables be incorporated into the model? Thanks a lot!
