You probably shouldn't try to use a regular expression for tokenizing English text. In English some tokens have several different meanings and you can only know which is right by understanding the context in which they are found, and that requires understanding the meaning of the text to some extent. Examples: The character ' could be an apostrophe or it could be used as a single-quote to quote some text. The period could be the end of a sentence or it could signify an abbreviation. Or in some cases it could fulfil both roles simultaneously. Try a natural language parser instead. For example you could use the Stanford Parser . It is free to use and will do a much better job than any regular expression at tokenizing English text. That's just one example though - there are also many other NLP libraries you could use.
