Quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) with qualitative predictors in R

I need your help with a Statistical Learning homework in R. I have to perform classification over this dataset: mammographic masses predicting Severity (0="not severe",1 = "severe) using these predictors: Age (quantitative) Margin (qualitative) Shape (qualitative) Everything is fine and understandable when I use logistic regression, but I don't know if it's possible to run QDA (or linear discriminant analysis either), since two of the variables are qualitative.
