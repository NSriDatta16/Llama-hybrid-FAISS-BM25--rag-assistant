There are several ways for me to tackle this one... If I understand your follow-up comments correctly, all you did was change the display name of the group, you didn't actually change the grouping. I tried this myself just to make sure and that's what it looks like to me. Second, (someone correct me if I'm wrong), you cannot group on a formula . I also tried this in CR2010 and couldn't do it. ( Edit scratch that. Ryan is right. I am wrong) I recommend using Reports -> Group Expert to see what is grouped where. By default, it should also be on your toolbar. I can think of 2 ways of setting up your report that would make this issue null and void: Make 2 separate reports, 1 for each view. Set the selection criteria appropriately OR Make 1 Master report. Set up your group, page, and report headers & footers in here. Before the data gets into Crystal, create a field to act as your 'index' (perhaps with the formula you listed) and group on that. Create 2 details subsections. If you want to change the label of your groups, just drag & drop a formula field onto your group header. Suppress the first subsection if {ReportParameter} Suppress the second subsection if {ReportParameter} > 50. Create a subreport in there and group that subreport by {CustomerID}.
