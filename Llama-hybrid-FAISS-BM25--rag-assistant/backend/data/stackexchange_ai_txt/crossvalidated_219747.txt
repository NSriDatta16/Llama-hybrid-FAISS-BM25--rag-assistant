What selection criteria to use and why? (AIC, RMSE, MAPE) - All possible model selection for time series forecasting

I'm performing all possible model selection in SAS for time series forecasting and basically fitting 40 models on the data and shortlisting the 'n' best models based on selection criteria. What criteria should I use to shortlist? From what I've read, SBC and AIC select the most parsimonious models or the ones with the least parameters (due to penalties applied). But if I'm fitting a time series model, I only have 1 independent variable or x, that is TIME. Also I read somewhere that RMSE is highly susceptible to outliers.
