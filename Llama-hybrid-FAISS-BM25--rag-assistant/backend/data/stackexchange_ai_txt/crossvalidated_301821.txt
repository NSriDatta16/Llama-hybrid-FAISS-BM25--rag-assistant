You can simply calculate conversion (i.e. LtS ), $$ C = {n_l \over n_s}. $$ In " Bayesian averaging " you need a correction for total number of leads, adding "dummy" leads (e.g. $200$), so $$ C' = {n_l \over n_s + 200 }. $$ Attributes with a large number of leads see their modified conversion alter very little from their real one, while attributes with relatively few leads will see their modified conversion move considerably toward low values. In effect, the attributes with many leads will rank higher than attributes with the same LtS but fewer leads. My assumption here is that "TV" is the strongest driver of conversion followed by "LinkedIn" due to the larger variable sizes creating a stronger indicator of performance than "Facebook" which might convert higher, but the variable size is small. Using your data, it's $C_1 = 0.05$ $C_2 = 0.48$ $C_3 = 0.41$ as per your assumption.
