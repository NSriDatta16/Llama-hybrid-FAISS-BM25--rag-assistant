Product images not showing after migration of magento website

I recently migrated my magento website to a different server, and here's the process I used: made a dump of the database. copied all the system files from the FTP to my hard drive. emptied the VAR folder emptied the media cache folders replaced the strings in the SQL dump from http://www.oldsite.com to http://www.newsite.com restored the database on the new server modified the local.xml file to suit the new database host, login and password. uploaded the system files to the new server Everything seems to work fine, except for the fact that the product images are not being displayed on the frontend for some reason. For example, here's a path from an image that was supposed to be showing, which I got through firebug: http://www.newsite.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/small_image/113x113/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/1/_/1_9.jpg When I search for the path of the image the site is supposed to show in the FTP, the file is actually there. I can download it and display it on my computer. I don't know why this is happening. It doesn't make any sense to me. This /media/catalog/product/cache/ was generated by the system, because I erased it myself before uploading the site, so I guess it isn't a cache related issue. Well, I described the issue the best I could. I hope you can help me out. EDIT: Hmm, it turns out the problem was the .htaccess file inside the media folder! Removed the file -> Problem solved!
