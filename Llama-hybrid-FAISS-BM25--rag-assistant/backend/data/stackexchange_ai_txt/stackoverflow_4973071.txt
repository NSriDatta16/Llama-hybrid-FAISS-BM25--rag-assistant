Huge MySQL Database -- Do's and Don'ts?

I'm interested to build a huge database (100s millions of records) using MySQL, to contain stock data in 1-min intervals. The database will contain data for 5000 stocks say for 10 years. Two concerns: (1) In the past, I had a problem of "slow insertions" -- meaning, at the beginning the rate of insertions was good, but as the table was filling up with millions of records, the insertion became slow (too slow!). At that time I used Windows and now I use Linux -- should it make a difference? (2) I am aware of indexing techniques that will help queries (data retrievals) be faster. The thing is, is there a way to speed-up insertions? I know one can turn off indexing while inserting, but then 'building' the indexes post insertion (for 10s of millions of records!) also takes tons of time. any advice on that? Any other Do's / Don'ts? Thanks in advance for any help.
