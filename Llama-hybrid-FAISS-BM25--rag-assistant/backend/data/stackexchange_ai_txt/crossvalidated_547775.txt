Can the variance of my posterior distribution reflect the amount of missing data from my sample?

I have treatment and outcome data (both binary, 100 samples) from two exchangeable populations which I'd like to contrast. The outcome data is partially missing, which was anticipated. Furthermore, the missing data mechanism can be considered to be completely at random. The thing is, I was wondering how would one go about incorporating somehow the missing data information (ammount) into the posterior distribution variance? that is, I'd expect my inference to be more precise have I observed missing outcome from 2 samples instead of 10, for instance. I'm fairly new to Bayesian analysis, I hope the question makes sense. References would be much appreciated, as well as software/packages recommendation. Thanks in advance.
