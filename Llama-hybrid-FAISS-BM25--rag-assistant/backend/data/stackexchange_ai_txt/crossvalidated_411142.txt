How to get the generative counterpart of a discriminative CNN

Say we train a (discriminative) CNN to predict age from images of faces. Is there a direct way of obtaining the homologous generative network (ie, from a scalar age to an image of a face) ? The backward pass during training should be doing something similar in order to propagate the gradients from age to the face.
