Transform a non-monotonic value before decision tree (concrete example)?

Newbie question here. I am building a toy decision tree to differentiate personal names from business, government, or organizational names, like: AAA ENTERPRISES LLC DBA AAA BBB SERVICE SMITH BARBARA EXAMPLE FLOOR COVERINGS BROWN JOSEPH A 2013 HOLDINGS L L C I'm mainly using continuous values, such as the # of tokens, the length of the string, and the % of tokens which are "dictionary words." However, I've noticed by eyeballing the data that if there are one or two trailing singleton chars (as in "BROWN JOSEPH A" or "HUTTON E F"), it's often a name, whereas if there are more than two, it's often a business (like "2013 HOLDINGS L L C"). The value of this signal is non monotonic and probably goes like this: Num Singletons: Relative size of effect: 0 0 1 +Large 2 +Smaller but positive 3 -Moderate 4 -Large I recall reading about "recentering" although this isn't quite exactly what I need, I fear. But I'm fairly confident there is a well-known technique for handling these non-monotonic suspected correlations early in the processing / transformation pipeline. Can someone point me in the right direction? Heavy lifting not required, just looking for a Wiki or CV link, or a couple terms of art I can Google.
