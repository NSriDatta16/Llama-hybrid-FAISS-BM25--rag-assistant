How do you assign user input to be stored into arrays

My challenge is to write a program that will store a user's GPA as a float value in a array. The user can enter up to 30 GPA's and display the average if wanted, after each value is iuput. What I'm confused about is how to use a scanf() function while in a loop to store float values in an array. Can anyone explain with a sample code? OK so this is the code that I have started. I know it's bogus but I wanted everyone to get a better idea of the program I'm trying to write. I want the user to type in how many GPA's they have. The number they input will be the number of arrays I will have. #include main() { int loopcount = 0; int NumGpa = 0; NumGpa = 0 - 1; float = 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25; int gpa[NumGpa] ={1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25}; int i = 0; int total =0; printf("\t\tWelcome to the GPA calculator.\n "); printf("Please enter the number of classes you have counted for you GPA: "); scanf("%d", &NumGpa); while (loopcount &lt; NumGpa) { printf("\nenter your first GPA: "); scanf("%d", &1); //??????????????(i want loops to use scanf() if order &2,&3 ect? for (i=0; i&lt;gpa; i++) { total += arbin[NumGpa]; } printf(" you average gpa is %d", NumGpa / ????); getchar(); } }
