Phil's right, you can't do it. Canvas, by design, only returns its own intrinsic pixel data, not any on-screen rendered content originating from other elements. You could make a canvas element that covers the entire page and captures an image of the rendered screen. If possible, that would be a cross-site-scripting security hole. You could iframe a target site (leveraging the users cookies/authentication/intranet to access it), then suck out the content from it pixel by pixel.
