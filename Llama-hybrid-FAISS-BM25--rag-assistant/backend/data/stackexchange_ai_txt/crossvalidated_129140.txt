If you have multiple correlated time series, you will usually model them using Vector autoregression , which generalizes AR models to include lags of different series. In addition, as @Aksakal notes , think about why your time series are correlated. If there are common drivers, then account for these in ARIMAX models and look whether the residuals are still meaningfully correlated. If not, then your external variables capture all the correlation in your series, and you are done.
