Yes, unbalanced BSTs can be bad. In fact if you add sorted data to a BST, you can quickly degenerate your tree to single linked list performance, which has an insert of O(n), assuming an insert is at the end. A standard BST will do decently well on average if you are dealing with random data. You're worst enemy is sorted, or reverse sorted data. This is why you'll usually want to use a balanced BST(just pick one from your language's library).
