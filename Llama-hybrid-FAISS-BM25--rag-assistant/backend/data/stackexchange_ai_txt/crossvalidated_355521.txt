I want to apply same PCA to different datasets

I am doing experiments in which I need to take different datasets. So, to make them consistent, I want to apply same PCA to all datasets failing which I can't compare them since, their offset will be different. I can apply PCA on forst datasets by using "PCA from sklearn.decompostion" in Python. Now, my task is to apply same pca in subsequent datasets. How I can do that? I can find the rotation angle from first PCA but how to apply subsequent PCAs by using that angle? Note- I am doing this in Python.
