I'm pretty sure this is the same requirements that almost all intranet apps follow. If you just enabled Windows Integrated Logins in IIS, then you'll be set for the #1 item. I don't know if #2 is even possible, because it conflicts with your other requirement. The browser only passes the locally logged in user's credentials (as required by #1). If you built a web form to authenticate via AD, then you would be in violation of the requirements listed in your narrative/paragraph. What do your clients think #2 really means? What do they want here? A way to log in as a different user? They can just log off the computer and log in as the other user.
