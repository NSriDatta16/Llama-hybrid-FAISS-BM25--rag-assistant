Inferring a likely full population from multinomial measurement or survey data

Assume that we have one or several multinomial samples (e.g., surveys) taken from our population. While inferring characteristics (such as mean values, correlation, ...) from a multinomial sample is a common statistical task, generating a likely full population doesn't seem to be that common. It is used in the field of transportation planning : Agent-based microsimulation models require such a full population, which the survey data usually is unable to provide. It has to be synthesized. In which scientific fields could this (or a similar) problem be also relevant? I appreciate any hints, remarks, and literature references. See the original question for more context. (It was probably too big, I'm splitting it into parts.)
