WPF: How to capture selected text in a textbox embedded in ListView

I am trying to get a selected text in a TextBox embedded in a listView. This seems so easy, but I couldn't really find a elegant solution. When I click on "Create Rule" menu item, I want to get the TextBox in which the menu item resides. I appreciate any help! I spent way too long of my time on this... ... --> ... I want to get the text in the code behind like this... private void CreateRuleMenuItem_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e) { TextBox txtBox = // ??? string selectedText = txtBox.selectedText;
