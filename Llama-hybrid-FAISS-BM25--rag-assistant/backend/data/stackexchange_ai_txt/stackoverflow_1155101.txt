A variation of creating a stack and pushing all the elements onto the stack is to use recursion (and the system's built in stack), this is probably not the way to go with production code but serves as a better (IMHO) interview answer for the following reasons: It shows that you grok recursion It's less code and appears more elegant A naive interviewer may not realize that there is a space overhead (if this is the case you may want to consider whether you want to work there).
