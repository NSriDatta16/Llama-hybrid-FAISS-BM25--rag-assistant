Maximum number of images to train a convolutional neural network

I just wondered if there is a technical limit on the number of images to train a neural network. I want to work with extremely high numbers of images, around 1,000,000 to 10,000,000 images. Is there a cap because of the graphics card memory? I tried to do some research on that issue, but I mostly find questions about how many images you need to get decent results for a convolutional neural network. Thanks and best regards, beinando
