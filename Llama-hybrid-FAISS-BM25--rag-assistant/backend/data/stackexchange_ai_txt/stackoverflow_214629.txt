I have to start by saying that I know nothing about C#, but... Looking at the definition of the ipep in the client code, it looks like you're trying to send your data to yourself, rather than broadcast it (as has been suggested in your other question). The thing that caught my attention was that "127.0.0.1" is the address of "localhost". That would explain why it works nicely when you're running both the client and server on the one machine, as it will be sending to itself. I would expect that correct endpoint would be for a broadcast address (eg. "255.255.255.255") - although you could also choose the broadcast address of the local network that you're on, depending on how widely you wish to broadcast.
