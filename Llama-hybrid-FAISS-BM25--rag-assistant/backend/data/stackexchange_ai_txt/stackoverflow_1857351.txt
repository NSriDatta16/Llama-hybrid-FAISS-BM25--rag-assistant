You can create a memory device context, MemDC at the very start. Draw everything into the MemDC, then when the window recieves a WM_PAINT message or is invalidated, copy the MemDC to the real DC by bit blitting. I remember reading up the technique by Herbert Schildt in his book a few years back (Windows 98 Programming from the Ground Up). In that way, all the redrawing is faster as you blit the memory dc to the real dc. But the one big gotcha, was how big the memory dc you want to use! But he showed how to do it. There is a code download for all of the chapters in that book published by Osborne McGraw Hill. Hope this helps, Best regards, Tom.
