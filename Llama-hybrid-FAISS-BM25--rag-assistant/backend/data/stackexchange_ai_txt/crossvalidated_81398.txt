A few thoughts: As @PeterFlom mentioned, if you just want to find out whether or not they "make it", that's a 0/1 outcome that is amenable to logistic or binomial regression, and can be addressed outside the context of survival analysis if you don't much care about the time they took to fail. However…you said you do care, so turning to survival analysis: Yes, "time to event" questions are survival analysis questions, and this looks like a pretty clear one. Whether or not "Olympic censoring" is a problem really depends on the question you want to ask. Are you just talking about time until injury in a cohort of athletes training for the Olympics? If that's the case, I can see making an argument that those who do make it to the Olympics are censored - given infinite time and no other outcome they will injure themselves, we've just stopped following them. If, on the other hand, you are really interested in Injury while training for the Olympics then yes, treating them as censored is a problem. What you actually have now is a time until two mutually exclusive outcomes: 1) Injury before the Olympics and 2) Participation in the Olympics. You're now in the domain of competing risks survival analysis, of which the cure models suggested in the comments are a sub-set. A related set of models are "mixture models", which model, as the name suggests, a mixture of two outcomes. This paper: http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/170/2/244.short by Lau, Cole and Gange in AJE is an excellent review of mixture models for survival analysis. Be warned however that, coming from a place with nicely documented and implemented packages for conventional survival analysis that the mixture model universe is…somewhat less developed from the software side.
