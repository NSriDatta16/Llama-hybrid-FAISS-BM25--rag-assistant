iphone; when to release a view when multiple copies are derived from it?

This is my scenario I have a main view, in which multiple copies of a subview are created. This is how i am doing it 1. In the main view, i have created a variable for the subview 2. created multiple copies of the subview and displayed them inside a scrollable view which works fine 3. When will be the right time to release the subview variable? Subview declaration SubView *svm; svm=[[SubView alloc] initWithNib:@"SubView" bundle:nil] //Show svm here // am not releasing svm here svm=[[SubView alloc] initWithNib:@"SubView" bundle:nil] //Show svm here // am not releasing svm here svm=[[SubView alloc] initWithNib:@"SubView" bundle:nil] //Show svm here // am not releasing svm here I am not sure if that's the right way, but it works well. If i release svm in the mainview's dealloc, will that be fine? How should i go about this? Thanks Veeru
