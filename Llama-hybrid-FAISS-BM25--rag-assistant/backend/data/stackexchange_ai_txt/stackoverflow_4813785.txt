Simply because you are using the wrong method. NSString *varImport = [NSString stringWithFormat:[importTextView string]; Also, you might have connected the importTextView instance variable to the wrong connection. A NSTextView is always in a NSScrollView. Simply just right-click your object from interface builder and drag the instances to the top of the textview (Where it should show "NSTextView"). Save the nib and try run it again. It should work.
