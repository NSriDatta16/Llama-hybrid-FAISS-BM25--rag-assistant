There is a good article on CodeProject about how to do this: This sample project lists a folder full of files, and lets you drag and drop them into Explorer. You can also drag from Explorer into the sample, and you can use the Shift and Ctrl keys to modify the action, just like in Explorer. Drag and drop, cut/copy and paste files with Windows Explorer To start a drag operation into Explorer, we implement the ItemDrag event from the Listview , which gets called after you drag an item more than a few pixels. We simply call DoDragDrop passing the files to be dragged wrapped in a DataObject . You don't really need to understand DataObject - it implements the IDataObject interface used in the communication.
