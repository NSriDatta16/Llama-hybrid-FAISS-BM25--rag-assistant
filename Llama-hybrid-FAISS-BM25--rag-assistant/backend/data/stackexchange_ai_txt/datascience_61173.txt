How can I map the sample from the original feature space to the new kernel feature space? (Sk-learn)

Let's say I have a very basic SVM model, implementin sk-learn: clf = SVC(kernel='rbf', class_weight=weights, gamma=gamma) clf.fit(X,y) X is the sample space with 2 features. I plot these sample using a scatter plot: And plot the hyperplane: But now, I want to see how the new kernel (from radial basis function) transforms my sample into a 3D space, how would I do that? I'm more interested in getting the new set of 3D coordinates After that, plotting in 3D is not that difficult. Thanks!
