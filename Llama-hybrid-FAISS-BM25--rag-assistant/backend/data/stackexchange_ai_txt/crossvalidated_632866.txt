As Peter noted already, simple outlier deletion is often a bad decision. In fact, it can often cause more problems once the data is deleted, as the model will consider other points outliers. Here I offer some solutions: Do some detective work to see if there are "systematic outliers" . As you noted, some data may cluster together and form relationships which are unaccounted for in the model. For example, you may have a "clump" of data in one area that is almost in an island of its own on a scatterplot. This may indicate that there is some non-independence of data (e.g. if Manhattan ambulance demand is often very different from Brookyln demand). If this is the case, you may have confounding effects like the Simpson Paradox , where you will need to model the data to fit this relationship. As an example, here is data with clear by-group differences (the bottom group has far larger widths and far lower lengths on average), where the sepal dimensions are separated into two distinct clusters of data: Similarly, check that you are modeling the correct functional relationship that the data is showing . If for example the data looks to be curvilinear, you may need to fit some form of nonlinear regression such as polynomial regression, splines, or generalized additive models (GAMs). You should usually check what plausible relationship is driving the data before moving on to other methods. Sometimes this will be hard to tell, particularly with small samples. For example, here is data generated with an exponential relationship. Are they outliers? Are they behaving the way they should be? Thinking about prior research and what the data generating process (DGP) should look like are key in this decision making. Use robust regression or quantile regression (using the conditional median rather than the typical conditional mean in normal regressions) if the model is otherwise correctly specified . These methods basically reweight the residuals so that points that are especially far away from where they should be are given "less attention." Below I show two regression fit with the normal OLS method in (conditional mean) and the quantile method in blue (conditional median). Here we can see that the outliers really sway the red line towards their direction, but the median is barely affected if at all. I mention other issues related to outliers here .
