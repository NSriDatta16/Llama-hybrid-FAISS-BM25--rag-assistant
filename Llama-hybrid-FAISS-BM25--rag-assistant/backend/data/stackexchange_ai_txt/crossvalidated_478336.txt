How to predict unknown time series in using Facebook Prophet?

The problem is predicting hits on different stories published on a website. I am aware that for this kind of time series forecasting, facebook prophet is a popular library. However, it seems in prophet, each model is trained on one time series which is used to predict the same time series in the future. But if I have a site publishing different stories, and I need to predict the views on the stories, clearly it is infeasible to train one model for each story. Also, as training data, I have the history of only past stories on how their popularity evolved after publication. So is prophet suitable for this scenario? Or any other popular time series library?
