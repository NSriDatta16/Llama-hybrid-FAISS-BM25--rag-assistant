I think there is no need to do log-transform given that your purpose is to see "if wage growth/decline throughout one's career is correlated with the number of children they have." All you need is a variable that measures wage change, a variable that measures number of children, and a correctly specified regression function(or a set of good control variables with correct functional form). Suppose your regression function is correcly specified as follows: $Y_i=\beta_0+\beta_1X_i+\gamma'\mathbf{Z}_i+\epsilon_i$ with $E(\epsilon_i|X_i,\mathbf{Z}_i)=0$ and $\mathbf{Z}_i$ is the vector of control variables. Then $E(Y|x,\mathbf{z})=\beta_0+\beta_1x+\gamma'\mathbf{z}$ and $\beta_1=\frac{\partial E(Y|x,\mathbf{z})}{\partial x}$ . In your problem, $X$ is average change in their wages throughout their career measured in percentage and $Y$ is the number of children that an individual has, then $\beta_1$ is interpreted as if career wage change by 1 percentage, holding other things constant, how many more children on average will people have. I guess this is intuitive enough to understand.
