If all you need in J2EE->SSIS channel is ability to start SSIS package from J2EE, I think the simplest solution is to configure SQL Server Agent Job that runs this package, and then invoke sp_startjob stored proc from Java - should be way easier, and less additional components involved. I'm not sure what's the best way to call SSIS->J2EE.
