Opportunities in machine learning and computational intelligence

I'm not sure this is the right site to post my question. If not, please direct me to the right one. I'm interested in machine learning and computational intelligence. I've spent the last year of my free time on personal projects in computation intelligence (neural networks and genetic algorithms). I'm currently working as developer. The programming tasks have become boring, and I'm looking to move on. I don't think I can continue being a developer unless it is in the field of computational intelligence. I now have the idea of doing freelance in computational intelligence. However, I do not have a good idea where to start looking. Edit The question is where do I look for opportunities? I'm mainly interested in finding freelance work. PS. I have also posted to Data Science, but had no answers https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/5866/opportunities-in-machine-learning-and-computational-intelligence
