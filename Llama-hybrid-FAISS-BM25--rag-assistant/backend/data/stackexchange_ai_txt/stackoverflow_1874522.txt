If you are building project i am not sure if that's a good idea to use asp.net 2.0, because of the issues you've got. At some stage in my project i moved these ascx controls to separate 'controls library project' that just gets me html strings which i then put somewhere in the website. Like use syntax inside aspx pages which i fill with that code. Not elegant solution, but made things much easier. Anyway we decided to reimplement project in php, as it is cheaper and not making such problems.
