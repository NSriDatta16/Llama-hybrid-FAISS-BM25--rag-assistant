Cheery, if you want to generate (from scratch) something that really sounds "organic", i.e. like a physical object, you're probably best off to learn a bit about how these sounds are generated. For a solid introduction, you could have a look at a book such as Fletcher and Rossings The Physics of Musical Instruments . There's lots of stuff on the web too, you might want to have a look at a the primer James Clark has here Having at least a skim over this sort of stuff will give you an idea of what you are up against. Modeling physical instruments accurately is very difficult! If what you want to do is have something that sounds physical, rather something that sounds like instrument X, your job is a bit easier. You can build up frequencies quite easily and stack them together, add a little noise, and you'll get something that at least doesn't sound anything like a pure tone. Reading a bit about Fourier analysis in general will help, as will Frequency Modulation (FM) techniques. Have fun!
