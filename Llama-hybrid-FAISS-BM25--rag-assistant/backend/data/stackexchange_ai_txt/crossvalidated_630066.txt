Range of Subset of Population based on a Sample

Suppose I have a population with a known mean, range, and variance of a characteristic $v$ . I am producing sets from this population that are of negligible size compared to the size of the population. I sample each of these sets and measure $v$ on each of my samples. Let's say the size of the set is $N$ , and I take $n$ samples. What can I infer, with some confidence interval, about the attributes of the subset of $N$ units of the population using the data on the $n$ samples I took? To put it into a more digestible form, say I am a pharmaceutical company making lots of pills. I know the attributes of the entire population because I've done a lot of testing before I brought them to market (the mean, range, and variance of the population are known). I put $N$ pills into each bottle, and I want to test $n$ pills from each bottle. What can I say about the mean, range, and variance of the subset of pills I have in that bottle based on the $n$ samples I took from it? As far as I can tell, this is a more granular form of operating characteristics (OC curves) because I don't just want to set the probability of accepting the bottle. Or rather, I do want to set the probability of accepting the bottle based on the range that bottle can contain. I'm not quite sure how to translate OC curves into actual values. The attributes of the subset of $N$ units can be estimated using $n$ samples (I am fairly sure - I am not very experienced in statistics) but I want to leverage my knowledge about the population to help narrow down the range. Is there a way to do this?
