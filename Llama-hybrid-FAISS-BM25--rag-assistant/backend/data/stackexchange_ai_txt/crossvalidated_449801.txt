Why does the RMSE value goes high?

I have been trying to predict the glucose values of patients by using regression algorithms. I used Support Vector Regression (RMSE: 65), Logistic Regression (RMSE: 86), Linear Regression(RMSE: 64) and Random Forest Regressor(RMSE: 72). So as you noted the minimum RMSE I got is 64 which is from Linear Regression. I did Hyperparameter tuning and Standardize the features using the Standard scaler but still, no reasonable RMSE value can be seen(Between 60 - 70). Any help to reduce the RMSE value? The image of the dataset I have is added. It contains about 2100 records. The code I typed for reading and scaling the features is given below data = pd.read_csv('output_morning-readings.csv') data = data.drop(['Insulin_t-2','Breakfast','Lunch_bd','Dinner','Event'],axis=1) I have dropped the above columns since I found that it doesn't have a much effect on the target by a correlation matrix. Then I converted the columns which contain binary and numerical categories in to the data type category data['Gender'] = data['Gender'].astype('category') data['None'] = data['None'].astype('category') data['Low'] = data['Low'].astype('category') data['Medium'] = data['Medium'].astype('category') data['High'] = data['High'].astype('category') data['Meal'] = data['Meal'].astype('category') Then I standardized the non-categorical data as below from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler sc=StandardScaler() data[['Insulin_t-1','Insulin_t','Glucose_t-3','Glucose_t-2','Glucose_t-1']] = sc.fit_transform(data[['Insulin_t-1','Insulin_t','Glucose_t-3','Glucose_t-2','Glucose_t-1']]) The COLUMN Glucose_t is the target which I want to predict. I didn't standardized the Glucose_t (target) column and age, weight(features). Is there something I have done wrong?
