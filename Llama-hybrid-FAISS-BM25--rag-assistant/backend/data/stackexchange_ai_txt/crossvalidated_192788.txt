Cluster selection and formula in (longitudinal) GEE models

I have a question according the "formula interface" from GEE models, for instance when using the gee function from the R gee package . Let's say I have a measured quality of life ( QoL ), education and sex from 100 subjects at three different time points ( time ). If I understand the GEE model approach correctly, GEE can be used for longitudinal, clustered data. However, I wonder what my clusters would be? The cluster variable is passed to the argument id within the gee function, so what would be the right syntax if I want to measure change in QoL over time , and how this change differs depending on education and sex ? Is time my cluster variable? gee(QoL ~ education + sex, id = time) Is the subject-ID my cluster? gee(QoL ~ education + sex + time, id = subject-ID) However, this looks like a random slope approach of mixed models to me. Is probably education my cluster? gee(QoL ~ sex + time, id = education) Last: I don't have any real clusters. But what would I then choose to analyze the longitudinal data, to account for the correlation of my DV QoL for same subjects at different time points? Maybe I'm confused because I try to compare the formula syntax to the one from longitudinal data analysis with lme4 , where the decision which variables to choose for random intercept and slope is quite clear (time and subject) - however, if I do not have individual differences (i.e. I'm interested in the population average), what are the clusters in GEE model for?
