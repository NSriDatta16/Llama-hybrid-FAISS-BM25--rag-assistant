With mod_rewrite, a RewriteRule can't be used to match a query string, but you can apply a RewriteCond to spot a target query string. Crucially, you can backreference matches in the RewriteCond in the rewrite rule, so try something along these lines: # we can refer to this----+-----------------and this--+ # match as %1 in the | match as %2 | # RewriteRule | | v v RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} ^(.*)fb_xd_fragment=?[a-z]*&?(.*)$ RewriteRule /abcd /abcd?%1%2 The % x in the RewriteRule is a backreference to the last matched RewriteCond . You might need to play around with this to get exactly the effect you want, but you should see the basic principle. Good luck :)
