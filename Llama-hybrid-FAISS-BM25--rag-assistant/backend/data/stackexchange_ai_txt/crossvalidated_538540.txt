How can we assume the models are exhaustive in Bayesian Model Averaging?

Bayesian model averaging is justified using the law of total probability which requires the the set of models that we average over to be exhaustive. Shouldnâ€™t we prove that the set of models are exhaustive first? Even if you were to claim that this marginal density is an approximation; can w e prove that there exists a set of models which are exhaustive and the set of models that we are averaging in our approximation is a random subset of that?
