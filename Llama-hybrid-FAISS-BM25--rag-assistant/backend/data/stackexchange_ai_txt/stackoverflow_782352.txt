The best thing to do here is compare the data entered in the ComboBox (likewise with other fields) to that already stored (in whatever - the DataSet , list object, etc.) and check for any differences. This way, if the user selects another item from the ComboBox but then changes it back to the original one, the program recognises that the data has still not been modified. (Handling the SelectionChangeCommited event, for example, and setting a boolean to true , wouldn't allow this to be detected, and would additionally be marginally harder to implement.) In this situation, the simplest and most elegant approach would also seem to provide the best functionality.
