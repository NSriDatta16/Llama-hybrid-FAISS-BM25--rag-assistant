how does windows azure platform scale for my app?

Just a question about Azure. Yes, I know roughly about Azure and cloud computing. I will put it in this way: say, in normal way, I build a program listening to a TCP port. I run this server program in a server. I also build a client program, which connects to the server through specified port. Once a client is connected, my server program will compute some thing and return to the client. Above is the normal model, or say my program's model. Now I want to use Azure. I want to use because my clients are too many, let's say 1 million a day. I don't want to rent 1000 servers and maintain them. ( just a assumption for the number of clients) I have looked at the Azure pricing plan. It say about CPU and talks about small, median, large instances. I don't know what they mean. for e.g., in my above assumed case, how many instances do I need? or at most I can get from azure for extra large (8 small instances?) How does Azure scale for my program? If I choose small instance (my server program is very little, just compute some data and return to clients), will Azure scale for me? or Azure just gives me one virture server and let it overload? Please consider the CPU only, not storage or network traffic.
