I haven't gone back to look at exactly what Gelman is doing in this chapter (my copy of the book is in storage ...), but the specific problem with this example is that 'arrests' is zero in some cases, so using log(arrests) as an offset causes problems. (You don't need library(foreign), and using a data argument to glm is usually safer/better than using attach().) X 0)
