As Mykola Golubyev pointed out, you need to delete the vector in the second case. The first will possibly build faster code, as the optimiser knows the full size of FieldStorage including the vector, and could allocate enough memory in one allocation for both. Your second implementation requires two separate allocations to construct the object.
