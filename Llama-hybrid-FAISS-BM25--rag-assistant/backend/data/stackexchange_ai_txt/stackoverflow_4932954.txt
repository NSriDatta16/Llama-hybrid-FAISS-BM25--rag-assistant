How to obtain fine-grained Authorization with .NET

I want to obtain an authorization similar to MSCRM: In this rappresentation we see: Entity (Marketing List, Campaign) Allowed Operation (Create, Read, Write, Delete, Append, Append To, Assign, Share) Scope (User, Business Unit, Parent, Organization) I have 2 Entities + 8 Allowed Operations + 4 Scopes. I want to represent the same situation in a .NET Application. The only way I see to obtain this is to create all the groups needed to express the various combinations . In the example I need 2*8*4 = 64 groups handled in my code using methods in RoleProvider. It seems a little bit strange for me. I'm missing some security concepts or creating 64 groups is the only way to express this level of configurability? Thanks
