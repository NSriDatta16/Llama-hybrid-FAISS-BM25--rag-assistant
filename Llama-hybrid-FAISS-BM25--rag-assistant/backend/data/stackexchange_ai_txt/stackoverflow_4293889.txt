Easiest way to develop simple GUI in Python

I'm done with my class project which I coded using Python. I'm working on the extra credit part i.e. GUI development - Windows platform. I need something simple, easy to use, possibly drag-and-drop GUI development tool for Python. GUI needs to look somewhat like google, since all my project does is: input: Company name output: Ethical or Unethical So, all I need is: An attractive image Input textbox Search button Output box
