ColdFusion scheduled tasks - how to secure when using ?

I have a web-site written in ColdFusion that contains both the usual interactive web pages and some tasks run through the CF scheduler. The dir layout is / /app /scheduledTasks I'd like the tasks to be able to use all the same settings, etc. created in the application.cfc inside of /app so I'd like to move that entire /scheduledTasks directory into /app. The problem is that that application.cfc uses the cflogin mechanism and my own log in form. The CF scheduler only lets you supply a username and password for HTTP Basic authentication. The scheduled tasks will never get past that. How can I resolve this or is there a better approach to begin with? I've wondered about looking at some CGI variable in my application.cfc's OnRequestStart such as the user agent, the remote IP, and/or a magic value in the URL param's and if all are there, bypass security since I "know" it's CF's scheduler on the other end. This isn't great security but it may be acceptable. I've also wondered about creating a new application.cfc in my root that the application.cfc in /app inherits from. I'd leave the tasks where they are and put a new application.cfc there as well that inherits common stuff from the root. This increases complexity though and I've had issues when trying to access the CFCs inside of /app/cfcs from /scheduledTasks. Has anyone had a similar problem and solved it?
