I have also been wondering about this. It turns out that this question has cropped up a few times in the recent past: Is Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test the right test to use? Can I use wilcoxon signed rank test for time series data @Glen_b makes the point that autocorrelation in the data (e.g. the tendency for readings close in time to be close in value) breaks the central assumption of the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test that the pairs are independent in your data. Put another way, if your 100 paired readings are highly correlated over time (as is often the case), then you are not testing 100 independent pairs. Your effective sample size is much smaller. If observation A >> observation B at time 1, the same is likely to be true at time 2, time 3 and so on... depending on the level of autocorrelation in the data. Now Wilcoxon comes along and sees 100 independent samples that all have the property A >> B. Bingo! A differs from B with dramatically high statistical significance. But in reality, if you were to run the test again you might find that $A \approx B$ at time 1 and this propagates forwards in time as before. Wilcoxon now says that A and B have the same distribution. So, having laboured this point, I now admit that I have no real idea how to deal with it! A recent study gives a modification to the test to deal with clustered data. For example a left eye - right eye (before and after) test. But our problem only has one 'cluster' - a single time series - so I don't think this will help.
