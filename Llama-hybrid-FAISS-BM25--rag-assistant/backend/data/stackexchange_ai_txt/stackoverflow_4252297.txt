I would recommend you to organize the methods and put it together.Ex: Have a file for all methods of user (add user,update user,get user,delete user etc..) Use querystring values to discriminate which function to be called.I usually add a handler suffix to the file names and keep it under the handler folder under my Library(Lib) folder Lib\handlers\userhandler.php Lib\handlers\coursehandler.php
