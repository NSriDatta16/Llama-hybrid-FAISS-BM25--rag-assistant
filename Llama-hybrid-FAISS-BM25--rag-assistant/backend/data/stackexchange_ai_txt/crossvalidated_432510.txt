What does R mean by "prediction from a rank-deficient fit may be misleading"

I am running binary logistic regression on class data with "yes" as the predictor. I have train/test and running the pred function for both and I get this error message. Anyone know what it is alluding to? Most of my variables are logical "Yes/No", one is Sex (M/F).
