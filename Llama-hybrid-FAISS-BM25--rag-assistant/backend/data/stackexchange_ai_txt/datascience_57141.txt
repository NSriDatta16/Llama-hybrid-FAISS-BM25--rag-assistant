As we have many machine learning algorithms, we have to know which ML algorithm best suits for our problem. This will be identified by Baseline Prediction algorithm, A baseline prediction algorithm provides a set of predictions that you can evaluate as you would any predictions for your problem, such as classification accuracy or RMSE. The scores from these algorithms provide the required point of comparison when evaluating all other machine learning algorithms on your problem. for further information we have a very good blog on ML : What does "baseline" mean in the context of machine learning?
