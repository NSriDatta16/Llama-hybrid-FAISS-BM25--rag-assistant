Find significantly high values compared to others in a 1D array

I have a number array and i want to pick only significantly big numbers from that array using some statistical method. I tried calculating the average of the array and then subtracting each numbers from that avg and picked only values which are less than 0. like this. (for this number set correct answer should be 13 and 14 as you can notice). number array : 10 10 7 13 10 10 14 10 10 avg = (10+10+7+13+10+10+14+10+10) / 9 avg = 10.44 10.44 - 10 > 0 (greater than zero. don't pick it) ... 10.44 - 13 But it doesn't always provide the correct answer For example for this number array :- 10 10 7 14 10 10 7 the above method doesn't work as expected. It should only choose 14 but since the avg is 9.7 it chooses 10 as well. So is there any way i can statistically pick the significantly high numbers compared to others from a given array reliably. For example: 10 10 7 13 10 10 14 10 10 --> **13** and **14** 10 10 7 14 10 10 7 --> **14**
