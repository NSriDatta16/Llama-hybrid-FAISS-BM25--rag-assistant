Text Classification for columns with numbers, string and special characters

I have a dataframe with 3 columns and 1 label Here is an example of a row key | title | description | number test-9999 | make sub projects | a single projects can have its own projects | 5 description may have special characters like (/ , : ? =) and numbers. title may just have special characters only. key and number is fixed. The problem I am facing now is I do not know which machine learning algo is best suited for my dataset and how to process the columns I have above.
