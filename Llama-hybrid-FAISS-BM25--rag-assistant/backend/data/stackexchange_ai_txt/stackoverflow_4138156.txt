css: set image-width inside of paragraph with specific width?

hey guys, somehow i can't find the solution for my little problem. i have a paragraph setting with a max-width of 630px. in some cases i have images within one of those paragraphs - and in this case i want the image to act normal -> without any max-width setting. .post-body p { width:99%; max-width: 630px; } .post-body p img{ max-width:100% !important; } is it even possible to have the image larger than the max-width setting that's set to it's parent? do i need to use javascript (jquery)? thank you for your help.
