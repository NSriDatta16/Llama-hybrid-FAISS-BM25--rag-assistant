The easiest way would be to create a tag that will be the target where your grid will be displayed from an AJAX call: Then you're jQuery would look like this: $(function() { $("#SelectedYear").change(function() { var year = $("#SelectedYear").val(); $("#bankHolidays").load("/YourController/BankHolidays/" + year); }); }); Then you just create a controller action called BankHolidays: public ActionResult BankHolidays(int year) { this.ViewData.Model = repository.GetBankHolidaysForYear(year); return this.View(); } Finally, in your BankHolidays.ascx you move your foreach loop from above in there and the model for that BankHolidays.ascx is your IEnumerable. This fragment of HTML will be returned in the AJAX call. jQuery will set that HTML to be the HTML inside the "bankHolidays" tag.
