Principal component analysis- covariance or correlation matrix

I am doing a PCA on 24 satisfaction variables from a survey. Respondents indicate their levels of satisfaction towards different aspects of the service. These variables are all measured in same unit, 1-5, 1= very dissatisfied, 5= very satisfied. x1-x3 are about pier, x4-x11 are about staff, x12-x16 are about food, x17-x18, x19-x22, x23-x24 are related EDIT: if the principal components show a satisfaction variable with high eigenvector loading value, does it mean that respondent is satisfied with that aspect of service, or does it mean that the respondent puts more weight on that aspect of service when he/she thinks of his overall satisfaction of the service. If the answer is the former one, I should find the factor with lowest/negative score across all PCs and interpret that that aspect of service needs to be improved, yes?
