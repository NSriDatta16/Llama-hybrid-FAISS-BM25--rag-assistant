Expected value of values in the interval

There is a normal distribution with EV 100 and SD 20. I take a random number, say 63 How to calculate EV of all values that follow the original distribution but excluding those bigger than 63? In other words, assume there is a test where students score points with EV 100 and SD 20 (quite strange test where negative score is also possible ). To pass the test, students need to get at least 63 points. What is the average rate of students who didn't pass the test?
