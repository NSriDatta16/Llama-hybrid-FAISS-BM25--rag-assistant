Custom View For RecentBlogPosts in Orchard

I've been searching and trying for 2 days to change the view for the RecentBlogPosts content type that appears on my homepage. I want to display the title and a phrase from the posts. I have managed to find a view that shows the title for each post, but I haven't managed to figure out what the other parts in the Model are named or how to extract the text. Help will be GREATLY appreciated ! @using Orchard.ContentManagement; @using Orchard.Core.Routable.Models; @using Contrib.Hyperlink.Fields; @{ IEnumerable blogPosts = Model.ContentItems.ContentItems; } @if (blogPosts == null || blogPosts.Count() @T("No posts.") } else { @foreach (dynamic post in blogPosts) { string title = post.Title; ContentItem item = post.ContentItem; @Html.ItemDisplayLink(title, item) } } The above code was (mainly) from Bertrand Le Roy 's blog , for which I thank him.
