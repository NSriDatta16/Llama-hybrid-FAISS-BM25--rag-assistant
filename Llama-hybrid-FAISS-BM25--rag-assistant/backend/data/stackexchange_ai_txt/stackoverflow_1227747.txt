There's not a great deal you can do. Jeff Prosise has an interesting article here where he tries creating an HttpModule . However you can see this isn't that effective: ...User-Agent headers are the last line of defense. And User-Agent headers are easily spoofed by someone aware that User-Agent headers are being used to validate session IDs. Personally I wouldn't lose any sleep over it.
