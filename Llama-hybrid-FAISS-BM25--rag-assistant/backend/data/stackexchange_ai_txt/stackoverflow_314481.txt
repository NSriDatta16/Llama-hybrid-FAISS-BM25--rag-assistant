Display Headers in Infragistics ULTRAGRID when no data in table

I am fetching data in from an SQL table using a DataSet in VB.Net. When there is data in table, it displays the data properly in the grid, but when there is no data in the table, it only shows the UltraGrid's basic view. How can I display the column names of the table as headings of the UltraGrid even when there is no data in Table? Thanks for the reply, but I think the problem that JD is having is a bit different from mine - in my application the data got fetched properly from SQL Server. My problem is that when there is no data in the table, I want to display the columns of the table as the headings of the grid with 0 rows. This is not happening. It just shows a message box saying that no data is found, and the UltraGrid shows as it does by default in the application.
