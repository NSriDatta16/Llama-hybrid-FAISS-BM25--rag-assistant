Wrap the imported content with something like this: Imported content here... These paragraph tags were imported... and style it like this: div.imported p { /* My style for imported s */ } Edit In answer to the comment about styling your own s, you can style all the s on the page with a standard rule like this: p { /* Style for all s */ } and then the more specific rule for imported s will override that one. Edit : In answer to the comment about inline styles, you could override them with !important but that will have a knock-on effect on people with user style sheets. I don't believe there's a clean CSS-only solution to that - you might end up having to parse the imported HTML after all.
