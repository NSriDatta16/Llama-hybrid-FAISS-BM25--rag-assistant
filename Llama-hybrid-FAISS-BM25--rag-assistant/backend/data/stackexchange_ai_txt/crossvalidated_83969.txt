ROC analysis answers the following question (in short): is your predictor different in the two groups? You are confident that the subset obtained at step 4 is highly enriched in true positives. However this result won't answer the question: "If I submit a new data point, is my predictive method going to get it right?" which is the typical question in ROC analysis. Instead, it will tell you "If this has a p might , I have no idea if it is actually the case here), it is clearly not a standard ROC analysis and you'd have to make this clear. To convince yourself that your procedure is not correct, repeat the procedure you showed above (generating a random dataset and computing the AUCs) multiple times. If this is random data, so you expect to obtain an AUC of 0.5 on average, right? Is it what you get? I bet not! A few more comments: If you are especially interested in the positives, and you want to ensure that all your positive observations are predicted in the positive group, you may be interested in the partial area under the ROC curve that focuses on the high specificity region. See this paper by McClish . If you are interested in the enrichment of true positives, you want to check the positive predictive value rather than the specificity / ROC.
