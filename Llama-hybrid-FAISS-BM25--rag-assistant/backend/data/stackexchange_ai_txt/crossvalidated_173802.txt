How do I model the time series with only one but huge level shift into a VAR-Model?

I am about to analyze the relationship of several variables using a VAR/VECM-Model. But one of the series presents a massive level shift that occurs within one period (caused by policy change) like this: 0.3 0.4 0.3. 0.5 0.4 21 23 20 22 and so on. I wanted to make use of a Dummy but IÂ´m not sure about how to add it and not to lose the information of the initial series. Any recommendations?
