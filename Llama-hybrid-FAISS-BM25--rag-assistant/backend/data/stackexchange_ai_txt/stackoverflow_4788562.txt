magento https + IE8 Alert Problem

I am using magento Enterprise edition 1.9, and after custom theming, site is on live. But the problem is when i open the site in IE8, it gave alert like the page is not safe, since the page is loaded with both http/https content. Sometime before I got something like this for magento CE 1.4 and it was working as far as I remember. Default code of getCacheKey public function getCacheKey() { return 'CATALOG_NAVIGATION_' . Mage::app()->getStore()->getId() . '_' . Mage::getDesign()->getPackageName() . '_' . Mage::getDesign()->getTheme('template') . '_' . Mage::getSingleton('customer/session')->getCustomerGroupId() . '_' . md5($this->getTemplate() . $this->getCurrenCategoryKey()); } is then replaced by following code public function getCacheKey() { return 'CATALOG_NAVIGATION_' . Mage::app()->getStore()->getId() . '_' . Mage::getDesign()->getPackageName() . '_' . Mage::getDesign()->getTheme('template') . '_' . Mage::getSingleton('customer/session')->getCustomerGroupId() . '_' . md5($this->getTemplate() . $this->getCurrenCategoryKey()) **. '_' . md5($this->getSkinUrl());** } This is it. You can now use peacefully https on Internet Explorer. By adding this line skin also comes into https whenever https page is loaded, so I didn't get error that time. But here in EE 1.9 I am not able to find this function in Mage_Catalog_Block_Navigation . I tried with command line, find -type f -print0 | xargs -0 grep -i "getCacheKey()" This does not return the function in this way, that function having some other cache info. Is anybody solved this issue. Please help to find this function.
