Bayesian hierarchical model - product of exponentials proportional to...?

I'm reading through chapter 12 of Statistical Machine Learning and came upon this series of equations. I don't understand how the transformation from equation 12.77 to 12.78 happens. Can someone shed some light on it? http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~larry/=sml/Bayes.pdf
