fptd 0.17 and directory access

I'm working on FTP demon 1.7 I have following questions. How can I restrict a user to one particular directory? Lets say a user logs in as "admin", he should be having access to only "/tmp" directory, nothing else. I'm going through ftpd's code and trying to modify as per my needs. Any good reference/documents to get hang of current code organization?
