On my curve and surface fitting web site I have the following options for cost functions, each has a different fitting goal. For example, fitting to the lowest relative error squared means that a 5% error on the lowest value fits as well as a 5% error on the highest value, useful for some wide dynamic range fitting problems. Fitting to the lowest peak absolute error can sometimes be used for robust regression. The last two, AIC and BIC, can sometimes be useful when choosing between different models. Lowest sum of squared absolute error (classic OLS) Lowest sum of squared orthogonal distance Lowest sum of squared relative error Lowest sum of absolute value of absolute error Lowest sum of squared log[abs(predicted/actual)] Lowest sum of absolute value of relative error Lowest peak absolute value of absolute error Lowest peak absolute value of relative error Lowest Akaike Information Criterion Lowest Bayesian Information Criterion
