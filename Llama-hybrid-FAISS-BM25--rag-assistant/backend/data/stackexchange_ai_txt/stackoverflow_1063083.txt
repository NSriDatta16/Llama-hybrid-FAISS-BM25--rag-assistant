I'm a Computer Scientist (says so on my degree, so it must be true!) with 26 years' experience. I've spent maybe 5% of that time writing programs; the rest of it has been: performance testing applications that others have written, and recommending solutions when problems are found building testing competency groups in big companies running operations teams running R&D teams software architecture investigating and approving architecture solutions (recently, Ruby, F#, Erlang) as appropriate for the organisation I work in designing infrastructure solutions running technical training courses ... I write code now primarily to make my life easier at work, or for my own interest; I don't work as a "coder", and have very rarely had to rely on my coding skills for income. If you are looking for a simple explanation of the difference in industry, I'd suggest that a programmer is primarily concerned with WHAT gets done and WHEN, and a computer scientist is primarily concerned with HOW it gets done and WHY. I'd be interested in hearing others' thoughts on whether this distinction fits their experience
