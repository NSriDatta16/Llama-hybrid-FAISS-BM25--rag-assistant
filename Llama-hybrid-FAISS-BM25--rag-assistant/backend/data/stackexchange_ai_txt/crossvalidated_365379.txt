Converting standardized factor scores back to original scale

According to my EFA, items q1-q5 of my questionnaire load on factor1 (loyalty), and q6-10 load on factor2 (satisfaction). Factor loadings are not similar between items within each factor. I would like to calculate factor scores which retain the scale of my items, but instead of simply averaging the raw scores for q1-q5 for instance (which, despite solving my need for a score that retains my items scale, would only give me a factor-based score), I would like to weight each item by their factor loadings. I know SPSS can compute regression-based factor scores for each participant, but they're standardized to have a mean of 0 and SD of 1. How would I "un-standardize" them back to the original scale? Or alternatively, is there a better method to achieve my aims of calculating a score for each latent factor?
