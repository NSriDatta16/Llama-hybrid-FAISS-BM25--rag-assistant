@whuber makes great suggestions; I would only add this: Plots, plots, plots, plots. Scatterplots, histograms, boxplots, lineplots, heatmaps and anything else you can think of. Of course, as you've found there are errors that won't be apparent on any plots but they're a good place to start. Just make sure you're clear on how your software handles missing data, etc. Depending on the context you can get creative. One thing I like to do With multivariate data is fit some kind of factor model/probabilistic PCA (something that will do multiple imputation for missing data) and look at scores for as many components as possible. Data points which score highly on the less important components/factors are often outliers you might not see otherwise.
