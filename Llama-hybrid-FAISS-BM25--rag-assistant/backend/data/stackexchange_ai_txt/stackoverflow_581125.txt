It turns out the problem is somewhere within PHP's parse_url(). I guess that in some versions, on some platforms, parse_url() doesn't handle UTF characters correctly. It was spotted on windows at least one more time . I was able to workaround it for now. Thanks for everybody's time and attention, Omer.
