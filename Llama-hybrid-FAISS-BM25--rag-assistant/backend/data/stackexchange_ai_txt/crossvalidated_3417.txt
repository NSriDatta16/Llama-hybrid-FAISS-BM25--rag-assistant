I'm an ecologist, so I apologise in advance is this sounds a bit strange :-) I like to think of these plots in terms of weighted averages. The region points are at the weighted averages of the smoking status classes and vice versa. The problem with the above figure is the axis scaling and the fact that you can't display all the relationships (chi-square distance between regions and chi-square distance between smoking status) on the one figure. By the looks of it, the figure is using a what is known as symmetric scaling which has been shown to be a good compromise preserving as much of the information in the sets of scores as possible. I'm not familiar with the ca package but I am with the vegan package and it's cca function: require(vegan) df The last plot is a bit easier to read than the one you show but AFAICT they are the same (or at least similarly scaled). So I would say that occasional smokers are lower in number than expected in QC, BC and AB, and most associated with ON, but that in all regions, occasional smokers are low in number - they differ markedly from the expected number. However, there is a single dominant "gradient" or axis of variation in these data and as the second axis represents so little variation, I would likely not interpret this component at all.
