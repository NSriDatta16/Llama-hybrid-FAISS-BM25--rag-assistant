Between DATE/DATETIME and VARCHAR for dates I would go with DATE/DATETIME everytime. But there is a overlooked third option. Storing it as a INTEGER unsigned! I decided to go with INTEGER unsigned in my last project, and I am really satisfied with making that choice instead of storing it as a DATE/DATETIME . Because I was passing along dates between client and server it made the ideal type for me to use. Instead of having to store it as DATE and having to convert back every time I select, I just select it and use it however I want it. If you want to select the date as a "human-readable" date you can use the FROM_UNIXTIME() function. Also a integer takes up 4 bytes while DATETIME takes up 8 bytes. Saving 50% storage. The sorting problem that Berin proposes is also solved using integer as storage for dates.
