All things being equal, longer match strings should run faster since it allows to skip through the test strings with bigger steps and do less matches. For an example of the algorithms behind sting matching see for example Boyer Moore Algorithm on Wikipedia . Of course not all things are equal, so I would definitely benchmark it. A quick check found in the mysql reference docs the following paragraph : If you use ... LIKE '%string%' and string is longer than three characters, MySQL uses the Turbo Boyer-Moore algorithm to initialize the pattern for the string and then uses this pattern to perform the search more quickly.
