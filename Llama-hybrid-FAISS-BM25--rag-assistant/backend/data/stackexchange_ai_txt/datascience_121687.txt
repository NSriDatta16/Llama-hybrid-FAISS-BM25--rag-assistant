Stationarity of growth hypothesis

I have two time series that demonstrate the evolution of number of papers published in Pubmed: the total number of papers and the number of papers contatining 'holy grail' in the text. I want to test the hypothesis if the number of 'holy grail' tokens will grow at the same rate as the total number of papers, so that the proportion of those papers to the total will be constant. What is the best way to test that?
