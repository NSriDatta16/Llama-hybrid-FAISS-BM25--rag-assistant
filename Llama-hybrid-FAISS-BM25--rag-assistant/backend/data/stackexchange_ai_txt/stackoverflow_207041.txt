The most elegant proof I've ever seen resembles Russell's paradox closely. Theorem (Cantor, I suppose). Let X be a set, and 2^X the set of its subsets. Then card(X) Proof . Surely card(X) Suppose there is a bijection between X and 2^X. Then each xk in X is mapped to a set Ak in 2^X. x1 ---> A1 x2 ---> A2 ... xk ---> Ak ... For each xk the chances are: either xk belongs to Ak, or it does not. Let M be the set of all those xk that do not belong to their corresponding set Ak. M is a subset of X, thus there must exist an element m of X which is mapped to M by the bijection. Does m belong to M? If it does, then it does not, for M is the set of those x that do not belong to the set they're mapped to. If it does not, then it does, for M contains all such x's. This contradiction stems from the assumption that a bijection exists. Thus a bijection cannot exist, the two cardinalities are different, and the theorem is proved.
