Combining multiple confidence intervals for comparison against another

Suppose I have three sets of means and standard deviations or errors from separate studies that ask the same research question. M1 +/- SD1 M2 +/- SD2 M3 +/- SD3 How can I combine these separate values to produce one "average" confidence interval, like a meta-analysis would do, to produce an M_new +/- SD_new ? Furthermore, how could I statistically compare that "average" confidence interval to a new M4 +/- SD4 like a t-test would do?
