Much of the data managed by Site like google comes from users. I enter my data and an responsible for its accuracy. Sites have their data, and it is captured from the web. Search data is captured from a search. This is likely significantly different from what your are attempting. There is little requirement for Google staff to do anything with it. Working with manufacturers feeds could make your efforts less manpower intensive. The trade-off is investing in the data transformation software. You may want to capture the source for each cross-reference. This will ease reloads when you get updates. From my experience you also have the issue that cross-references may be unidirectional. A can replace B, but B can not replace A. As long as you have manual entry, you will have errors. Anything you can do in your interface to detect these errors is likely worth the effort. Input volume to staff should scale linearly. Review the research on attention cycles to determine if you can do something to increase quality of input and verification processes. Recent research in security scanning indicates that you may want to generate periodic errors in the verification data. As other have noted, making it easier for users to flag errors is a good idea.
