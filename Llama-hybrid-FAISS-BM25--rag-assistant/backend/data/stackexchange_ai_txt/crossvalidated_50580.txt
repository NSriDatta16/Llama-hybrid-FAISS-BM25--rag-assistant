Well, it depends on your algorithm. Highly correlated variables may mean an ill-conditioned matrix. If you use an algorithm that's sensitive to that it might make sense. But I dare saying that most of the modern algorithms used for cranking out eigenvalues and eigenvectors are robust to this. Try removing the highly correlated variables. Do the eigenvalues and eigenvector change by much? If they do, then ill-conditioning might be the answer. Because highly correlated variables don't add information, the PCA decomposition shouldn't change
