I have set up the 'build chain' target so that the coverage files (*.em, *.ec) from the unit and integration targets are available to it. I created an ant build file specifically for the build chain target (with help from the emma doco!): and individually overridden for each report type: --> ...which merges all the coverage files into a single report! The metrics parameter of report sets the highlight threshold for the html report, so that the percentages against packages and files that are lower than the threshold are highlighted in red. Modifying the xml output will allow me to use something like andariel to run an xpath over the results, and then force the build to fail if thresholds are not met!
