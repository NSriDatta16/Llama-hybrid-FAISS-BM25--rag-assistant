As you have a common starting state for all cases and multiple final states (deaths from different causes), this is a classic competing-risks situation as explained in the R multi-state survival vignette . The Aalen-Johnson model explained in Chapter 2 of the vignette is a non-parametric description of the probability of being in each state as a function of time; when covariates aren't involved I don't know of a simpler or easier-to-understand way to deal with competing risks. When you are modeling competing risks with covariates, you have a choice. Rate models described in Chapter 3 draw on the ideas behind Cox proportional-hazards regression, with the caveat that "For multi-state models ... proportional hazards does not lead to proportional p(t) curves." You get separate sets of regression coefficients for each state transition, which in your case would simply be from "alive" to each of the cause-of-death states. That should help you "to draw conclusions about which predictors are most important to distinguish potential types of failure." With this approach and your simple state transitions you should get the same regression coefficients as you would get by doing separate models for each of the causes of death, just censoring cases at times of death from other causes. That won't, however, directly show you how deaths from different causes are distributed over time given specific covariate values, which is $p(t)$ in your situation and requires the combined modeling. Fine-Gray models are described in Chapter 4: "The primary idea of the Fine-Gray approach is to turn the multi-state problem into a collection of two-state ones." I don't do much multi-state modeling, and I've always had a hard time wrapping my head around that approach. Recognize that there is a choice of how to deal with multi-state situations. In terms of implementations via boosted models, a search on boosted multi state survival regression should provide several possibilities and links to the literature. This arXiv document reviews machine-learning approaches in survival modeling, including multi-state models. It also describes a general way to reduce survival analysis to a set of Poisson regressions amenable to machine learning. In R, the gamboostMSM package combines the general boosting algorithms provided by the mboost package with Cox-type multi-state modeling. There is also a package CoxBoost in development that used to be available on CRAN but was removed recently due to failure to pass check results. I haven't used either of these myself, however.
