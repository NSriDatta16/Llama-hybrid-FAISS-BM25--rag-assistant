I would suggest either one of the approaches: SELECT patron_name, producer.fed_number, tax_number, average_tb_test, MAX(statement.statement_number) as MaxStatementNumber, MAX(statement.period_ending) as MaxPeriodEnding FROM PRODUCER JOIN producer_details ON producer.federal_number = producer_details.federal_number JOIN statement ON producer.patron_number = statement.patron_number WHERE producer.patron_number = @PatronNo GROUP BY patron_name, producer.fed_number, tax_number, average_tb_test or DECLARE @MaxStatementNumber INT, @MaxPeriodEnding INT SELECT @MaxStatementNumber = MAX(statement.statement_number), @MaxPeriodEnding = MAX(period_ending) FROM statement SELECT patron_name, producer.fed_number, tax_number, average_tb_test, @MaxStatementNumber AS maxStatementNumber, @MaxPeriodEnding AS MaxPeriodEnding FROM producer INNER JOIN producer_details ON producer.federal_number = producer_details.federal_number INNER JOIN statement ON producer.patron_number = statement.patron_number WHERE producer.patron_number = @PatronNo It really depends on the results you're looking for. If you want MaxStatemetnNumber and MaxEndingPeriod per group of patron_name, etc, use the first one, otherwise use the second.
