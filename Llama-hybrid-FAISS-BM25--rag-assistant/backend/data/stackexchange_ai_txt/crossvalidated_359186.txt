Comparing observed and expected diets of two different species

My data consists of dietary data from two species (C1 and C2) and expected diets for each species (E1, E2) generated from a combination of variables, but is based on their foraging behavior. What I want to test is whether differences in foraging behavior between the two species lead to differences in their diets. There are 29 prey item categories.

The residuals of the model had really fat tails centered at 0, and some very high leverage points. I cube rooted the differences in observed diet, which fixed the problem with the fat tails, but not the leverage. I am hesitant to try robust regression and down weight the high leverage points because these are generally the prey items that were consumed the most, and if anything should probably be more important than the food items that neither species consumed in high amounts. Is a regression analysis even appropriate? I'm not really sure that regression is best to test for this. Does anyone have suggestions on how to analyze this data? I prefer to work in R when possible.
