Regarding potential tools, you may want to look into NDepend . It is a code-analysis tool, with an emphasis on highlighting the internal organization and dependencies of the code base ( see this post for typical outputs), and spotting code quality issues. I have not used it personally, but Patrick Smacchia, one of the developers of the product, has a few posts where he applies NDepend to some classic apps ( here is NUnit for instance ) and discusses what it means, and I found them interesting.
