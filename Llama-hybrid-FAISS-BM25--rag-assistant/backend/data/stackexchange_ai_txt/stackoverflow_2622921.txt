Instead of using the straight YouTube code, I would use swfobject for cross platform flash embedding. So if you have a video located within this tag: To embed your YouTube video, you do the following: swfobject.embedSWF(<>, "myvideo", "580", "326", "9.0.0"); To change the video, you do this in javascript: swfobject.removeSWF("myvideo"); swfobject.embedSWF( >, "myvideo", "580", "326", "9.0.0"); swfobject (which is hosted on google code) takes care of all the cross-plaform flash embedding issues. Alternatively, you can use the YouTube JavaScript API to change your video on the fly.
