Permutation Distribution Clustering is a clustering method for time series. Dissimilarity of time series is formalized as the divergence between their permutation distributions. The permutation distribution was proposed as measure of the complexity of a time series. PDC is available as an R package: http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pdc/index.html
