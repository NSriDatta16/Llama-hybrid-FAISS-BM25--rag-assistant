As always, start by looking at the data . Pick a user, and look at their typical login times. Maybe plot a histogram to show the distribution of time of day of their login. Pick another user, and look at them. Pick a few more. Do you see any patterns? Do they have a common shape? Do users fall into a few clusters? Try to understand the data well. Then, once you have a feeling for what normal behavior tends to look like, and how it varies from user to user, you can start to think about how to build a model that captures this random behavior and helps you distinguish normal vs abnormal behavior (perhaps by some kind of anomaly detection). But as always: start by visualizing the data. Asking how to approach the problem or what machine learning method to use is premature, until you have a better understanding of the data.
