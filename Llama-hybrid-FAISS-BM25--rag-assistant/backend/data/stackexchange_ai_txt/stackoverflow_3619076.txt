Like this: actions[key + "Dialog"] = function () { ... }; However, since Javascript functions capture variables by reference, your code will not work as intended. You need to define the inner function inside of a separate function so that each one gets a separate key variable (or parameter). For example: var actionNames = [ 'create', 'update' ]; //This creates an array with two items var Dialog = { }; //This creates an empty object for (var i = 0; i You can use it like this: Dialog.create(...); EDIT You are trying to pollute the global namespace with multiple dialog-related functions. This is a bad idea; it's better to organize your functions into namespace. If you really want to polute the global namespace, you can do it like this: var actionNames = [ 'create', 'update' ]; //This creates an array with two items for (var i = 0; i This will create to global functions called createDialog and updateDialog . In a normal function call, the this keyword refers to the global namespace (typically the window object).
