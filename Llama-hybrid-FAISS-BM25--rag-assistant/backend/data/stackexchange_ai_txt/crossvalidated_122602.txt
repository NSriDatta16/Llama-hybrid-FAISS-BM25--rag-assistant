Your satisfaction variable is discrete. I very strongly suspect that you have more low satisfaction scores among non-supporters, and more high satisfaction scores among supporters. You don't see this in your graph, since multiple dots (e.g., multiple non-supporters with satisfaction score 2) are plotted on top of each other. Consider jittering the satisfaction scores for plotting ( ?jitter ) and looking at chi squared tests and/or simple t tests: chisq.test(table(satisfaction,support)) t.test(satisfaction~support) EDIT: based on your t test, you can say that non-support is associated with statistically significantly lower satisfaction (supporters have an average satisfaction of 7.50, non-supporters 7.16, $t_{460}=2.78$, $p=.006$). Of course, you can't really deduce causality from your data. If you have more regressors, you could consider a logistic regression. With just satisfaction as an independent variable, that would look like this: model This will give somewhat different results from your t test. It's a bit more complicated, and I wouldn't consider the added complexity to be warranted unless you do have additional regressors.
