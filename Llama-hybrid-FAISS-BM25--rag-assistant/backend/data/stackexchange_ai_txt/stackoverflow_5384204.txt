Is it possible to make the CLR JIT use SIMD from C# in WP7?

If I have, say, 4 floating point numbers that I want to multiply on Windows Phone 7, is there some way that I can write this in C# so that the CLR JIT will optimise this with an SIMD instruction? I'm trying to get more performance out of my WP7 phone for a very calculation intensive app. I have an HTC 7 Trophy with a Snapdragon processor which supports the NEON (Advanced SIMD) instruction set and VFPv3 floating-point extensions. I'm just trying to find out how I can make use of these.
