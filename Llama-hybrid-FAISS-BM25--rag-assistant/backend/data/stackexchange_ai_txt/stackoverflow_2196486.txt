As Byron has said, this is a non-trivial exercise. You could do it using libpcap http://sourceforge.net/projects/libpcap/ having installed http://www.winpcap.org/ on Windows. Tutorials for using libpcap are around and you'd need to learn to filter out everything but http/https traffic, although once you've got to that stage it shouldn't be too hard. Try http://yuba.stanford.edu/~casado/pcap/section1.html for starters or http://systhread.net/texts/200805lpcap1.php . Both tutorials look reasonable. I also feel I should point out that "transparent to the user" and "dll" are not equivalent ideas. A DLL is a set of library functions separate from an application that can be used by many applications - see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic-link_library . A "standard" executable file (i.e. file ending in .exe) can still be transparent to the user if run, for example, as a Windows Service, which might be more what you are looking for.
