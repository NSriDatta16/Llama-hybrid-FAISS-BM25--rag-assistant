While generating random data from regular expressions would be a convenient interface, it is not directly supported in R. You could try one level of indirection though: generate random numbers and convert them into strings. For example, to convert a number into a character, you could use the following: > rawToChar(as.raw(65)) [1] "A" By carefully selecting the range of the random number to draw you can restrict your self to a desired set of ASCII characters that might correspond to a regular expression, e.g., to the character class [a-zA-Z] . Clearly, this is neither an elegant nor efficient solution, but it is at least native and could give you the desired effect with some boilerplate.
