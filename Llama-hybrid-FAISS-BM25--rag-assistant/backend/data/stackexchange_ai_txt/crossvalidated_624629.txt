A few thoughts: First, while in this case the difference in distributions is blatantly obvious, in general, if you want to compare two distributions a QQ plot is much better than two histograms. In one of his books, William S. Cleveland disparages histograms saying "longevity and ubiquity are not guarantees of utility" and never uses them again. Second, you've already had recommendation for a hurdle model. That's a good idea. Third, you clearly have both zero inflation and over-dispersion and it's pretty easy to figure out why you have both. Zero inflation because a lot of posts don't get any likes at all. Heck, a huge number of social media posts don't get any views, or get very few. Over-dispersion -- well, almost every set of count data I've seen has this. In context, though, anyone who looks at social media knows that some posts get a TON of likes. E.g. posts by celebrities. Finally, an alternate to hurdle models is zero-inflated negative binomial models. I did some research comparing ZINB to Hurdle models, but I did it back in grad school, around 25 years ago. Doubtless there is much more now. Maybe someone here is up-to-date on the differences; or you can do some research on which is preferred where. Back then, I found the main difference was by field of research. IIRC, psychology preferred ZINB and economics preferred hurdle, probably because James Heckman, who did a lot of work on hurdle models, is an economist.
