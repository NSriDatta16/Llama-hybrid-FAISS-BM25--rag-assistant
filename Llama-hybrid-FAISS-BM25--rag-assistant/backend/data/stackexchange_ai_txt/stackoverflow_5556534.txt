You have the viewport set up correctly; you need to adjust your projection matrix (or equivalent, if you're in ES 2.0 rather than 1.x). E.g. glMatrixMode(GL_PROJECTION); glFrustumf(-(float)w/h, (float)w/h, -1, 1, 1, 500); OpenGL makes no assumptions about the aspect ratio of your pixels or of your viewport â€” you have to organise yourself.
