Jquery UI Slider focus issue

I have a problem with the jQuery UI Slider. The issue also appears on the demo. It is more obvious in Chrome - if you go to http://jqueryui.com/demos/slider/#steps and slide the slider, you'll not see anything wrong. If you then click "New Window" or go to ( http://jqueryui.com/demos/slider/steps.html ) to view the demo in a new window and try sliding the slider, you'll see the handle of the slider gets a focus box around it during dragging. I am having this problem and I cannot seem to fix it. Can anyone point me in the right direction?
