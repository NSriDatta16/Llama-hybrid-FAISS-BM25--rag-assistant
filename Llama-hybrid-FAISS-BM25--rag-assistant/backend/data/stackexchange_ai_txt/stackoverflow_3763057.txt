Create a SQL table with a varying number of columns

I have two tables, say teacher and student. I want to build a third table called class. The class table will have one column for the teacher of the class, but I want to see if their is an elegant way to represent the students. My first thought is to have say 30 columns.. student1, student2 and have quids for each of these that tie back to a row in the student table. But I am asking to see if there is a more preferred solution. The above solution seems clunky.
