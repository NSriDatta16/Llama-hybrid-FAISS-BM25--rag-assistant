Django request.POST does not contain the name of the button that submitted the form

I have a django form with two different submit buttons, on the view where the form is submitted to I need to know what submit button was pressed and take different actions accordingly. From what I have read the submit button's name or id should be somewhere in the request.POST dictionary, but it not there! This is a fragment of my form: ... In the view: ... if 'sendPaperButton' in request.POST: return applicants_confirmSend(request, paperID) else: return applicants_home(request) sendPaperButton is never in the request.POST, and neither is the other one, should I be looking somewhere else? The only idea I have is to add a hidden field and modify it via javascript before sending the form but that seems kind of redundant since I'm pretty sure that data should be there somewhere... Thanks!
