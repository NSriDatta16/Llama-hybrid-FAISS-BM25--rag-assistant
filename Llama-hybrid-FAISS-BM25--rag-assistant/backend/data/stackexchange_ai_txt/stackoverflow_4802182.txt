This was fixed with release 9.0. I had the same problem so I upgraded. From the release notes : Improve bytea support in PL/Python (Caleb Welton) Bytea values passed into PL/Python are now represented as binary, rather than the PostgreSQL bytea text format. Bytea values containing null bytes are now also output properly from PL/Python. Passing of boolean, integer, and float values was also improved. I do not think that there is a very elegant solution for this problem in previous PostgreSQL versions.
