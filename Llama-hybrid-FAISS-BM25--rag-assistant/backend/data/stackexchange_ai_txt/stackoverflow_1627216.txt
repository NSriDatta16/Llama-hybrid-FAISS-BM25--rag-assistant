I would say that your 2nd option is close, just few points: Customer, Distributor, Vendor are TYPES of organizations, so I would suggest: Table [Organization] which has all columns common to all organizations and a primary key for the row. Separate tables [Vendor], [Customer], [Distributor] with specific columns for each one and FK to the [Organization] row PK. The sounds like a "supertype/subtype relationship".
