WWW:Mechanize Form Select

I am attempting to login to Youtube with WWW:Mechanize and use forms() to print out all the forms on the page after logging in. My script is logging in successfully, and also successfully navigating to Youtube.com/inbox; However, for some reason Mechanize can not see any forms at Youtube.com/inbox. It just returns blank. Here is my code: #!"C:\Perl64\bin\perl.exe" -T use strict; use warnings; use CGI; use CGI::Carp qw/fatalsToBrowser/; use WWW::Mechanize; use Data::Dumper; my $q = CGI->new; $q->header(); my $url = 'https://www.google.com/accounts/ServiceLogin?uilel=3&service=youtube&passive=true&continue=http://www.youtube.com/signin%3Faction_handle_signin%3Dtrue%26nomobiletemp%3D1%26hl%3Den_US%26next%3D%252Findex&hl=en_US&ltmpl=sso'; my $mechanize = WWW::Mechanize->new(autocheck => 1); $mechanize->agent_alias( 'Windows Mozilla' ); $mechanize->get($url); $mechanize->submit_form( form_id => 'gaia_loginform', fields => { Email => 'myemail',Passwd => 'mypassword' }, ); die unless ($mechanize->success); $url = 'http://www.youtube.com/inbox'; $mechanize->get($url); $mechanize->form_id('comeposeform'); my $page = $mechanize->content(); print Dumper($mechanize->forms()); Mechanize is unable to see any forms at youtube.com/inbox, however, like I said, I can print all of the forms from the initial link, no matter what I change it to... Thanks in advance.
