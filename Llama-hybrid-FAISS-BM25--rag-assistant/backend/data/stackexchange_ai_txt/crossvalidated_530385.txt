How can I use RNN to predict 5 sequence numbers based on historical data?

Supposing I want to predict the next 5 sequences of numbers based on the historical data. my training set is as follow: historical data: 3634 38 51 190 127 2422 568 5796 578 60 1935 -> next_value: 66 For the output, I want to predict the next 5 numbers in a sequence on the test set: historical data: 2 1 208 1404 1134 413 135 40 -> next_values: 5 88 526 4551 97 The lengths of the sequences are different (min=5, max=29), and I've already trained some models, but I did not get good results. I have some question: Is this a sequence prediction problem? How do I solve this problem with LSTM?
