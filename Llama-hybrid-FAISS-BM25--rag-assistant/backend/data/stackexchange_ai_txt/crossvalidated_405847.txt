Do i need to log transform a variable if it displays a linear relationship?

I am writing a thesis on the relationship between gin consumption and health outcomes for my final year at university. After completing my research, I am wondering whether I should have logged some of my control variables. It is time series panel data. The two I am concerned about are - total expenditure on healthcare, and income. I plotted these variables using added variable plots - which I will attach. They present linear relationships - does this mean I am ok not logging the variables? Any advise on this matter would be extremely grateful.
