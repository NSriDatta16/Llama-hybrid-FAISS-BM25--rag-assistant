The "best practice" in this case, is to not fight the tool. It allows you to do what you want, but you'll get more work done and be able to focus on code if you just let the IDE organize your project for you. I would create an empty solution project called PdMagic.Common This will give you a file structure like PdMagic.Common\ PdMagic.Common\PdMagic.Common.sln then I generally add a src and libs folder (via the file system, not VS) inside the libs folder, i would place all my third party dependencies, and the src folder would hold all of my projects PdMagic.Common\ PdMagic.Common\PdMagic.Common.sln PdMagic.Common\libs PdMagic.Common\libs\nunit PdMagic.Common\src Next, in Visual Studio, I would right click on the Solution I just created, and click "Add -> New Project", I would specify that I wanted it created in the \src folder and call it PdMagic.Common.Math Now my folder structure would look like this PdMagic.Common\ PdMagic.Common\PdMagic.Common.sln PdMagic.Common\libs PdMagic.Common\libs\nunit PdMagic.Common\src PdMagic.Common\src\PdMagic.Common.Math PdMagic.Common\src\PdMagic.Common.Math\PdMagic.Common.Math.csproj PdMagic.Common\src\PdMagic.Common.Math\Class1.cs Then, as you add classes to your PdMagic.Common.Math project, they will go in the folder with the project file. This is how the IDE has the opinion we should work, and I think most developers go with it because trying to get any other layout on the file system would require too much fighting with the IDE. I know it can be hard to come from a different convention, and you instinctively want the same conventions in the new environment. However, if you stick with the conventions, (right or wrong in your opinion) you'll get more done because you won't be trying to force the IDE to do things the way you think they should be done.
