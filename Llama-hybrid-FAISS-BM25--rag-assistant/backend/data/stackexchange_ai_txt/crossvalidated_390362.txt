Kalman filter-ish model, is this identifiable?

Time series of observations $y_t$ . The proposed model is that there's unobservable scalar series $x_t$ : $$x_t=\phi x_{t-1}+B_tu_t+w_t$$ where $u_t$ - vector predictirs and $w_t$ - noise. Then there's observable scalar: $$y_t=Z_t\times(x_t\beta_1+(1-x_t)\beta_2)+v_t$$ where $Z_t$ - another vector of regressors, potentially, could be the same as $u_t$ if it helps; $v_t$ - noise, and $\beta_1,\beta_2$ - parameter vectors I'm trying to estimate. Is this model identifiable? Can estimate betas and the unobservable $x_t$ ?
