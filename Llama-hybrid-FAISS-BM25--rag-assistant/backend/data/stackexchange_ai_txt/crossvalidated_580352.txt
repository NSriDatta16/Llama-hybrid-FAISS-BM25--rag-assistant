How do I test for significant change when looking at a metric such as "average products added to cart in per session"?

I will try to ask this question via an example. Let us assume we have two groups. Group A & Group B. Group Total Products added to Cart Total Sessions Avg. products added to cart per session A 25,000 21,000 1.1905 B 27,500 21,955 1.2526 What I want to understand is, is the difference in avg. products added to cart per session between Group A and Group B, statistically significant? My initial thoughts was to use unpaired 2-sample t-test. But I am questioning this more and more...mainly because I am getting confused as to whether it is actually appropriate to calculate the std. deviation of the 'average prod. added to cart per session'? Usually in t-tests you calculate the std. deviation of a value such as weight, test scores and not average weight or average score. Could any one please advise and help me?
