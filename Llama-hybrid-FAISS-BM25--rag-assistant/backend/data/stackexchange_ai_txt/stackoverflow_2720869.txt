Managed (.NET) library with HTML Tidy-like functionality?

Is there an HTML cleaner for .NET that can parse HTML and (for instance) convert it to a more machine friendly format such as XHTML ? I've tried the HTML Agility Pack, but that fails to correctly parse even fairly simple examples. To give an example of HTML that should be parsed correctly: test TestElem1 TestElem2 TestElem3 List: Nested1 Nested2 Nested3 TestElem4 paragraph 1 paragraph 2 paragraph 3 li tags don't need to be closed ( see specification ), and neither do P tags . In other words, the above sample should be parsed as: test TestElem1 TestElem2 TestElem3 List: Nested1 Nested2 Nested3 TestElem4 paragraph 1 paragraph 2 paragraph 3 Since the aim is to use the library on various machines, it's a big disadvantage to need to fall back to native code (such as a wrapper around HTML Tidy ) which would require extra deployment hassle and sacrifice platform independence, not to mention being impossible in sandboxed scenarios. Any suggestions? To recap, I'm looking for: An HTML cleaner ala HTML Tidy Must be able to deal with real world HTML, not just XHTML, at the very least correctly reading valid HTML 4 Must be able to convert to a more easily processable XML format Should be a purely managed application.
