From the various answers and comments, it looks like your main problem is latency/bandwidth with the centralized server. Here are a couple leads I suggest : Is your server served over http / https or over svnserve / ssh+svnserve. In my experience on pre 1.5 svn, the svnserve way was much faster than the http/https way for multiple file diff retrieval. If I recall correctly my investigation at the time, the http serving uses a protocol which needs a roundtrip to the server for each diff, while svnserve is able to send multiple diffs in one go. Is your client able to request multiple diffs at the same time ? (I think more specifically of the eclipse synchronize view which is able to request all the diffs for a tree and then let you review the files without further round trips. the last avenue of investigation I suggest is creating a readonly cache on your local machine, there are various ways to do that which have been explored in : How to synchronize two Subversion repositories?
