How to understand the prior and posterior of Gaussian process in the function space view?

I've been reading Gaussian process for machine learning by Rasmussen and Williams and I'm confused by the prior and posterior in the weight space view and function space view. The prior and posteior are clear in the weight space view as written in Page 9 of the book. $$ p(\mathbf{w}|\mathbf{y}, X) = \frac{p(\mathbf{y}|X,\mathbf{w})p(\mathbf{w})}{p(\mathbf{y}|X)} $$ where $p(\mathbf{w}|\mathbf{y}, X)$ is the posteior on weights, $p(\mathbf{w})$ is the prior, and $p(\mathbf{y}|X)$ is the marginal likelihood (which is used later for model selection). However, in the function space, the prior and posterior should be defined on a function $f$ . Following the formulation above, we have $$ p(f|\mathbf{y}, X) = \frac{p(\mathbf{y}|X,f)p(f)}{p(\mathbf{y}|X)} $$ The problem lies in: Are $p(f)$ and $p(f|\mathbf{y}, X)$ the correct formulation for the prior and posterior in the function space view? How to understand the meaning of the distribution of a function like $p(f)$ ?
