You'll need to use the overload of DateTime.Parse which takes an IFormatProvider. The IFormatProvider you supply must understand that format. You can do this by creating a DateTimeFormatInfo object with the correct format for the date string you are feeding to parse. This is probably a lot of work for what you're doing. If you can reorganize the string a little first (most likely to a date string with seperators), you'll probably be better off.
