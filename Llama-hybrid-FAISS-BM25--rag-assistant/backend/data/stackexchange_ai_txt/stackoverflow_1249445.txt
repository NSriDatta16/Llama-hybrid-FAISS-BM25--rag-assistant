Loading external url with client side coding

I have recently created a student organization website (i.e. www-sc.xxx.edu/studentorganizations/ourorganization). Our college does not allow us create dynamic websites so I needed to host some of the pages at a different domain (blog, news, etc..). Now, I want to mask that I hosted some websites at an external URL. So, for example if students visit news page, I want data loaded from external url without visitor realizing it. Is this possible with jquery, if yes, how? Thank you all in advance.
