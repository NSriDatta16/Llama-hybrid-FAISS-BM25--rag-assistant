Estimating the $\chi^2$-divergence with Monte Carlo: which distribution to sample from?

Notation: let the $\chi^2$ -divergence between $p, q$ be defined as $$\chi^2 (p||q) := \int \left ( \frac{p(x)}{q(x)} \right )^2 q(x)\mathrm{d}x -1 = \int \frac{p(x)}{q(x)} p(x)\mathrm{d}x - 1. $$ Suppose $q$ is a fully known prior distribution, and $p$ is a posterior distribution known up to a normalizing constant but its normalizing constant can be estimated with a reliable Monte Carlo estimator with finite variance. If it helps simplify the problem, assume exact iid samples can be drawn from both distributions. Which estimator would be less variable? A Monte Carlo estimator with samples from $q$ , or samples from $p$ ? Suppose I have samples from both $p$ and $q$ . Is there a method for leveraging both samples to produce a more stable estimator?
