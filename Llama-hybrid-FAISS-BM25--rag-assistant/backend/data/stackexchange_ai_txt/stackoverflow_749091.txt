Do all developers consider monitor quality (colors, not resolution) to be irrelevant?

I especially hear it from those advocates of "business" notebooks manufactured by IBM/Lenovo, HP, Dell (maybe) that "business users do not need quality screens". They stick in the worst possible LCDs out there (even if with a high resolution) and dare to sell that crap. You can't even distinguish hue variations like light-yellow vs. light-grey. I really miss it - do all of you agree color reproduction of a developer display is irrelevant, be it even a grayscale display it will do? I understand most of developers work with text but... at times there is some design work to be done which is not doable on cheap LCDs. And besides - wouldn't you enjoy fresh saturated colors even in a development environment? Bright cheerful icons on menus? Isn't it better to sit in a sunny office with green trees and flowers out of the window than in a garage with dark colors and weak artificial lighting? P.S. Inspired by the topic about keyboards: Keyboard for programmers The question about displays and developers really interests me since a very long time.
