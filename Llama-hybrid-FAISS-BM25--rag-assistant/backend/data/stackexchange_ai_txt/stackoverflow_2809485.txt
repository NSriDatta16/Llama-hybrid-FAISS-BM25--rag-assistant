Good freeware COM/ActiveX Type Library Explorer?

I used to have a dated, but valuable solution to display COM/ActiveX control- and type-library contents (ProgIDs, method names and signatures, enumerations, constants, interfaces/coclasses, etc.) of all such libraries registered on my system. It provided an Explorer-like overview of everything that was available to ActiveX development/scripting and served as an automatic API documentation tool since official docs for most COM/ActiveX libraries are either missing completely or fragmentary at best. My recent move to a 64bit Windows rendered the program I had unusable, due to internal dependencies on the 32bit VB6 runtime (comctl32.ocx) that is no longer supported on 64bit Windows. Does anyone know an alternative that still works?
