draggable + sortable working not so good

http://jsfiddle.net/268By/ I'm trying to drag table rows from one table to another and to be able to also sort them in the second one. the sorting doesn't work as it should(doesn't show the space where it will drop) and it works only between the rows tried to drag one more time after dropping them
