I do not know about the current situation regarding this, but in the past, I have been burned in the following scenario: Apple wants to make life easy and provide compatibility to ex-Mac OS users, modifies the system version of tar to encode data forks or some other Mac-specific metadata in tar files. They consider, rightly, that it's "just another filesystem". The encoding is nothing fancy (similar to the encoding used for FAT32 filesystems) but it's a nice touch. MacPorts want to control the version of tar used when doing MacPorts-related things (perhaps fix a bug that has been present in some system-provided version), installs pristine GNU tar as a dependency for some package. MacPorts tar is first in $PATH, is used in a place where Apple tar behavior was desired. Backup is revealed to be worthless. I am still using MacPorts though. I just pay attention at the time of using tar. MacPorts is such a big timesaver that I couldn't do without it.
