Eclipse Helios and SVN?

I installed eclipse helios (for Java developers) and installed svn via help, install new software. When checking out a new Java project (for example by selecting new Project.. and then choosing checkout from SVN the sources always land next to the src folder and not in it (in some cases it does not even create an src folder). With the result that I cannot run the project. When dragging the sources manually in the src folder, eclipse then interprets this as an svn move command which I don't want. Any ideas how to get the sources after checkout in the src directory of a new java project? Update For example after checking out some subproject of apache's cocoon it does not put them into the src directory.
