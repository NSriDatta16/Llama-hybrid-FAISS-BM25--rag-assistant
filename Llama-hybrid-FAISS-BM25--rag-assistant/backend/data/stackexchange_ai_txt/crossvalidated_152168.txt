Best way to combine information from different models

I have 3 models using different methods for the same outcome and predictor variables of a training set. I can apply these models to a new test dataset for predicting outcome variable. Is it a good idea to take average of the outcome variable predicted by these 3 models? It seems that 'ensemble learning' deals with combining multiple models to get better prediction ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_learning ). What are the drawbacks of simple averaging of predicted values? Which other method(s) are easy to implement?
