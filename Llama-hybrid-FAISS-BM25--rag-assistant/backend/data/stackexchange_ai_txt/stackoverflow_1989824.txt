An easy way to see all activity that you need to replicate is the Live HTTP Headers Firefox Extension . To see all form elements on the page, Firebug is useful. Finally, I often use a fake server that I control to see what the browser is sending, and compare to my application. I rolled my own, just a small Java server that prints out everything sent to it - inverse telnet, if you will. Another note is that some sites deny access based on the User-Agent, i.e. you might need to get your application to pretend it's Firefox. This is very bad practice, and a little dishonest. As BalusC mentioned, check their usage policy and robots.txt! I would also recommend asking permission if you intend to spread your application around. Finally, I happen to be working on something similar and you might find the following code useful (it writes a mapping of key -> lists of values to the correct POST format): StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder(); try { boolean first = false; for(Entry > entry : data.entrySet()) { for(String value : entry.getValue()) { if(first) { first = false; } else { builder.append("&"); } builder.append(URLEncoder.encode(entry.getKey(), "UTF-8") + "=" + URLEncoder.encode(value, "UTF-8")); } } } catch (UnsupportedEncodingException e1) { return false; } conn.setDoOutput(true); try { OutputStreamWriter wr = new OutputStreamWriter(conn.getOutputStream()); wr.write(builder.toString()); wr.flush(); conn.connect(); } catch (IOException e) { return(false); }
