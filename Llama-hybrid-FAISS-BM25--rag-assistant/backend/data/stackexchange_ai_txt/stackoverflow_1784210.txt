Firstly, the link you posted is incorrect, that will just get google.com, because the hash value is never part of the request URI. It should be http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=google+keyword+search Second, Google blocks crawlers from accessing anything from /search with robots.txt. Whether CURL pays attention to this or not I don't know. However, it's very likely that Google blocks access from unknown sources. I guess you could try and set the user-agent to match a web browser, though that is kind of deceiving...
