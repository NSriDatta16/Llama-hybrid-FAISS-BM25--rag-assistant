How can I average the variance extracted from different group of samples?

I have groups of samples, where each group has a different number of samples and a different mean. I also know the variance of each group of samples. I would like to compute a sort of "average" variance, that should be something like the mean of my variances. If the groups had all the same number of units, I think I could simply average the variances of each group summing up the variances and dividing by the number of groups. However my groups have different sizes and I should, somehow, keep this into account. How can I proceed?
