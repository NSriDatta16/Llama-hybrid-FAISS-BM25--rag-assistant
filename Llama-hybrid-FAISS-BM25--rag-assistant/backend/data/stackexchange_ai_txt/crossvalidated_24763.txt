First of all, thank you for providing context. Next: Why dichotomize volatility? This makes little sense to me. By doing this, you are saying that the most volatile day was just like the day that was the 149th most volatile (of 1000) and the 151st was just like the 1000th (presumably a day with just about 0 volatility). Dichotomizing increases both type I and type II error, and makes the result less meaningful. Use volatility as a continuous variable instead Then, don't use backward elimination. The p-values will be too small, the coefficients will be biased away from 0, the model will be too complex. In SAS, you can use GLMSELECT to implement LASSO or LAR. For more on this, see my paper Stopping Stepwise (written with David Cassell). It's here Even more important, though, unless the stock market acts very differently from the way I think it acts, you will violate the assumption that the residuals are independent. That is, the volatility today depends in part on the volatility yesterday. You need to account for this. There are two broad ways of doing this: Time series analysis and multi-level modeling. I think the latter is probably more suitable here, with the goal of modeling a bunch of independent variables. In SAS, if you take my above advice and don't dichotomize, you can look at PROC MIXED. If you decide to ignore that advice, look at PROC GLIMMIX.
