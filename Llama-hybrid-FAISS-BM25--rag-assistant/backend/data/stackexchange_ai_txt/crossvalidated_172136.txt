Real world datasets using Markov Chains

I understand that Markov Chains are very important in modeling phenomena such as intergenerational socio-economic status, weather, random walks, memory-less board games, etc... But I'm struggling to find real, empirical data that satisfies a Markov Chain. For example, I see a lot of..."imagine that if it rained yesterday, then it will rain today with probability 0.8". Where is this 0.8 from? I can't find anything that references a study, or some dataset upon which these figures are based. Not just weather, but any Markov Chain based model. Anyone have resources or suggestions on where to locate these? I searched the footnotes of a lot of these examples but they haven't revealed anything. Edit Just because some people have provided answers to this, let me clarify and ask it in a different way: Are there processes in nature, and accompanying datasets, that satisfy the Markov Property to a "high" degree, rather than just toy examples that illustrate it?
