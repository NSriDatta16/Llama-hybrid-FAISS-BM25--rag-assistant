What is an intuitive explanation of the Bayesian score?

I am familiar with the Bayesian score , which is used to compare competing structures of a BN. However, I have difficulty in understanding how the Bayesian score formula below is derived. 1) What is an intuitive explanation of the Bayesian score? (e.g. how do the fractions within the product operators equate to $P(D|B_S)$) 2) What type of structures does it favour? (e.g. more/less connected, higher/lower number of parents, etc.) Background: The Bayesian score of a BN structure, $B_S$, for a data set, $D$, is used to calculate the joint probability of $P(B_S,D)$. For a discrete network (after some assumptions*), it is given as: $$P(B_S,D) = P(B_S)\prod_{i=0}^n\prod_{j=1}^{qi} \frac{\Gamma(N'_{ij})}{\Gamma(N'_{ij} + N_{ij})} \prod_{k=1}^{ri} \frac{\Gamma(N'_{ijk} + N_{ijk})}{\Gamma(N'_{ijk})} $$ $\Gamma()$ is the gamma function. Above, since all counts are positive integers, $\Gamma(int) = (int-1)!$ $P(B_S)$ is the prior on the network structure ( taken to be uniform/uninformative by many versions of the Bayesian score) $xi$ is a node in the network with $n$ nodes; $ri (1 ≤ i ≤ n)$ is the cardinality of $xi$; $qi$ denotes the cardinality of the parent set of $xi$ , that is, the number of different values to which the parents of xi, $pa(xi)$, can be instantiated. $N_{ij} (1 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ j ≤ qi)$ denotes the number of records in $D$ for which $pa(xi)$ takes its $j$th value. $N_{ijk} (1 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ j ≤ qi, 1 ≤ k ≤ ri)$ denotes the number of records in $D$ for which $pa(xi)$ takes its $j$th value and for which $xi$ takes its $k$th value. So, $N_{ij} = \sum_{k=1}^{ri} N_{ijk}$. $N′_{ij}$ and $N′_{ijk}$ represent choices of priors on counts restricted by $N'_{ij} = \sum_{k=1}^{ri} N'_{ijk}$. *List of asssumptions: 1 - Multinomial Sample; 2- Parameter Independence; 3- Parameter Modularity; 4 - Dirichlet; 5- Complete Data
