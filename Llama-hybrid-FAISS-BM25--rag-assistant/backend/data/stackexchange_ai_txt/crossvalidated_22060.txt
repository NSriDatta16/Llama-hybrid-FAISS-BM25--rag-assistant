Just to make things clear: given a positive recurrent Markov chain $(X_t)$, the sequence $Y_t = \mathbb{I}_A(X_t)$ is not a Markov chain in most cases (see Kemeny and Snell's Finite Markov chains ); the sequence $Y_t = \mathbb{I}_A(X_t)$ has a limiting/stationary distribution directly induced by the limiting/stationary distribution of the Markov chain $(X_t)$.
