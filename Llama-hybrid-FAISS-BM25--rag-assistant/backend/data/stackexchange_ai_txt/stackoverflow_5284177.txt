Okay! My bad--I'm using Mootools Slideshow2 http://code.google.com/p/slideshow/ The show defaults to having titles on, it converts alt text into titles. I simply changed titles from "true" to "false" in slideshow.js and the problem is solved. I feel a bit silly, I should have thought of that right away. Thanks for your attention everyone!
