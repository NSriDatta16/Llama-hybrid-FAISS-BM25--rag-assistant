Whats the difference between a dense layer and an output layer in a CNN?

All deeplearning4j CNN examples I have seen usually have a Dense Layer right after the last convolution or pooling then an Output Layer or a series of Output Layers that follow. What is really the difference between a Dense Layer and an Output Layer in a CNN also in a CNN with this kind of architecture may one say the Fullyconnected Layer = Dense Layer + Output Layer / Fullyconnected Layer = Dense Layer alone .
