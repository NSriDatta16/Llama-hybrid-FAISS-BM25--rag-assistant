You're right that they won't be able to see them just by visiting the URL that ends in the directory name in a standard browser. If you have other connection options available, though, such as FTP, they are likely to be able to look wherever they want after establishing a valid connection. General security advice: you should probably set strict permissions on any files that you don't want random people looking at. Of course this will not work on pages you DO want available online (e.g. through links) but could be helpful if you're the kind of person who keeps little notes to yourself in various directories. Also note Alex's second paragraph (curses, I've been FGIW-ed).
