One of the recommendations I had (which I think came from the Pragmatic Version Control book by Mike Mason) to refer to particular revision in your external, so that you always get the same version of the external dependency until you explicitly choose to change it. At this point, you have probably interactively built it once to make sure it works, so relying on it to build every time isn't really an issue, which avoids the need to add some indirection in your build tasks. If you choose to have the indirection, and for some reason a build does fail on an external, it is possible this will be missed as the next nant task will pick up the previous binary.
