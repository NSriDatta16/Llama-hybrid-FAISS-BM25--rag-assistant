Building a Contact Database - Need a little schema inspiration

I've been working on laying out the data structure for an application I'm working on. One of the things it will need to handle is storing customer / contact information. I've been studying the interface of a few different contact information programs like Address Book, gmail contacts, etc. I have basically boiled the contact down to an "entity" (individual, company, role, etc). Each Entity can have multiple Address , Phone , E-Mail entries. Each of these defines a "relationship" (home/work/assistant, etc) Entity {1} --{relationship}--> {0..*} Data An Entity can have multiple fields that are freeform data storage for other "generic" data (birthdays, AIM account, etc) Entity {1} --{fieldName}--> {0..*} Field Data An Entity can link to another Entity for instance as a employee , spouse Entity {0.. } {0.. } Entity Has anyone done any SQL implementations of similar contact databases? Any insight/suggestions/pitfalls to avoid that you could share with someone trying to work on a project by themselves here? Does what I have described seem reasonable or overcomplicated? One question, lets say you have 4 people who all work for the same company. They all have the same "work" phone number (perhaps with a different extension) - If the number or address for "work" changes, I'd like to be able to update the contacts fairly easily. Now a lot of this comes down to how you would use the database. I'm thinking that this becomes a matter of linking employee's to their respective company entities, but then the address/phone number is no longer directly connected to the employee. I'm kind of debating making the Entity/data relationship many to many allowing you to attach the same mailing address/phone number to multiple people, and updating it in one place can update it in all places. Am I just over thinking this? pulls out hair
