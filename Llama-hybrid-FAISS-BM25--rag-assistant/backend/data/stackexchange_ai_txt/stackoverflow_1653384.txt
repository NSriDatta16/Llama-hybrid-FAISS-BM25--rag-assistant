What matters the most is how quickly the hard drive can access the data (usually called the access time ). The faster your drive can access the hundreds of tiny files that the compiler accesses as it builds your project, the better. RPMs may improve the access time a bit, but not as much as switching to drives that use different mechanisms and interfaces. Unfortunately, most hard drive manufacturers don't publish the average access time. Instead, they promote the seek time (the time it takes to move the read/write head from track to track) and the latency (the time it takes the platters to rotate 1/2 revolution). The access time should be roughly equal to seek+latency. Most consumer 3.5" SATA drives have a seek time of 8-12 ms, a figure which has remained relatively unchanged even as the RPMs went from 5400 to 7200. By contrast, SCSI and SAS drives have seek times of 3.5-4.5 ms. They've always been faster than SATA/ATA drives, due to their more robust actuators and better interfaces. SSD drives have near-zero access time.
