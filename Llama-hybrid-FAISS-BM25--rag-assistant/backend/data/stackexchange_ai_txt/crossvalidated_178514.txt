Bias in bagged decision tree estimates of probability (classification)

As far as I understand it, random forests are as biased as any tree in the forest. Bagging a non-random forest (using all available variables at any given split) is unbiased -- bias in random forests comes from sampling the independent variables. However, is $$ \widehat{pr}(y)_{bagging} = N^{-1}\displaystyle\sum_{trees}vote(y=1) $$ a unbiased measure of the probability of $y=1$? The following suggests not: par(mfrow=c(1,1)) N=3000 x = rnorm(N) yt = pnorm(x+rnorm(N)) y = as.factor(yt>.5) m = randomForest(y=y,x = cbind(x),mtry=1) yhat = predict(m,type='prob')[,2] plot(yt,yhat) abline(lm(yhat~yt),col='red',lwd=2) Am I missing something? I ask because I've recently heard some loose talk about bagging replacing nonparametric regression in contexts where causality is important.
