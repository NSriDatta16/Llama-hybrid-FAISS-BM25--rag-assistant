Mean squared error of 2 distributions when there are many zero values

I am comparing two (2-D) distributions using mean squared error. I take the difference between distributions, square them, average them and multiply them by the area of a pixel/bin. These distributions represent the receptive field of a neuron, so are mostly zeros surrounding a 2-D Gaussian. The problem I have is that as I decrease the binsize of my distributions the number of bins containing zero increases, as a result the mean squared error of bins decreases, even though the underlying distributions themselves have not changed. I would like to compare errors across different binsizes, so is there a way to correct MSE when there are many zeros? Or is there a way to correct for binsize that I have missed? Or is there a better approach I could use?
