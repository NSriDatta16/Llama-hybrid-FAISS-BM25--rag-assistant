How to construct GLMM with differing random effect variance structure by group?

I have a longitudinal dataset with a normally distributed outcome variable, a normally distributed predictor variable, and a binary grouping variable. I am trying to construct a GLMM with differing random effect variance structures for group 1 and group 0. The code that I am using is library(lme4) dat$group1 = ifelse(dat$group==0, 1, 0) dat$group0 = ifelse(dat$group==1, 1, 0) mod The output that I get is: Groups Name Variance Std.Dev. visit_individual group0 466.81 21.606 visit_individual.1 group1 676.92 26.018 Residual 352.60 18.778 Does this look right? What mathematical model does this correspond to? My interpretation of the output is that variance for group0 describes, on average, how much the outcome bounces around from group 0 participant to group 0 participant and the variance for group1 describes, on average, how much the outcome bounces around from group 1 participant to group 1 participant. What does the residual variance describe here?
