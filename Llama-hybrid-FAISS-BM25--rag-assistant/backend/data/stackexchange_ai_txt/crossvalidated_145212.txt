What mathematical background do I need for the Gaussian Process book by Rasmussen and Williams?

I started reading the book today, but right off the bat, he mentions infinite Hilbert spaces in the notation, so I feel that it might be out of my league. I am familiar with linear algebra, probability and statistics, and basic multivariable calculus (up to Green's theorem).
