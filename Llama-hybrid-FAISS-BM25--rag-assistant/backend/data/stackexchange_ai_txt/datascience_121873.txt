Problem with the size of test data?

I am working on my thesis, which has two different research questions: Evaluate transformer models while incorporating non textuel features Evaluate the importance of data quality in tranformer models So, I have two different datasets with various qualities. My approach: The validation set was created by selecting 10% of the crowdsourced dataset, while the test set consisted of 10% of the ground truth dataset. Problem here is that the test set doesn't have much samples. Here is the distribution: 6 samples for label 0 24 samples for label 1 74 samples for label 2 So basically the evaluation won't be that significant, but the problem is that I can't merge both validation and test set, since I am assuming that the test data has better quality? Does anyone have an idea how I can tackle this problem. Thanks !
