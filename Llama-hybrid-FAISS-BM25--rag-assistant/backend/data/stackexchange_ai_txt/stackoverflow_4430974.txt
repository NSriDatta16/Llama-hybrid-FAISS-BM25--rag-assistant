Is there a standard and an implementation for Icalendar event RSVP

The summary is that I am now implementing an event confirmation system and can't find the right format for the ICalendar replies. Therefore I wonder if there is an example out there of complete REPLY message and maybe a PHP library that would wrap it all? Now for the details, we get external emails including event invitations asking for RSVP. Here is an excerpt of the iCal file: ATTENDEE;ROLE=REQ-PARTICIPANT;PARTSTAT=NEEDS-ACTION;RSVP=TRUE;CN="'user@company.com'":MAILTO:user@company.com ORGANIZER;CN="Organ Izer":MAILTO:organizer@company.com I couldn't find the reply standard to send the RSVP to the organizer. The RFC 2447 mentions "ATTSTAT" and "PARTSTAT" parameter. By trying to mail the following message to Google calendar the event is not being updated. $headers = "Content-Type:text/calendar; Content-Disposition: inline; charset=utf-8;\r\n"; $headers .= "Content-Type: text/plain;charset=\"utf-8\"\r\n"; $headers .= 'BEGIN:VCALENDAR VERSION:2.0 METHOD:REPLY BEGIN:VEVENT ORGANIZER;CN=JCharles:mailto:abcdef@gmail.com UID:oc7ae7537999onscsivg8km123@google.com ATTENDEE;CUTYPE=INDIVIDUAL;ROLE=REQ-PARTICIPANT;PARTSTAT=CONFIRMED;RSVP= TRUE;CN=jc@company.se;X-NUM-GUESTS=0:mailto:jc@company.se LOCATION: SEQUENCE:1 END:VEVENT END:VCALENDAR'; mail('abcdef@gmail.com', 'Accepted:', "Event accepted", $headers); Is there anything wrong with the Ical message or with the method in itself? Is this the way the event replies are supposed to be sent?
