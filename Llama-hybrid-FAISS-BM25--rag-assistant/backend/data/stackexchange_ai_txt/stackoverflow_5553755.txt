Make regressions and predictions for groups in R

I have the following data.frame d from an experiment: - Variable y (response, continuous) - Factor f (500 levels) - Time t (posixct) In the last 8 years, y was measured roughly once a month (exact date in t) for each level of f. Sometimes there are 2 measures per month, sometimes a couple of month passed without any measures. Sorry for not providing example data, but making up unregular time series goes beyond my R knowledge. ;) I'd like to do the following with this data: make a regression using the loess() function (y ~ t) , for each level of f make a prediction of y for the first day of each month and each level of f The first point I think I solved by using Hadleys answer to this question: models So, now I have a models (class list ), with a model for each level of f . I also created times for which I'd like to predict y for each level of f like this: dates But now I'm stuck on how to make predictions for each model. Something like this should work (pseudocode): for each f in models p.f As a result, I'd like to have this data.frame: y.predicted f t.predicted (= dates) Any help would be greatly appreciated.
