Possible yes, sensible no from most time series perspectives. The main problem with your approach is an apparent assumption that removal of seasonality is, or should be, a trivial matter. But in practice most modern procedures require some kind of estimation of seasonal components based on some choice(s) on how to model it, especially because seasonal components usually vary from year to year. Conversely, if your seasonal components are essentially deterministic, this would be trivial. Weeks are especially awkward as they don't nest in years. If you are primarily interested in methods that ignore seasonality, datasets with major seasonality don't seem pertinent. Why make the problem more difficult than it is already?
