You may find the Salient Object Segmentation so useful in your problem. Here is the idea: When human freely looks at a scene, there are some objects that involuntarily grabs the human attention . These objects are often the most informative ones in the scene, and are passed for detailed analysis in Human Visual System. Skipping the neuro-scientific aspect of this field of study, Visual Saliency detection researchers in Computer Vision Computer community are making amazing improvements on proposing algorithms to make the machine to predict these regions in an image. Interestingly, these salienct objects are the objects in the scene which convey the most amount of information regarding the scene or whatever. Another bonus is that there are plenty of ready-to-launch implementation over the web which can be used. Just google the term: "Salient Object Segmentation" or "Human Fixation Prediction" and pick one out of pool.
