The answer from Thomas Lumley (+1) states the issues with respect to logistic regression quite clearly. This question might, however, be extended to whether logistic regression is the best choice for developing a probability model when specific downstream uses and associated cost-based probability cut-offs are in mind, as posited in the question. Logistic regression implicitly involves log-loss as the scoring rule, which puts emphasis on extremes of probability estimates. Other scoring rules emphasize other regions of the probability scale, which might be more attuned to the anticipated downstream cost/benefit tradeoffs. See this paper as an example of how to tune the choice of a proper scoring rule to handle such situations and to develop a probability model that isn't strictly a logistic regression.
