How to delete part of a CSV string using Ruby?

I have a string: "116,118,120,130" and will want to delete either the first, last or any value in between upon execution. To to this I was using: "116,118,120,130".gsub('118','') but the problem is the string contains an extra unnessesary comma: "116,,120,130" and if I use "116,118,120,130".gsub(',116','') it will remove the comma, but then won't match "116" in the string as there is no comma in front of "116" How can I match parts of my string that may or my not have the comma in front of value I am removing elegantly? Thanks,
