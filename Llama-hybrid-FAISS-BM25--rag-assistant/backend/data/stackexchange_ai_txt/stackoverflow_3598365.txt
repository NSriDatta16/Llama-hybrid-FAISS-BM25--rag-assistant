This is a long shot, but it could be that something small is mapped near 0x40000000 (maybe a DLL?), and since the kernel cannot find a contiguous VA space that is the size you want (i.e. you've got enough, but it's split up), it fails. If you want to map in gigantic files, it's much easier on a modern architecture - as you only get maybe 1.5GB guaranteed VA space for user-mode processes on Windows once you subtract all the DLLs and heap.
