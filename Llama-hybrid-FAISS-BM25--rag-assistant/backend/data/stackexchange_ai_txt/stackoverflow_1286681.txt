Yes, heaps have issues. Your data will logically fragment all over the show and can not be defragmented simply. Imagine throwing all your telephone directory into a bucket and then trying to find "bob smith". Or using a conventional telephone directory with a clustered index on lastname, firstname. The overhead of maintaining the index is trivial. StartDate, unless unique, is not a good choice. A clustered index requires internal uniqueness for the non-clustered indexes. If not declared unique, SQL Server will add a 4 byte "uniquifier". Yes, I'd use int or bigint to make it easier. As for GUIDs: see the questions at the right hand side of the screen. Edit: Note, PK and clustered index are 2 separate issues even if SQL Server be default will make the PK clustered.
