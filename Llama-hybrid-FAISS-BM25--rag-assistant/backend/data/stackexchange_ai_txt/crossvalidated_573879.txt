What does Feed Forward Policy in terms of Reinforcement Learning?

While reading Reinforcement Learning, I saw the term, Feed Forward Policy and the article also says that it does not have memory, what does "it does not have memory" also mean? If possible, I hope that somebody turn the following paragraph more expressive words as easy as plainly understandable.
