As has been said iPhone Safari will render site very well. However sites optimised, or at least designed for 800x600 and larger do not show up well on the 320x356 on the iphone viewport. A lot of detail is lost and clicking on links can be a hiy and miss affair. The best approach is to rewrite the essential pages with the iPhone viewport in mind and only put the essential elements in. The iPhone can be detected as follows: $browser = strpos($_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'],"iPhone"); if ($browser == true) { echo 'Code You Want To Execute'; } else{echo 'just carry on';} And then the pages need to be built by analysing the essential elements of the web site that a user is likely to want when browsing on a smaller form factor device. With of course links back to full site. Apple may do guidelines for this and certainly eBay has done some work that can be seen by browsing there. In the short space here i cannot go into more detail on how you do that redesign but its by discussion, analysis of site usage and talking to users or owners of the site.
