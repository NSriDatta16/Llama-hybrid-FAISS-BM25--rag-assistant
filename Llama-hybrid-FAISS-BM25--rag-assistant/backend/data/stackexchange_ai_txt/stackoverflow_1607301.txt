The most pragmatic solution would be to define a template in your IDE or editor so that the repetitive code can be inserted with a single key combo. Due to Java's lack of closures or delegates and the more verbose syntax for anonymous classes, the resulting code might even be shorter than the "generic" solution. Additionally, (and unless your method call needs the indexes as parameter) you can use the "enhanced for loop" for a cleaner syntax: for(MyObject[] row: table) { for(MyObject cell : row) { cell.MyMethod(); } }
