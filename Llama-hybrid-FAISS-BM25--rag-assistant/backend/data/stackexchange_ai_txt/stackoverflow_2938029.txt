eclEmma - full code coverage on class header?

I have a class that starts with: public class GeneralID implements WritableComparable { ... } And another that is: public class LineValuesMapper extends Mapper { ... } All methods in these classes are covered. But not their header. The header of both classes gets painted as yellow with EclEmma. The covered instructions for these classes are: Element Coverage Covered Instructions Total Instructions LineValuesMapper.java 97.3 % 145 149 GeneralID.java 99.3 % 566 570 Is there anything I can do to fully cover the class header?
