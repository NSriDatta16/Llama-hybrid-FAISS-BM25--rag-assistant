Do you mean that from a set of N colors, you need to pick M colors, where M best representation of the N colors in the M space? As a better example, reduce a true-color (24 bit color space) to a 8-bit mapped color space (GIF?). There are quantization algorithms for this, like the Adaptive Spatial Subdivision algorithm used by ImageMagic. These algorithms usually don't just pick existing colors from the source space but creates new colors in the target space that most closely resemble the source colors. As a simplified example, if you have 3 colors in the original image where two are red (with different intensity or bluish tints etc.) and the third is blue, and need to reduce to two colors, the target image could have a red color that is some kind of average of the original two red + the blue color from the original image. If you need something else then I didn't understand your question :)
