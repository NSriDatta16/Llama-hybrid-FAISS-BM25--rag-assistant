Does jquery clone() user documentfragment internally?

I am inserting elements into dom dynamically and for that i m using following steps :(jquery) The initial dom structure is as below: clone the parent div using jquery .clone() clone the child div and do manipulation append to the cloned parent do this for all child data (parentdiv original).replaceAll(clonedparent) Basically i want to clone the parent div in a manner so that it is available as a documentfragment and so that appending doesnt happen on the dom and gain performance . Will jQuery clone() give the performance advantage by behaving like documentfragment? Or is there a better way to do this? I don't want to construct each child element as HTML string as the structure of them is pretty complex.
