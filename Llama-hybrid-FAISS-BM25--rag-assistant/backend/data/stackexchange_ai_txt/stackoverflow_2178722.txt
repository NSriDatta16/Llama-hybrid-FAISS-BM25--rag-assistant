From wikipedia: (computing) A variable that is associated with a value, and therefore a variable that has an allocated storage location. If the programming language implements a representation of a canonical unknown value, infinity, etc., the value bound to the variable may be one of these. Notice the bold portion Variables that are not bound to a location are known as free variables.
