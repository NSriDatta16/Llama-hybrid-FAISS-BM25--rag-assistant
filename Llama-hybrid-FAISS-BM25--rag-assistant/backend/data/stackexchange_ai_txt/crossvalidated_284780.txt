Why not use Regression methods instead of Time Series?

Please consider myself as newbie to data science, specifically to Time Series. As I can see in time series we are trying to predict the future based on past values. Isn't this problem can be formulated as any supervised machine learning problem with time also as one of the feature? Aren't they more accurate than timeseries models considering they can capture more than one predictors, apart from time? In real time data the time series data is always affected more than time itself isn't it? Is it still relevant?
