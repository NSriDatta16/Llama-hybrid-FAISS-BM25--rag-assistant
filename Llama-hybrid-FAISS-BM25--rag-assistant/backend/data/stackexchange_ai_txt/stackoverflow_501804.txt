Could you do a risk analysis? This is an accepted project management discipline and essentially involves enumerating the risks, making an attempt to quantify them in terms of likelihood and impact, and identifying possible mitigating measures. That approach should work for source control at least, unless your boss wilfully ignores the risks, which would be very... courageous of him. :-) If a source code disaster does occur yuour boss bis going to look pretty stupid (and reckless) and you're going to look prescient. Peter's suggesiton is good as well - set it up for yourself and then, when someone loses some source code, or some changes, casually say "Oh, I did that recently but I just re-fetched the previous version from source control and only lost about 20 minutes' work. Do you want me to set you up with a login?")
