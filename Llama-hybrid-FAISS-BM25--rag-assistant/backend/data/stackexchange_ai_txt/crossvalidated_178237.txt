For method 1, you are looking at the probability of having problems for a given contractor for ONE typical house. That means the house itself is considered average in terms of the features you used. This is good indication for people that want to make houses similar to the "typical" house. For method 2, you are looking at the average probability of having problems for a given contractor over all the houses; this gives a good look at the contractor's average performance on all types of houses. It's a better indication of overall performance than method 1 but it depends on your sample of houses. If your sample contains a lot of say, 3-floor houses and a particular contractor specializes in 3-floor houses, then their performance might look better than a contractor that specializes in bungalows.
