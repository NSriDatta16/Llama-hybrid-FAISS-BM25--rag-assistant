How do i merge these two database tables into a single result set?

I have two tables in the system. I'm trying to make a VIEW that represents them both together, and i'm not sure how this can be done or even IF this can be done. Pets PetId INT PK Name VARCHAR(100) PetOtherNames PetID INT PK FK Name VARCHAR(100) PK So, i have a table of pets. The name (in this table) is their formal common name. Each pet maybe have Zero-To-Many other names. These names are never displayed BUT are to be used in a search query. So, lets look at some data. Pets Data 1. Fred 2. Barney 3. Foo 4. Megan Fox (boom tish) PetsOtherName Data 2. B-b-b-Barney 2. Bannana Barney 2. Banannarama 4. TapTap So ... if i make a VIEW of these two tables, i expect the following results.... SELECT * FROM PetsView ORDER BY PetId, Name 1. Fred 2. B-b-b-Barney 2. Barney 2. Bannana Barney 2. Banannarama 3. Foo 4. Megan Fox 4. TapTap And this will then enable me to do the following .... SELECT PetId, Name FROM PetsView WHERE CONTAINS(Name, 'Fox') ... and returns 4. Fox SELECT PetId, Name FROM PetsView WHERE CONTAINS(Name, 'Fox') ... and returns 4. TapTap cheers :) PS. I'm not sure i worded the title of this post, so please feel free to edit it appropriately (or suggest a better title, for me to update). Update: This is for sql2008, but i'm assuming the result would be tsql .. so it should/could apply accross the board.
