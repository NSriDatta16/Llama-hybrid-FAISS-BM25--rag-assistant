This isn't a technical answer, but it might help you come up with one: Convert the plot to an image, and stick it into a decent image program like gimp or photoshop break the plots into discrete images whenever there's a gap put the first series of plots in a horizontal line put the second series in a horizontal line right underneath it visually identify the first correlated event if the two events are not lined up vertically: select whichever instance is further to the left and everything to the right of it on that row drag those things to the right until they line up This is pretty much how an audio editor works, so you if you converted it into a simple audio format like an uncompressed WAV file, you could manipulate it directly in something like Audacity. (It'll sound horrible, of course, but you'll be able to move the data plots around pretty easily.) Actually, audacity has a scripting language called nyquist, too, so if you don't need the program to detect the correlations (or you're at least willing to defer that step for the time being) you could probably use some combination of audacity's markers and nyquist to automate the alignment and export the clean data in your format of choice once you tag the correlation points.
