Logistic regression is a good place to start. I'm guessing you'd get better accuracy if you transform your vector of points to a single trajectory value, like degrees or something similar. This could be done with linear regression or just some math. Simpler predictors are better, assuming you don't throw out too much information in the simplification process. Medium is a good place for walkthroughs.
