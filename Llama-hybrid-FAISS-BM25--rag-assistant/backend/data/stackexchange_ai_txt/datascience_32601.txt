Dueling DQN - Advantage Stream, why use average and not the tanh?

For Dueling DQN (page 5) , why do authors use an average for Advantage stream, and don't simply "activate" the Advantage stream (with a $tanh$ for example)? Would "activating" work in theory, and is it a similar idea to what the authors intended to achieve, or am I missing the point? To remind, this is the equation, which Produces a Q-value for the taken action $a$ by combining the Value stream with the Advantage stream: $$Q(s,a; \theta, \alpha, \beta) = V(s; \theta, \beta) + \biggl( A(s, a; \theta, \alpha) - \frac{1}{N}\sum_{a'}^{N}A(s, a'; \theta, \alpha) \biggr)$$ where $s$ is the current state we are in $a$ is the action we've decided to take $a'$ is one of any action we could have taken (including the action we've taken) $\theta$ are parameters (weights) of the network before the "splitting" into two separate streams $\alpha$ are the parameters of Advantage stream $\beta$ are the parameters of the Value stream
