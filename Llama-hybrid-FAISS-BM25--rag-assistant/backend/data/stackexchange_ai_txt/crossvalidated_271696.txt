Observations made if dataset performs better on Linear Kernel than Polynomial Kernel in SVM and vice versa?

When I run a dataset using Support Vector Machines(SVM) and I am use both Polynomial and Linear Kernels. The performance I obtain is different, so I was wondering if there is any information I can obtain about the data from how it performs on each kernel. Or phrased in a different way, what kind of data tends to perform better with a Polynomial Kernel vs a Linear Kernel and vice versa.
