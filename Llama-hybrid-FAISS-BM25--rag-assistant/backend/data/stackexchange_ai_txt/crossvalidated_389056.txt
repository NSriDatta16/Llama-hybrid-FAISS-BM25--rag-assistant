Logistic regression vs Poisson log link

The exercise is to predict the success rate for different groups of students. Here's sample data (using R): require(data.table) sampleDT Two GLM approaches are considered here: Logistic regression with 'num_students' as weights: glm(success_rate ~ Age + Gender, data = sampleDT, family = binomial("logit"), weights = num_students) Poisson log-link regression: glm(success ~ Age + Gender, data = sampleDT, family = poisson, weights = num_students) We can just run these two models and see which one gives better result, but I would like to step a bit back and try to understand it. So here's my question(s): How would you decide which approach to take? What assumptions we're making if we take either of the approach?
