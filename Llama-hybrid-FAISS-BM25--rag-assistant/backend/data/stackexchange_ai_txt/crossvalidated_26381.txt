What is the difference between tapped delay line and sliding window in a neural network?

I'm trying to model some time series data, and I've been reading about tapped delay line and sliding window to transform the input data. In my understanding a sliding window with windows size 1 shifts the inputs by one at each time step and feeds them back to a feed forward neural network. target| input 2| 1 0 3| 2 1 4| 3 2 5| 4 3 6| 5 4 7| 6 5 In my understanding, a tapped delay line with delay 2 takes the two most recent inputs and outputs and feeds them back to a recurrent neural network y(t) = f(x(t-1),y(t-1)) Is there a difference? Why are there different names? Please correct me if I'm wrong.
