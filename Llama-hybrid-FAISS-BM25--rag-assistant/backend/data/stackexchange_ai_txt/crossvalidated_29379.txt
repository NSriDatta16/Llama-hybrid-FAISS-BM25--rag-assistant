Panel-data exploratory data analysis

I have a dataset for around 40k firms over fiscal years 1950-2011 with about 430k firm-years. If I'm not mistaken I have panel-data. In addition, the firms are nested within 9 industries. I created a unique identifier ticn for each firm. Years are indicated by fyear . For now my variables of interest are yearly sales sale , yearly advertising xad , and yearly R&D expenses xrd . I have industry dummies indicated by sicagg . I am interested in the relationship between yearly sales and advertising/R&D expenditures, including some control variables. Currently I am in the exploratory phase of my research. So my objective, I want to get a feel for the data, give descriptives and maybe make a few plots. First I computed between and within descriptive statistics (mean, stdev, min and max). I also made scatter plots between sales, R&D and advertising. In addition, I plotted the time-series of the yearly average advertising expenses for each industry in a nice graph. Can you give me ideas for additional analyses? Thanks in advance!
