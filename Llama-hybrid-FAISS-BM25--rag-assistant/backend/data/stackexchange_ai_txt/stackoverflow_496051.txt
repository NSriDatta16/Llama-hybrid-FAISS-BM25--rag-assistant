I have had a similar issue where there has been a table of start/end dates designed for data storage but not for reporting. I sought out the "fastest executing" solution and found that it was to create a 2nd table with the monthly values in there. I populated it with the months from Jan 2000 to Jan 2070. I'm expecting it will suffice or that I get a large pay cheque in 2070 to come and update it... DECLARE TABLE months (start DATETIME) -- Populate with all month start dates that may ever be needed -- And I would recommend indexing / primary keying by start SELECT months.start, data.id, SUM(CASE WHEN data.start months.start GROUP BY months.start, data.id That join can be quite slow for various reasons, I'll search out another answer to another question to show why and how to optimise the join. EDIT: Here is another answer relating to overlapping date ranges and how to speed up the joins... Query max number of simultaneous events
