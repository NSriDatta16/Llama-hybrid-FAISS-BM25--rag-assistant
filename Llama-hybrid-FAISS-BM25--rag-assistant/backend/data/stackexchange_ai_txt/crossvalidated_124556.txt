Posterior predictive check following ABC inference for multiple parameters

I am relatively new to Bayesian statistics so please be gentle. I have just performed Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) for the inference of a multi-parameter model. Now I am looking to perform a posterior predictive check on the parameters that have been inferred. What I am wanting to know is that, when sampling from the posterior to generate the summary statistics for the posterior predictive check, do I sample independently from the marginal posteriors for each parameters, or am I supposed to sample the parameter values jointly (i.e. sample from the exact parameter combinations that gave rise to the accepted summary statistics). The model contains a lot of parameters (over 6) and I am interested in the marginal posteriors for each parameter. I hope this question makes sense.
