Could you give the specifics of the visible item and the container(s) it's in? Is it a matter of having to scroll some container to get to the buttons? Or is it a matter of someone has dragged a child window of a flexlib:MDICanvas partially off screen? I think it's going to come down to if the x,y position of the component is beyond the width and height of its container, (and so on up through the parent containers until you reach your top level Application.)
