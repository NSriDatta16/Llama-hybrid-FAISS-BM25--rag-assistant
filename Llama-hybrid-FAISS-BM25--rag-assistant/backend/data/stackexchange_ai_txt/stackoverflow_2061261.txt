Create a subclass of the button, then override these methods so that the button will catch events but ignore them if some property of the button is set to NO: touchesBegan:withEvent: touchesCancelled:withEvent: touchesEnded:withEvent: touchesMoved:withEvent: These are methods of UIResponder. Have them just call their [super ...] method if you want the event handled, otherwise just don't call it and return if you want the events "eaten".
