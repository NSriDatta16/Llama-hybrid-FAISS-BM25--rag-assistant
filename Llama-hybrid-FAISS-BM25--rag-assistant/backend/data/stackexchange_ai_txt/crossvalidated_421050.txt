In the context of machine learning, consider the iris dataset, what exactly the sample space, attribute space, feature space is?

Sample space, attribute space, feature space are used everywhere. It seems that a lot posts talk about these concepts without a really specific example. This post uses a conceptual example a little bit away from real life. there is no real data in there. does't talk about the relation between feature space and sample space setting features like $\text{distance travelled} \in R$ , $\text{time duration} \in R$ does not make sense to me (more precisely, I cannot understand), why would time duration be negative value in real life? Columbia's glossary gives Feature Space is The set X of feature vectors x that can be used as input to a classifier. and Feature Vector is A vector of features, denoted by x. In general, a classification function is a function defined on feature vectors and taking values in a set of class labels. set Y. wiki gives The vector space associated with these vectors is often called the feature space Let's talk about these based on the iris dataset , where there are 150 instances and 4 attributes. Attribute Information: 1. sepal length in cm 2. sepal width in cm 3. petal length in cm 4. petal width in cm 5. class: -- Iris Setosa -- Iris Versicolour -- Iris Virginica I assume attribute space and feature space are the same thing, concerned about the 4 attributes. Based on all above, what exactly the sample space, attribute space/feature space is?
