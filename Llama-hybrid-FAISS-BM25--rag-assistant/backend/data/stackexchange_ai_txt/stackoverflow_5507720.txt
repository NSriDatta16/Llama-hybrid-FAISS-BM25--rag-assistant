Actionscript 3 Package/Constructors

I've written a small game in AS3.0 where all the source files were in the root directory, no package organization whatsoever; mainly because it was a spur of the moment thing. I've since moved everything into a proper package structure so I can organize, maintain, and continue to expand. The problem with this move is that nothing works anymore. I continuously get an "1136 : Incorrect number of arguments. Expected 0" error on the majority of my constructors. All the package declarations look fine... besides it would tell me if it couldn't find a class. Also, the errors seem to be happening on classes that are linked to movieclips. I started to think that passing arguments to a linked class isn't allowed, but then again it works well when all the source is in one location. Anyhow I tried using a no argument constructor and creating convenience methods/functions for the values I need to set quickly... now it doesn't understand my convenience function!? Can someone shed some light please. Sincerely frustrated,
