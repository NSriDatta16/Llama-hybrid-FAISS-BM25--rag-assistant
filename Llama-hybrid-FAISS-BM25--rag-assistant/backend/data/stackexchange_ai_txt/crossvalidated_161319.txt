Error with lapply and robust regression

First let me start off by saying I know the consequences that come with removing/ignoring outliers.. but for this particular case I am just looking at weekly trends in the equipment I collect data from (a little over 100 sensors). I need to ignore "leverage points" that ruin R sqd values. I need to see if any of my sensors are trending out of their normal operating limits over time using simple regressions. rm(list=ls()) mtcars I have also tried just removing any data points in each column that are outside of +-3 Sigma but I wasn't able to get that working...
