Can't access global variable inside of a usort() function call

I'm trying to use usort() and leverage a global variable inside its function scope, but without success. I've simplified my code down to bare bones to show what I mean: $testglobal = 1; function cmp($a, $b) { global $testglobal; echo 'hi' . $testglobal; } usort($topics, "cmp"); Assuming the usort() runs twice, my expectations is this will be the output: hi1hi1 Instead, my output is: hihi I've read the manual ( http://us.php.net/usort ) and I don't see any limitations on accessing global variables. If I assign the usort() to a variable that I echo, it outputs 1, so the usort() is definitely running successfully (plus, there are all those "hi's").
