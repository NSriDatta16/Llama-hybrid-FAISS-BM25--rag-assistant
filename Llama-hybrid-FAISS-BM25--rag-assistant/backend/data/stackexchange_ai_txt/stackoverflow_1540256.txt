My decision on which method to use comes from how many records are needed and how likely the amount of information is to change. If you are just listing a few views, one table is good. If the number of products + categories + pages is less than a thousand, I would combine them in one table. The advantage is that if you want to later add a field (example: an obsolete flag), you would only need to add it to one table. The disadvantage is that you are using (slightly) more space, i.e. storage & memory. As the number of records gets larger, separating the lists can improve performance. If one type is far more numerous than the others, the smaller types can get bogged down in the parsing or maintenance of the table. If time treats the types differently, space can become an issue. Example: If Products start to need more information (like style, price, or who is allowed to view it), but Pages and Categories never do, the table would reserve space that Pages and Categories will never use. Then, the Pages and Category records start to look silly mingled with Products.
