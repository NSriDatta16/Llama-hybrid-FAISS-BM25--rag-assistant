Getting SQL Connection fragmentation, different way to connect to DB's

We have multiple DB servers. On one of the servers we have a master config table that holds instructions as to what DB server and DataBase name an Agency is supposed to use. Currently each Database always has 2 connections on them, even if they're not being used (which we are fixing). However, we're trying to find a way to make it so our connections are not all over the place, and relieve some of the stress on our DB Servers. After a lot of research we found some articles saying to do all connections to a central location, and then Change which database we're using through the SQLConnection object. Which seems a bit roundabout, but could work. So I'm wondering what others do in this situation? The current path for this is: -User Logs in -System access ConfigTable to find out which database user is going to connect to. -System loads the Agency connection settings into memory (SEssion) for that user. -Every request now directly hits that users database. Is there a more efficient way of doing this?
