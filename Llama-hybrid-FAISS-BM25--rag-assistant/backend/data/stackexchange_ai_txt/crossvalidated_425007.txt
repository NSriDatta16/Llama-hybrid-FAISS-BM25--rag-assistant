How to run Bayesian A/B testing when your users have a cardinal feature that impacts the treatment set

Suppose you want to run a Bayesian A/B testing to establish whether a certain action influenced conversion rate of your users. What would be the best ways to incorporate the notion that each user has a cardinal feature (e.g. age, average money spent) that impacts the conversion rate when the action is applied (e.g. users in the treatment set that spent more money are more likely to not convert)? Another example would be the following: you want to check the effect of a drug on curing a condition (cured/not cured) so you give sample a placebo and another the real drug. You also suspect that the age has an impact in curing the condition once the drug is given (e.g. the older you are, the more the the drug has effect in curing the condition). Is A/B testing the right way to approach this problem or can you suggest any other solutions? Do you have any suggestion on sources with walk through concrete examples one can utilize to learn more on how to conduct this kind of non-plain scenario with Bayesian techniques?
