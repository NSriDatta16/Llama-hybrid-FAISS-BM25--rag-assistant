Using one-hot encoded features along with continuous-valued features?

The task I wanted to do is a prediction task where most of the features are continuous numbers and some of the features are one-hot encoded. I am training a neural network and I wondered that, is it sensible from a methodological perspective? If not, can someone tell me why?
