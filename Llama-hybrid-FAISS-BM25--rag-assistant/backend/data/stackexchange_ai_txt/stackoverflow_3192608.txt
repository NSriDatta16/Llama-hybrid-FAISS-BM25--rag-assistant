Drag and drop a child node

I had populated data in TreeView control. How will I drag a particular child node from a parent node and drop the dragged one to a DIV or any portion, using JQUERY ? I know in jquery, there are methods "draggable" and "droppable" to make this possible. But I want to drag a particular child node and drop it. Or atleast How to fetch the text/id of a particular child node using jquery ? I hope I can drag,if I can fetch the child node
