Firefox textarea typing causing screen shaking (firefox2 winXP)

EDIT: Firefox 2 windows XP Steps to reproduce problem: Firefox 2 and visit: http://resopollution.com/rentfox/html/property_setup.html Begin Typing and pressing [enter key] to create new lines After about 10 [enter key] presses you'll notice the screen shaking How this happened This began happening after I installed a plugin for jQuery. It's located here: http://resopollution.com/rentfox/html//js/textarea.js It makes it so the textarea is expandable as I type, depending on how many lines there are in the text area, up to a max-height value which can be specified in CSS. I tried disabling the 'setHeight' function within this plugin (the only thing that changes height dynamically) but I still saw the screen shaking. When I think the problem might be Firefox thinks that the screen just got larger, and compensates by putting in a scrollbar on the right side of the body document. However, it realizes that in fact the page didn't get larger, and removes the scrollbar, causing the shaking. I have no idea where in the code that makes Firefox think this way... Appreciate any help.
