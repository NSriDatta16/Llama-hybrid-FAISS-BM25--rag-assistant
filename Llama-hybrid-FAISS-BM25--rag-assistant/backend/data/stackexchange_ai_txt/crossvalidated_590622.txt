What you are proposing to create are called statistical control or Shewhart charts. There are many references, I would recommend Chapter 14 of Box's book "Statistics for Experimenters". In response to your questions: Regarding 1., if you can't pin down a reason why the 1GB transfer is abnormal, then there is no reason to exclude it, since it comes up as part of the "normal operation" of the process. This implies that the mean and sd you will use should take that value into account, otherwise you will underestimate the variability. Of course, you may want your chart to forget about values very far in the past, and therefore take only the mean and sd based on the last $N$ values, for some well-chosen $N$ . If, on the other hand, you can flag the value of 1GB as erroneous, then you need not consider it in the computation of your mean and sd. Regarding 2., a simple adjustment would be to compare each measurement with the mean of the corresponding category (weekdays vs not). You could compute two means and two sds, one for each category, and only compare like with like. A better model would use a time series model (these are briefly covered in the Box book).
