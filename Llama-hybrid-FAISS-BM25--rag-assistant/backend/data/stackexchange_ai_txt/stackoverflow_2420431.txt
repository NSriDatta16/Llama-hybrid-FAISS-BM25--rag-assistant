How to setup Replication or Federation between MySQL and Derby?

Perhaps this is not possible yet, but... What's the easiest way to setup Replication or Federation between MySQL and Derby? I need a way for data updates/inserts/deletes into a certain table in Derby to automatically flow into an equivalent identical table in MySQL, as quickly and efficiently as possible. This can be done in application code of course, but it would be inelegant, slow, and inefficient to say the least.
