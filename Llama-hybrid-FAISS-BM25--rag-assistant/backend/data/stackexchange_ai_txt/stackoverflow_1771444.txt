ASP.NET Ajax ReOrderList - Any way to disable specific items from being dragged and dropped?

I have an ajax controltoolkit reorderlist within an asp.net application. I need to disable certain specific steps from being reordered. This has to be done dynamically. All steps are consecutive and start from the beginning, but it's not known until runtime how many need to be disabled from being reordered any further. I tried the e.item.enabled = false for reorderlist_itemdatabound but this just disabled links. I need to disable the drag handler. Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks!
