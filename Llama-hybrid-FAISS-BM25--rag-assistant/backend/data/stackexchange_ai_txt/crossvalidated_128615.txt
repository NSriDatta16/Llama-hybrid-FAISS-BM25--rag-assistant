A logit model is a linearization of a nonlinear relationship between the X's and the dichotomous outcome. The slope is therefore constant everywhere in X. As far as the predicted probabilities, the average predicted probability is just the proportion of 1's in your data. So you want to identify for what value of X does an observation have a higher probability of being 1 than the overall proportion. You can do that a number of ways - one way would be to estimate the predicted probabilities for each level of X (keeping other variables in your model at their means), sort them and see at which point is it higher than the overall. (You can find this out by looking at the coefficients and doing some arithmetic, but this may be easier if you have trouble with converting log-odds to p). You can also estimate a confidence interval around the marginal effect (i.e. average probability) at each level. I haven't done this in R though it probably isn't that complicated - in Stata, you run your logit and then do margins. For example, I simulated some data where the overall sample probability is 0.391, and one standard normal predictor x, where the true logit coefficient was 2. In Stata, here is my output: logit y x Logistic regression Number of obs = 1000 LR chi2(1) = 504.19 Prob > chi2 = 0.0000 Log likelihood = -417.09877 Pseudo R2 = 0.3767 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ y | Coef.

EDIT : Per whuber's comments below, this approach doesn't account for the sampling variation of the mean from the data. It will tell you a difference from a particular value, which may happen in this instance to be the mean of your sample. But it may not address your specific question.
