If I understand correctly, the problem you are facing is that by using MSE you are developing a poor predictor. This is a common issue on skewed-population problems. For example, if you were trying to predict if a person has cancer or not (binary) in a popluation where 99% of people dont have cancer, by analyzing a routine blood exam, a model trained by minimizing MSE would say that nobody has cancer, and would by 99% precise. One way to address this issue is to use Fscore instead of Precision, or MSE. Fscore is an error metric that uses both Precision and Recall. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_score I learnt this in Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Course on Coursera. Here is a video of the specific class on error metrics for skewed classes. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj605bVFH8Y Hope this helps!
