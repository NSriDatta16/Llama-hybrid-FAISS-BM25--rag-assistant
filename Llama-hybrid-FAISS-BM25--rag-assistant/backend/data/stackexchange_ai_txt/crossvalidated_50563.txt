You will want to use 60 divided by the number of breaths, not the other way around. Consider if you take 20 breaths; then the average length of each breath is 60/20 = 3 seconds. Doing this once will give you a single observation; so it won't have a distribution and standard deviation as such. However, if you do it multiple times you will get a slightly different answer each time (particularly if don't round eg you can record if you take 20.3 breaths, not just whole breaths -as ideally you should). That set of observations will have a distribution and everything that goes along with it, including shape and standard deviation. Rounding will definitely be a problem if precision is important. It would be mitigated by using a longer test period than a minute.
