Fill the missing values (NA) in various columns (independently of each other) using imputeTS package (in particular, na_kalman function)

A friend of mine has recently started working on R-studio and is interested in filling the NA values in different columns using the above-mentioned function. Also, since he intends to run a time series analysis for every column, what should be the correct approach?
