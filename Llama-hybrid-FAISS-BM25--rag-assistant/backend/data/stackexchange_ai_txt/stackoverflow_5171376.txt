How can I test drag-and-drop functionality between applications?

I'm writing a Cocoa app which allows the user to drag content to another application. I'd like to write an automated GUI test for this behavior. I can move the mouse cursor using CGDisplayMoveCursorToPoint() . How can I issue mousedown and mouseup events to simulate a drag and drop operation?
