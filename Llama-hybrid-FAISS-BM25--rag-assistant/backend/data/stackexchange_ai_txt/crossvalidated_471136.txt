Two dummy variable case I think you would find it easier if you expressed your first model like this: Wage = $β_0 + β_1Female + β_2Black + β_3Female*Black + \epsilon$ If the error term $\epsilon$ has a mean of zero, that implies that: Mean Wage = $β_0 + β_1Female + β_2Black + β_3Female*Black$ . Assume the dummy variable $Female$ is defined as: $Female = 1$ if the study subject is a female and 0 if the study subject is a male. Furthermore, assume the dummy variable $Black$ is defined as: $Black = 1$ if the study subject is Black and 0 if the study subject is White. Then the mean wage can be expressed as follows: Gender = Male; Race = White: Mean Wage = $\beta_0$ (since $Female = 0$ and $Black = 0$ ); Gender = Male; Race = Black: Mean Wage = $\beta_0 + \beta_2$ (since $Female = 0$ and $Black = 1$ ); Gender = Female; Race = White: Mean Wage = $\beta_0 + \beta_1$ (since $Female = 1$ and $Black = 0$ ); Gender = Female; Race = Black: Mean Wage = $\beta_0 + \beta_1 + \beta_2 + \beta_3$ (since $Female = 1$ and $Black = 1$ ). Now, simple arithmetic shows that: a) $\beta_1$ = $(\beta_0 + \beta_1) - \beta_0$ is the difference in mean wage between females and males having white race. In other words, $\beta_1$ is the average wage differential between genders for whites. b) $\beta_2$ = $(\beta_0 + \beta_2) - \beta_0$ is the difference in mean wage between blacks and whites having male as their gender. In other words, $\beta_2$ is the average wage differential between races for males. c) $\beta_2 + \beta_3$ = $(\beta_0 + \beta_1 + \beta_2 + \beta_3)$ - $(\beta_0 + \beta_1)$ is the difference in mean wage between blacks and whites having female as their gender. In other words, $\beta_2 + \beta_3$ is the average wage differential between races for females. Subtracting b) from c) yields that $\beta_3$ = ( $\beta_2 + \beta_3$ ) - $\beta_2$ is the difference between (i) the difference in mean wage between blacks and whites having female as their gender and (ii) the difference in mean wage between blacks and whites having male as their gender. So $\beta_3$ is a difference of differences. It contrasts the average wage differential between races across the two genders. If you test the hypotheses: Ho: $\beta_3 = 0$ versus Ha: $\beta_3 \neq 0$ then you are really testing: Ho: there is no difference in the average wage differential between races across the two genders Ha: there is a difference in the average wage differential between races across the two genders Of course, like you noted, interactions are symmetric, so you could re-express $\beta_3$ as the difference in the average wage differential between genders across the two races and test the corresponding hypotheses. $$ $$ In your comments, you ask: For the 2nd statement, I was trying to say that given that genders are the same is there a difference in wage between different races. Do you think my approach is also acceptable? . $$ $$ My answer is that, once you formulated your 4 submodels for mean wage for the 4 possible combinations of gender and race, you can test any hypotheses that are of interest to you. However, you need to make sure you formulate your hypotheses appropriately as a function of the model coefficients. If you want to set up hypotheses to address the research question "among males, is there a difference in mean wage between different races?" , start by comparing the following submodels: Gender = Male; Race = White: Mean Wage = $\beta_0$ (since $Female = 0$ and $Black = 0$ ); Gender = Male; Race = Black: Mean Wage = $\beta_0 + \beta_2$ (since $Female = 0$ and $Black = 1$ ); This will make it clear that you can address your research question by testing the following null and alternative hypotheses: Ho: $\beta_2 = 0$ (among males, there is no difference in mean age between blacks and whites) Ha: $\beta_2 \neq 0$ (among males, there is a difference in mean age between blacks and whites) $$ $$ If you want to set up hypotheses to address the research question "among females, is there a difference in mean wage between different races?" , start by comparing the following submodels: Gender = Female; Race = White: Mean Wage = $\beta_0 + \beta_1$ (since $Female = 1$ and $Black = 0$ ); Gender = Female; Race = Black: Mean Wage = $\beta_0 + \beta_1 + \beta_2 + \beta_3$ (since $Female = 1$ and $Black = 1$ ). This comparison will reveal that you can set up your hypotheses as follows: Ho: $\beta_2 + \beta_3 = 0$ (among females, there is no difference in mean wage between blacks and whites) Ha: $\beta_2 + \beta_3 \neq 0$ (among females, there is a difference in mean wage between blacks and whites) $$ $$ If you wish to address the research question "among people of the same gender (be it male or female), is there a difference in mean wage between blacks and whites , then you need to simultaneously test the following sets of hypotheses: Ho1: $\beta_2 = 0$ (among males, there is no difference in mean wage between blacks and whites) Ha1: $\beta_2 \neq 0$ (among males, there is a difference in mean wage between blacks and whites) and Ho2: $\beta_2 + \beta_3 = 0$ (among females, there is no difference in mean wage between blacks and whites) Ha2: $\beta_2 + \beta_3 \neq 0$ (among females, there is a difference in mean wage between blacks and whites) You will need some correction of the resulting p-values for multiplicity, since you are simultaneously performing two tests. $$ $$ To answer the research question "among black people, is there a difference in mean wage between males and females" , you would start by comparing the following submodels: Gender = Male; Race = Black: Mean Wage = $\beta_0 + \beta_2$ (since $Female = 0$ and $Black = 1$ ); Gender = Female; Race = Black: Mean Wage = $\beta_0 + \beta_1 + \beta_2 + \beta_3$ (since $Female = 1$ and $Black = 1$ ). This suggests that you need to set up your hypotheses as: Ho: $\beta_1 + \beta_3 = 0$ (among black people, there is no difference in mean wage between females and males) Ha: $\beta_1 + \beta_3 \neq 0$ (among black people, there is a difference in mean wage between females and males) $$ $$ One dummy variable and one continuous variable: Again, best to write your model like: Height = $β_0 + β_1Female + β_2Calcium + β_3Female*Calcium + \epsilon$ , which will imply that: Mean Height = $β_0 + β_1Female + β_2Calcium + β_3Female*Calcium$ provided the mean of $\epsilon$ equals 0. This model shows that the effect of Calcium on Mean Height depends on Gender, since: Mean Height = $β_0 + β_1Female + (β_2 + β_3Female)Calcium$ . This last model is a collection of two submodels: Males: Mean Height = $β_0 + β_2*Calcium$ ; Females: Mean Height = $β_0 + β_1 + (β_2 + β_3)Calcium$ . Since $β_2$ represents the rate of change in mean height for each extra unit of Calcium in males and $β_2 + \beta_3$ represents the rate of change in mean height for for each extra unit of Calcium in females, the difference between them, $\beta_3$ , represents a difference in two rates of change.
