I guess it depends on the details of your situation whether this will work or not. But could you just add spaces between each letter, and set the text alignment to be justified? Unfortunately you don't get to set the # of pixels this way if that's what you need... but you can get even spacing this way. If this isn't just one spot on your window or is a little more complex with dynamic text... then you may want to look into a more elegant solution.
