Lasso is only useful if you're restricting yourself to consider models which are linear in the parameters to be estimated. Stated another way, the lasso does not evaluate whether you have chosen the correct form of the relationship between the independent and dependent variable(s). It is very plausible that there may be nonlinear, interactive or polynomial effects in an arbitrary data set. However, these alternative model specifications will only be evaluated if the user conducts that analysis; the lasso is not a substitute for doing so. For a simple example of how this can go wrong, consider a data set in which disjoint intervals of the independent variable will predict alternating high and low values of the dependent variable. This will be challenging to sort out using conventional linear models, since there is not a linear effect in the manifest variables present for analysis (but some transformation of the manifest variables may be helpful). Left in its manifest form, the lasso will incorrectly conclude that this feature is extraneous and zero out its coefficient because there is no linear relationship. On the other hand, because there are axis-aligned splits in the data, a tree-based model like a random forest will probably do pretty well.
