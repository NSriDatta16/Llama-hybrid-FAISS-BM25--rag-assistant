How to make CSS width to fill parent?

I am sure this problem has been asked before but I cannot seem to find the answer. I have the following markup: here be dragons My desire is to make foo to have width of 600px ( width: 600px; ) and to make bar have the following behaviors: padding-left: 2px; padding-right: 2px; margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; outerWidth: 100%; In other words instead of setting width of bar to 592px I would like to set the outer width of bar to 100% so that it is computed to 592px . The importance here is that I can change foo's width to 800px and bar will calculate when rendered instead of me having to do the math for all these instances manually. Is this possible in pure CSS? Some more fun with it: What if #bar is a table? What if #bar is a textarea? What if #bar is an input? What if #foo is a table cell ( td )? (Does this change the problem or is the problem identical?) So far the table#bar , input#bar has been discussed. I have not seen a good solution for textarea#bar. I Think a textarea with no border/margin/padding with a div wrap might work with the div styled to work as borders for the textarea .
