An empty paragraph is meaningless - which means you're probably writing the wrong HTML. Also, your example doesn't have a DOCTYPE - a valid DOCTYPE is essential for getting browsers to correctly interpret your code, without one you'll be stuck in quirks mode. But anyway, the simplest workaround for this bug is simply set a background for your current unstyled element.
