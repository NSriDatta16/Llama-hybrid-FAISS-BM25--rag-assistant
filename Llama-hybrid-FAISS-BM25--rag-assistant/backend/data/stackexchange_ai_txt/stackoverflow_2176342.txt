Embedding part of a web site

Suppose I want to embed the latest comic strip of one of my favorite webcomics into my site as a kind of promotion for it. The webcomic has the strip inside of a div with an id, so I figured I can just embed the div in my site, except that I couldn't find any code examples for how to do it (they all show how to embed flash or a whole website). Can someone please show me (or tell) how it's done? PS I'd rather not use server side scripting or external services (which is what is often recommended for embedding RSS).
