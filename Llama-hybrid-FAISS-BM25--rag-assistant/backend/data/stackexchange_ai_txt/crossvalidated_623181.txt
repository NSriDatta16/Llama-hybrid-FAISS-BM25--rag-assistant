I have a new case study on what is essentially nonlinear sparse principal components here . A redundancy analysis is also included, and missing data is handled by stacking multiple imputation-completed datasets. This uses a 3 step approach. First do multiple imputation and stacking, then find optimal transformations using an unsupervised learning ACE algorithm , then use the transformed variables to do sparse principal components analysis. The latter essentially does variable clustering and PCA simultaneously to handle collinearities.
