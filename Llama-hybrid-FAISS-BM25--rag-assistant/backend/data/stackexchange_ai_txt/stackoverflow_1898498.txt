Select elements only post back the actual value of the selected it. In this case, the parameters will be received back at the server/controller as ID (organization) and Name (role). The model you use for the update action should either contain these as properties or your controller action should accept them directly as parameters. The lists on the model won't be repopulated -- and the names don't match in any event. Modify your model by adding: public int ID { get; set; } public string Name { get; set; } with controller action as: public ActionResult Update( UserAccountModel userAccount ) { ... } Note that if there is a validation error, you'll need to repopulate the SelectList properties (reconstituting the menus).
