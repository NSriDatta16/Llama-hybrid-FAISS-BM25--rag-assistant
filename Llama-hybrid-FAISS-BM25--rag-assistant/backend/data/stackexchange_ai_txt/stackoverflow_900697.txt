How to find the largest UDP packet I can send without fragmenting?

I need to know what the largest UDP packet I can send to another computer is without fragmentation. This size is commonly known as the MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit). Supposedly, between 2 computers, will be many routers and modems that may have different MTUs. I read that the TCP implementation in windows automatically finds the maximum MTU in a path. I was also experimenting, and I found out that the maximum MTU from my computer to a server was 57712 bytes+header. Anything above that was discarded. My computer is on a LAN, isn't the MTU supposed to be around 1500 bytes?
