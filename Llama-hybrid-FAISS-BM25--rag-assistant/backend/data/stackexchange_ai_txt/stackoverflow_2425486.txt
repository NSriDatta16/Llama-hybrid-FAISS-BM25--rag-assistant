This is known as vertical partitioning , and is a legitimate strategy. You might do this for the following reasons: If certain columns are accessed or changed far more frequently than others. If you want to store some of the columns on one set of storage media and the others on another. If you have extensive triggers that don't need to run in response to updates on certain of the columns. There will likely be a small performance hit when accessing through the JOIN, but performance may increase in the cases where you only need to access one or the other of the component tables.
