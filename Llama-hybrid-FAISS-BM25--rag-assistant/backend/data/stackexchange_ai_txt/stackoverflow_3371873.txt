If you just want to change the price of a product for each store, that much is simple. The price attribute can be declared to have any scope in the site's configuration, so you can set it to store level and give the product multiple prices. If, however, you want to change the price of the product programmatically, you are going to have some troubles. On every page load, Magento reloads the shopping cart and makes sure that the prices that were offered are still current. As such, if you have overridden the product price in code, it will overwrite your changes and restore the original product price. You can jump through some hoops and mostly hack this behavior, but it's not really a perfect proposition. Additionally, when the customer goes to reorder (w/ the reorder button), the price will not match either. For your second question, can you clarify exactly what you are trying to do? It's not really clear what you want. Hope that helps! Thanks, Joe
