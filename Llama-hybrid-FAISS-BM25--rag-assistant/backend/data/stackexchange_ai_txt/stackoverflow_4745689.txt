There is always some state that you'll have to keep on the servers if you want to perform any kind of user login. The only question is: Where does that state reside? In the application server or In the database (or maybe some other storage) Obviously, the user name and password will be saved in the database. A session token is usually kept in the application server's memory - but it doesn't have to be. You could just as well save it in the database. Because your implementation is stateless, with your current solution you'll have to retrieve the user name and password from the database for every request. You could easily change this to retrieve a token and timestamp instead. The only significant change is, that there may be multiple sessions per user, so you'll need a 1:N relation for users/tokens.
