Likelihoods express the probability, that the observed event (two heads up) occurs given some parameters ( $p = 1$ ). If you have a coin that always lands on head, two heads in a row have a probability of 1. However, the likelihood does not equal the probability, that these parameters / models are the correct ones. It is crucial to distinguish between plausibility and probability here. As you yourself stated in the second to last paragraph, likelihoods can be used to compare different parameter choices / models. The one with a higher likelihood is to be prefered.
