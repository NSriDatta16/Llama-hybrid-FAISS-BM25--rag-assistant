How to do 4-parametric regression for ELISA data in R

I am a biology student. We do many Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) experiments and Bradford detection. A 4-parametric logistic regression ( reference ) is often used for regression these data following this function: $$ F(x) = \left(\frac{A-D}{1+(x/C)^B}\right) + D $$ How can I do this in R ? I want to get the $A$, $B$, $C$ and $D$ values and plot the curve. PS. If I have some data, how can I use the calculated function $F(x)$ to get the value? I mean how do I go from "data -> F(x) -> value"?
