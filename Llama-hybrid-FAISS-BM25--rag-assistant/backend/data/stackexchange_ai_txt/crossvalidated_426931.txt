How to deal with biased dataset for both training and testing data?

I am currently working on a classification problem with a highly biased dataset. The dataset is biased for both training and testing data. And I am having trouble dealing with the dataset or modifying the model. For example, I have 30 classes, 70% of which are class A and B. And I have tried to expand the dataset to make my model more robust. However, it has worse performance on the test dataset since the test dataset is also biased. I am using a deep learning model with cross-entropy loss and also tried weighted cross entropy loss. I wonder what else I can try to relieve the impact of the bias.
