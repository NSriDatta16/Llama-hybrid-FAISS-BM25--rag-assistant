Munro and Paterson studied essentially this problem in their paper Selection and sorting with limited storage . They show that your algorithm requires k = Ω(√n) to succeed with constant probability and that this is asymptotically optimal by appealing to basic results about one-dimensional random walks. If I wanted to prove absolute optimality, the first thing I would try would be to consider an arbitrary algorithm A and then couple its execution with an algorithm A' that, the first time A deviates from your algorithm, does your algorithm would do instead and then attempts to follow A as closely as it can.
