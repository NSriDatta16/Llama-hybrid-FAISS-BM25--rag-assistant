I need to strip out the HTML tags, and convert characters like &lt and &amp to their equivalents. However, I'd also like to keep the effects of bold tags and paragraphs tags if possible. I know I can use rereplace, and others to brute force the output, but I was hoping for a more elegant solution. I do not think such a function exists in CF. It would require some sort of html=>excel conversion of the styles. This thread says that functionality did not even exist in POI (which is used by cfspreadsheet) until recently. So my guess would be it does not exist within the CF spreadsheet functions either. If you are willing to work lower level, you might check the latest version of POI . See if the mentioned patch is available in the main distribution. Otherwise, rereplace() sounds like the simplest approach.
