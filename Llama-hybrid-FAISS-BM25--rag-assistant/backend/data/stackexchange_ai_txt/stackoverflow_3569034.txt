You are talking about IPv4-IPv6 mapping or IPv4 address embedding. IPv4 address embedding is used to create a relationship between an IPv4 address and an IPv6 address to aid in the transition from IPv4 to IPv6. One type, the IPv4-compatible IPv6 address, is used for devices that are compatible with both IPv4 and IPv6; it begins with 96 zero bits. The other, the IPv4-mapped address, is used for mapping IPv4 devices that are not compatible with IPv6 into the IPv6 address space; it begins with 80 zeroes followed by 16 ones. .. The difference between these two kinds of addresses is subtle, but important. The first 80 bits are always zero, so when this is seen you know it is an embedded IPv4 address of some sort. IPv4-compatible IPv6 addresses are only used for devices that are actually IPv6-aware; the IPv4-compatible address is in addition to its conventional IPv6 address. In contrast, if the "FFFF" is seen for the 16 bits after the initial 80, this designates a conventional IPv4 devices whose IPv4 address has been mapped into the IPv6 format. It is not an IPv6-capable device. So the bottom line is unless they are mapped together, you won't be able to convert to/from. You'd need a translator .
