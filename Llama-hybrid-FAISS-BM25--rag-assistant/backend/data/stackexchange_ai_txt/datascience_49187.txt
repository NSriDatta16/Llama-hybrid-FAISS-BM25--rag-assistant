I think your case would benefit from tunning a existing language to the new one but that is only a good approach if you plan to use it commercially. Also Google accepts help to improve their translation algorithm and you could petition for them to assemble a team for this and donate data. Google uses a Neural Network that they call Google's NMT (Neural Machine Translation) for translation and it works as a encoder-decoder pair. You can read more on their paper . Also, Google's NMT is available in tensorflow and can be trainned and improved. It is license under Apache License 2.0 and has a nice tutorial and explanation available on their GitHub: Check on this GitHub folder here
