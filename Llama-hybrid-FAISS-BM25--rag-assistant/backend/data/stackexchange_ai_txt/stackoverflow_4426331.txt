Read the Swing tutorial on Using Layout Managers . It is strongly recommended that you learn to use layout managers effectively and avoid trying to manually position components. Beginners don't understand how to use layout managers effectively and attempt to use manually placement. However, the tutorial has a section on "Absolute Positioning" that will help you out. However in general this should only be used when you have a drag and drop feature.
