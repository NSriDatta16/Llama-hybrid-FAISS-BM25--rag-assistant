xml - how to create/run XML file

Can someone advise me on what I need to run an .xml file? Can I create it in Notepad and save it with an .xml extension then double click the file whilst in Windows or do I need a special editor? I have a java application and want to use Jave Web Start techonology which requires a JNLP file from my .jar file. Thanks
