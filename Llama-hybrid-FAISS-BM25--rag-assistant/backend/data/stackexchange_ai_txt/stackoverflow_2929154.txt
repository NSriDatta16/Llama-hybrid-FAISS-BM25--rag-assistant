First of all, the most common practice is to use an ORM (object-relational mapping) tool. These are available to most any modern OO language, and they take care of generating the classes needed to interact with the database, managing retrieval and updating, and managing connection lifetime. That aside, yes, you need a Group class that has a collection of Item s, and (ideally) a reference from Item to its parent Group . This is one of the areas where an ORM can help, since it can ensure that these two references (the collection of children and the parent reference) stay in sync.
