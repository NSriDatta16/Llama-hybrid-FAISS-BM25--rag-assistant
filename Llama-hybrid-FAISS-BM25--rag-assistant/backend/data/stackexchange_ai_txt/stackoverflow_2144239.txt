The only truly safe way to guard your password is to encrypt it. But then you have the problem of safeguarding the encryption key. This problem is turtles all the way down. When the good people who build OpenSsh tackled this problem, they provided a tool called ssh-agent which will hold onto your credentials and allow you to use them to connect to a server at need. But even ssh-agent holds a named socket in the filesystem, and anybody who can get access to that socket can act using your credentials. I think the only two alternatives are Have a person type a password. Trust the filesystem. I'd trust only a local filesystem, not a remote mounted one. But I'd trust it. Security is hell.
