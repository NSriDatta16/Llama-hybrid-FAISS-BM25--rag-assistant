Firstly, I would suggest looking at what work has been previously done on similar problems. For example, a bank offering a mortgage looks at similar sorts of data and then predicts how likely it is the person will be able to pay it back. This should give you ideas on how to tackle the problem. Logistic regression certainly seems like a good idea. Another thought is maybe looking at some of the multivariate data analysis methods to classify people into different groups, based on the data you have. Specifically correspondence analysis and its extension, multiple correspondence analysis, are the counterparts of principal component analysis for categorical variables, and may be of interest.
