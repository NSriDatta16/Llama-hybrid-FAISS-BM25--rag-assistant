Understanding signficant interaction with non-significant main effects

Possible Duplicate: How to compute significant interaction estimates when main effect is not significant? I am an applied linguist and I am modelling responses to a vocabulary test taken by second language learners of English; the aim is to test theoretical hypotheses regarding the relationship between the nature of the word and the likelihood of the learnersâ€™ knowing that word. The models I am using to explore the role of explanatory variables are the random item Item Response Theory model LLTM+e (see de Boeck et al. 2011; de Boeck 2008). These are created using the lmer function in the LME4 package in R and treat item and person responses as random. The estimates shown below are effectively like those from a binary logistic regression model, indicating the log-odds of a correct response on a word, given certain properties. Covariates relate to both item and person characteristics. The nature of my concern is actually a basic regression issue. I have found a significant interaction between ability grouping of the test taker (GRP; with two levels High and Low) and the length of the word in letters (LEN_L). As far as I can see the estimate of the fixed effects for the first model shows that (a) the lower level learners have an overall lower probability of giving a correct answer (b) that LEN_L does not provide a significant explanation across the pattern of responses for the whole test-taker population, and (c) a significant interaction between GRP and LEN_L indicates that the lower ability learners are less likely to give a correct answer for a longer word. This is in keeping with theory. However, when I model the data without including the main effect for LEN_L, I am not seeing a significant effect for either high or low groups as shown in Model 2. LEN_L does not show as significant if modelled without interaction with grp low (not shown). I feel that I am missing something obvious, but I cannot quite grasp what is happening. And my references have run dry on this particular issue and I am thinking myself around in circles about it. (NB: in my full model I have many other significant covariates, but this pattern holds true.) My query basically regards whether I should use Model 1, including the non-significant main effect, or whether my findings from Model 2 indicate that the finding is a little unstable. Any advice would be much appreciated! (I can post more details if necessary.) Karen Model 1 Fixed effects: Estimate Std.
