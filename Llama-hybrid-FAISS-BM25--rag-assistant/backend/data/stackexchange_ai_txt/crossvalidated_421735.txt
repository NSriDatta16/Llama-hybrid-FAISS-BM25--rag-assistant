How to account for different replicates?

I am analyzing an experiment. I am particularly interested in the volume loss rate (or log volume loss rate) by pulse. Attached is the graph of one of the arms. It shows three replicates of the same arm. This arm is difficult because there is a rate in the beginning, then it suddenly changes to a different rate. After 44 pulses or so, each of the three replicates have somewhat similar rates, but are translated up or down. When I try to fit a line, you get the below. I am trying to fit this line along with all the other arms as a single linear model. I am not sure how to account for the initial part that is very different and the different locations (translations up or down). The average rate is the goal. Any thoughts? Thank you.
