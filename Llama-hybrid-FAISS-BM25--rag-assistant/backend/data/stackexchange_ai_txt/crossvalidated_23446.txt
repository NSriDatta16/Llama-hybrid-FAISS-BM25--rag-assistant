Because they are different: One does not include the other. Yes modern NLP (Natural Language Processing) does make use of a lot of ML (Machine Learning), but that is just one group of techniques in the arsenal. For example, graph theory and search algorithms are also used a lot. As is simple text processing (Regular Expressions). Note I also said "modern NLP" - the statistical approach to NLP is a relatively recent development over the past few decades. I understand a more formal approach (e.g. based on parsing formal grammars) was the norm back in the 1960s/1970s. Similarly ML does not have to use NLP, and usually it doesn't, although some applications might use NLP techniques (eg. to process text input).
