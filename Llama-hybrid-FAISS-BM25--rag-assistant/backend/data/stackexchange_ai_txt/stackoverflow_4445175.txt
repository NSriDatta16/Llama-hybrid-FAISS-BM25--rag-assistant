Architecture for search engine based on distributed key/value store?

Is anyone aware of any links, papers, presentations, or blog posts that describe a large-scale full-text search engine built upon a distributed key/value store? I'm particularly interested in the organization of the index. What, exactly, is the data structure? Where and how are dictionaries and postings stored? What is the workflow for query processing? How are queries handled in such a way that it's not necessary to haul massive amounts of data across the network? I gather that Blekko is built this way. I'd like to know what they, or their competitors, actually did.
