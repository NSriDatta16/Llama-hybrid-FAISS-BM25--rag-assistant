Machine Learning Dataset: Easy enough for fully connected, but not easy enough for logistic regression

I was wondering if someone could direct me to a dataset for a classification task with the following conditions: Multinomial logistic regression alone does not learn a good classifier A series of fully connected layers is able to learn a good classifier The task is not MNIST Thank you
