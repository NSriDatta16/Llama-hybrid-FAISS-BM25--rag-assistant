If you have IID random variables $X_1, X_2, ..., X_n$ , then the average $\bar{X}_n = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n X_i$ has expectation $E(\bar{X}_n) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n E(X_i) = E(X_1)$ . This previous fact has nothing to do with the fact that we have independence though! This is just from the identical distribution of the $X_i$ 's and linearity of expectation. We use the independence assumption when we calculate $Var(\bar{X}_n) = Var \left(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n X_i\right) = \frac{1}{n^2}\sum_{i=1}^n Var(X_i) = \frac{1}{n^2} \cdot n Var(X_i) = \frac{Var(X_1)}{n}.$ Notice in both cases the $X_1$ in the final expressions can be replaced by any of the $X_i$ 's, since they are all identically distributed.
