How do I create a custom borderless NSWindow in Objective-C + Cocoa?

Let me start off by saying that this is my first real Cocoa app. It's a simple app that pretty much displays my website in a borderless window. The way I'm currently creating a borderless window is using the following: - (void) awakeFromNib { [window setStyleMask:NSBorderlessWindowMask]; [window setAcceptsMouseMovedEvents:YES]; [window setMovableByWindowBackground:YES]; [window setLevel:NSNormalWindowLevel]; } The problem with this is that as a result, the WebView within the window does not pass mouse over events to elements on the loaded page, nor does it provide the ability to type in text fields. I know that I'm supposed to create a custom window instead and move the contentView into it but I'm too new to Objective-C to figure out how. I've also tried declaring all of these with no luck: @implementation specikAppDelegate @synthesize window; @synthesize webView; - (BOOL) canBecomeKeyWindow { return YES; } - (BOOL) canBecomeMainWindow { return YES; } - (BOOL) acceptsFirstResponder { return YES; } - (BOOL) becomeFirstResponder { return YES; } - (BOOL) resignFirstResponder { return YES; } ... @end Additionally, I'd like to be able to move the window by clicking and dragging it anywhere but that's a side thought. I've searched extensively online, and cannot find a solution to this. Contents of my .h file (just in case): @interface specikAppDelegate : NSObject { IBOutlet NSWindow *window; IBOutlet WebView *webView; } @property (assign) IBOutlet NSWindow *window; @property (nonatomic, retain) IBOutlet WebView *webView; - (IBAction)openAboutPanel:(id)sender; @end Any help would be appreciated, and like I said, I'm super new to the world of Objective-C and Cocoa, but I do come from a PHP development background.
