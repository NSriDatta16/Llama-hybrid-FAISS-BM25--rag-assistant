I recreated your plot with data from http://hawaii.gov/dbedt/ert/winddata/krab0192.txt (I took the 1200 measurements). I got a decent fit of the data, generally using your code: library(lmom) daten Sorry, I'm not shure were your problem could be, but I think you should be able to fit weibull to your data. What makes me suspicious is the bell-curve of your density plot, I have no idea where that came from. Here are the moments I generated: wind.moments l_1 l_2 t_3 t_4 15.17287544 4.80372580 0.14963501 0.06954438 moments zeta beta delta 0.516201 16.454233 1.745413 WTR to the annual output: I suppose I'd generate discrete values for the probability density function, multiply these values with the output function and sum it up. Alternatively, you could just use your raw data, multiply the values with the output function, sum it up and calculate the annual average, you should control for seasonality in a suitable way (e. g. make sure to use whole years, or to weight accordingly). Here is the uncontrolled output (using the formula from http://www.articlesbase.com/diy-articles/determining-wind-turbine-annual-power-output-a-simple-formula-based-upon-blade-diameter-and-average-wind-speed-at-your-location-513080.html ) years
