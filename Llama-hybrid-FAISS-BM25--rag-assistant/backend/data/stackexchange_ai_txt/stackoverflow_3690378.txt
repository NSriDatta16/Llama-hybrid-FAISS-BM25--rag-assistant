Since you are in all likelihood using Eclipse, there's a far easier way to import it right into your workspace. The source is bundled with your eclipse distribution. Just do File -> Import -> Plug-ins and Fragments Keep defaults ("Active target platform", "Select from all plug-ins" & "Projects with source folders" Hit next, and select the JUnit plugin-packages and hit Finish, and they will be imported as Eclipse projects into your workspace.
