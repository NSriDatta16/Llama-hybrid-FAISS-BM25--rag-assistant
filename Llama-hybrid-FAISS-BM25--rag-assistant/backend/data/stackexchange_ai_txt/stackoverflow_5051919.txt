Passing an input to the process created by CreateProcess()

like in the title I was wondering whether is it possible to pass an input by use of redirection operators in CreateProcess(). I tried something like the following: CreateProcess(NULL, "%ComSpec% /c c:\\somebatch.bat", NULL, NULL, ...); where somebatch.bat contained c:\app.exe and it didn't pass the input, just launched the app.exe . On the output it said that: c:\working_directory> c:\app.exe c:\working_directory>Not enough storage is available to process this command. (messing with irpcstack didn't help) Are you guys aware of any magic trick that would allow me to do what I want without messing with the hStdInput pipe, which saying frankly I wanted to avoid. Cheers.
