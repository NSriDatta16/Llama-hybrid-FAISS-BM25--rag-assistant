Memory management for multiple Views in iOS

I'm developing an application for iOS where I need to load many views. My application needs to switch in and out the views as the user wishes. These views take up a lot of memory and I need to manage this somehow. I was wondering if anyone could give me direction as to how to tackle this? Should I use persistant storage and write some of my views to disk? Any other suggestions? Thanks!
