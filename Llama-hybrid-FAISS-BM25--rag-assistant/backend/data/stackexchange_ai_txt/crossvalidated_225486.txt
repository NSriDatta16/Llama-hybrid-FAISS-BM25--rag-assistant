Average duplicates before fitting?

Common practice for calibration curves is to take several duplicate measurements for each timepoint (or concentration, whatever variable) and fit using the average of each measurement set. The dependent and independent variables are both known. E.g. a 3-point calibration with 5 duplicates generates 15 datapoints, but we only fit against the 3 average values. What is the major difference with fitting against all 15 datapoints, other than being less computationally intensive? Is there even a difference?
