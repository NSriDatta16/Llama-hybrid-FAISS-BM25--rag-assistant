Take a look at https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/189991/11476 (and related LambertW posts on cross-validated ) with examples on how to transform financial return data to a marginal Normal distribution using Lambert W x F transformations (in R w/ the LambertW package; in Python using the pylambertw module . Though recall that just transforming to Normality alone does not solve any problem; it depends on what you are trying to accomplish. Rarely ML algorithms require data to be normal ( maybe conditional on features it should be normal, but even then ML algorithms for prediction purposes often don't really require much distributional assumptions -- unless you want to predict full distributions and/or perform statistical inference & decision making on your ML predicts). It would be helpful to understand what the actual problem is that you are trying to solve.
