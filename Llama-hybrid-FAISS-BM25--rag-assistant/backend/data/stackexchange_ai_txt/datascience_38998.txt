Although generally in training a machine learning model, the more data you have the better for training generalised models, that may not be the case here. Given that the two datasets were collected in completely different environments, they may have completely different distributions. In this case, training a model on the combined dataset may even reduce the performance of the model. My advice would be, do some statistical analysis on each dataset independently - find the mean and variances of each of the variables for each dataset and compare them for example. If the analysis shows that the two datastes have fairly similar distributions (Iâ€™ll leave the definition of fairly similar up to you), then it should be ok to combine the two datasets to train a model on.
