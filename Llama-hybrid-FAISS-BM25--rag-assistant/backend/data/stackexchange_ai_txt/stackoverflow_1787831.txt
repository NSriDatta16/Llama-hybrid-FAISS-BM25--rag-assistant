Model Relationship Problem

I am trying to calculate the average (mean) rating for all entries within a category based on the following model associations ... class Entry true ... end The rating model is handled by the acts as rateable plugin, so the rateable model looks like this ... module Rateable #:nodoc: ... module ClassMethods def acts_as_rateable has_many :ratings, :as => :rateable, :dependent => :destroy ... end end ... end How can I perform the average calculation? Can this be accomplished through the rails model associations or do I have to resort to a SQL query?
