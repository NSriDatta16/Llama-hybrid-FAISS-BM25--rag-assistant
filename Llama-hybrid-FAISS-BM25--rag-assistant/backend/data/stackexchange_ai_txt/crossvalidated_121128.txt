You are ignoring the model intercept when evaluating the model fit. The plot method shows the fitted spline, but the model includes a parametric constant term, just like the intercept in a standard logistic regression model. Instead, predict from the fitted model using the predict() method for locations on a grid of locations over the interval. For example: m.gam which gives Using a te() smoother seems to do a bit better than s() and I used method = "REML" as this can help with situations where the objective function in GCV/UBRE-based selection can become flat (and hence these methods can undersmooth), in case that was the problem here.
