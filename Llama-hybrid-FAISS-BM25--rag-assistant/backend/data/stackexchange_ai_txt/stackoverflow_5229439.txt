iPhone Photo Smile Manipulation Applications

I'm trying to create an iphone application that allows a user to take a photo of their smile, then drag and drop new smiles, from a small predefined list. I know there are a lot of photo manipulation apps and I have seen similar concepts that allow smile manipulation, but not quite what I am looking for. The problem is knowing where to start. How can I create this effect? Would the OpenCV iPhone port be the best way to go? Or perhaps something using OpenGL? Willing to do some research, but I find that experience often goes a long way, so any advice or insight would be much appreciated.
