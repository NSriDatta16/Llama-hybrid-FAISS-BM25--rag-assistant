For small allocation, boost has a very simple allocator I've used called boost::simple_segregated_storage It creates a copy of slists of free and used blocks, all the same size. As long as you only allocate to its set block size, you get no external fragmentation (though you can get some internal fragmentation if your block size is bigger than the requested size.) It also runs O(1) if you use it in this manner. Great for small allocation the likes of which are common with template programming.
