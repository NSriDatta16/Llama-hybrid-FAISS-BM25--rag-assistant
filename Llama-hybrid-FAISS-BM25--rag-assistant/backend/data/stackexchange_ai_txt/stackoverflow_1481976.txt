While I don't have extensive experienve with TxF, I do have experience with MS DTC. TxF itself is fairly performant. When you throw in the MS DTC to handle multiple resource managers across multiple machines, performance takes a considerable hit. From your description, it sounds like you are storing and indexing very large volumes of unstructured data. I assume that you also need the ability to search for this data. As such, I would highly recommend looking into something like Microsoft's Dryad or Google's MapReduce and a high performance distributed file system to handle your unstructured data storage and indexing. The best examples of high-volume enterprise systems that store and index massive volumes of blob data are Internet search engines like Bing and Google. There are quite a few resources available for managing high-throughput unstructured data, and they would probably solve your problem more effectively than SQL Server and NTFS. I know its a bit farther out of the box than you were probably looking for...but you did mention that you had already exhausted all other search avenues around the NTFS/TxF/SQL box. ;)
