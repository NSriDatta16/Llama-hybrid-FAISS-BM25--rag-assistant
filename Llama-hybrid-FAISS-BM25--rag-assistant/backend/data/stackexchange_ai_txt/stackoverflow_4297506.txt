I am a SQL server DBA so I will sugggest what I would do in SQL Server 2008. Add the columns to the existing table as nullable marking the columns as SPARSE. Using the sparse tag will not increase the storage for the extra columns in the existing table pages and still allow you to query the sparse columns as columns. SQL Server stores sparse columns internally in XML format which may also be queried or displayed. If there are legacy apps which can not handle the new table structure rename the table Create a view with the origional table structure and name it the origional table name If you have a version which does not support sparse columns build a single child table for your existing table linking the child to the parent with the ID of the parent table. Create a view across the two tables to present the data.
