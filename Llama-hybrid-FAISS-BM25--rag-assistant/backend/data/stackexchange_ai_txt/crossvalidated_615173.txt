Difference-in-difference estimation of average treatment effect with no pre-intervention period

Suppose that Walmart has 1,000 stores. It has a 20% coupon for cereal, and it hypothesizes that the coupon will increase the sales of cereal by 3%. Walmart put the coupon in 100 stores on 2022-05-01; the other 900 stores continue to have no coupon. Unfortunately, it does NOT have any sales data from before 2022-05-01. The only data that it has is in the post-intervention period (from 2022-05-01 till today). Assume that I have data on all the confounding variables that you care about. I was going to use difference-in-difference to estimate the average treatment effect, but I have no pre-intervention data . What I can do instead to estimate the average treatment effect?
