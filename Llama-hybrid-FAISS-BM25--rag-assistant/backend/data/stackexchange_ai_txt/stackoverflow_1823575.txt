What are situations with western languages where you'd use HTML 5's Ruby element?

HTML 5 is introducing a new element: ; here's the W3C's description: The ruby element allows one or more spans of phrasing content to be marked with ruby annotations. Ruby annotations are short runs of text presented alongside base text, primarily used in East Asian typography as a guide for pronunciation or to include other annotations. In Japanese, this form of typography is also known as furigana. They then go on to give a few examples of Ruby annotations in use for Chinese and Japanese text. I'm wondering though: is this element going to be useful only for east-asian HTML documents, or are there good semantic applications for the element in other western languages like English, German, Spanish, etc.?
