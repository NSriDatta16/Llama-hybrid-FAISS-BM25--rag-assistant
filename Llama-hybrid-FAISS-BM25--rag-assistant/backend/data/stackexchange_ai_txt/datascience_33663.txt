How can we interpret biplot?

This is not a question as such but more likely to be verification (enhancement) of my current understanding. With the thought that it may help future visitors as well, I am taking liberty to make this post. Question Is the interpretation mentioned in attached image correct ? As per my interpretation, Movie A doesn't seems to have much Action, nor Drama. What does that mean? Is it boring movie or what? I would like to give some intuitive name to PC0 and PC1, what seems to be suitable name for it?
