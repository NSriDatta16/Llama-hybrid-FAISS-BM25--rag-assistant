What data are you trying to grab? Why not just using an existing implementation like WebService::YouTube Some comments on your code: I always avoided the shortcut $ua->request(GET/POST) method since I always ended up needing more flexibility that only the use of HTTP::Request and HTTP::Response allowed. I always felt the code was cleaner that way too. Why is your code not working? Who knows. Make sure your cookiejar is adding your cookies to the outgoing HTTP::Request . I'd suggest dumping all your headers when you do it in a browser and compare with the headers and data that libwww is sending. There may be some additional fields that they are checking for that vary for every hit. They may be checking for your UserAgent string. If you are just looking to learn libwww I'd suggest using a different site as a target as I'm sure YouTube has all sort of anti-scripting hardening.
