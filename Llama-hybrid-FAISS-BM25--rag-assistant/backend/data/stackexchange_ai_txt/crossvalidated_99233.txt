It sounds like your dependent variable is whether they get the placement right, your IV is whether they responded "yes" to the question at the beginning of the term. That would be a simple logistic regression. You could do one of those for each of the 20 questions. But perhaps a better method is use a nonlinear mixed model and include the task as an IV and the person as a random variable.
