Average of precision and recall

A machine learning model is outputting precision and recall for a two-class classification problem (0 and 1) like this: Confusion matrix: [[136 21] 41 6]] Precision: [0.768 0.128] Recall: [0.866 0.222] Accuracy: 0.696 There are two measures for both precision and recall: The first measure for the 0 class and the second for 1 class. Is it okay to take the average of these? E.g. precision as a whole is 0.768+0.128 / 2 = 0.448 ? And similarly with recall?
