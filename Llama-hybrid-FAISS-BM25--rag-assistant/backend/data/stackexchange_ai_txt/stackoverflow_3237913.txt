Magento: How to show only products with a custom binary attribute

I created some custom attributes for my Products in the backend, put together in a single attribute set. Attributes are like: "Can be used to fill holes in teeth" "Can be used to to cover up fillings" "Is absorbable" All of those attributes are of the "yes/no" kind. I made all of them searchable, yet when I search for "fillings" or "teeth" or whatever they have as a text, no product is found, even so I have one product which has all of these attributes attached and all of them set to "yes". How would I go about if I wanted to have a link that displayed me all products that, say, had "is absorbable" set to "yes"?
