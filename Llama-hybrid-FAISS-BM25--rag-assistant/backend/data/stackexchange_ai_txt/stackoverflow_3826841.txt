How can I see if one string loosely contains another (case, extra whitespace, and punctuation ignored)?

I am writing a program in C# that compares strings similarly to the way that Google searches documents for keywords. I am wanting a search for "stack overflow" to return true for "stack overflow" (plain), "This is the stack overflow." (in the middle), "Welcome to Stack Overflow." (case insensitive), "I like stack overflow." (variable whitespace), and "Who puts a dash in stack-overflow?", but not "stackoverflow" (no whitespace). I was thinking that I could use a regular expression like "stack([ -]|. )+overflow", it seems overkill to have to replace every space in each keyword with a character set for each new keyword. Because "stack overflow" is not the only string I am searching, I have to do it pragmatically.
