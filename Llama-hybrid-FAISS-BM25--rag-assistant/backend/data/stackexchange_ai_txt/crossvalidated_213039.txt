Simple way to combine predictions from multiple classifiers?

I have predictions from 3 binary classifiers (SVM, RF and NN) and would like to combine them in some way. I'm aware of the notion of ensemble learning methods but I was wondering if it would be valid to do something as simple as majority voting on the three predictions. E.g.: Observation SVM RF NN Overall One 1 1 0 1 Two 0 0 0 0 Three 0 0 1 0 Four 0 1 1 1 Would this be a reasonable and valid approach? Thank you.
