Univariate and multivariate regression

I found a research article Nursesâ€™ reports of staffing adequacy and surgical site infections: A cross-sectional multi-centre study and I want to know the reason why they used regression for their research. The research is about the relationship of work environment with the emergence of surgical site infections. They first performed Univariate mixed effects logistic regression to examine the associate between the independent and dependent variable. Independent variables that were significantly associated with the clinical outcome variable were then included in the multivariate mixed effects logistic regression. I want to know why they used two regression and if it is appropriate.
