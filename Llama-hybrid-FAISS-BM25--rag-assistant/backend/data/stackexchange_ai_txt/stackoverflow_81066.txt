Here's my response to a similar question : The combination of OneNote with a tablet PC is awesome! I was a bit of a skeptic at first. I used the trial version and then forgot about it. A year later I had an unruly collection of files, project related emails, notebooks and scraps of paper all scattered throughout my life. I went back to OneNote and all my problems went away. Some highlights: Everything is searchable. The character recognition is good enough that my chicken-scratch meeting notes can be searched. Text within images is searchable. OneNote syncs with Outlook so finding meeting notes is a breeze. I now embed all files into OneNote - pdfs, spreadsheets, word docs, images, web clippings. OneNote is constantly saving all changes so, combined with a scheduled automated backup, everything is in one place and is safe. There are some built-in collaboration tools I have yet to try but that look useful. It is SO worth the price. It allows you to get started on a project and avoid all that time spent deciding how to organize things.
