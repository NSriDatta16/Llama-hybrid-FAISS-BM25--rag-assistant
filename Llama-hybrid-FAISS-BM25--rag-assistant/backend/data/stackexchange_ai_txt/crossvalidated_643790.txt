Adding to PBulls excellent answer: You can still add covariates/confounders to the analysis in a double blind RCT. It's true that, with random assignment to treatment/control (or more) the confounders will balance out, on average (and statistical theory can make quite precise statements about how many subjects you need to get how much of a chance of getting a certain degree of balance), those other variables can still affect the regression (or whatever analysis you are doing). The terminology does get confusing! There is random selection and random assignment and a "single blind" could be either the participant or the experimenter. And, in today's world, as PBulls points out "experimenter" is rarely one person. There can be a person collecting the data, a person analyzing the data, another one writing it up .... Indeed, more than one person doing each of these! And these all relate to internal and external validity, which sometimes work at cross-purposes.
