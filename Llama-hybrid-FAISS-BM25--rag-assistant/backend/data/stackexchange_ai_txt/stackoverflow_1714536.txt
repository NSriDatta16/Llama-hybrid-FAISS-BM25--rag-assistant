My preferred solution: Padding the string with extra zeroes and just using the four first is easy to understand, doesn't require any regex and the lambda is more or less readable. I use two lines for readability, for me elegance is short and simple. def mycmp(version1,version2): tup = lambda x: [int(y) for y in (x+'.0.0.0.0').split('.')][:4] return cmp(tup(version1),tup(version2))
