Although I cannot imagine a fixed-time hash function for unlimited length strings, there is really no need for it. The idea behind using a hash function is to generate a distribution of the hash values that makes it unlikely that many strings would collide - for the domain under consideration. This key would allow direct access into a data store. These two combined result in a constant time lookup - on average . If ever such collision occurs, the lookup algorithm falls back on a more flexible lookup sub-strategy.
