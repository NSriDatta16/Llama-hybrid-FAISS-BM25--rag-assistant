How to detect touch in triangle area

For my application, i need to divide diagonally the screen of my iphone in 4 parts and detect which of the part was touched. I am very confused because my areas are triangles and not squares and I can't find a solution to detect which of the triangle was touched... I get the touched Point with method touchesBegan, and there I'm stuck... :( How to define triangle shapes and test if it was touched? with View? layer? It could be really cool if someone could help me.
