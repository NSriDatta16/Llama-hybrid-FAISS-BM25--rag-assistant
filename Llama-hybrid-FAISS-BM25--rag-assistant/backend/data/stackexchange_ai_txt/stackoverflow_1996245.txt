People discourage the use of global variables because it increases the likeliness of bugs. It's so much easier to make a mistake somewhere if every function in your program accesses the same global variables, and it's much harder to debug. It's also much harder to test for. I imagine they're still used so often because programmers are lazy . We don't want to spend time up-front making the code all organized and pretty, we just want to get the job done . It's so much easier to just write a global function/variable/whatever than to modularize it, and once you've started down that path it's too much of a pain to go back and refactor . Maybe that's the reason: They started out that way and simply never turned back.
