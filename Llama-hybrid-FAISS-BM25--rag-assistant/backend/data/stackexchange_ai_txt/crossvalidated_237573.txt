Why the predicted probalility in logistic regression is small, spreading within (0.0, 0.6), rather than(0.0, 1.0)

Just realized that the predicted probability of default in logistic regression is small and spread within a narrow range. My first guess is that it could be related to the not-strong-features selected during the modeling. My question, is this normal or did somebody observe this phenomena before? how to correctly transform as it represents the 'True Probability" spreading within (0.0, 1.0) thanks.
