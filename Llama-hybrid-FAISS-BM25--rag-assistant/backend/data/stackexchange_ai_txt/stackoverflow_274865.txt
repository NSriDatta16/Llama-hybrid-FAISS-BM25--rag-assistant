what is `int *userMask[3][4]` pointing to?

I am modifying some code and came across a declaration that I am having trouble understanding: int *userMask[3][4] = {0}; What exactly is this pointing to? Is it a matrix where every element is a pointer? Or is it pointing to a matrix of size [3][4]? Thanks I guess my question is how userMask[2][maskElement][user] can work when it is declared as int . Wouldn't userMask have to be int[] for that to work properly? I must not be understanding this right... On a side note, thanks for your suggestion about cdecl Robert. However, does anyone know how to use it in an XP command prompt? All I can get is syntax error :(
