startActivity doesn't work from a Fragment in HoneyComb

The onCreate() method is called but the new Activity never appears. No errors are logged. Follow up - There was no problem with calling startActivty() from a Fragment (we had a bug in the second Activity that caused it to exit immediately). startActivity() from a Fragment works exactly like startActivty() from outside a Fragment.
