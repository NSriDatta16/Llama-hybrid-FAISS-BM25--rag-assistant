There's an option in Visual Studio 2010 called "Break when exceptions cross AppDomain or managed/native boundaries (Managed only)" (under Debugging > General) that, when unchecked, sometimes helps. When it doesn't I need to quit Visual Studio 2010, delete all temporary files, and then try again. Not a very elegant solution, so if anyone have any better ideas, please provide them.
