The burning question we all have for you is: is it reasonable to assume the numbers of cars on either road are independent? If so, you can create a smoothing process for the numbers of cars over time and add the smoothing curves together. Something like a smoothing spline in negative binomial regression model would be sufficiently flexible and involve few assumptions. If the numbers of cars on either road are not independent, then you will need to merge the road information as a function of time into a 3 column array with a column for time and the corresponding columns for road1 and road2 traffic. You can define a 4th column of roadsum traffic and apply the same smoothing spline methods there. If you do not have these time series indexed by time to find the corresponding traffic occurrences, then you're out of luck. There's no reason to assume that a peak in traffic on road1 could be indicative of a synchronous or lagged peak in traffic on road2. Those assumptions would just be unreasonable.
