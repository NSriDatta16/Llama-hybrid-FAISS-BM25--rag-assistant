How to enumerate word document using office interop API?

I want to traverse through all the elements of an word document one by one and according to type of element (header, sentence, table,image,textbox, shape, etc.) I want to process that element. I tried to search any enumerator or object which can represent elements of document in office interop API but failed to find any. API offers sentences, paragraphs, shapes collections but doesnt provide generic object which can point to next element. For example : (Please imagine it as a word document) So, now I want some enumerator which will first give me , then on next iteration give me , then and so on. Does anyone knows how we can achieve this? Is it possible? I am using C#, visual studio 2005 and Word 2003. Thanks a lot
