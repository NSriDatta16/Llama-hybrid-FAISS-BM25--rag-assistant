Example of bigmemory and friends with file backing

I am interested in exploring how R can handle data out-of-memory. I've found the bigmemory package and friends ( bigtabulate and biganalytics ), but was hoping that someone could point me to a worked out example that uses file backing with these packages. Any other out-of-memory tips would also be appreciated.
