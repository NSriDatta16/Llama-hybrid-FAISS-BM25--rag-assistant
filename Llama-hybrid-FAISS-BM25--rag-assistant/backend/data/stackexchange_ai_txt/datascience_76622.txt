How to build recommendation model based on resume and job description?

How to build a model which will result in better recommendation of resumes based on the job description given? I am familiar with bow or tfidf (n-grams) approach and then take a cosine similarity but I'm looking for a deep learning approach. I don't have any labelled data to evaluate. Anything suggestions will be really appreciated.
