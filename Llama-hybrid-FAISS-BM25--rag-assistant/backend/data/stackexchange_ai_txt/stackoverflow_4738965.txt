I think i found a pretty simple solution for you. Basically you can relay the event only when certain conditions are met (eg #face is under the #fixed). Check out this fiddle for example . A quick look at the even data revealed that draggable only binds mousedown, so that seems to be the only event you will need to relay. $('#face').draggable(); $('#fixed').bind('mousedown', function(e){ // TODO: IF #face is under #fixed AND mouse is over #face THEN $('#face').trigger(e); // trigger the event on face });
