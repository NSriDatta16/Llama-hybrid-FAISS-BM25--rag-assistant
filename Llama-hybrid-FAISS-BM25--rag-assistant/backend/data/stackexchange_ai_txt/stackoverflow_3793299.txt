Fortran is a general-purpose, procedural, imperative programming language that is especially used for numeric computation and scientific computing. It has a long history and is still evolving: the first language proposal was put together by J. W. Backus in 1953, the first international standard was approved in 1966, and the latest minor standard revision (with new features), Fortran 2023 , was published in 2023. Fortran is widely used in the scientific computing community and accounts for an important part of numerical codes run in supercomputing facilities. Hello world in Fortran program hello print *, 'Hello, world!' end program Related tags Language feature tags: fortran-iso-c-binding regarding the C interoperability facility (not restricted to the intrinsic module) fortran-common-block regarding the (problematic) use of common blocks Compiler tags: gfortran for the Fortran compiler component of GCC xl-fortran for the IBM XL Fortran compiler intel-fortran for Intel's Fortran development suite nag-fortran for NAG's compiler (nagfor) and Fortran numerical library nvidia-hpc-compilers for NVIDIA's HPC SDK compilers pgi-visual-fortran for PGI's compiler and tools silverfrost-fortran for the Silverfrost compiler (Salford FTN95) There are also language revision tags: fortran77 , fortran90 , fortran95 , fortran2003 , fortran2008 , fortran2018 and fortran2023 . These tags are rarely necessary as there is limited incompatibility introduced in succeeding revisions and context should make language feature support clear.
