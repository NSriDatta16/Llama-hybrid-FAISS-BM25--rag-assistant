Use a separate table -- that way you have a master list of cities to populate dropdowns and/or autosuggest fields, and you save space by storing ids instead of strings redundantly. If you have a million venues, and only a thousand cities, that's significant savings, both in terms of storage, and in terms of query speed -- since you won't have to read as much off disk, which is what kills performance. You should probably specify more than just a city, but also the state (so that you know which Springfield the venue is located in).
