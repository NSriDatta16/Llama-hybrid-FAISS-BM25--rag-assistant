How much data is needed for transfer learning in convolutional neural networks?

The issue with medical datasets are low count of observations. I would like to utilize Transfer Learning with CNN to correctly predict illnesses based on either writings (i.e. paper Refining Parkinsonâ€™s neurological disorder identification through deep transfer learning), drawings (or possibly in future voice - with different NN than CNN). I am looking for rule of thumb how many observations do we need to utilize TL over those datasets? What would be the optimal base dataset? Should I use pretrained imagenet or try to utilize different datasets?
