2000 levels is perfectly feasible if your ML supports sparse matrices (ie so you don't run out of memory) (most ml language tasks need that) . Eg in python scikit_learn does this. Then you need to add regularisation (since it is unlikely that all your 2000 levels have sufficient examples) eg in logistic regression 'ridge regression', l2 regularisation. Ideally you would have a combination or hierarchy of levels: eg rather than an id for each car model/colour combination you would have factors for make/type /fuel/model. See eg scikit learn tutorial http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/text/document_classification_20newsgroups.html
