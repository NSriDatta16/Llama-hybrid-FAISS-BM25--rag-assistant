jQuery UI Draggable - need to modify element while dragging

I'm playing with Drag and drop funcitonality for the first time so I'm not entirely sure what I'm doing! I need to add a class to a "portlet" while it is being dragged. I don't want to use the clone functionality because I want the user to drag the actual element, I just want to nodify the element while it is being dragged and reset it when it's dropped. Can anybody help?
