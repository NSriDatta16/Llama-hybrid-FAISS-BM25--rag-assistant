CakePHP, organize site structure around groups

So, I'm not quite sure how I should structure this in CakePHP to work correctly in the proper MVC form. Let's, for argument sake, say I have the following data structure which are related in various ways: Team Task Equipment This is generally how sites are and is quite easy to structure and make in Cake. For example, I would have the a model, controller and view for each item set. My problem (and I'm sure countless others have had it and already solved it) is that I have a level above the item sets. So, for example: Department Team Task Equipment Department Team Task Equipment Department Team Task Equipment In my site, I need the ability for someone to view the site at an individual group level as well as move to view it all together (ie, ignore the groups). So, I have models, views and controls for Depart, Team, Task and Equipment. How do I structure my site so that from the Department view, someone can select a Department then move around the site to the different views for Team/Task/Equipment showing only those that belong to that particular Department. In this same format, is there a way to also move around ignoring the department associations? Hopefully the following example URLs clarifies anything that was unclear: // View items while disregarding which group-set record they belong to http://www.example.com/Team/action/id http://www.example.com/Task/action/id http://www.example.com/Equipment/action/id http://www.example.com/Departments // View items as if only those associated with the selected group-set record exist http://www.example.com/Department/HR/Team/action/id http://www.example.com/Department/HR/Task/action/id http://www.example.com/Department/HR/Equipment/action/id Can I get the controllers to function in this manner? Is there someone to read so I can figure this out? Thanks to those that read all this :)
