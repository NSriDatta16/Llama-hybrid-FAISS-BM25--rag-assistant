ClaimedIdentifier for Google Accounts when using Dotnetopenauth

I'm currently switching from Janrain engange (rpxnow) to dotnetopenauth. In my database I have the claimedidentifieres from my users stored in the form https://www.google.com/accounts/o8/id?id=AItOawnVaDz_Os6ysv4-tB0zlhFan1ltyHWa10k When using engange I was able to switch between dev, test and prod enviroments and the claimed Ids would always remain the same. So I was asuming that these Ids would also be the same when using dotnetopenauth. To my surprise the are smiliar but not identical. What makes things even more confusing, is that it seems, that when I change the path of my webapp, e.g. from http://localhost/ to http://localhost/mvc , the claimed identifier also changes. Could somebody shed some light on this please and help me make my ids moveable from enviroment to another BTW: Moving other account types such as yahoo has worked without a problem
