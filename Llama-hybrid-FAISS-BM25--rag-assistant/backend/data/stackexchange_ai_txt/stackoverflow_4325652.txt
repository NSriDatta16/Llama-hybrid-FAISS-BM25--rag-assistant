For the situation you've described, you should consider having the controller (whose view contains all your imageviews) handle the touch events. I think what you are describing as a "detection layer" is in fact the region of the screen which your imageview occupies at the beginning of the stream of touch events. Repositioning the imageview on-the-fly (dragging) really is better handled by the parent view, I believe. A bonus to this approach is that you can more easily deal with rearranging the sibling views, defining behavior at the parent views boundaries, doing whatever you plan to do with sibling collisions/overlaps, etc. from the perspective of the superview.
