If you think 11MB is "too much" memory... you'd better avoid using Java entirely. Seriously, the JVM needs to do quite a lot of stuff (bytecode verifier, GC, loading all the essential classes), and in an age where average desktop machines have 4GB of RAM, keeping the base JVM overhead (and memory use in generay) very low is simply not a design priority. If you need your app to run on an embedded system (pretty much the only case where 11 MB might legitimately be considered "too much"), then there are special JVMs designed for such sytems that use less RAM - but at the cost of lacking many of the features and/or performance of mainstream JVMs.
