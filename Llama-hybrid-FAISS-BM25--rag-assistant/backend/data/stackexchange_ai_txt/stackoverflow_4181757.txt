If you do not record the inbetween points, your application will only create a line between the start and end. In order to get a line that curves to your tracing, you need to add an event for touchesMoved. Here is some psuedo-code of event handlers that is needed to create a drawing app. - (void) touchesBegan:(NSSet*)touches withEvent:(UIEvent*)event { //Record your first point here CGPoint point = [ [touches anyObject] locationInView:self]; } - (void) touchesMoved:(NSSet*)touches withEvent:(UIEvent*)event { //Record another point CGPoint point = [ [touches anyObject] locationInView:self]; //Call your rendering function [self draw]; } - (void) touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { //Record another point CGPoint point = [ [touches anyObject] locationInView:self]; //Call your rendering function [self draw] //Add any finishing code here }
