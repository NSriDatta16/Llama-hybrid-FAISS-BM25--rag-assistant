How does a machine learning model distinguish between ordered discrete int and continuous int?

Lets say I am classifying if a user will like a Airbnb listing or not (binary classification model) I have 2 features: Number of house rules the Airbnb host has. Since this is a count, this is a discrete (categorical) variable. We will store this as an int because it is ordered (10 house rules is greater than 9 house rules). Price of the Airbnb listing, rounded to the nearest whole dollar. This is clearly a continuous variable. It is also stored as an int . If I'm not missing anything, do I need to specify anything myself to the machine learning model (let's say logistic regression since XGBoost classifier probably auto handles this) to distinguish between the discrete and continuous int? Or is there nothing to worry about here and it will automatically be handled for me?
