You might want to try simply using stylesheets to directly style a tab instead of subclassing just for that purpose. In the stylesheet, you can use the :tab subcontrol to access a single tab, and you can then modify a dynamic propoerty to set its state as either needing attention or not, and applying the style based on the dynamic property. See : :tab sub control , Customizing using dynamic properties
