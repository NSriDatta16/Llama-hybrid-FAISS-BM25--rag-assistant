Jquery sortable 'change' event element position

Is there way to get current position of helper being dragged on over new position ? $("#sortable").sortable({ start: function (event, ui) { var currPos1 = ui.item.index(); }, change: function (event, ui) { var currPos2 = ui.item.index(); } }); It seems that currPos1 and currPos2 have same value when actual change happens ! What I need to achieve is highlight to user all positions between 'start drag element' to 'currently replaced element'. Once user releases mouse button update happens and only then I get new position, but I need it before mouse release.
