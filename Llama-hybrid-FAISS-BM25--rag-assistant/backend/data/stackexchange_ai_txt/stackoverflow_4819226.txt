What's the best way to detect a browser with php?

Could anyone tell me the best way to detect a browser using php? IE 6 and 7 are terrible when it comes to achieving full browser compatibility with CSS so my site isn't going to support and version of IE that's older than 8. I'm current using $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'] to detect the browser but I've been told that that isn't a good way to do it since browsers can lie and send any user agent info that they want. So, does anyone know of a sure fire way to detect the type of browser that the client is using?
