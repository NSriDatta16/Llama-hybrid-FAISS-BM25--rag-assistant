I've had this problem when running Visual Studio 2008 on Windows 7. VS2008 must run with admin privileges on Windows 7, so I'm running it as a different user. I'm pretty sure this prevents drag 'n' drop working as the application runs fine when run as an app, but drag 'n' drop won't work when being run from Visual Studio.
