10 minutes wind speed data to 1 second wind speed data

I have a wind speed data series .txt file (1 year long), in which in each register I have the following info: date; hour; 10 minute wind speed average; 10 minute max value; 10 minute sigma An example of the data would be like this: 050206 0130 8.05 10.28 0.84 050206 0150 7.29 11.06 1.13 .... For each 10 minutes, the available information is the wind speed average, the maximum value in such 10 minutes and the standard deviation in such 10 minutes. Such statistics for each 10 minutes are calculated with 1 s sampling data (600 values for each 10 minutes). It can be assumed that the 1 s sampled values are Normally distributed. The problem is that such 1 s sampled values are not available and I need them for my study. So, the questions are: -Is there a mathematical/statistical solid well known method to generate the 1 s values for each 10 minute register assuming that they are Normally distributed?? -Is there a mathematical/statistical solid well known method to link each 1 s values with coherence?? I would like to implement a Python script in order to do so.
