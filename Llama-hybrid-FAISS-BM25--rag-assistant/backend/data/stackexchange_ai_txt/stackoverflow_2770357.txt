.NET framework 4 total application deployment size

After watching in horror as the .NET framework 3.5 SP1 bloated to whopping 231 MB I was amazed to see that .NET Framework 4 Full (x86) is only 35 MB and client profile just 29 MB. My question is if .NET Framework 4 is in any way dependent on previous versions of the framework being installed on the client machine or if my users will have to download only 29 (or 35) MB if I develop a Winforms or WPF desktop application in VS 2010 targeting .NET Framework version 4.0? Edit: Wikipedia concurs with the answers: Some developers have expressed concerns about the large size of .NET framework runtime installers for end-users. The size is around 54 MB for .NET 3.0, 197 MB for .NET 3.5, and 250 MB for .NET 3.5 SP1 (while using web installer the typical download for Windows XP is around 50 MB, for Windows Vista - 20 MB). The size issue is partially solved with .NET 4 installer (x86 + x64) being 54 MB and not embedding full runtime installation packages for previous versions.
