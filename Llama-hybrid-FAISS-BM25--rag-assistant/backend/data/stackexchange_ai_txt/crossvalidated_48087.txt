thank you for answering. But as far as I see, my question isn't answered. Because I'm not even sure, whether I posted the way it should be, I try to ask again this way: We tried this before the way Gilbert described it. Using "seqdef" (and seqsum before) there is indeed the opportunity defining 'real states' but not the gaps with defined index-costs, or am I wrong? Or the other way around: Is there a 'code' defining the gaps? It's because the custom set costs are only accounted for 'real states' (not the gaps) if you set submission costs like this: R> subm.custom Anybody can help? (if my question isn't understandable, please let me know)
