Problem with IE8 web accelerator

I try to create a web accelerator for IE8. My original XML file was: http://localhost:3090 My web accelerator http://localhost:3090/favicon.ico It works ok, but when I tried to add "preview" feature, IE8 has reported the error message: "There was a problem with the Accelerator's information." The modified XML file is: http://localhost:3090 My web accelerator http://localhost:3090/favicon.ico What's wrong with added XML fragment?
