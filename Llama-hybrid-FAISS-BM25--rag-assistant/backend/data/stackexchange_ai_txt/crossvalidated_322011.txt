How to use the null hypothesis in hypothesis testing -- draw a conclusion

This may be an odd question, but am learning about hypothesis testing and having a hard time with the logic of it, especially getting comfortable with how to draw a conclusion from the null hypothesis! For example, here is an example question: Test the hypothesis that the mean weight of North Americans is at least 175lbs. The mean of weights of 100 sampled people is 178lbs, with a sample standard deviation of 8lbs. What can we conclude? Here are the steps I understand: -Define the null hypothesis: The average weight of North Americans is less than ( =) 175lbs.) -Assume the null hypothesis to be true. -Find the Z-score associated with some significance interval (let's say, 95%; which for a two-tailed test, Z-score would be -1.96,1.96) -Calculate the Z-score for the problem: $\frac{(Sample Mean - Hypothesis Mean)}{(Standard Deviation)}$ --> $\frac{(178 - 175)}{(8/\sqrt{100})} \approx 3.75$ Here is where I have a hard time drawing a conclusion. I've drawn out the normal curve and marked the confidence interval boundaries and z-score, but have a hard time with how these are used to either accept/reject the null hypothesis. Here the null hypothesis assumes the average weight of North Americans is less than ( Sorry if these are basic questions, I'm having a hard time getting comfortable with the pattern of logic here, even by drawing out. Any insights are greatly appreciated. Thanks for your time!
