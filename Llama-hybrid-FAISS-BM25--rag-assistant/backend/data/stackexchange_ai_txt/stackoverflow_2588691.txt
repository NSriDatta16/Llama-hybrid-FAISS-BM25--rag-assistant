What is the encoding of your data? is it plain ASCII, or is it something else, like UTF-8/Unicode? if it is plain ASCII, you could just allocate a StringBuilder() of the required size (get the size from the ContentLength header of the response) and keep on appending your data to the builder, after converting it into a string using Encoding.ASCII. If it is Unicode/UTF8 then you have an issue - you cannot just call Encoding..GetString(buffer, 0, bytesRead) on the bytes read, because the bytesRead might not constitute a logical string fragment in that encoding. For this case you will need to buffer the entire entity body into memory(or file), then read that file and decode it using the encoding.
