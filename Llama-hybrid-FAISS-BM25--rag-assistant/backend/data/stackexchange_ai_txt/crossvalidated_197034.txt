Different order and signs of eigenvectors when doing PCA via eig() or svd() functions in Matlab

Assume we have a matrix X = randn(5,3) . I am doing two things: 1) [S D1 V1] = svd(X); 2) [V2 D2] = eig(X'*X); I am getting: V1 = -0.6220 0.5046 0.5987 -0.6549 -0.7544 -0.0446 -0.4292 0.4198 -0.7997 and V2 = 0.5987 0.5046 0.6220 -0.0446 -0.7544 0.6549 -0.7997 0.4198 0.4292 First question : How can we interpret the difference between V1 and V2 ? why some negative values are getting positive and the values are in reverse order? Second question : in principal component analysis, one can compute the principal components (PCs) as Z = S*D1 or Z = X*V2 . But in this case S*D1 is not equal to X*V2 but X*V1 . So the PCs are Z = X*V1 not X*V2 right?
