I agree with whuber that your question is still vague. However, I will try to provide a solution. A common model for time series is the ARIMA model. Assuming this model is a good fit to your data it would allow for estimation and inference on the mean of the process over time. It would also allow you to extrapolate estimation and inference on the mean at future time points as well as to construct predict intervals for future observations. Below is a picture from this SAS documentation webpage on Proc VARMAX. Another related procedure would be Proc ARIMA. You could model both of your time series each with different time indices. By interpolating the means between time points you could compare the means between the series at common time points. Let me know if this addresses your question or if you were interested in something else.
