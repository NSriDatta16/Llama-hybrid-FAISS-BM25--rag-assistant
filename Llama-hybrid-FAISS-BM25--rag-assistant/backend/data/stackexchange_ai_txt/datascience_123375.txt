How to count number of circular pipes in an image using Deep Learning or Machine Learning?

I'm trying to build a program to count the number of pipes from a given image, here are some example test images. [![enter image description here][2]][2] [![enter image description here][3]][3] I want to use deep learning for the same. I have looked at several blogs and research papers but find it difficult to create my own CNN for the same, as I have just started studying Neural Networks. Can I use YOLO for object detection or UNet for segmentation? [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/G7KFi.jpg [3]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/5yoc2.jpg
