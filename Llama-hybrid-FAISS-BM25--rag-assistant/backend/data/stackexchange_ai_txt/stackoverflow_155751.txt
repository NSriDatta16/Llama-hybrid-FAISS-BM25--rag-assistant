Checking for and not printing JavaScript in generated data?

In my php web app, suppose I want to go the extra mile and in addition to going gang-busters and being anal-retentive about sanitizing my inputs, I also want to ensure that no JavaScript is being output in strings I am inserting into html templates. Is there a standard way to make sure I don't put JavaScript in the generated html content?
