Predicting risk factors

i'm trying to find predictive risk factors i already found out that young age at diagnosis is a risk factor ( binary logistic regression) But now i want to know the exact age when the risk is highest. Is there a way to find out at what age the risk is higher than other ages.. ( i already tried to make age groups and compare them, but i want to know the exact age... In the end i want to end up with: children with an age of 0-2 years have more chance to develop ... than children with an age > 2 years
