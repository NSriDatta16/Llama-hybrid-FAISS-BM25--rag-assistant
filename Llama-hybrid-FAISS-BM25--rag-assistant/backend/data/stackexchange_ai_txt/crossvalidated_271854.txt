posterior predictive p-values understating

I seem to misunderstand the calculation process of posterior predictive p-values. Let's say I have dataset of concentration of 400 different proteins measured in 9 rats. So: $x_{pr}$ for $r=1...9, p=1...400$ The way that I understand posterior predictive p-values should be calculated is: 1) you run your MCMC chain for each sample $'i'$ in your chain (and each protein $'p'$): 2) you calculate the variance of your actual data $s^{2 (true)}_{p}$ 3) you calculate the variance of your simulated data $s^{2 (pred)}_{p}$ 4) you calculate $M_{ip} = I(s^{2 (pred)}_{p} > s^{2 (true)}_{p}) \in \{0,1\}$ You use your $M_{ip}$ values to calculate $P(s^{2 (pred)}_{p} > s^{2 (true)}_{p}) \approx \frac{\sum_{i}M_{ip}}{N}$ ($N$ being the total number of samples) Do I understand this correctly? So overall we have 400 different p-values ranged between 0 and 1? Also, how should it look like if my model is supposedly good?
