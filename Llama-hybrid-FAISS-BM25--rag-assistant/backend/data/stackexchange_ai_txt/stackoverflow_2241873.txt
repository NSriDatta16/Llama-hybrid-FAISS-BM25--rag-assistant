Visual Studio 2008 play sound on error while debugging

I have a long running process (40+ min) that I am debugging. I don't want to have to give my workstation my full attention while I'm debugging. I'd like if VS could play a sound if an exception occurs to pull my attention back to my workstation so I can resolve the issue and move on. Is this possible?
