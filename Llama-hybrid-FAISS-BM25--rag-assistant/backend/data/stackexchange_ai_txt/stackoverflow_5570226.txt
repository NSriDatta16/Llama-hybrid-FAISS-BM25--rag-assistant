Some kind of drag'n drop based IDE/GUI-tool would have been nice? With capabilities to record the interactions, and put descriptive text on animations. Instead of UC's design IDE you let IDE do UC's. With the IDE/GUI in a specific state you can let a pop-up show what happens by write UC or some text on that pop-up, comming up every time that specific state is conditioned by the user or developer. The pop-up can be connected to more pop-ups depending on what happens in the real world. Like those text adventures asking "what do you want to do now?". And a UC pop-up kan trigg events to change the IDE/GUI or change other states according to test-suites made from the specifications. A test-suite map inputs to outputs. Interactions with the IDE/GUI select inputs and the outputs changes the state of a prototype of the data-layer of the program. Theoretically you can do all functions with in/out-tables (some infinetly large) instead of algorithms. Practically when a table is big enough, let one programmer use it as a test-suite to do an algorithm and exchange the table. The table now used as a test-suite reporting errors. Let the IDE/GUI-tool generate the code for the final event driven IDE/GUI interacting by events with code, data and user layers, or better you let it be reflective with all in one layer, to get rid of endless restructurings. That was just some id√©as
