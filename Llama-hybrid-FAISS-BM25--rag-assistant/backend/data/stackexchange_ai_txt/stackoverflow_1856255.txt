Porting MS SQL stored procedures to MySQL

i have about 140 - 150 stored procedures that I need to migrate from MS SQL 2005 to MySQL 5.1 After succesfully porting 0 of them in the last eight hours I decied to drop by and ask if anyone has any experience, or tips, or knows some util app that can help. MySQL Administrator is not very helpfull, with a frustrating "MySQL Error number 1064 You have an error in your SQL Syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax". Given that an average SP is +100 lines long, simply GUESSING what the problem is is not an option. Eg. This is the exact error that I get : Script line: 1 You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near '' at line 5 Then at line 5 all I have is: declare PropID float;
