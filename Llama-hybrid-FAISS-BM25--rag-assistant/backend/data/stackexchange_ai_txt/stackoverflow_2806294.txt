You could always just concat them together before evaluating them. pCardAccount.Concat(expenditures).ToArray() should generate a single sql statement with a union. As to whether there is any benefit to this in your situation, I don't know. There's also a chance that linq-to-sql won't be able to generate the SQL for the concat and will throw an exception whenever you use it. I'm not sure what causes it, but I've seen it a few times when I was playing around in a similar situation. Edit: I just noticed that your keys are different in each of the queries. I'm not sure if this is a typo or not, but if it isn't, you won't be able to concat them due to the different types and it wouldn't make any sense to anyway
