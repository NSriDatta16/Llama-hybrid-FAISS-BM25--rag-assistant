inelegant (but effective) way: use percentages #horizontal-style { width: 100%; } li { width: 20%; } This only works with the 5 example. For more or less, modify your percentage accordingly. If you have other s on your page, you can always assign these particular ones a class of "menu-li" so that only they are affected.
