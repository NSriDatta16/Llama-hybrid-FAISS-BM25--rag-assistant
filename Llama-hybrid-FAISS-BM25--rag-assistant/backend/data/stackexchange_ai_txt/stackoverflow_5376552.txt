What you want is a space-filling-curve like a Z-Curve or a Hilbert-Curve and then instead to compute the index convert it to a quadtree-key for each tile. A sfc reduce the 2D-problem to a 1D problem. Then with the new key you want to perform a DFS or BFS to look for overlapping tiles. I've wrote a class for sfc in php at phpclasses.org ( hilbert-curve ). You are welcome to download.
