Its possible. You might be able to do it with regexp, with somethings similar to bellow. You will have to run it multiple times tho, as this regex replaces only 1 " with ' between tags. Serach: (\ .+?)(")(.+?\ ) Replace: $1'$3 But, the better approach would be to utilise callbacks to do function replacement. Just create RE that sends content of tags to the function, which can then simply replace " with whatever you want. See more info here . Search for callback. As derobert noted, you might need to remove comments before that :)
