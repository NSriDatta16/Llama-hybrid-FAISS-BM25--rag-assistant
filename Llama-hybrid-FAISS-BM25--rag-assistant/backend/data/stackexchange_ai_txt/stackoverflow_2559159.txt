How to dynamic call property on javascript object with jQuery

Hallo all. I got a javascript object with some propeties let's say function Animal() { this.id; this.name; I need to call id function in a dynamic way to get and set its value: something like this Animal animal = new Animal(); var propertyName = "id"; animal.+propertyName = "name"; Is there an elegant way to do it? With jQuery? Kind regards Massimo
