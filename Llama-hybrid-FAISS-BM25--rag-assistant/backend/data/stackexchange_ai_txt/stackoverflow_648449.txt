Server-generated keys and server-generated values are not supported by SQL Server Compact

I just started to play with the entity framework, so I decided to connect it to my existing SQL Server CE database. I have a table with an IDENTITY(1, 1) primary key but when I tried to add an entity, I've got the above-mentioned error. From MS Technet artice I learned that SQL Server Compact does not support entities with server-generated keys or values when it is used with the Entity Framework. When using the Entity Framework, an entityâ€™s keys may be marked as server generated. This enables the database to generate a value for the key on insertion or entity creation. Additionally, zero or more properties of an entity may be marked as server-generated values. For more information, see the Store Generated Pattern topic in the Entity Framework documentation. SQL Server Compact does not support entities with server-generated keys or values when it is used with the Entity Framework, although the Entity Framework allows you to define entity types with server-generated keys or values. Data manipulation operation on an entity that has server-generated values throws a "Not supported" exception. So now I have a few questions: Why would you mark key as server-generated if it is not supported and will throw an exception? It's hard to make sence from the quoted paragraph. When I've tried to add StoreGeneratedPattern="Identity" to my entity's property, Studio complained that it is not allowed. What I'm doing wrong? What is the best workaround for this limitation (including switching to another DB)? My limitations are zero-installation and using entity framework.
