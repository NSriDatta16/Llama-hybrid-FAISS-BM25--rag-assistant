First of all the zero-inflated poisson is not a link function, it is an error distribution. Secondly, your data are not counts but ordinal scores, the numbers assigned are purely arbitrary. As a result, count models are inappropriate for this type of data. Ordinal logistic regression is what you are looking for.
