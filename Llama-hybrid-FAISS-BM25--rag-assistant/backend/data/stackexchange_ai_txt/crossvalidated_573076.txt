One of the challenges of time series classification is that most ML algorithms assume the feature variables are independent of each other. That's often not the case in a time series, as a value of the series at one time point likely depends on one or more of the preceding values. So using either a time series feature extraction method to provide the features for a standard classifier (such as random forest) or a specialised time series classifier is often beneficial. There are a number of time series feature extractors that have been proposed. An example is Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX) Jessica Lin et al., Experiencing SAX: a novel symbolic representation of time series , which transforms a time series into a set of "words" that can be used as features for a classifier. If you're using Python, you could try using the sktime package , which is a package of tools for time series machine learning. It includes several time series feature extractors and classifiers.
