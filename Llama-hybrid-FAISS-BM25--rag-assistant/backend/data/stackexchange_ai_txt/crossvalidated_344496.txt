PCA - Reconstruction from a "clean" set of eigenvectors?

This is a question related to the explanation here on how to reconstruct data from PCs found here: How to reverse PCA and reconstruct original variables from several principal components? I have two datasets (spectral imagery data) that are similar but one should contain a feature that the other doesn't (i.e. I have a "clean" image as a reference and a "experiment" image containing a feature not present in the reference). I want to calculate the eigenvectors from the reference image and use these eigenvectors to reconstruct the experiment image. The theory being then that the difference between the real experiment image and the experiment image reconstructed using the reference eigenvectors should highlight the feature we're interested in. The thing I don't understand is how this works in practice. Using this equation from How to reverse PCA and reconstruct original variables from several principal components? : $$\boxed{\text{PCA reconstruction} = \text{PC scores} \cdot \text{Eigenvectors}^\top + \text{Mean}}$$ Can I simply drop in my "clean" eigenvectors or do I need to rescale them (or the PC scores)? Logically it would seem some rescaling would be needed somewhere but I'm not 100% clear on how.
