Appropriate method for time series data

I am interested in comparing the presence/absence of different species ( MUVI80 , MUXX80 , MICRO80 , etc.) both within and between datetime rows. Here is an example of my data: datetime MUVI80 MUXX80 MICRO80 TAHU80 TAST80 ERDO80 LEAM80 ONZI80 MEME80 MAMO80 2012-10-30 17:42:00 FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE 2012-10-31 17:42:00 TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE 2012-11-01 17:42:00 FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE 2012-11-02 17:42:00 FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE 2012-11-03 17:42:00 FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE 2012-11-04 16:42:00 TRUE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE Specifically, I would like to determine if a MICRO80 was seen in the second time step ( 2012-10-31 17:42:00 ) how likely am I to see, for example, MUVI80 or MUXX80 within that same time step ( 2012-10-31 17:42:00 ) or in the immediately prior ( 2012-10-30 17:42:00 ) or following ( 2012-11-01 17:42:00 ) time steps? Despite that I know what I would like to figure out, I do not know what sort of statistical analysis would be most appropriate to answer this preliminary question. If this question is not appropriate for CrossValidated and would be better suited for a different forum, my apologies and please let me know where it should be posted!
