Assessing correlations, adjusted for time

I have time series data for two signals, $X$ and $Y$. At $\text{time}=0$, the both $X$ and $Y$ are roughly 50. As time progresses, $X$ increases to settle at 100 and $Y$ decreases to settle at 0. Hence, the time-series go from (50,50) to (0,100). My question is, if I plot this data, clearly $X$ any $Y$ will appear negatively correlated. Is there a way to control for the correlation that develops just by virtue of the time? Or am I thinking about this all wrong?
