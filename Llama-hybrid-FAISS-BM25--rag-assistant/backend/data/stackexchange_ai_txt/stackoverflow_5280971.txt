The problem is that you're passing showData() to then() , not showData . You should pass a reference to a function to .then() : $.when(method1(), method2()) .then(showData); or $.when(method1(), method2()) .then(function () { showData(); }); Edit I've put together a working demo . Part of the problem (at least in the code fragment you posted) was that there was no callback function named $callback . Part of the problem was the $ in the callback name '$callback' . So, remove the jsonp: '$callback' ajax option, so that jQuery defaults to a callback function named callback , and define a function with that name, and it all works.
