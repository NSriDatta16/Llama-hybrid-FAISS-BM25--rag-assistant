Your logic is correct. Based on the estimated mean and standard deviation that you have for the wind speeds I checked that you constructed a 95% confidence interval for the mean correctly on the log scale. Using the exponential transformation on the scale of the original speed measurement (knots) the interval I get is approximately [64.85, 69.96]. What do you think is wrong with that? Note that on the log scale 4.92 is far above the upper limit of the interval. Also only 9 of the 291 observations are above 4.92. which means on the scale of knots only 9 cases are abobe 137 knots. Hurricane speeds are much higher than normal wind speeds so most of the other observed speeds are going to be much lower than 137 (apparently more likely to be in the range 60 to 70 knots). If you are confused because 137 is far above 69.96 don't be. 4.92 is far above 4.25 on the log scale also. All this is telling you is that category 5 hurricanes have winds speeds far above the average speeds observed in the north Atlantic basin over the time period from 1980 to 2006. There should be nothing surprising about that conclusion. But if you want to answer the question in the title of your problem the confidence interval for the mean doesn't answer your question. You should take the fitted normal distribution and calculate the probability for the interval from [4.92, âˆž) to estimate that probability.
