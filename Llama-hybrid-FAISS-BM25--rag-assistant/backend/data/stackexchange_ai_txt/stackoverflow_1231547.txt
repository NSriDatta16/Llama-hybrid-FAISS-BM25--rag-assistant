1 . Should everything be within document.ready(function() {});? No, I think that the document.ready function must be only to initialize things, assign event handlers and so on. 2 . Is there any reason to have anything outside of document.ready(function() {});? Code reutilization, and better code organization. 3 . Is the code within document.ready(function() {}); inaccessible by outer code? Yes, the variables and objects created on the document.ready are inaccessible from the outer scope.
