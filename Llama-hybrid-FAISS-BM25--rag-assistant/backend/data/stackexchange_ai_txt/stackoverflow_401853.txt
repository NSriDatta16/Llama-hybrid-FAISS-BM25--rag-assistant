I don't see an elegant solution. You could use the split message to get the characters into an array, but then once you've sorted the list I don't see a nice linear-time concatenate primitive to get back to a string. I'm surprised. Incidentally, run-length encoding is almost certainly a waste of time . I'd have to see some very impressive measurements before I'd think it worth considering. If you avoid run-length encoding, you can anagrammatize any string , not just a string of letters. And if you know you have only letters and are trying to save space, you can pack them 5 bits to a letter. ---Irma Vep EDIT : the other poster found join which I missed. Nice.
