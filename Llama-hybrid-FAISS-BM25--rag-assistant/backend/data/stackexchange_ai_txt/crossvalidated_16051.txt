How best to reduce dimensionality of a dataset composed of events and trials?

I'm trying to reduce dataset dimensionality. PCA is a good metric but that gives me new dataset. My goal is to determine from number of events (e.g. 60) and number of trials (e.g. 6) which events are more relevant. For example: 1st, 3rd, 21st, 45th ... (N total) events are good enough to approximate behavior of dataset. That will allow me to discard 60-N events, and to deal with only N. For now, I'm calculating covariance matrix, and take events for which correlation is smaller than some threshold. Is there some official metric or math function for this?
