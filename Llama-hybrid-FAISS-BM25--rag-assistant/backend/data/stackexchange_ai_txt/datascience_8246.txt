What is conjugate gradient descent?

What is Conjugate Gradient Descent of Neural Network? How is it different from Gradient Descent technique? I came across a resource , but was unable to understand the difference between the two methods. It has mentioned in the procedure that: the next search direction is determined so that it is conjugate to previous search directions. What does this mean? Also, what is line search mentioned in the web page? Can anyone please explain it with the help of a diagram?
