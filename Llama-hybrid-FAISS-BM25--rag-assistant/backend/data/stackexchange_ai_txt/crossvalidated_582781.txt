Transforming the Odds ratio of logistic regression coefficients to the original scale

I have fitted a logistic regression model with a transformed variable $z$ , where $z=x/M$ . I want to interpret the $\beta$ coefficients in the original scale (in-terms of x). I started following calculation. First, I wrote the Odds rations in the transformed scale, as follows: let $\pi_1=logit(p1)=\beta_0+\beta_1z$ and $\pi_2=logit(p2)=\beta_0+\beta_1(z+1)$ . Then, $\pi_1-\pi_2=log(\hat{OR})=\beta_1$ . And $\hat{OR}=exp(\beta_1)$ . This $OR$ was calculated based on z. Now, I want to calculate $OR$ for x. My friends said that $OR$ based on x would be $exp(\beta_1/M)$ . I want to prove it. So I substitute $z=x/M$ in the above calculation. Then, $\pi_1=logit(p1)=\beta_0+\beta_1x/M$ and $\pi_2=logit(p2)=\beta_0+\beta_1(x/M+1)$ $\pi_1-\pi_2=log(\hat{OR})=\beta_1$ . This is not what I expected. Correct answer should be $\beta_1/M$ Could anyone explain what did I do wrong?
