To sum up your options: If a screen-shot of a portion of the PDF is good enough, then as tomlog answered, you could find a library or existing code to extract said portion as an image, and display that image in the "lightbox". If, however, you need actual PDF-viewing functionality , it can not be done in IE6/7 without loading into an Adobe Flash/swf object, or contained within the official Adobe Reader browser plug-in somehow. Going the plug-in route, you will have to use an iFrame . If the Flash /embedding approach seems better, jvenema suggested http://stickmanlabs.com/lightwindow/ which has a "Flash Paper" demo (Flash Paper is the official way to embed PDF documents) you could check out, or embedding something else, as seen at http://www.scribd.com/ and others.
