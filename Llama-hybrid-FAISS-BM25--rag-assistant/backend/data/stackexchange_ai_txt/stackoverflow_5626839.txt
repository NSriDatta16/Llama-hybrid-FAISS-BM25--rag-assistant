I have found a way to do what I want. The only problem is that at this moment I do not know how to check whether the FrontEnd has some pending inputs. I am forced just to wait 1 second. In the most cases it is sufficient time for sending all pending inputs to the kernel but probably not always. In[1]:= $new$PreRead = False; AbortAllPendingInputs := AbortProtect[If[! $new$PreRead, $new$PreRead = True; $TimeOfAbort = SessionTime[]; last$PreRead = ToString[Definition[$PreRead], InputForm]; ClearAll[$PreRead]; $PreRead := If[TrueQ[SessionTime[] - $TimeOfAbort But I am still looking for more elegant solution. I think that if the FrontEnd creates an input queue for MathKernel it probably can also cancel this queue.
