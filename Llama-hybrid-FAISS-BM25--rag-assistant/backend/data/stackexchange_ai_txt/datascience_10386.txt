Role and need of Mathematics in Data Science

I am Bachelors of Engineering in Software Engineering field and having 3 years professional work experience in Oracle ERP/Database related technologies. Now I'm planning to pursue MSc in Data Science. What I need to know that what sort of Mathematics skills should a Data Scientist have? As we had learned numerous subjects like Numerical Analysis, Statistics, Linear Algebra etc.
