Derivation of CNN math equations in Matrix format

I've gone through jefkine's website and Jae Seo's articles to get a hold of math behind the famous CNN architecture. Although I understand it in theory, I'm unable to implement in matrix format or to put it straight... In numpy format. After digging through internet like a broken web scraper, I could only understand FC ANN after Andrew Ng tutorial and this, sudeepraja.github.io/Neural/. Can someone please help me understand CNN architecture in similar way? I'm expecting downvotes and closed as off topic by admins for being naive and dumb. If that's the price I gotta pay to learn... So be it!
