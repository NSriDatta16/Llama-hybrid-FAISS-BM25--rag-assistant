js-regression: intercept and betha coefficient

I am trying to run a simple logistic regression (response ~ stimulus, where responses are "f" or "s" and stimulus goes from 1 to 11). My main objective is to calculate the turning point of the function (-alpha/beta). I have to use JavaScript to do it. For that, I am using js-regression package. However, the js-regression returns theta, a pair of numbers different from the alpha and beta I need. Does someone know how to calculate alpha and beta (or the turning point) from theta? For example, consider the following data: response JavaScript: var jsregression = require('js-regression') var logistic = new jsregression.LogisticRegression(); var dados = require('data_simulated.json') logistic.fit(dados) Output: theta: [ 0.5397380297076451, 0.46554794170958247 ], threshold: 0.7320965934732375, cost: -4.387012914910967, config: { alpha: 0.001, lambda: 0, iterations: 100 } The R output, using glm(family = "binomial") , is intercept = -3.5744; beta = 0.8816 . Using js-regression, the output is theta= [0.5397380297076451, 0.46554794170958247] .
