Machine Learning is one of the few things where 99% is excellent and 100% is terrible. Well, I cannot prove this because I don't have your data, but probably: the test data is included in the training data. To check this possibility, here's a hint: print(X_test[X_test.isin(X_train)]) will print all the rows in X_test that appear in X_train. Can you think what to do with that information? :) Or you forgot to remove the target variable y from X . To check this possibility, simply type: print(X_train.columns) and check whether one of the columns matches the name of the target variable.
