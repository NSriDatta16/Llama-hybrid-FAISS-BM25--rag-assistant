Is GridSearchCV in combination with ImageDataGenerator possible and recommendable?

I want to optimize some hyperparameters for a CNN architecture by using GridSearchCV (Scikit-Learn) in combination with Data Augmentation (ImageDataGenerator from Keras). However, GridSearchCV only offers the fit function and not the fit_generator function. Is it even recommended to use data augmentation with GridSearchCV? The parameters for the ImageDataGenerator are already fixed and should not be changed. Would it be better to first determine the hyperparameters via grid search without data augmentation and only to use data augmentation for the final model? What do you think about this topic? What are your experiences?
