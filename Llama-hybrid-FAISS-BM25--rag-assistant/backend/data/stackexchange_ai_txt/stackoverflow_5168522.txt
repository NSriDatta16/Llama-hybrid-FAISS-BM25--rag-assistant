One other option is the more-or-less obvious one: define a table of the days of the week, and have a ManyToManyField map one to the other. The admin would just work, you can do searches based on dates, and it works on SQLite unlike some of the functions in django-bitfield. Searches can be fast, since they're within the database and you don't have to use SQL's LIKE (which ignores indexes if there are wildcards at the start of the string, which would be the case for CommaSeparatedIntegerField or a seven-character string). Sure, it takes more storage, but how many users do you have, anyway? Millions? P.S. if you have an ordering field in your weekday table, you can also make the database sort by day of week for you with something like queryset.order_by('available__order') .
