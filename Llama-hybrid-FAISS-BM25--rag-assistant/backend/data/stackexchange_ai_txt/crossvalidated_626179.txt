How can I restrict the predicted values of a bayesian linear regression?

Is there a way to restrict the predicted values, say, to only positive values or an interval of values? Let's say I want to estimate a linear model, y = a + Xb, using Bayesian techniques. I specify priors for a and b, a ~ Normal(0, 1), b ~ Normal(0,1). When estimating posteriors, I might get that b= -0.3 with some probability and a = 0.2 . What I want to do is to restrict the values of y to be positive always after replacing the values of a and b in the above equation, y = 0.2 - 0.3X. Here the value of X is always fixed. How can I do it?
