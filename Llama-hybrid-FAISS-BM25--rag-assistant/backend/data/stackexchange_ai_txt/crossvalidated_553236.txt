Random Forest - percentage contribution of variables

I have an RF model similar to the following. The variation explained is about 50% and the variable importance is the following: library("randomForest") library("caret") data("cars") my_data What I want is to extract the percentage contribution of each of the variables to the model. How can I do this?
