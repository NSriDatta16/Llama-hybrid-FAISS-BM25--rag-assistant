I would suggest you to consider both frequentist and Bayesian approaches, assessing their applicability to your particular circumstances. For the former, take a look at mixture model-based clustering (see basic information and recommended R package mclust ). For the latter, take a look at Dirichlet mixture models and, possibly, Dirichlet diffusion trees , which apply hierarchical clustering to Dirichlet process mixtures: http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~radford/ftp/dft-val7.pdf . Some other related literature can be found via relevant links at Radford Neal's research interests page .
