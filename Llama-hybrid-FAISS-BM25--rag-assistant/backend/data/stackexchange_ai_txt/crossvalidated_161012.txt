Testing Cointegration at level or with first differences?

I have a question regarding testing for cointegration. The situation is a follows: I have two time series that are both stationary at level when I consider "constant and trend". They are otherwise not stationary. The first differences are all stationary. With regard to Cointegration testing: Do we test cointegration (Johansen) at level or at first differences? If we test with the level data, is it okay to model with a trend?
