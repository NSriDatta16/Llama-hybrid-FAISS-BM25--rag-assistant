Probability threshold in ROC curve analyses

When conducting a logistic regression analysis in SPSS, a default threshold of 0.5 is used for the classification table . Consequently, individuals with a predicted probability 0.5 are assigned to Group "1". However, this threshold may not be the one that maximizes sensitivity and specificity. In other words, adjusting the threshold could potentially increase the overall accuracy of the model. To explore this, I generated a ROC curve , which provides both the curve itself and the coordinates . I can choose a specific point on this curve. My question now is, how do I translate from this ROC curve or its coordinates to the probability that I need to specify as the classification cutoff in SPSS (default: 0.50)? The value must naturally fall between 0 and 1. Do I simply need to select an X-value from the coordinate table where I have the best sensitivity/specificity (top left corner) and plug it into the formula for P(Y=1)? What do I do when I have more than one predictor (X) variable? Choose the best point/coordinate for both predictors separately and plug in the values into the equation for P(Y=1) and calculate the new cutoff value?
