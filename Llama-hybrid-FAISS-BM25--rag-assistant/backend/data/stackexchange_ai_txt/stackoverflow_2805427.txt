How to extract data from csv file in PHP

I have a csv file which looks like this $lines[0] = "text, with commas", "another text", 123, "text",5; $lines[1] = "some without commas", "another text", 123, "text"; $lines[2] = "some text with commas or no",, 123, "text"; And I would like to have a table: $t[0] = array("text, with commas", "another text", "123", "text","5"); $t[1] = array("some without commas", "another text", "123", "text"); $t[2] = array("some text, with comma,s or no", NULL , "123", "text"); If I use split($lines[0],",") I'll get "text" ,"with commas" ... Is there any elegant way to do it?
