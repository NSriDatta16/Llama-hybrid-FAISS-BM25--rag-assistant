The simplest answer that I can given to you is you can save your entire model or you can save only your weights of your module in hdf5 format or json format. After that you can load your model anytime form disk to memory. But the way you save your model may differ from the machine learning library that you are using. If you are using Tensorflow or keras here how to do it follow this link you will meet their official documentation. Anyway you could reach this simple explanation by doing a simple Google search too..
