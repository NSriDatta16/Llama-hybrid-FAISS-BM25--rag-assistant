Is the problem the bridge between your client and the SVN repo, or the versioning of binary files ? For the second one, I think there's no big deal. Read from here : http://help.collab.net/index.jsp?topic=/faq/svnbinary.html Note that whether or not a file is binary does not affect the amount of repository space used to store changes to that file, nor does it affect the amount of traffic between client and server. For storage and transmission purposes, Subversion uses a diffing method that works equally well on binary and text files; this is completely unrelated to the diffing method used by the svn diff command. Since versioning of big files can be rude for developers when updating/committing small changes, you can use a dedicated series of branches.
