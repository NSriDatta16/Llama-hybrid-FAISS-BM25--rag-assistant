understanding of libsvm output

I applied libsvm to build a text classifier. The output looks like as follows: w[a_b] = 0.006 w[a_c] = 0.032 w[a_ctif] = 0.000 w[a_cs] = 1.009 w[aa_d] = 0.000 w[a_e] = 0.001 The terms, e.g., a_b, and a_c, etc are the features generated for characterizing these documents. My question is how to understand these values corresponding to each term? The model output shows that all of these values are bigger than zero. Can I say that a positive file tends to have a term with higher weight?
