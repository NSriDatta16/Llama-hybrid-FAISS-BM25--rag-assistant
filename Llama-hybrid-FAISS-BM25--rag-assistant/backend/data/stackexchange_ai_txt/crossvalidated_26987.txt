Identifying a number of significance from a histogram

I'm creating a program that identifies trending music artists that uses Twitter metrics. I have data in a histogram format that represents the frequency of twitter @mentions of an artist for the last 30 days. I need my program to recognize a "significant" change (number that is quite greater than the rest in the sample) in the frequency of @mentions. Here is a data sample: histogram: [ 43, 17, 70, 137, 198, 113, 126, 96, 100, 130, 107, 112, 438, 215, 76, 30, 119, 78, 38, 27, 27, 35, 29, 38, 59, 35, 164, 113, 29, 111 ], In this scenario, 438 is the number of significance. It's fairly obvious in this data set b/c it is 2x greater than any other value. I need to build an equation that recognizes this number of significance across various data sets. In my first attempt at writing this equation, I will calculate the average of the 30 values and compare the average to the highest value in the data set. After doing some sampling, I will come up with a percentage difference that justifies significance. This is a simple approach, but I'm worried its too subjective. Are there any other ways of doing this?
