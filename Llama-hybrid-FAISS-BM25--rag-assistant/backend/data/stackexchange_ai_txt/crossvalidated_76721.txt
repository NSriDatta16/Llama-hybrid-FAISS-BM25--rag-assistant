EMD-SVR method for time series

Has anyone attempted to use Empirical Mode Decomposition(EMD)-Support Vector Regression(SVR) in nonstationary time series forecasting? It seems quite interesting. As I observed it has high performance compared with single SVR. But I didn't find it as a real approach for time series.
