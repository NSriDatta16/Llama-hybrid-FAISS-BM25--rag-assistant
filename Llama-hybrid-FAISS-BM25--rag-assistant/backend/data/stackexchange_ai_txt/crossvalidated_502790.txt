This makes me think of Meyn and Tweedie's book . They use $P$ to denote the transition kernel for a Markov chain, and $\mathsf{P}$ for the law of the entire chain on $\mathsf{X}^{\infty}$ . This answer is specific to Markov chains, but the distinction is obviously important. The difference between $P$ and $\mathbb{P}$ (and $E$ and $\mathbb{E}$ ) from book to book, is just for aesthetic appeal, in my opinion. I can't generalize where I see $\Pr()$ or $\text{Prob}()$ , really.
