Events and other stuff does not work in general

I got my static HTML(5) file with jQuery (latest release), and nothing that I tried got my jQuery Code running. origin html BynGame $(document).ready(jInit); function jInit(){ $.('#thebutton').click( function() { alert("HIT THE WALL");} ); } {{ login }} Home Neuen Eintrag erstellen Channel&#252;bersicht Registrieren Click Me or Hit Me Push The Button! I checked W3C.org and it occured NO validation error. (Even no related warnings) Now changing between $.(document).ready(jInit) and $.(document).ready(jInit()) makes no difference. Putting .ready() before or after jInit() does not affect the code. Putting something different into jInit() does not affect the code. Renaming jInit() to something else.... Using different jQuery refs...... simply calling $.get("#thebutton').click( function() { that I wrote; }); doesn't work The only thing that works is: (without any other code in front of it, otherwise it seems to be broken) $(document).ready(function() {alert("bla");}); Am I missing some basic Javascript Syntax? I am completely frustrated... because implementing JS into my Project is really essentiall and I turned to try to get the simpliest stuff to work, but event this fails.
