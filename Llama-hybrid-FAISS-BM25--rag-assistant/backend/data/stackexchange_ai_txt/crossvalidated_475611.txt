How does colinearity among the features impact classification problem in a) Logistic Regression b) Tree models like Decision Tree or Random Forest?

If I have 20 variables, should I do a pair-wise correlation check before building a classification model with Logistic Reg, Decision Tree or Random Forest ? Multicolinearity is a problem in regression. Is it a problem in classification as well ? Besides classifying, I also need to understand the influence of variables as well. The post Should one be concerned about multi-collinearity when using non-linear models? has conflicting answers.
