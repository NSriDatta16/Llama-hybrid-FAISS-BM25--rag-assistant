(-: Self answer :-) I would like to highlight one aspect of aggregates WRT efficiency : The order of evaluation of op== and op!= is irrelevant for (average) performance. Assuming separate implementations for now and given the two extremes (a-eq) all subelements equal and (b-neq) all subelements inequal, we have these cases: (a-eq) + operator== : Needs to compare all sub elements to return true (a-eq) + operator!= : Needs to compare all sub elements to return false (b-neq) + operator== : Returns false after 1st sub element is determined inequal (b-neq) + operator!= : Returns true after 1st sub element is determined inequal Since performance on average is the same either way it seems -- at least to me -- more natural to implement op!= in terms of op== , as it feels more natural to me to implement the equality op.
