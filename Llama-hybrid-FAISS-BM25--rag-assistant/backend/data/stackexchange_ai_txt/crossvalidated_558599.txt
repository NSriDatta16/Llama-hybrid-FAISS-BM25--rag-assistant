How is time series analysis a different problem than forecasting?

Rob Hyndman states : " The paper describing the competition [M] ( Makridakis et al, 1982 ) had a profound effect on forecasting research. It caused researchers to: ... treat forecasting as a different problem from time series analysis " and " Even today, I often have to explain to other academics why forecasting is not just an application of time series analysis ". I'd like to get a better understanding of where we draw the line between time series analysis and forecasting. What question is time series analysis trying to answer? What question is forecasting trying to answer? To restrict the scope a bit, let's focus on a single time series and what it would mean to conduct time series analysis on it and what would it mean to forecast it? Hyndman, R. J. (2020).
