cluster multivariate repeated measures

I have a dataset with 600 observations of 150 fields. Some fields were measured five times while others only two. Measures (continuous) were taken for 40 variables. My job is it to identify fields that are similar. Therefore I was thinking of cluster analysis. However, how to account for the repeated measures design. Fields were sampled multiple times to rate them under different farming practices. However, the observations are linked because the year depends on year-1 and so on. For me it is important to reduce the 150 fields to like 5-10 groups which I then want to predict from management data using e.g. random forest. I found the following link here quite helpful: Click Here I was using the advice in the comments by @EngrStudent to calculate means and standard deviations for all my variables. I further scaled the data by (x-mean/stdDev) to account for different measurement scales. Using the Elbow Criterion I was able to extract 5 (reasonable) groups from my data. However, I am uncertain weather this is "proper" statistics. It is planned to publish the results in a peer reviewed journal so I want to be on the safe side. My questions: Is it reasonable to use this approach, if yes, is there a name or publications I can cite? If no, what would be another approach? Identification of similarity between fields or identifying groups is important.
