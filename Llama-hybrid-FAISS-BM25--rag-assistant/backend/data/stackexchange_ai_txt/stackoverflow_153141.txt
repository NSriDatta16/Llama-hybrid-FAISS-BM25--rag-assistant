A quick google for C# xslt msxml revealed a link to the following page which gives many examples of extending XSLT in microsoft environments. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc302079.aspx Specifically the section on Mapping Types between XSLT and .Net gives you exactly the information you need: W3C XPath Type - Equivalent .NET Class (Type) String - System.String Boolean - System.Boolean Number - System.Double Result Tree Fragment - System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator Node Set - System.Xml.XPath.XPathNodeIterator So in your example I would try XPathNodeLiterator.
