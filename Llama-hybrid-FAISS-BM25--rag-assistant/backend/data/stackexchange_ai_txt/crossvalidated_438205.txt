Why would you use a scale_pos_weight of 17000.It seems wrong to me. The formula suggested to calculate it(according to official xgboost website) is: sum(negative instances) / sum(positive instances) In your case, you can rather use the square root of the result as suggested in this thread as your data seems very heavily skewed. Suggested scale_pos_weight for your data would be:[sqrt((1410667+97)/371)] => 62
