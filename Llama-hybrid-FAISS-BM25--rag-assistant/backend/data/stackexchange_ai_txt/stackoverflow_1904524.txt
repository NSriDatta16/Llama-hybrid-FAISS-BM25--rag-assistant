asp.net-mvc and webforms co-existing

I know I've asked this question before, and I know there are plenty of resources out there describing the technique but I cannot for the life of me work it out. I began by creating a simple WebForms application. I then added the Views and Controllers folders. I then added home and shared folders to the views and added an Index.aspx and a site.master file. I created the HomeController.cs file. I then made the changes to the web.config and added the web.config into the views folder. I then made the changes to the global.asax page. The whole thing compiles, routes appear to get registered but I simply cannot open the Home/Index page. I always get "HTTP Error 404 - Not Found" Has anyone actually managed to do this? Oh and we're using IIS6 here. CODE BELOW Global public static void RegisterRoutes(System.Web.Routing.RouteCollection routes) { routes.IgnoreRoute("{resource}.axd/{*pathInfo}"); routes.IgnoreRoute("{resource}.aspx/{*pathInfo}"); routes.MapRoute( "Default", // Route name "{controller}.mvc/{action}/{id}", // URL with parameters new { action = "Index", id = "" } // Parameter defaults ); routes.MapRoute( "Root", "", new { controller = "Home", action = "Index", id = "" } ); } Web.Config Home Controller using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Linq; using System.Web; using System.Web.Mvc; [HandleError] public class HomeController : Controller { public ActionResult Index() { return View(); } public ActionResult About() { return View(); } } Home View MVC Home Page
