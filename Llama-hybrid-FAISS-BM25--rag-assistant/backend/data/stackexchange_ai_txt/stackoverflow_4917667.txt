I'd start by trying to isolate where the timeout is happening. You've mentioned a 15MB zip with 2,500 files which doesn't strike me as particularly large. Have you tried creating a deployment package in Visual Studio then running it directly on the server? This will take network latency out of the picture which is a pretty fundamental variable when it comes to timeouts. As for why a zip with the entire application needs to be uploaded, you need to remember the actual identification of what has changed and subsequent deployment into IIS all happens on the server. It's not Visual Studio or msdeploy on your local machine calling the shots on this. As for why you don't just manually copy the changed files over, it's summarised in my blog post you've referenced but in short, it's laborious and error prone. It means you need to consciously work through the thought process of "which of my 2,500 files just changed" rather than simply saying "make my target site match my development version". You haven't mentioned if you're publishing the web.config or not but obviously config transforms is another important reason why the simple CTRL-C then CTRL-V approach is cumbersome. Trying to just take a change directly from SVN is also risky. Your first problem is you need to have complete confidence in the integrity and accuracy of the revision you're updating from if you're to get the appropriate changes published. You're then left with trying to sync these to the target and you're back at the same issues raised in the previous paragraph. The other big problem is versioning object code is always nasty; you'll be in a perpetual state of conflict with anyone else on the project and VCS is simply not intended to function this way. My advice would be to focus on solving the root cause of the problem - Web Deploy is timing out - rather than simply trying to work around the symptoms. Manually publishing changes only or messing around with IIS bindings is only going to create more trouble for you in the long run and a lot more work in the immediate term. See how you go sharing the results of creating a package, copying it to the server then executing it locally and we'll take it from there. Once you have it working as designed, you should be seeing deployments no more than a few minutes and site outage measured in seconds. BTW - You might also like to add what sort of latency you have between your PC and the server and how long it would normally take to transfer a 15MB file over HTTP.
