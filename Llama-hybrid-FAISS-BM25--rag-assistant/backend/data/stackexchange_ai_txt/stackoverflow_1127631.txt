Assuming, but I think what you would need can be found here: $.event.special.drop It uses the jQuery famous $.event.special.drag to create de drop event. You can put your own javascript code under the .bind( "drop", function( event ){ the this element inside this function represent the object with the class "drop" you have defined and the event.dragTarget is the object that is being dragged. More doc at the site linked above. This was what I needed anyway.
