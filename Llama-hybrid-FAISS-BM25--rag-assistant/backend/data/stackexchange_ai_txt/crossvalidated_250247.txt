Obtaining group-level estimate of quantity, for e.g. correlation

say I have multiple estimates of correlation between source A and source B, for multiple subjects. the number of estimates vary between subjects. for example, subject 1 might have 10 estimates of correlation between source A & B, subject 2 might have 50 estimates. I want to combine all these estimates to obtain a group-level estimate of the correlation. Apart from estimating a multi-level model (which is mathematically difficult in this case, since quantity of interest is actually not correlation), I have two options: simply average all available estimates to obtain a group-level estimate of correlation. first average estimates within subject for each subject, to obtain subject-level estimates of correlation. then, average the within-subject averages to obtain a group-level estimate of correlation. which of the above two options would you choose and why?
