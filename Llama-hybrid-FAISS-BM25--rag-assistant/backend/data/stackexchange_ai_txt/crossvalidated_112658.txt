The algorithm used in the "Analyse Key Influencers" tool in excel is a variation on the Naive Bayesian algorithm for classification. The explanation from Microsoft may be found here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn282341.aspx The naive Bayes algorithm has been implemented in several packages, though most notably the e1071 package by David Meyer. It can be found on CRAN and a decent tutorial on implementing the algorithm may be found here: http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Data_Mining_Algorithms_In_R/Classification/Na%C3%AFve_Bayes I would caution you to ensure that your predictor variables are independent and to avoid multicollinearity in your models, as the algorithm ignores dependencies and is thus "naive" or "stupid".
