Bayesian Decision theory

A person randomly chooses a coin with probability 0.5: Tossing coin 1 yields a head with a probability P(X1=H)=.3 (and tail with P(X1=T)=.7). Tossing coin 2 yields a head with a probability P(X2=H)=.6 (and tail with P(X2=T)=.4). You earn 1 dollar if you correctly guessed the coin and 0 dollars otherwise. Design the optimum decision rule and estimate your average earning. Can anybody explain me ,how should i go about solving this problem?
