The assumptions are :we have i.i.d. observations (Xi, Yi), i = 1, . . . , n, for (X, Y ). Note that the the first 'i' means independent thus daily prices would be inapplicable due to their auto-correlative structure unless filtered by an ARIMA model with any necessary deterministic variables such as Pulses, Level Shifts , Seasonal Pulses and/or Local Time trends to render the process "identically distributed". You might want to look at some of my comments in Correlating volume timeseries . Pay close attention to the Yule paper (1926) that is cited as there continues to be a total oversell of the cross-correlation when dealing with non-Gaussian data, ignoring the critical assumptions that you wisely ask for. Your question is dead-on and deserves attention. You might also review a recent Masters Thesis at GSU Interval Estimation for the Correlation Coefficient by Aekyung Jung ajung1@student.gsu.edu at http://digitalarchive.gsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1109&context=math_theses . Hope this helps .
