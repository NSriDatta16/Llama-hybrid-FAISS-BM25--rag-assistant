edit Never mind; I think you're sunk here. As soon as you hand over the content to jQuery, I'm pretty sure that your scripts are stripped out. The stuff trick below would work if "newContent" were actually part of the "native" page, but because it's in that fragment instantiated by jQuery, it's too late. I think this will work, but I admit I haven't tried it with a loaded document like what you've got: $('#loadingElement').html($('#' + loadingElementId, $newContent)[0].innerHTML); The idea is to bypass jQuery when pulling out the contents of the loaded portion.
