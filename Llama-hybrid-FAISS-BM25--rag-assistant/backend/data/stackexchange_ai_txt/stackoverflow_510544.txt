Virtual Memory

Most of the literature on Virtual Memory point out that the as a Application developer,understanding Virtual Memory can help me in harnessing its powerful capabilities. I have been involved in developing applications on Linux for sometime but but didn't care about Virtual Memory intricacies while I code. Am I missing something? If so, please shed some light on how I can leverage the workings of Virtual Memory. Else let me know if am I not making sense with the question!
