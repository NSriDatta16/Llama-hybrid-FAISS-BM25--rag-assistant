Ideally you can make an API call to exclude the XML header if desired. It doesn't appear that KXmlSerializer supports this though (skimming through the code here ). If you had a org.w3c.dom.Document (or actually any other implementation of javax.xml.transform.Source ) you could accomplish what you want this way: TransformerFactory tf = TransformerFactory.newInstance(); Transformer transformer = tf.newTransformer(); transformer.setOutputProperty(OutputKeys.OMIT_XML_DECLARATION, "yes"); StringWriter writer = new StringWriter(); transformer.transform(new DOMSource(doc), new StreamResult(writer)); Otherwise if you have to use KXmlSerializer it looks like you'll have to manipulate the output.
