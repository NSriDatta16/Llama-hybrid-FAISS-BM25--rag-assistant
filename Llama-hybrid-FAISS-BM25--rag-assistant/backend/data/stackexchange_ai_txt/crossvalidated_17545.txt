I would probably use a similar analogy to the one I've learned to give 'laypeople' when introducing the concept of bias and variance: the dartboard analogy. See below: The particular image above is from Encyclopedia of Machine Learning , and the reference within the image is Moore and McCabe's "Introduction to the Practice of Statistics" . EDIT: Here's an exercise that I believe is pretty intuitive: Take a deck of cards (out of the box), and drop the deck from a height of about 1 foot. Ask your child to pick up the cards and return them to you. Then, instead of dropping the deck, toss it as high as you can and let the cards fall to the ground. Ask your child to pick up the cards and return them to you. The relative fun they have during the two trials should give them an intuitive feel for variance :)
