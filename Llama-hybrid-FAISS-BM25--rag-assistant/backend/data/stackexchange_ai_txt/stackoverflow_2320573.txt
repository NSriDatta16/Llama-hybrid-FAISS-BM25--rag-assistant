If you mean defining a grammar, you would be best served by starting with an existing language and modifying its grammar to match what it is that you are after. Creating a grammar specification is a fairly mechanical exercise, using a set of patterns in your own head. For instance, what does an if statement look like? Does it look like C if if or like ML? if or maybe you want to use elseifs like Lua: if if The grammar and semantics codify these decisions. Note that none of these are quite suitable for implementation in a LALR or LL(*) compiler generator yet, and would have to be massaged for implementation because they are ambiguous. Programming Language Pragmatics by Michael Scott is a good introduction to the design of programming languages. It's available on Amazon here
