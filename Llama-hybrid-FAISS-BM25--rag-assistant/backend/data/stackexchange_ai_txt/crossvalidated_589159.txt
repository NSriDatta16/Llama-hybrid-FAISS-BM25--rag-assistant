Show Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) implies a logistic regression model

I am attempting to show that QDA implies a logistic regression model of the form $\log(\frac{P(Y=1 \mid X = x)}{1-P(Y=1 \mid X = x)}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1x + \beta_2x^2$ , where there is only one covariate x Let $P(Y=1 \mid X = x) = p_1(x) = \frac{\cfrac{\pi_1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma_1}}exp(\cfrac{-(x-\mu_1)^2}{2\sigma_1^2})}{\sum_{l=1}^{K} \pi_l \cfrac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma_1}}exp(\cfrac{-(x-\mu_l)^2}{2\sigma_1^2})}$ Then, $\frac{p_1(x)}{1-p_1(x)} = \frac{\cfrac{\pi_1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma_1}}exp(\cfrac{-(x-\mu_1)^2}{2\sigma_1^2})}{ \sum_{l=1}^{K} \pi_l \cfrac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma_1}}exp(\cfrac{-(x-\mu_l)^2}{2\sigma_1^2}) -\cfrac{\pi_1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma_1}}exp(\cfrac{-(x-\mu_1)^2}{2\sigma_1^2})}$ Taking the log of the equation above, I can deduce the numerator to be: $\log(\pi_1)-\log(\sqrt{2\pi\sigma_1}) -\frac{(x-\mu_1)^2}{2\sigma_1^2}$ But, I do not know how to continue further. I am unsure as to how to take the log of the denominator, and make the terms simplify, so that I can yield the aforementioned quadratic form.
