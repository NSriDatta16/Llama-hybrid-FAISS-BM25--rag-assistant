visual-studio-2008 versioninfo for all files updated from one place

The version information, displayed when the mouse cursor hovers over the file in windows explorer, is set for a file built by visual studio in the VERSION resource. I would like to set the version in one place for all the files built by a solution, preferably when I change the version in the install properties. Is there a way to do this? The motivation for this is that if the version is not updated for a file, then the installer will leave previous versions of files instead of replacing them with new files. This happens even when the 'RemovePreviousVersions' property is set. In order to save the tedious and error prone task of updating the version in every file built and installed, I remove the version resource from all files - which is not elegant.
