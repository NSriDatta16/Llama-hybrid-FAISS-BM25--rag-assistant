WPF Localization in XAML, what is the simple, easy and elegant way of doing it?

I have a very common question. What is the best way to do localization in a WPF app. Well, I searched in SO and Binged a lot too. But I could not find any pointers which is really simple and elegant. Assume that I have to display in UI something like: In English: Orgnanization - Beoing In French: Organizzazione - Beoing Basically, I need to assign the localized text to Organization Label TextBlock. Should I separate the hyphen from "Organization -" and put it in a separate label? How do I do that?
