The standard deviation $s_\mathrm{p}$ is the pooled estimate of the common standard deviation for the two populations. Its square is the pooled estimate of variance, which is an appropriately weighted average of the two sample variances. The weights $n_1-1$ and $n_2-1$ are used instead of $n_1$ and $n_2$ to get the right degrees of freedom. Note that $s^2_1$ is defined as the sum of the squares of the observations minus the sample mean divided by $n_1-1$ and similarly divided by $n_2-1$ for $s^2_2$.
