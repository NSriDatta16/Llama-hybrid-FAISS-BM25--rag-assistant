Attempting to manage user data in the manner you state is a sure-fire path to hair pulling and teeth gnashing. There are more dragons than you suspect and have described. Consider: The forms ticket expiration is pushed forward on a sliding scale on each request. In order to correlate a foreign cookie to have the same lifespan you would have to duplicate this logic, which resides in the FormsAuthenticationModule , drastically and unnecessarily complicating your code. If the data is of reasonable size, simply stuff it into the userData field of the forms ticket, now your user variable goes wherever the forms ticket codes and is discarded when the forms ticket (or cookie) is expired. No fuss no muss. See more details here
