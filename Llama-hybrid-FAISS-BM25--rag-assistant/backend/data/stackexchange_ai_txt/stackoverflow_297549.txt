You can do some IP comparaison without having a whole library to do it. Solution #1 Use an API, this way nothing is needed from your side. This is a web API that let you know the country: Example: http://api.hostip.info/get_html.php?ip=12.215.42.19 Return : Country: UNITED STATES (US) Solution #2 But, Have you think to use the browser agent language? You might be able to know the type of english from it. Solution #3 This website called BlockCountry let you have a list of IP by country. Of course, you do not want to block, but you can use the list of IP and compare them (get all US IP...) this might not be accurate...
