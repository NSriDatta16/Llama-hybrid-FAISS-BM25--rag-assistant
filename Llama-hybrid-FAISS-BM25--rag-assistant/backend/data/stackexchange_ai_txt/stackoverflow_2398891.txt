Nitrogen: changing targetID breaks lightbox

I'm using Nitrogen & lightbox. I'm looking for some guidance after spending way too long trying to understand why a working example breaks as soon as I change the targetID of a lightbox. The fragment below works if I use "name_dialog" or "share_dialog" , but not if I use "compose_dialog" . I've looked through the source and style sheets, but have not found where those two are defined any differently than what I'm trying to do. In my .hrl: ... -record (compose_dialog, { ?ELEMENT_BASE(compose_dialog_element) }). .. In my element module: ... reflect() -> record_info(fields, compose_dialog). render_element(_HtmlID, _Record) -> #lightbox { id=compose_lightbox, style="display: none;", body = [ .. show() -> wf:wire(compose_lightbox, #show {}).
