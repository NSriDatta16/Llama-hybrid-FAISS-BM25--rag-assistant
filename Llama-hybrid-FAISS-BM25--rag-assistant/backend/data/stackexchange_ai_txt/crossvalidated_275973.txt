Let me see if I understood your question correctly. You have a sample of n = 20; For each observation in this sample you have computed a percentage reduction as a consequence of some treatment: i.e. \begin{equation}p_i =\frac{x_i,t - x_{i,t-1}}{x_{i,t-1}}\end{equation} where $x_{i,t}$ is the i-th observation in your sample after the treatment and $x_{i,t-1}$ is the i-th observation in your sample before the treatment. These percentage reductions you have taken and averaged: \begin{equation} \hat{p} = \frac{1}{20}\sum_{i=1}^{20} p_i\end{equation} to estimate a parameter $p$ in the population: the percentage reduction in the population on average as a result of the treatment. And what you're interested in is computing a confidence interval for this RATIO (I did not realize that this was a ratio of two random variables that was being estimated when I wrote this). If this is correct, then what I suggest you use is a paired sample t-test: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-test#Dependent_t-test_for_paired_samples The value of $\hat{p}$ is a random variable as it will differ from sample to sample. If the sample is large enough (usually n > 30), then the distribution of $\hat{p}$ over many simple random samples will be normally distributed according to the Central Limit Theorem. This sample is somewhat small, and you probably don't have a very reliable estimate of the population variance therefore (it's unknown), so for that reason you use the T-distribution which is approximately normal for large samples. The reason for using the paired T-test is that your observations are not independent. The percentage reduction is computed, if I understood you correctly, by comparing the i-th observation before and after a treatment. If there are two groups, however, that you're comparing, then an ordinary T-test will do. Hope that this helps! Edit: what I (stupidly!) forgot here is to mention that you have a ratio estimator. This poses some problems for using a T-test. $\hat{p}$ is the quotient of two random variables. In addition, your estimate will be biased. See here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio_estimator . It's explained there how you can adjust for this.
