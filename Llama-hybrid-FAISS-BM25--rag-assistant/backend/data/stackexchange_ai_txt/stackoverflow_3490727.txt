What are some methods to analyze image brightness using Python?

I'd like some advice on performing a simple image analysis in python. I need to calculate a value for the "brightness" of an image. I know PIL is the goto library for doing something like this. There is a built-in histogram function. What I need is a "perceived brightness" values I can decide if further adjustments to the image are necessary. So what are something of the basic techniques that will work in this situation? Should I just work with the RGB values, or will histogram give me something close enough? One possible solution might be to combine the two, and generate average R,G,and B values using the histogram, then apply the "perceived brightness" formula.
