There is something called Sandpaper that can help you to transform your elements, even in IE! .myDiv { -sand-transform: rotate(45deg); } You can just plug it into your site and you're set. Also you can use CSS3 transforms, which you asked about in your question: "Using nothing but CSS." To do this you'd use: .myDiv { -webkit-transform: rotate(45deg); -moz-transform: rotate(45deg); filter: progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.BasicImage(rotation=5); /*for IE*/ } And thanks to Josh and Robert for the Opera equivalent: -o-transform: rotate(45deg); Internet Explorer will drop ClearType on any text that has a filter applied to it. But you can add empty extra element inside the main one and apply filter to this extra element. After this ClearType will be not ruined and the same result can be achieved.
