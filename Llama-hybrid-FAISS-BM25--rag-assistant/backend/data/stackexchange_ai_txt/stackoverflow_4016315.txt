An array of nested forms, but I do not want the previous completed objects to show

I have an Object where the object has a nested form of which can be duplicated as needed. To accomplish this I am using : - 2.times { @organization.referrals.build } - form_for @organization do |f| = f.error_messages - f.fields_for :referrals do |qf| = render :partial => 'referral_fields', :locals => {:qf => qf} Now I have two blank referrals for them to fill out. But I do not want the user to see the older created referrals . How do I keep the nested model form, but dissalow the end user from seeing the previously created objects?
