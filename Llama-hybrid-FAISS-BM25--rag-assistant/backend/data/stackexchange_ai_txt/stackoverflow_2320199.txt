A good strategy would be to set statically the maximum number of clients that can be managed by your server. Then you build all Client objects required to manage all the clients from start (in an array or vector). You will then re-use Client objects when there is a new connection, end using one when the client disconnects. That require that your Client object is made in a way that allow reuse : the initialization and "termination" of it's use have to be explicit functions (init() and end() for example, something similar). When you can, allow from start all resources you will ever need and reuse the objects. That way you limit memory fragmentation and get faster to the "worst case".
