"Profiler" is what you're looking for; which you choose is up to you. I've used HP's Diagnostic Server to do this, although it'd cost money. It'll tell me what methods are called how many times, and the average and worst-case time spent in them. As an important safety tip, running a profiler will slow down the execution of your code; it's not ideal for a long-term installation into a production environment.
