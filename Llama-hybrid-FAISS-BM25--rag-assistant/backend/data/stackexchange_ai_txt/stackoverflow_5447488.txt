Why not have a table of base urls (ie www.google.com/) and a table of connections, with these example columns: starting page id (from url table) ending page id (from url table) the trailing directory of the urls as strings in two more columns This will allow you to join on certain urls and pick out information you want. Your solution seems like it would be better suited to a non relational datastore, such as a column store. Most search engine indices aren't stored in relational databases, but stored in memory as to minimize retrieval time.
