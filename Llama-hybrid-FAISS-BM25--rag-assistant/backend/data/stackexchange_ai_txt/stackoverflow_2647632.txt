How to allow sorting in the Django admin by a custom list_display field, which doesn't have a DB field nor annotatable

I have a custom list_display field which is responsible for a column of integers in one of my admin pages. I need to allow staff members to sort according to it. There's a solution for how to acheive that if the integer represents a count/average/etc of some DB field, which is not the case for me. [ the solution for that case is here: Django admin: how to sort by one of the custom list_display fields that has no database field ] Any ideas how I can achieve this sorting without actually creating and maintaining a DB field for the values?
