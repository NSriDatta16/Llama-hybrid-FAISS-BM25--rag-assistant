GWT Voices is written by Fred Sauer. He seems to be very closely affiliated with GWT. I've used his drag and drop code before, and found it quite well documented and frequently updated. Also, he seems responsive to questions in the forum. (I have no affiliation!) I don't know anything about the others.
