Here's a really nice complete sample for WPF that does both drag scrolling and automatic flick/inertia scrolling. I'm not sure what if anything would need to be changed to make it work in Silverlight. http://sachabarbs.wordpress.com/2009/12/24/friction-scrolling-now-an-wpf-attached-behaviour-too/ Just a note that as-is you can't click and drag the view if you click on a child (e.g. buttons) that capture the mouse input. I actually ended up modifying this sample so you could still drag scroll when you click on children, while still allowing children to accept mouse input when not drag scrolling.
