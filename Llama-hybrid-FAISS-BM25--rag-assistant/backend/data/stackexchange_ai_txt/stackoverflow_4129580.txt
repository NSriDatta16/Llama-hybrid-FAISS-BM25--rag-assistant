Showing different pages to different users

I need to design a system in a website to display different pages to different users based on multiple rules: If the user's visit is organic, direct hit to the homepage, show /url1 If the user's visit is not organic like he was referred from a blog, show /url2 If the user wants to shop, but isnt logged in, show /url3 How do I achieve this?!
