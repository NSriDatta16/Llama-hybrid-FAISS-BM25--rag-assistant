The Gibbs sampler accuracy is provided in the simulation-base bayesian inference background. Before looking at the sampling accuracy, in such context, you need for: deciding whether the Markov chain coming out the sampling process fulfills the stationarity condition; identifying the number of iterations to take into account after the first criteria above is satisfied; The convergence statistical diagnostics help you to do that. Shown below the main convergence criteria described in the literature: Gelman-Rubin test; Geweke diagnostics; Heidelberger-Welch stationarity test; Heidelberger-Welch half-width test; Generally speaking, although all of these statistics aim to test for convergence, the third test reports whether the chain sample size is adequate enough to meet the required accuracy; the failure of the test suggests that you need for longer Markov Chain to achieve the convergence and an accurate estimate. You can get a longer Markov Chain by moving the number of iterations (this is the reason why you found those resources suggesting you to increase the number of iterations) or the burn-in records. Once the convergence is achieved, you have an accurate sampling, parameter estimates or whatever. Woefully, it is not possible to know exactly how much your sampling is accurate; you can simply know only if the Markov chain coming out the sampling process converges or not. I suggest you to read the following reference: KOLASSA, John E., et al. Convergence and accuracy of Gibbs sampling for conditional distributions in generalized linear models. The Annals of Statistics, 1999, 27.1: 129-142. Hope this helps.
