Remove float: left from your labels, add float: left to your div.menu, and remove the width: 271px from your div.menu. The reason it breaks now when you remove the width from div.menu is because the labels are floated left and not clearing the input above them. Edit: Another option if you want to leave the labels floated left would be to add a clearing rule to the paragraphs within the menu: div.menu p { clear: both; }
