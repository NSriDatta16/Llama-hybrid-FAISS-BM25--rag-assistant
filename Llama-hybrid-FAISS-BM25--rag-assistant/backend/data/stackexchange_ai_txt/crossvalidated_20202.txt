If you have two factors, then you now have two continuous variables from the scoring on the factors, don't you? I'm not quite following how you have categorical variables out of the factor analysis. If you really want to use multinomial logistic regression, you could make 4 classes using a median split on each factor: hi/hi, hi/lo, lo/hi, lo/lo. Another approach would be to use each factor as a dependent variable in its own (not logistic) regression.
