There are many ways to scale an image. The easiest way is to decode the image and then scale using a naive scaling algorithm, something like: dest_pixel [x,y] = src_pixel [x * x_scale_factor, y * y_scale_factor] where x/y_scale_factor is src_size / dest_size Once you have that working, you can look into more complex scaling systems, things like bilinear filter. For example, the destination pixel is the average of several source pixels when reducing the size and an interpolation of several source pixels when increasing the size.
