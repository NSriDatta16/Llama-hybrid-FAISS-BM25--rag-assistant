There is no standard way to define goodness-of-fit. It depends on your application and what the problem you are going to solve. As in classification, you may define the goodness-of-fit as 0-1 loss. For a logistic regression, you can compute the likelihood function. I would use a McFadden pseudo-$R^2$, which is defined as: $$ R^2 = 1 - \frac{\operatorname{L}(\theta)}{\operatorname{L}(\mathbf{0})} $$ $\operatorname{L}$ is the log-likelihood function, $\theta$ is the parameter of the model and $\mathbf{0}$ denote a zero vector (i.e. you compare the likelihood ratio of your model against a model with all coefficients 0) Moreover, given a probability measure $\mu(x) = P(Y = 1|X=x)$, define the loss function of a classifier $g$ as $L(g) = P(g(X) \neq Y)$. The Bayes decision rule: $$ g^*(x) = \begin{cases} 1 & \mbox{if } \mu(x) \geq 0.5 \\ 0 & \mbox{if } \mu(x) is the rule that minimize $L(g)$. That is nothing wrong to classify as 1 when your logistic regression output probability $\geq 0.5$ as long as you are thinking the loss function as above.
