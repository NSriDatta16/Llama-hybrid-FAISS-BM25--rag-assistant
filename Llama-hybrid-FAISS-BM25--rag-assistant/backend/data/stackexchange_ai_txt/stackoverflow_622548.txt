Thanks for the answers. The example I am currently working on is a todo list, where the user can drag items to a new position. I'm using jQuery to send post data to the view, which saves the new order in the database. For this example, I don't want to show a response to the user after they have resorted the list because it would get annoying and it's not really necessary. I will be catching any errors if they occur and showing the user an appropriate response if that happens. So using return HttpResponse(status=201) is a good idea in this scenario?
