You could have a sprite that is the "area". That meaning that it's the size of the area you want to check. So just loop through every movieclip and check with hitTestObject or hitTestPoint if the movieclip collides with the sprite. If so then it's in that area. This is how I create the drag and select units thing in RTS games.
