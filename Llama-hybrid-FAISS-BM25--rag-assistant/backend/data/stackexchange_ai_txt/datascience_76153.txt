In Physics, the uncertainty of a value can be calculated or estimated from some well established rules. For various reasons, these rules are not as well established in Machine Learning/AI. The actual uncertainty value in a machine learning model can suffer from several issues, which are difficult to detect or track down. Here are just a few: New values (values outside the distribution) in the Test dataset that were not seen in Training: How can you know what you haven't seen before Data collection errors Not matching the model to the data. Non-random datasets, skew, etc. Feature engineering Model selection Usually having a highly accurate uncertainty is not necessary, as any change or inaccuracy will usually have little effect in the actual predictions.
