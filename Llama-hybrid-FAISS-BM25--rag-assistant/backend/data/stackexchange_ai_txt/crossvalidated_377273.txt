Loosely speaking, cross-correlation is a generalization of the Pearson's correlation. Specifically, when comparing two time series, cross-correlation seeks to obtain a relationship between lags of each series. For example, assume two time series, $x_t$ and $y_t$ , each with $T$ observations. Also, let $\bar{x}$ and $\bar{y}$ represent the sample means and let $\sigma_x^2$ and $\sigma_y^2$ represent the sample variance. The sample cross-correlation is obtained as follows: $$\frac{\sum_t^T(x_t-\bar{x})\sum_s^T(y_s-\bar{y})}{\sigma_x\sigma_y}$$ Notice the subscripts, with the cross-variance I will compare $x_t$ to lags of $y_{t-s}$ and vice versa. As a result, with only two series the cross-correlation generates a $T\text{x}T$ matrix (i.e. the above sample cross variance will be entry ( $t$ , $s$ ) within the matrix). Pearson's correlation is actually contained within this cross-correlation matrix, i.e. $$\frac{\sum_{t=1}^T(x_t-\bar{x})\sum_{t=1}^T(y_{t}-\bar{y})}{\sigma_x\sigma_y}$$ Which will be the first entry of the diagonal.
