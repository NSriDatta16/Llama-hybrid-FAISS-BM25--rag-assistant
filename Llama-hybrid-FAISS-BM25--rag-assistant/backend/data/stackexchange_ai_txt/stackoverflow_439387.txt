Do you really need the extra table? You can get that data you need with a simple query, which you can obviously create as a view if you want it to appear like a table. This will get you the data you are looking for: select account, bookdate, amount, sum(amount) over (partition by account order by bookdate) running_total from t / This will create a view to show you the data as if it were a table: create or replace view t2 as select account, bookdate, amount, sum(amount) over (partition by account order by bookdate) running_total from t / If you really need the table, do you mean that you need it constantly updated? or just a one off? Obviously if it's a one off you can just "create table as select" using the above query. Test data I used is: create table t(account number, bookdate date, amount number); insert into t(account, bookdate, amount) values (1, to_date('20080101', 'yyyymmdd'), 100); insert into t(account, bookdate, amount) values (1, to_date('20080102', 'yyyymmdd'), 101); insert into t(account, bookdate, amount) values (1, to_date('20080103', 'yyyymmdd'), -200); insert into t(account, bookdate, amount) values (2, to_date('20080102', 'yyyymmdd'), 200); commit; edit: forgot to add; you specified that you wanted the table to be ordered - this doesn't really make sense, and makes me think that you really mean that you wanted the query/view - ordering is a result of the query you execute, not something that's inherant in the table (ignoring Index Organised Tables and the like).
