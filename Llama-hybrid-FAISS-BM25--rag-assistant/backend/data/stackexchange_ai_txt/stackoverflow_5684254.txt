I actually just found a much more elegant solution. Simply add the following line before your findActive() call, and it will return an invisible page, if selected: $this->navigation()->setRenderInvisible(true); For example, the following code: Zend_Debug::dump($this->navigation() ->findActive($this->navigation()->getContainer())); $this->navigation()->setRenderInvisible(true); Zend_Debug::dump($this->navigation() ->findActive($this->navigation()->getContainer())); Produces: array(0) { } array(2) { ["page"] => object(Zend_Navigation_Page_Mvc)#33 (24) { ... PAGE INFORMATION ... } ["depth"] => int(0) } The curious part is that it doesn't affect the rendering of the menu - i.e. hidden pages are still hidden. That doesn't make much sense though, so I'd recommend setting it to false again to make sure it doesn't cause problems in the future.
