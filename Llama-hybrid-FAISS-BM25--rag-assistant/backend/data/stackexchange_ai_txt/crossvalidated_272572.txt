Fit the mean and the harmonics of the seasonal cycle to the time series of x and y. These provide the intercept terms. Then, subtract them from x and y to create anomalies. Use these anomalies x' and y' to compute seasonally varying regression slope coefficients: Fit the array product between the x' and y' with the mean and leading harmonics to the seasonal cycle. Do the same for the variance of the x'. Then divide the seasonal cycle fit to the covariance by the seasonal cycle fit to the variance to provide continuously evolving slope coefficients.
