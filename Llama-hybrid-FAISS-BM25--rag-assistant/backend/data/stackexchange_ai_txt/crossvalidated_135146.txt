It is very common for extremely simple forecasting methods like "forecast the historical average" to outperform more complex methods. This is even more likely for short time series. Yes, in principle you can fit an ARIMA or even more complex model to 20 or fewer observations, but you will be rather likely to overfit and get very bad forecasts. So: start with a simple benchmark, e.g., the historical mean the historical median for added robustness the random walk (forecast the last observation out) Assess these on out-of-sample data. Compare any more complex model to these benchmarks. You may be surprised at seeing how hard it is to outperform these simple methods. In addition, compare the robustness of different methods to these simple ones, e.g., by not only assessing average accuracy out-of-sample, but also the error variance , using your favorite error measure . Yes, as Rob Hyndman writes in his post that Aleksandr links to , out-of-sample testing is a problem in itself for short series - but there really is no good alternative. ( Don't use in-sample fit, which is no guide to forecasting accuracy .) The AIC won't help you with the median and the random walk. However, you could use time-series cross-validation , which AIC approximates, anyway.
