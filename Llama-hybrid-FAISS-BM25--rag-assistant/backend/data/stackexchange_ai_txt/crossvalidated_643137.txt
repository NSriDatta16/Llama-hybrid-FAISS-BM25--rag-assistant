You certainly can't use both daily change and total. Those are not only not independent, one is the sum of the other. You could model either cumulative or daily reputation as a function of time. To do that, I'd create a variable "day" which would start at 1 and increase. You might want to add other variables too such as "day of week" (maybe divided into weekday and weekend/holiday). But maybe you are interested in the time of day as well (I'm not sure what "creation date" captures exactly --- is it date and hour and minute?). In any case, I would convert that variable into ones that are of interest to you and more readable. But, if you've been on the particular site for a while, then I think some sort of time series analysis might be good. And, depending on what you are interested in, a simple graph (similar to the ones that the site produces) might be what you need.
