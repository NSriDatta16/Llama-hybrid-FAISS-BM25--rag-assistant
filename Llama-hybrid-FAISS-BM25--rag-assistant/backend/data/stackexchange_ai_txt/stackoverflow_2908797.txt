I had a similar problem, and did not find a desirable answer. From what I know, C++ doesn't have elegant support for variable amounts of template arguments, so you have to get around it by "wrapping" extra arguments in another class; policy_base > You can pretty this up a little bit by putting making typedefs for twoArgs , but not by a lot in this basic case. (Remember, you can "do" templated typedefs by using member typedefs in templated classes.) or by having many different declarations of the core template, with different args; template struct base {...} template struct base {...} //etc
