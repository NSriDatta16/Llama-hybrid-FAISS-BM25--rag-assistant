Interesting question - I have a parser that can be compiled with Bison, Byacc, MKS Yacc or Unix Yacc, and I don't do anything special to deal with resetting the grammar whether it fails or succeeds. I don't use a Flex or Lex tokenizer; that is hand-coded, but it works strictly off strings. So, I have to agree with Gamecat; the most likely cause of the trouble is the lexical analyzer, rather than the parser proper. (If you want to obtain my code, you can download SQLCMD from the IIUG (International Informix User Group) web site. Although the full product requires Informix ESQL/C, the grammar can, in principle, be converted into a standalone test program. Sadly, however, it appears I've not run that test for a while - there are some issues with the test compilation. Some structure element names changed in April 2006, plus there are linkage issues. I will need to re-reorganize the code so that the grammar can be tested standalone again.)
