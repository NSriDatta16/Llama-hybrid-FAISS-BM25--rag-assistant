Do the functions provided by SecurePage , PageWithGridViewSorting and PageWithSessionWarning actually need to be overloaded or overridden by their derived classes? If all you're doing is using inheritance to group functions, you should consider using a different method of organizing functions into classes. Like, for example, the Strategy pattern . A page with sorting is a page, with sorting. It's a page that has sorting. Using inheritance isn't the right way to approach this problem. If they do need to differ in the derived classes, you might want to approach the problem with interfaces instead of inheritance. Since you'll be redefining the functions anyway this shouldn't increase complexity or make you repeat yourself. EDIT: Given the specifics of your problem, it really sounds to me like you should investigate aspect-oriented programming and how you can fit it into your language .
