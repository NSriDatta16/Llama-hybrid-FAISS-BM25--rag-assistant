Determining the shape of the relationship between $y$ and $x$ after passing the Granger causality test

Let's say you have two time series, and you have already established a Granger-causal relationship between them. E.g. when testing if $X$ Granger-causes $Y$ (with a lag of 1), we calculated a $p$-value of 0.01. The results of our test mean that the $\beta X_{t-1}$ term in the equation $$Y_t = \alpha Y_{t-1} + \beta X_{t-1} + \varepsilon$$ provides statistically significant information about $Y_t$, compared to the original equation $$Y_t = \alpha Y_{t-1} + \varepsilon.$$ Here's my question. The equation $Y_t = \alpha Y_{t-1} + \beta X_{t-1} + \varepsilon$ has an $R^2$ value of 0.2. This means that the data does not fit well to this regression line. Is there a better way to determine a function to calculate $Y_t$?
