The short answer is no; images in TextView are just treated as a character (which may be a lot bigger than a usual character). There isn't any layout engine in the HTML sense. (Layout is limited to what PangoLayout can do.) You could probably hack something together, using an approach such as: leave a margin the size of the image on your paragraph add an expose event handler to paint the image to the window (see the "border windows" examples which are I think in gtk-demo or the docs somewhere, but draw to the main window not border windows) Some amount of work, but it would probably get the job done.
