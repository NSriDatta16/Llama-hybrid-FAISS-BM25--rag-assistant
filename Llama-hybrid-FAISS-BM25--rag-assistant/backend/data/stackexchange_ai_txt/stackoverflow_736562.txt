Sun has extensively documented their real-time garbage collector, and provided benchmarks you can run for yourself here . Others mentioned Metronome, which is the other major production-grade RTGC algorithm. Many other vendors of RT JVMs have their own implementations -- see my list of vendors over here and most of them provide extensive documentation. If your interest is particularly in avionics/flight software, I suggest you take a look at aicas , an RTSJ vendor who specifically markets to the avionics industry. Dr. Siebert 's (aicas CEO) home page lists some academic publications that go into great detail about PERC's GC implementation.
