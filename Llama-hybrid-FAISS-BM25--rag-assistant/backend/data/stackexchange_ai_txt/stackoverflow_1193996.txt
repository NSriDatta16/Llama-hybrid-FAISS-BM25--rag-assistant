The names used in enums need to be unambiguous, so you'll have a problem: either the compiler has access to both definitions, then the enums can't be identical because of the name problem or the compiler has access to only one definition a time, then it has nothing to check against. Even the number of elements (as proposed by Robert) can't be checked at compile time (the preprocesser doesn't know anything about the enums). If you really can't have one common header file, the easiest thing to do would be a runtime check at the start of your application.
