Possible to spoof iPad UA in Safari through script?

I apologize if this question comes across as asinine, but is it possible to spoof the UA string of an iPad in Safari via a script of some sort? I know it can be done through the Develop > User Agent menu item, but I am interested in making a Safari extension that forces a page that only serves HTML5 video to iPads to work without manually changing the UA every time. Thank you
