It's hard to think of any sorting operation that could be faster than multiplying the same set of numbers. At the processor level, the multiplication is just load, load, multiply, load, multiply, ... , with maybe some manipulation of the accumulator thrown in. It's linear, easily pipelined, no comparisons with the associated branch mis-prediction costs. It should average about 2 instructions per value to be multiplied. Unless the multiply instruction is painfully slow, it's really hard to imagine a faster sort.
