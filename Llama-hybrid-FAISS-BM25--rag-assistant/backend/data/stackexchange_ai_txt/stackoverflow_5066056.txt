The server uses Cookies for tracking the user's session. The specific cookie we are looking for is PHPSESSIONID which is the tracking cookie. Blockquote As Adarsh R said How ever you can prevent this if you save the sessions into a database table using session_id and serialize the session this is for users that can't change the php.ini EDIT $ip = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']; $browser_string = $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT']; $session_id = session_ID(); $session = serialize($_SESSION); The DB code is an exercise for the reader. $sql = "SELECT * FROM `sessions` WHERE `ip`='".$ip."' AND `browser_string`='".$browser_string ."'"; Hopefully you can work it out from that.
