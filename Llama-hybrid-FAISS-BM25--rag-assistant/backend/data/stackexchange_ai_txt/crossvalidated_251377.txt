For OLS, you can still compute the likelihood function (the exponentiated log likelihood, as Christoph Hanck mentions in the comment). It is just the good old $L_i = \prod_i (2\pi \sigma^2)^{-.5} \exp(-.5 (y_i - x_i\beta)^2)$. Stata stores this as e(ll) after running a regression using regress Then you construct weights as $w_i = \frac{L_i}{\sum_j L_j}$. Finally, you construct weighted averages of your regression coefficients using $w_i$ as weights.
