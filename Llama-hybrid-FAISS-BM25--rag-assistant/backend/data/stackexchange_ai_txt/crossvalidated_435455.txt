Non-stationary data ( simple linear regression )

i am trying to find the correlation between GDP and solid waste generation and recycling in all Chinese provinces, i have collected the data from 1999-2017 and i am using average data of all provinces at one year, for instance, average all provinces in 1999 till 2017. and i am using a linear regression model to do the correlation, my question is shall my data be stationary or its ok with non-stationary data, however when i converted the data into stationary using log and first difference, new data values have negative values, and the correlation does not exist like the case of using non-stationary data.
