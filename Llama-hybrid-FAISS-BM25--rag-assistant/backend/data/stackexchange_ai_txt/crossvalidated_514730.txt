Mathematical foundations to justify the "existence" and appropriateness of using prior distributions?

I claim that there is no a priori reason I should use a probability distribution to express uncertainty about models, claims or parameters. Apparently, (some) Bayesians disagree with that, as they require us to use prior distributions. What are the mathematical justifications for using probability to express all types of uncertainties? Can you explain this in very simple terms? The whole Bayesian philosophy seems like a pretty fragile castle, without a very strong justification for this.
