strpos returns false when the string is not found, so check for false instead of making an implicit condition. if(strpos($string, ':ERROR:') !== false) { // Do something... } As Anurag said in the comments, with functions like these it's always best to do a strict comparison ( === instead of just leaving out the operator or using == ) because that's a common source of bugs, especially in PHP, where many functions can return values of different types.
