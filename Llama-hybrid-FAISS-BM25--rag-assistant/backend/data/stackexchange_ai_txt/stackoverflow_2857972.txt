Rather than proxying, why not simply redirect? Use the django view at www.myproject.com/downloads/1 to serve a HTTP Redirect to the S3 storage URL - it's possible to generate time-limited authenticated URLs e.g. see here https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ShareObjectPreSignedURL.html Then the client downloads the file directly from S3, but the contents is still secure and access has to come through your Django application
