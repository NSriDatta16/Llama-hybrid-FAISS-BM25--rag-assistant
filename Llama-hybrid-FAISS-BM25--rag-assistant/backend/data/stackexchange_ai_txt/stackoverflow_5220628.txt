Making items draggable

How are objects made draggable on iphone? How is an item/object moved by the user. e.g. apps can be moved on the homescreen and they icons follow the users finger. How can e.g. a tableview cell contents be moved if the user holds down on it and then moves their finger? What controls the movement of these objects to follow a users finger?
