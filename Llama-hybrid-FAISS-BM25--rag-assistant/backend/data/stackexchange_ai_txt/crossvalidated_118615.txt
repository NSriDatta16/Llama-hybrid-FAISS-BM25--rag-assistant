Resources to write a statistical analysis plan

Following ICH-E9 guideline on statistical principles for clinical trials, A statistical analysis plan is a document that contains a more technical and detailed elaboration of the principal features of the analysis described in the protocol, and includes detailed procedures for executing the statistical analysis of the primary and secondary variables and other data. A SAP is also used beyond clinical trials in other fields of biostatistics. There are no strict regulatory authorities insisting on proper SAPs, yet the appropriate procedures can be even less obvious than in clinical trials, thus clarification in a SAP is even more necessary. How deep should one go into detail there? I'm taught a certain way to think by first understanding how the (mostly qualitative) question of the scientist is expressed by (quantitative) mathematical formulas (in German: "Operationalisierung der Fragestellung"), then to identify with him anything possibly confounding, then to fill in more and more assumptions (beginning with the most plausible ones) until the question is statistically tractable (and weaknesses of the chosen procedure are best visible). Are there publicly available resources and good examples of statistical analysis plans (SAP) for various fields of science? What am I allowed to omit in a SAP although I thought about it for designing the analysis?
