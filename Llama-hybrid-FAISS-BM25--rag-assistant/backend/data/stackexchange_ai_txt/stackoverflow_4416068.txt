HTTP 500 Internal Error - IIS websites

I have installed SP 2010 in a Windows Server 2008 R2 loaded environment. I have been using VS 2010 for developing application pages for SP 2010. I make use of wsp builder to package all my dlls, pages, scripts and images into a solution package and deploy it in the web applications. Everything was working like a charm. I started enduring a torrid time when all of a sudden my web applications started popping up with 'HTTP 500 Internal Server Error' . This started happening after I made some drastic changes in my application pages and deployed it. I tried creating new web applications but its not doing me any good. Any insights on what could be the source of this issue? Regards, Raghuraman.V
