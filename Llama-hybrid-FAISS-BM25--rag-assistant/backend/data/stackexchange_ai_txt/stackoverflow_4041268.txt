If you don't declare div b as droppable, you're actually not dropping div a inside div b. You are only changing the location of div a by moving it around. Try this, declare div b as droppable. $("#b").droppable(); $("#a").draggable(); $( "#b" ).droppable({ drop: function( event, ui ) { alert($(this).attr("id")); } });
