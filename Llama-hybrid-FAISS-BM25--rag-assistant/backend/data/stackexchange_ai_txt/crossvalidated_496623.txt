Law of Large Numbers

Suppose X is uniform discrete distribution from a set of (1,2,3,...,m). How do i investigate the law of large numbers for this? I thought of doing this by maybe setting m as 10 and having sample of distributions from 1 to 10 using R. By running the program multiple times I would have multiple distributions for X being (1:10). Suppose I run the program for 20 times, i would have 20 sample distributions from (1 to 10). I can calculate the mean of each distribution. Then i would gather up the means and find the average of the means. For example, for the first 5 distributions, i would have 5 means and i sum those up divide it by 5. I do the same for 10, 15 and 20. As I increase the number of times i do it i would approach the population mean of (1+10)/2 = 5.5 Is my approach correct or is there a better way to do this?
