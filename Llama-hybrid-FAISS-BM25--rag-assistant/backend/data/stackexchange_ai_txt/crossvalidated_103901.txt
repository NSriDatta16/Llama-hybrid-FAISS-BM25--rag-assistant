Time Series on Oil Filter Pressure

I am not really strong with time series but I have a project I am working on.. I have a problem where I am trying to model a time series of the difference in pressure before and after oil has passed through an oil filter. I am trying to see if this oil filter can go longer without being changed. I also have data on the temperature of this oil. The temperature of the oil is a strong indicator of Difference in Pressure, 'PD'. I was thinking that I would like to remove the effect of the Temperature by modeling the residuals from a model with Temperature as a predictor and PD as the response. Would this work? Or is there a better approach?
