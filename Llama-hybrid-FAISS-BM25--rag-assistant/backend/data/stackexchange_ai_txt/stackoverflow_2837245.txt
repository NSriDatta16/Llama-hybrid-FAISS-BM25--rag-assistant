First, I recommend you download an evaluation copy of Expression Blend instead of trying to do your development in Visual Studio. Blend is a far, far better tool for creating WPF UIs and it integrates beautifully with Visual Studio. For example, in Blend, it is as simple as dragging an image onto the window. When you do so, Blend creates this XAML: That said, I have no idea why you're seeing examples that require 10 lines of code to do this! It seems ridiculous to me when one line of very simple XAML will suffice.
