The chisquare statistic you discuss is usually used to test the goodness of fit for contingency table data. This is based on the assumption that the distribution of cell counts is multinomial, and the $(O_i - E_i)^2/E_i$ for each cell has an expected $\chi^2_1$ distribution (which is then added up). The problem is that this distribution is not expected with a general continuous distribution of $E$ and $O$. If you are interested in a global goodness of fit test, try binning your predicted values according to their deciles and calculating the same test. This is the Hosmer Lemeshow test of calibration. This is described in their book "Logistic Regression".
