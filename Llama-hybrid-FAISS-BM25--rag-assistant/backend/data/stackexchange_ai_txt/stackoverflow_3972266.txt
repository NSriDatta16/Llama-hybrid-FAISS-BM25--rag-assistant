Any C++ header files with inline code will get coverage instrumentation when you compile and the results will be visible with gcov. One useful flag is gcov -long-file-names (or just -l) which creates a unique .gcov output file for each header included by a given file. The files have names like foo.cpp##bar.h.gcov . This would make them easy for you to delete afterward with rm \*\\#\\#\*.gcov (careful with those backslashes!) Another way you can detect these files is to look for the lines numbered 0 in the gcov output. These have tagged information including 'Source:' with the full path to the original source file.
