Why don't you source control your references directly?

I'm in the process of establishing some new source control best practices for my organization, so I've been immersing myself in things like TreeSurgeon for the past few days. One thing I see a lot is that it's a best practice to include your references in your source control tree, but in a seperate directory (lib/ in tree surgeon) rather than directly with your code as they naturally appear in ASP.NET projects. I know a few reasons why it's bad to source control them directly in the bin folder, but I want to understand the big picture including how you get those references back into, say, an ASP.NET project after you pull down code from source control on a fresh machine. Thanks in advance! Brian
