Finding exact node C#

I was trying to implement drag and drop in treeview . I generate the root nodes first then if I drag any item over the treeview I want to put it under exact root nodes . I need something like private void treeView1_DragOver(object sender, DragEventArgs e) { TreeNode tNode = FindNodeAtPoint(e.X, e.Y); } so that from tNode I can find it's root node and can populate it under that parent node. can anybody help me out with findNodeAtPoint() functionality. private TreeNode FindNodeAtPoint(int x, int y) { Point p = new Point(x, y); p = PointToClient(p); ................ ................ ................ }
