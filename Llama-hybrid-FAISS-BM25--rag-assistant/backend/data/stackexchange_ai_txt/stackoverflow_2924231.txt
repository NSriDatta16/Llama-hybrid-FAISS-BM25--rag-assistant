Python/Sqlite program, write as browser app or desktop app?

I am in the planning stages of rewriting an Access db I wrote several years ago in a full fledged program. I have very slight experience coding, but not enough to call myself a programmer by far. I'll definitely be learning as I go, so I'd like to keep everything as simple as possible. I've decided on Python and SQLite for my program, but I need help on my next decision. Here is my situation 1) It'll be run locally on each machine, all Windows computers 2) I would really like a nice looking GUI with colors, nice screens, menus, lists, etc, 3) I'm thinking about using a browser interface because (a) from what I've read, browser apps can look really great, and (b) I understand there are lots of free tools to assist in setting up the GUI/GUI code with drag and drop tools, so that helps my "keep it simple" goal. 4) I want the program to be totally portable so it runs completely from one single folder on a user's PC, with no installation(s) needed for it to run (If I did it as a browser app, isn't there the possibility that a user's browser settings could affect or break the app. How likely is this?) For my situation, should/could I make it a browser app? What would be the pros and cons for my situation?
