This answer will depend on the type of application. And the specific situation. For a count variable, I would typically update it on the fly, because the cost to calculate may be prohibitive, and the cost to store is very low. In other circumstances, the cost to caluculate may be very low, but the cost of storage could be high (maybe in terms of the number of places code would need to be maintained to keep it accurate)
