ipad user agent changes during use?

In the logs of our website, we are occasionally seeing the user agent of an iPad 'switch' from one set of requests to the next. On one set of requests that occur simultaneously, the user agent will look like this (which is the style of user agent we see most of the time for iPads): mozilla/5.0+(ipad;+u;+cpu+os+4_2_1+like+mac+os+x;+en-us)+applewebkit/533.17.9+(khtml,+like+gecko)+version/5.0.2+mobile/8c148+safari/6533.18.5 The user then clicks a link or a button; the next series of requests will have a user agent setting like: mozilla/5.0+(ipad;+u;+cpu+os+4_2_1+like+mac+os+x;+en-us)+applewebkit/533.17.9+(khtml,+like+gecko)+mobile/8c148 Notice how safari & the version fields are missing from the second. We are trying to understand what action or functionality on the iPad would cause this switch to take place, so we can replicate it in our test environment.
