One-step ahead predicitons in a Bayesian state-space model

How can I make one-step ahead predictions in a Bayesian state-space model? Specifically, for the model \begin{align} y_t \sim& N(x_t, py) \\ x_t \sim& N(rx_{t-1}, px) \end{align} where $y_t$ are the observations, and $x_t$ the states, I want to predict $\Pr(x_{t+1} \mid y_{1:t})$ or $\Pr(y_{t+1} \mid x_{1:t}, y_{1:t})$ . I have written some JAGS code below for a Gaussian state-space model but I do not know how to extend it to make predictions. I have tried to predict $x_{t+1}$ in the code below with xpred but it just seems to nudge the time-series along so I do not think it is implemented correctly. I do not know how to predict $\Pr(y_{t+1})$ . I'd really welcome any help please (not necessarily complete code but some implementation hints to get me moving). Thank you. library(rjags) load.module("glm") set.seed(1) y A plot of the time-series observations $y_t$ , the states $x_t$ , and predictions $x_{t+1}$ .
