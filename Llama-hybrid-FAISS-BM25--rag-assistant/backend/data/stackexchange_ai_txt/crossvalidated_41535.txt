Formal way of defining a weighted average

I am looking for a nice and formal way to define moving averages : $y = \sum_{i=0}^N w_ix_i= $ and especially the fact that weights have to equal one, i.e. $\sum_{i=0}^N w_i=1$. This property seems quite obvious to me, as you somehow want the output to have the same "level" as the input values. However, I don't know how to describe it a more mathematical way .. Can somebody help me out ? Thank you
