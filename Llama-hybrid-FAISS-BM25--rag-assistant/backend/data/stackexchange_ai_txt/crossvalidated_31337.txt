In addition to the answer mentioned by @gung referring you to the t-test, it sounds like you might be interested in Bayesian rating systems . Websites can use such systems to rank order items that vary in the number of votes received. Essentially, such systems work by assigning a rating that is a composite of the mean rating of all items plus the mean of the sample of ratings for the specific object. As the number of ratings increases, the weight assigned to the mean for the object increases and the weight assigned to mean rating of all items decreases. Perhaps check out bayesian averages . Of course things can get a lot more complex as you deal with a wide range of issues such as voting fraud, changes over time, etc.
