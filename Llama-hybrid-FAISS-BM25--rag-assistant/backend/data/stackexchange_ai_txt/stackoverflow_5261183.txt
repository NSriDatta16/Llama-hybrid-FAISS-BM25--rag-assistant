You can use placement new to construct an object at a particular memory location: vector a(n); for(int i = 0; i ~A(); But you cannot solve the 'real' problem without giving up the continuous storage: if one object is freed, it will cause a hole in the heap, thus causing high fragmentation over time. You could only keep track of the freed objects and re-use the storage.
