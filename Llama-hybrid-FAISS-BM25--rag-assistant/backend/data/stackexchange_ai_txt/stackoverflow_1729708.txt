I am sorry in advance if I took this question too far or in a wrong direction. RageZ is right that GWT applications are all client-side. Server-side integration is supported in GWT using GWT-RPC, etc. and you will have to provide at least minimum server support outside of GWT to run it. Are you trying to implement functionality that commonly runs on a server using client-side GWT only? If the answer is no then you have no server-side functionality (persistence, services, tasks, etc.) and your GWT should and will be pure client side application. If the answer is yes then you have a sophisticated exercise that may or may not be possible with a sub-set of Java GWT supports. But architecturally it is very questionable approach since server-side functions are centralized for a reason: shared resources such as persistence, collaboration, scalability, availability, maintenance, other QoS, etc.
