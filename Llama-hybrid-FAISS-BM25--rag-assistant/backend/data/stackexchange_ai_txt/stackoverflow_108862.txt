You need to be able to identify bottlenecks and test improvements. To identify bottlenecks, you need to use your system's reporting tools. Some examples: MySQL has a slow query log. Linux provides stats like load average, iostat, vmstat, netstat, etc. Apache has the access log and the server-status page. Programming languages have profilers, like Pear Benchmark . Use these tools to identifyy the slowest/biggest offenders and concentrate on them. Try an improvement and measure to see if it actually improves performance. This becomes a never ending loop for two reasons: there's always something in a complex system that can be faster and as your system grows, different functions will start slowing down. Based on the description of your system, my first hunch would be disk io and network io on the NFS servers, then I'd look at MySQL query times. I'd also check the performance of the shared sessions.
