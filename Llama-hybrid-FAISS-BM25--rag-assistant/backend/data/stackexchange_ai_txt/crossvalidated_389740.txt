Batch size stateful LSTM in Keras - how to evaluate with just one sample?

I'm using Keras to classify time series of 1000 timesteps containing one feature. In keras the input shape of an LSTM is defined as (batch_size, timesteps, features). So my input is f.e. (32,1000,1), with a batch size of 32. To construct the training X I take 32 time series of different classes and put them together in one batch. After training I want to ask the LSTM to classify ONE time series. But because Iâ€™ve specified a batch size of 25 I now always need to show it 32 time series?! In my understanding I showed the LSTM multiple samples at once during training, but shouldn't I be able to now let it classify only one sample?
