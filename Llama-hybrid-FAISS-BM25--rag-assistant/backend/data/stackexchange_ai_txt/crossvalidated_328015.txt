As already commented by @g3o2, you can get what you want by running separate PCAs on your distinct groups of variables, and use the first PC from each. Make sure that you include precisely the same observations (cases, people?) in each one. At the same time, it wouldn't be amiss to test your assumption of separate clusters of variables in different ways, e.g. Look at the correlation between your new PCs from separate analyses. Plot the results and watch for any patterns. If latent variables or factors really are quite separate, that should also fall out of a PCA on all variables together.
