I suspect these bytes are really in UTF8 , not in UTF16 as you supposed. See, if you change your code to: byte[] unicodeBytes = new byte[] {0x61, 0x70, 0x70, 0x6C, 0x69, 0x63, 0x61, 0x74, 0x69, 0x6F, 0x6E, 0x2F, 0x70, 0x63, 0x61, 0x70}; string unicodeString = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(unicodeBytes); Console.WriteLine(unicodeString); You'll get the output: application/pcap
