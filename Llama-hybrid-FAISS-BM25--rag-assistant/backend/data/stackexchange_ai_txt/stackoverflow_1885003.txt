Apple's site fakes it. Try it on a computer without QuickTime X and you'll see â€” that's a Javascript-based interface designed to look like the QuickTime X interface. I don't know of any way to tell QuickTime to use the new interface for embedded content. You might be able to fake it by creating an iframe that uses the media file as its src. It's a bit of a fragile solution, though.
