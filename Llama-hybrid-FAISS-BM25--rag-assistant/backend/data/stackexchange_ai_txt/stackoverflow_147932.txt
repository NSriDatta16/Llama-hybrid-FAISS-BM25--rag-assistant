Multi-user systems do not require relational databases, though RDBMSs are a staple technology for data storage/retrieval for a vast number of (especially CRUD) applications. If you want to read-up on document/object -oriented, distributed database solutions of yore, search on "Lotus Notes/Domino" (it's a mature technology/product in this area that's good background knowledge in how applications are designed in a document-based paradigm. Classically, it's really good at workflow type applications). On CouchDB specifically, check out: http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/ (this shouldn't be a surprise) http://seanoc.wordpress.com/2007/10/12/more-on-couchdb/ (easy reading description overview) http://twit.tv/floss36 (Podcast interview all about CouchDB)
