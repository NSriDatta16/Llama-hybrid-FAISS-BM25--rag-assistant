There's no getting around the number of evaluations: Sum[n-i, {i, 0, n}] = http://www.equationsheet.com/latexrender/pictures/27744c0bd81116aa31c138ab38a2aa87.gif But you can save yourself the expense of all those square roots if you can get by with an approximate result . It depends on your needs. If you're going to calculate an average, I would advise you to not try putting all the values into an array before calculating. Just calculate the sum (and sum of squares if you need standard deviation as well) and throw away each value as you calculate it. Since and , I don't know if this means you have to multiply by two somewhere.
