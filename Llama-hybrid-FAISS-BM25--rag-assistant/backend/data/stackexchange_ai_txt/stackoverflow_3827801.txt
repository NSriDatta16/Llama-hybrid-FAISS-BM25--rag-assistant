I have a strange feeling that the problem is with my xsl:copy-of statement. This is exactly the reason. The source XML document contains this fragment : Some HTML code here. In the XPath data model, namespace nodes are propagated from a root of a subtree to all of its descendents. Therefore, the element has the following namespaces: "http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" "http://stackoverflow.com/xml" "http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace" http://www.w3.org/2000/xmlns/ The last two are reserved namespaces (for the prefixes xml: and xmlns ) and are available to any named node. The reported problem is due to the fact that by definition the instruction copies all nodes and their complete subtrees with all namespaces belonging to each of the nodes. Remember : the prefixes specified as the value of the exclude-result-prefixes attribute are excluded only from literal-result elements ! Solution : My Title when this transformation is applied on the provided XML document : Some HTML code here. the wanted, correct result is produced : My Title Some HTML code here.
