You can always place a more flexible model on the arrive rate parameter. For instance, make the arrive rate a function of time, or place some time-series style model on it. Whatever makes sense for your data. The literature typically focuses on the core model because extensions are application specific. In an extended model, you'll almost certainly want to use Bayesian methods. You are interested in the posterior predictive distribution of the object "almost concurrent events." A recent paper in JASA describes nearly your exact problem, applied to call center data: Bayesian Forecasting of an Inhomogeneous Poisson Process With Applications to Call Center Data For a quick solution, don't underestimate the power of histogram style estimators. They are simple nonparametric estimators and you can cross-validate tuning parameters like binwidth and placement. Theoretically this is somewhat unsatisfying, but it would take a day to implement. A fully Bayesian approach likely will dominate, but at significant computational cost.
