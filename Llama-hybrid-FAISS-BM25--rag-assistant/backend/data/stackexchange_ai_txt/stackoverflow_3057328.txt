HttpWebRequest.UserAgent : What does it do

I read this MSDN like about it and ran its example. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.httpwebrequest.useragent.aspx when I change the uSerAgnet to something like "blah", the output is wrong but when I use the same thing that is in the example of even when I comment out the line of code that is setting the UserASgent, the output is correct. what is UserAgent at all ? when should I set it ? How to know to what value should I set it ? thanks
