Using a decision tree to predict a relevant location to a user

I am trying to create a decision tree to predict new locations a user would like to visit based on previous locations they have liked. Here is my problem, I have two data sets, a user data set which stores the tags from locations they have previously liked and how many times these tags have been liked by the user: a location dataset for locations and their associated tags: Is it possible, using decision trees (or another ML algorithm -please specify) to suggest/predict for a user which locations they will 'like' based on the tags of photos they have previously liked? I am fairly new to machine learning and I am really struggling to think of a way to train my datasets if this is possible. Does anyone have any ideas? Thank you in advance.
