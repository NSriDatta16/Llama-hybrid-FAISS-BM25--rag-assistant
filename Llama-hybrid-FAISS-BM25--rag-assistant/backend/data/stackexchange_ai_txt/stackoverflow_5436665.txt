Resizing another grid row size in WPF

I am wondering is there any way to solve this by changing XAML code? Please look at this sample picture: What I wants to do is when user dragging GridSeparater No.1, I want to resize thr 3rd row of grid. This is because in this application, the first and third rows are variable size, but second one is fixed size. Is that possible?
