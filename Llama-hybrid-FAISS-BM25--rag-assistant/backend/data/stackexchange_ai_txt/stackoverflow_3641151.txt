Create_date You'll usually want to use the DMBS underlying date storage type which stores all pieces of a date (and time if need be, like MySQL datetime). This opens up the ability to use date processing functions within the DBMS. For the filter example, you would calculate what the date was at 2 weeks ago. You may also get have a function to specify such a string in the DBMS. PHP's strotime() allows this. Create_day The text output is either automatic (MySQL datetime for instance) or it's easy to render whichever piece you need. (PHP date() can do this). It's generally a Good Idea to store a time stamp (datetime) for every record. Create_time If it's a global app you'll want to use UTC/GMT. Every user will have their offset applied to the times and as well as their form submissions (such as searching). PHP's DateTime objects allow specifying a timezone name as the offset. The user can choose from a list but in it's standard form that's a big list and isn't much towards usability if it doesn't even match their city ( http://us.php.net/manual/en/timezones.php ). The other option is getting the user's computer's timezone via Javascript. Lookup Table Yes those are both lookup tables.
