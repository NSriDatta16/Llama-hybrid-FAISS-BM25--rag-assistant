Activate jquery ui widgets within dynamically loaded form

What is the best practice of activating jquery ui widgets for html loaded and inserted into the document by ajax? I am an advocate of unobtrusive javascript and strongly believe that all functionality accessed by javascript should be also accessible without it. So in the ideal case, each form which opens in a popup, should also have its separate page and links to them should be replaced with javascript-based ajax loading. I find this pattern very useful for loading and inserting a part of another page into the current document: $('#placeholder').load('/some/path/ #content>*'); Or to make it more generic: $('a.load').each(function() { $(this).load($(this).attr('href') + ' #content>*'); }); However, I would also like to activate the javascripts from the dynamically loaded page, so that different widgets function correctly. I know, I could add those javascripts to the current document and activate all of them in the callback of .load() , or I could use $.get() to get some JSON with html and javascripts separately, but I guess, there might be a more elegant generic solution to this. What would you recommend? BTW, I am using Django in the backend.
