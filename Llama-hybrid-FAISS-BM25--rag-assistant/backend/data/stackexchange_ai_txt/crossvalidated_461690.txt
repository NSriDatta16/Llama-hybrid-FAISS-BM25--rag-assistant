Hypothesis testing intervention analysis - pre vs post with expected seasonal change

I have 400 discrete geographic areas of vastly different sizes, where I am recording the number of specific events. Every event is timestamped so I can summerise from daily counts to weekly, monthly, etc. The number of events varies significantly between areas, mostly as a product of their size. Bigger area = more events. Not all areas will see these events, even after several months, however, the larger areas may see several tens per week. These events, when all the areas are combined, have a very apparent seasonal pattern. Some of the larger areas will display this individually due to the number of events. I have two main questions; I changed something in one of these areas at a given date, where the intensity of the change will increase over time. Given the seasonality, which is the most appropriate test to demonstrate the change had an effect? How could I demonstrate that the rate of change is more significant in this area? Would simply tracking the monthly % change across all areas be sufficient? Something changed in all of these areas at a given date, given the seasonality, which is the most appropriate test to demonstrate the change had an effect? I am looking at Poisson regression, repeated measures ANOVA and ANCOVA. The time series element, the seasonality and the very biased treatment vs non-treatment groups are throwing me off a bit. It may be worth noting these changes all occurred in the real world, not in a controlled way. In the following example, df would create the example data, where treatment1 refers to the data for the first question and treatment2 for the data for the second question. The actual treatment months do not align for each treatment, it serves only to create an example. Please also note I have not created a seasonal variable for event_count . df = data.frame( year = rep(2011:2020, each = 12), month = rep(month, 10), area = paste("Area", rep(1:6, each = 120), sep = "_"), treatment1 = c(rep("not treated", length.out = 100), rep("treated", times = 20), rep("not treated", times = 600)), treatment2 = c(rep("not treated", length.out = 100), rep("treated", times = 20)), event_count = round(rnorm(120, mean = 50, sd = 10), digits = 0) ) Thank you in advance
