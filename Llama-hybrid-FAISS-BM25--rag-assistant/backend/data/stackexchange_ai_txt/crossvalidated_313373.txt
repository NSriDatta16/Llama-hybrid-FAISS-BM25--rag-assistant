To great extent this is really a question about expected value, that was already discussed in different place . You are right, that we are and should be interested in the whole distributions, but it is hard to compare whole distributions and comparing single point summaries is much easier. Yes, you could compare other single point summaries, and in many cases you would compare them, but expected value has several nice properties that makes it a very good single point summary for a random variable. Expected value weights the possible outcomes by their probabilities and tells you what could you "expect" in the long run. If you play against the casino, the expected value of the possible wins and losses is negative for you, so it tells you that in the long run you shouldn't expect it makes you rich. Let me give you very game-theoretically non-rigorous example. Imagine that you are considering playing Russian roulette , you are going to take one shot towards yourself using a six-shot revolver with only one bullet in the chamber. If nothing happens, you win \$1000, otherwise you die. The mode outcome is that you win \$1000, same with the median. The expected value from this game is 5/6 $\times$ \$1000 $+$ 1/6 $\times$ death, would you consider playing? Of course in game theoretic approach you would consider what is the actual utility of the money won and what is the price of dying, but I guess that without going any deeper you should see the point of using expected value as a single point summary in here. Expected value (and mean, its estimator) are sensitive to outliers and this is one of the reasons why use it so much. Would you even consider the competition if the price was \$1? What about \$1 000 000 000? Notice that if you were using the mode or median as your criteria for the "possible" outcome, you shouldn't care since in each case they tell you that you win "on average". Would you change your mind if you were shooting with blank bullets? Notice that neither the mode, nor the median do not change if you are using blanks, since they don't care about the extreme outcomes, yet the expected value changes dramatically * . Expected value (and mean) consider all the possible outcomes and weight them by probabilities, that is the reason for using it in decision scenario. More realistic example would be the lottery with 1000 coupons and only a single winning coupon. Say that the price is \$1000, so the expected value is 999/1000 $\times$ \$0 $+$ 1/1000 $\times$ \$1000 = \$1, so coupon is not worth buying if its price is not less then \$1. This means that if you played the game many, many times, you would win few times and loose a lot of times and the overall balance of the invested and won money would be approximately \$1. If the prize would change to \$10 000, without changing the coupon price, the story would be different since the expected value would change to \$10. Notice that, again, the mode or median are in both cases \$0, so they are insensitive to the payoffs. This is not saying that they are useless, but it shows that the expected value is what we usually need in here. * - To be honest, this example is misleading, since you can kill yourself with blanks , but for stake of argument lets say that you have some kind of hypothetical "safe" blanks.
