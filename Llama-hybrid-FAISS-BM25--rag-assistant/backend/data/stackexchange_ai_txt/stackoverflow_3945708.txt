TrueWill had the right answer. I wanted to add that I had to do the following to get it working: Install FXCop 10 (You can get it from the 7.1 Windows SDK) Update buildagent.properties to include: system.FxCopRoot=C:\Program Files\ (x86)\Microsoft\ Fxcop\ 10.0 system.FxCopCmdFileVersion=10.0.30319.1 system.WindowsSDK7.1 Restart build agent.1.
