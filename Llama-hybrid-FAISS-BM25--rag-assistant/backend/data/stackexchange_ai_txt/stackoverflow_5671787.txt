unset shipping and recalculate totals in magento

Here is my problem: When I add an E-course (no shipping) and a regular product (has shipping) to my cart and select shipping during checkout the cost gets set in the quote. if I leave checkout after this has been set and then remove the product that has shipping, the shipping cost is still set in the quote and I can't unset it...even by removing all items in the quote. I'm trying to figure out how to unset the shipping method and recalculate the totals after a product is removed from the cart.
