XGBoost prints trees beyond n_estimator

I have a XGBoost model with the following parameters xgbc_final = XGBClassifier(objective="multi:softprob", num_class = 2,max_depth = 60, n_estimators = 512, reg_lambda = 0.1214, alpha = 0.9131, gamma = 0, colsample_bytree = 0.7, colsample_bylevel = 0.8, colsample_bynode = 0.7, subsample = 0.6, learning_rate = .01, min_child_weight = 14, random_state = 2020, eval_metric = 'auc', verbosity = 1) Here, I only have n_estimator = 512 but I noticed that when I try to print a decision tree greater than 511, I still get a plot plot_tree(xgbc_final, num_trees=900) I expected an error for n_estimator greater than 511(if the trees are index from 0) Can anyone explain why it's spitting out trees for number greater than 512?
