How do I detect if a function is available during JNLP execution?

I have an application which really should be installed, but does work fine when deployed using JNLP. However, it would seem that some Java functions such as Runtime.exec don't work using the default security options. I would like to therefore disable UI functionality that relies upon such functions. So my question is, how do I detect at runtime whether certain functions are available or not? The case study, here of course, is Runtime.exec .
