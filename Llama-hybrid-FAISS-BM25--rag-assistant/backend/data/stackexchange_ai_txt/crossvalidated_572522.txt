Scale-independent error metric for data with many zeros

I've been working on a time series forecasting model. I can't use a scale-dependent error measurement. And my target outputs also occasionally have zeros, meaning I can't use MAPE either. What is the best choice for me in this situation? I've thought about adding some amount (for example, the mean) to all of the outputs (all non-negative) to make them all non-zeros and then use MAPE, but I'm not sure what would be an appropriate amount.
