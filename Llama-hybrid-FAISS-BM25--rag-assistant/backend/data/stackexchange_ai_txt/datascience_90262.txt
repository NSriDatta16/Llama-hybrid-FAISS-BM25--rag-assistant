Difference between rulefit & skope-rules Python Packages

RuleFit is an implementation of a rule-based prediction algorithm based on the rulefit algorithm from Friedman and Popescu (PDF) . skope-rules Skope-rules is a Python machine learning module built on top of scikit-learn and distributed under the 3-Clause BSD license. Both the packages generate rules. Do both the packages rely on The RuleFit algorithm by Friedman and Popescu (2008) , and implement the same algorithm?
