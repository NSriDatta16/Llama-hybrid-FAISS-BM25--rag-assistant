Suppose I have a single queue of $n$ people, in a shop each waiting to but their items. Suppose I have $c$ servers (i.e. cashiers). If $n , and on average, it takes $\mu$ times units (say minutes) for a single servers to serve a single customer. If I have say $c = 5$ servers then I can serve up to $n = 5$ people at once, so my service rate will be up to $5\mu$ ; I serve $5$ customers every $\mu$ minutes. If I only have $n=2$ customers at once, then my service rate is only $2\mu$ , even if my capacity is $5\mu$ . If I have $n=10$ customers my service rate will only be $5\mu$ because my workers can only serve $5$ people at once.
