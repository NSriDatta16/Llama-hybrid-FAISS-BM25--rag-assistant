I recommend you delay the question of which sort of model to use in relating your DV to your IVs. First, you need to tackle scale development and see what sort of DV you arrive at. Maybe it'll end up something measured on an interval scale that is suitable for a linear regression. As Peter has said, combining variables that could be components of your ultimate DV could be challenging since they're measured on different scales, but it can be done. You'll need to put in careful thought about how to combine them in a way that preserves the weights you believe each one deserves. I don't have an answer about that to offer you, but I can suggest a few authors you might read: Robert Devellis, Paul Spector, and Lewis Aiken. Or there are probably lots of websites that deal with scale development and with the reliability and validity of scales one forms based on several "ingredients." If you search for terms like these and add the qualifier "different scales" you'll probably find good sources.
