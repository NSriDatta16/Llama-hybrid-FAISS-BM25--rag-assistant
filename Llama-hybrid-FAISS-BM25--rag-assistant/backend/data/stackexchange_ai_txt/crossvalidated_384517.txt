Are all classification models appropriate for estimation of probabilities?

I try to estimate the probability that a tennis player will win based on several predictors (such as skill, form, surface, weather etc.). Can I use every classification method to estimate a probability such as these methods: Logistic Regression Linear Discriminant Analysis SVM Neural Networks KNN Bagged Trees Random Forest Or are some methods more suitable to identify a specic class and less suitable for estimation of a precise probability?
