How calculate probability when we have continuous features?

Suppose that we have a dataset with four features and each feature follows different distribution (normal,beta,gamma...). All features are continuous. So, how we can calculate the probability of any target if we want to follow Bayesian rule? ( Because the probability will be zero for each)
