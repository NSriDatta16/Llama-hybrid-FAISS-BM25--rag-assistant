Relation and difference between time series and regression?

What are relation and difference between time series and regression? For models and assumptions , is it correct that the regression models assume independence between the output variables for different values of the input variable, while the time series model doesn't? What are some other differences? For methods , from a website by Darlington There are a number of approaches to time series analysis, but the two best known are the regression method and the Box-Jenkins (1976) or ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) method. This document introduces the regression method. I consider the regression method far superior to ARIMA for three major reasons I don't quite understand what the "regression method" for time series is on the website, and how it is different from the Box-Jenkins or ARIMA method. I appreciate if someone can give some insights on those questions. Thanks and regards!
