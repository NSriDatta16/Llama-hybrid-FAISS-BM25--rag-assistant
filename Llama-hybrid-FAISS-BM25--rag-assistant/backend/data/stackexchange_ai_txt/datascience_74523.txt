Python strategies for handing categorical variables

I am currently working on a binary classification task where the class is imbalanced . I have the following categorical attributes with different levels: time_slot: 8 levels product_type: 3 levels state: 40 levels due_day: 6 levels (Mon - Sat) lead_time: numerical in days (0-100) Now, I am planning to use three algorithms to start with: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest I am confused as to what sort of encoding strategy is best when it comes to categorical variables? LabelEncoder, OneHot, BinaryEncoding? Also, I am thinking of creating bins for lead_time any pointers/tips will be useful.
