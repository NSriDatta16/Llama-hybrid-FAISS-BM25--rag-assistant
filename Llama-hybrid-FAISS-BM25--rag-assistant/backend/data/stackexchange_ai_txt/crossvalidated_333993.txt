How to determine I am over fitting my machine learning algorithm and what are other method to evaluate performance of machine learning algorithm?

I am trying to recognize patterns through deep learning. I have data set of 850 images that I split (600 into train and 250 to validation). After I run machine learning algorithm, I get results shown in attached picture. . How I will know if my model is over fitted or not? Secondly, I want to know what are other ways to evaluate a deep learning model than measuring accuracy and loss? For example can I calculate ROC curve, precision, confusion matrix etc? Thanks Umer
