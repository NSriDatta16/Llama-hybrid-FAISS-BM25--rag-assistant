I have a simple philosophy. If it's need to keep the database secure and in a consistant state, make sure to do it in the database I do try to keep a lot of other stuff there too, in my world it's easier to update a client's database than it is to update their application... Essentially I try to treat the database as a pseudo object. A bunch of methods I can call, etc, but I don't want the app to care about the detail of the internal data storage.
