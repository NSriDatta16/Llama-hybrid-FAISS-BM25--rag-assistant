First of all, you should ask this on gamedev.stackexchange.com. But I've seen a tutorial embedding XNA. You should check this question and this page. They are on Windows Forms, but they'll help. Also check this and this articles. Keep in mind one thing. XNA is meant to be used for the whole game, integration would be useful on making level editors like you say, but not for a full game.
