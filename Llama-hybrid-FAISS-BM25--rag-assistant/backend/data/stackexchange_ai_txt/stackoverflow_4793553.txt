ORM is nice if your data model is well structured, not overly complex and, most of all, if you have control over it. Legacy databases or poorly modelled ones are harder to be represented with ORM, and doing so would be strongly discouraged, as your application would add further complexities over those implied by the model itself. If you are comfortable with some ORM tool such as Hibernate and your database is fairly well done, go for it. They sure save you a lot of boilerplate code and have some nice query optimization code under the hood. Otherwise, you may want to use JDBC directly or some other framework to simplify JDBC use but still using plain SQL. For such situations I recommend MyBatis .
