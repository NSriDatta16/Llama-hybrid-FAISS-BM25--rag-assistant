Certain bits of HTML5, sure. Almost all new elements introduced in HTML5 can be used already, thanks to the html5shiv , and if you provide a suitable fallback you could be using and as well. Those, along with the more advanced scripting features (local storage, etc.) are the features that will take time to implement. Also, while Mark Pilgrim's Dive into HTML5 mostly discusses features that won't be available for some time (at least not in IE, i.e. the majority of web users), the chapter on semantics is both interesting and applicable. Also keep in mind what your target audience is; if most of your visitors are from the designer community (or whatever), most of them probably have a browser with HTML5 capabilities. WebKit browsers already support much of the HTML5 draft .
