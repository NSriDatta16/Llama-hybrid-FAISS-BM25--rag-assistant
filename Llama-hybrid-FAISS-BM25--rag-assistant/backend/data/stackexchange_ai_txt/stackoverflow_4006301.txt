I don't think it's failing on you, unless you have the warning level set to 4 (or similar, I assume Visual Studio) and have enabled "treat warnings as errors". Basically, this warning is A Good Thing, since it won't let you accidentally use the this pointer when what it points at is yet to be constructed. However, when you know what you are doing wherever this is passed in the initialization list, the warning and error caused by this will be annoying. You can get rid of it (again, assuming Visual Studio) by decorating the constructor (unless it's defined in the class declaration - then you must decorate all the class): // warning C4355: 'this' : used in base member initializer list #pragma warning (push) #pragma warning (disable : 4355) some_class::some_class() : ... { } #pragma warning (pop)
