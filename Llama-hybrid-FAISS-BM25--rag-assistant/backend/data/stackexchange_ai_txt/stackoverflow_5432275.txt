Encrypted storage on an Android/iPad

I want to create an application for the Android tablets and/or iPad that's going to hold a lot of sensitive data that needs to be encrypted. I'm thinking about two possible ways of dealing with that problem: Implement (or use an implementation) of some well known encryption algorithm, but that leaves a problem of passing private key as it probably be best if user has to enter 1024 bytes key from the on-screen keyboard on each start of the application Using a hardware encryption device (smart card, etoken etc.) - that's probably one of the most secure ways of doing that but here the problem is how can you insert the hardware device to a tablet. I assume you can probably find few Android devices that will have USB port but does anyone know how are those kind of devices supported on Android? I think it makes little sense of thinking about that kind of solution on an iPad since there's no USB on it. Another downsize of this whole approach is it makes a life a bit more complicates as you need to carry cryptographic device with you all the time. I should probably add that for this application we don't need to have it working on every possible device - we could limit to one device (Android or iPad) as we are providing both hardware and software. Same goes for external cryptographic devices. Security is the primary concern for the customer and I'd like to know if anyone have dealt with similar situations and what solutions have you used?
