If your first query works fine, why not just UNION ALL it with the new dates subbed into the 2nd version? Yes, you won't get a pivoted output, but that's easy enough to fix with application layer presentational code. Another option would be to use CASE. SELECT agentName, SUM (CASE WHEN saleDate.myDate BETWEEN @minDate1 AND @maxDate1 THEN sales.Amount ELSE 0 END) AS Gross1, SUM (CASE WHEN saleDate.myDate BETWEEN @minDate1 AND @maxDate1 THEN sales.Commission ELSE 0 END) AS Commission1, SUM (CASE WHEN saleDate.myDate BETWEEN @minDate2 AND @maxDate2 THEN sales.Amount ELSE 0 END) AS Gross2, SUM (CASE WHEN saleDate.myDate BETWEEN @minDate2 AND @maxDate2 THEN sales.Commission ELSE 0 END) AS Commission2 FROM agent INNER JOIN sales ON agent.agentId = sales.agentId GROUP BY agentName
