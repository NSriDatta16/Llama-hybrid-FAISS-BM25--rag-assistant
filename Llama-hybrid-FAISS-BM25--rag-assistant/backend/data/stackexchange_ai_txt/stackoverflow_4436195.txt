Transferring an SQL query from the workbench to a .java class

I'm trying to transfer an SQL query into java from my workbench. I wrote this query in the mySQL workbench and it executed fine with the results I wanted. SELECT committee_member . member_CAN# , member . first_name , member . last_name , committee_member . member_status , committee_member . start_year , committee_member . end_year , committee_member . added_notes FROM committee_member LEFT JOIN member ON committee_member . member_CAN# = CAN# Here is my .java class code. I am trying to print a table that displays this information. I keep getting an error that reads "Unknown table 'committee_member' in field list" in eclipse, so i'm guessing that my query syntax is wrong. package model; import java.sql.*; import java.util.ArrayList; public class ViewCommitteeMember { private Connection connection; private ArrayList members; public ViewCommitteeMember(){ members = new ArrayList (); makeConnection(); } public void viewMembers(){ String query = "SELECT `committee_member`.`member_CAN#`, `member`.`first_name`, `member`.`last_name`, `committee_member`.`member_status`, `committee_member`.`start_year`, `committee_member`.`end_year`, `committee_member`.`added_notes` FROM committee_member LEFT JOIN member ON `committee_member`.`member_CAN#` = `CAN#`"; PreparedStatement ps; try { ps = connection.prepareStatement(query); ResultSet rs = ps.executeQuery(); while (rs.next()){ //while the query is running, loop through all of the members CommitteeMember member = new CommitteeMember(); //create a new member for each entry so info may be displayed member.setID(rs.getInt(1)); //pulls the ID member.setFirstname(rs.getString(2)); member.setLastname(rs.getString(3)); member.setMemStat(rs.getString(4)); //pulls the status member.setStartYear(rs.getInt(5)); //pulls the start year member.setEndYear(rs.getInt(6)); //pulls the end year member.setNotes(rs.getString(7)); //pulls the additional notes members.add(member); //add the member to the array list "members" } } catch (SQLException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } finally { this.closeConnection(); } } private void makeConnection(){ // get connection String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/committee_database"; String user = "root"; String pwd = "coolman"; try { connection = DriverManager.getConnection(url, user, pwd); } catch (SQLException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } } private void closeConnection(){ try { connection.close(); } catch (SQLException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } } /** * @return the agents */ public ArrayList getMembers() { //list of all the members return members; } }
