The question is unclear as stated: Do you mean that you have to sample a posterior $\pi(\sigma)$ on $\sigma>0$ and use a Gaussian random-walk proposal $\mathcal{N}(\log\sigma,\tau^2)$ on $\log\sigma$ within a Metropolis-Hastings framework? In that case, the Metropolis-Hastings move is as follows: Given $\sigma^t$ , value of the Markov chain at iteration $t$ , generate $\eta\sim\mathcal{N}(\log\sigma^t,\tau^2)$ Accept $\sigma^{t+1}=\exp\eta$ with probability \begin{align}\alpha(\sigma^t,\eta) &= \min\left\{1,\underbrace{\frac{\pi(\exp\eta)}{\pi(\sigma^t)}}_{\text{ratio of targets}}\times\underbrace{\frac{1/\sigma^t}{1/\exp\eta}}_\text{ratio of proposals}\right\} \end{align} else take $\sigma^{t+1}=\sigma^t$ so the difference with the usual random walk move is the inclusion of the Jacobian $$\frac{\text{d}\log \sigma}{\text{d}\sigma}=\frac{1}{\sigma}$$ in the Metropolis-Hastings probability.
