What the hell, you want it without a plugin? MyClip.addEventListener(Event.ENTER_FRAME, onEnterFrame); var time:Number = 0; var deltaTime:Number = 1 / stage.frameRate; var initY:Number = MyClip.y var deltaY:Number = 367 - initY; function onEnterFrame(event:Event):void { time += deltaTime; if (t >= 1) { MyClip.removeEventListener(Event.ENTER_FRAME, onEnterFrame); MyClip.y = 367; } else { MyClip.y = deltaY * (-Math.pow(2, -10 * time) + 1) + initY; } } I think, though I haven't tested it. Easing equation from robertpenner.com , though mighy be optimizable Using the enter-frame may not be optimal, see my blog post on tickers for more information. Really though, you ought to use a tweening library. They are built by clever people looking to squeeze every ounce of performance out of a performance heavy operation. You might consider looking at Grant Skinner's GTween too, as it has a less restrictive license than TweenLite/TweenMax.
