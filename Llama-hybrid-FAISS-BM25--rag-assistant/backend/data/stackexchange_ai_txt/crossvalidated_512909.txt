I had some trouble understanding your question, to be honest, but... Yes, Bayesian genetic algorithms are a thing. Take a look at Ter Braak's (2006) work on Differential Evolution Markov Chains . This is a Bayesian sampler that uses a genetic algorithm to efficiently propose parameter values to evaluate on high-dimensional problems. It really isn't clear that the distribution of samples in the approach you describe should match the posterior distribution, so I wouldn't put too much trust in this method without further verification.
