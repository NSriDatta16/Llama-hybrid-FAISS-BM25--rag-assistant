As you know, the $t$ -distribution tends towards the normal distribution as the sample size increases. Therefore, if you are willing to assume that the underling distribution is normal -- which is a requirement for your $t$ -distribution argument anyway -- you might also assume that the sample size is large enough, such that the normal and the $t$ -distribution are very similar [my guess is that this is save to assume]. Hence, I would just use the 68-95-99.7% rule to obtain the confidence bounds of your measurements. Using your data above, I would state that you are 95% confident that the averaged lead concentration lies within the interval $\bar x \pm 2\sigma = (1.1 \pm 0.4)mg/cm^2$ . If you like to check this assumption, you stated the solution already. First take many measurements from the same sample. Then use the central limit theorem. If the assumption is correct we expect that approx. 68% of the $\pm 1 \sigma$ confidence intervals contain the grand sample average and approx. 95% of the $\pm 2 \sigma$ confidence intervals contain the grand sample average.
