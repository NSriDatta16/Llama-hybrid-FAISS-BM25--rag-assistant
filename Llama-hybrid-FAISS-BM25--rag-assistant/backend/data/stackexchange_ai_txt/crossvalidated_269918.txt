First of all, by elimination the first two are solvable (you can look at the variance and mean of the distribution). But I strongly agree 3 is tricky, but I came up with an explanation: Poisson distribution has a nice property: $x_i - \operatorname{Poisson}(\lambda_i) \Rightarrow \sum_ix_i-\operatorname{Poisson}(\sum_i\lambda_i) $ Therefore: $X_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n}X_i, X_i-\operatorname{Poisson}(1)\rightarrow_{n\rightarrow\infty}N\left(\mathbb{E}\left[\sum_iX_i\right],\sum_i\lambda_i\right)=N(n,n) \\\Rightarrow \mathbb{P}(X_n\leq n)=0.5$ The last part is true since Gaussian distribution is symmetric. BTW - I encourage you to use the same way the calculate the actual probability in 2 and 3
