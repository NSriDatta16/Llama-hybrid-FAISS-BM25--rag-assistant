Where does advanced probability theory/stochastics come into machine learning?

I have a chance of writing my bachelor thesis about ML in our Probility Theory/Stochastics deparment at the university. In the search of interesting theoretical topics I am studying Bishops Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning book. I have read into most of the chapters now and the only place where I obviously see some advanced probability theory (stochastic processes) is in the Gaussian processes chapter. Are there any other areas which I overlooked or where the advanced math isn't so obvious s.t. I could find interesting theoretical questions regarding probability theory or stochastic analysis?
