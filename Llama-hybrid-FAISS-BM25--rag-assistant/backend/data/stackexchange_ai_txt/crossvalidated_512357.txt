If you mean to say you'd like to classify the most likely clothing item based on variables such as event and body part the clothing covers, it seems fairly trivial to condition a model off of those two variables such that your input is some tuple x = (event_type, body_part) and the output is y = clothing_item . For a full output, say hat, shirt and pants for a costume party, you'd need three inputs: x = (party, head) x = (party, torso) x = (party, legs) And hopefully, your random forest would give you three corresponding outputs based on your training data. Or, you could build a model that outputs a probability distribution based on each input, giving you some likely candidates to choose from.
