Which technology stack would result in easiest deployment for a customer-hosted web app?

For a web-app product which would need to be installed by the customer on their own servers (think FogBugz or the self-hosted Wordpress package), which technology stack would result in a smoother/easier installation? Our target platforms are known: Windows/IIS/SQLSever and Linux/Apache/MySQL. But the technology stack to be used is being debated around the office: PHP w/ no frameworks, PHP with Codeigniter, Python, ASP.Net with C# (running Mono for the Linux installations), Rails, Java, etc. Some of the things to consider would be whether an average "out of the box" web server running IIS or Apache would have the required libraries to install the product if it were built using one technology rather than the other (for example, a PHP-based solution would probably be easier for the customer to deploy on a Linux machine as opposed to having to install mono and whatever other dependencies would be required to run an ASP.Net solution on a Linux machine as a web app). We're working on the assumption that the customer has some access to a system administrator, but perhaps not a full-time/dedicated one -- something like a shared web host account. Given that, we want the customer to be able to have the least amount of friction in installing the web app on their web server, and we're debating the right technology stack to use for that.
