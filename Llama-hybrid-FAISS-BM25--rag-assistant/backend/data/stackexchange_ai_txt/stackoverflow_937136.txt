Lua on the iPhone?

I am trying to use Lua on the iPhone. On Mac OS X, in a normal (non-iOS) Cocoa application, I used the following code: lua_State* l; l = lua_open(); luaL_openlibs(l); luaL_loadstring(l, "print(\"Hi from Lua\");"); lua_pcall(l, 0, 0, 0); I downloaded Lua 5.1.4 from lua.org/ftp and compiled it for Mac OS X. In the Xcode project, I used "Add Existing Framework" to add liblua.a and I used "Add Existing Files" to add the include directory. This works as expected, and prints the string: "Hi from Lua". When I try the same thing in an iOS project, it gives the errors: "_luaL_newstate", referenced from: _main in main.o more of the same thing... symbol(s) not found collect2: ld returned 1 exit status It seems that the .a file is not linked into the iPhone app. Does anybody know how to make this work? (By the way, I don't really care that Apple might not accept my app if it has Lua in it.)
