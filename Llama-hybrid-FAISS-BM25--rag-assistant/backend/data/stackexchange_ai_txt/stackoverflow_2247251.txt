So, I've wrestled with this question myself and in fact still want to set up a dedicated Linux box despite my usage of VirtualBox . I enjoy using the Mac OS X machine for development. I find Mac OS X to be very elegant and it's stable. (Not that Linux isn't). The features and support apple puts out keeps it up to date and operating smoothly. Also, a side benefit I must mention is how fast Mac OS X will start and shut down. I am, not comparing it to Linux but more to Windows in this regards. But it is still nice if you have a MacBook. I run Linux in VirtualBox on my MacBook. It runs fine though I often don't use it because it can be a pain to get it started and working in it. Just because Mac OS X is already "there". I've found that using most tools is the same. So no real difference there. And then, of course, you have the additional text editors that are out for Mac. I like TextWrangler -- it's a straight forward editor. I guess, ultimately, what I enjoy is knowing that support is down the street at my local apple store if I need it. Normally, I'd like to fix my own compupter -- it's how we learn -- but on the flip side, if I need to accomplish something, I need to get up and running quickly .
