The classifier training needs information from all training data so for bagging the training data is either replicated on processors or some reduced information is communicated if the data is distributed. Once the classifier is trained, the classifier is replicated and prediction can be parallel on different subsets of data. See slides 34-38 in this pdf for how to do this for random forest parallel training and parallel prediction with the randomForest package in R. Random forest classifiers are bagging plus random column subset selection.
