Average of Average in one row

I'm not sure if this is possible what I'm trying to achieve. I want to get the avg of averaged columns. SELECT avg(col1), avg(col2), avg(col3) FROM tbl My Result should be the avg of all three avg columns, is this possible? Something like this SELECT avg( col1, col2, col3) FROM tbl doesn't work at MySQL 5.1
