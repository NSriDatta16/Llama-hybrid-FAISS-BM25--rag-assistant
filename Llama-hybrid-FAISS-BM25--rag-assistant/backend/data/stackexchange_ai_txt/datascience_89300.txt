How do you use KS-test in a data science report?

I'm writing a data science report, I want to find an exist distribution to fit the sample. I got a good looking result , but when I use KS-test to test the model, I got a low p-value,1.2e-4, definitely I should reject the model. I mean, whatever what distribution/model you use to fit the sample, you cannot expect to have a perfect result, especially working with huge amount of data. So what does KS-test do in a data science report? Does it means only if we got high p-value in KS-test then the model is correct?
