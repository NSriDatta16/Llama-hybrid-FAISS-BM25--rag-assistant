No, your understanding is not correct. First, frequentist statistics does not allow us to "test to see what is the % chance the population mean falls within some range, using the sampling distribution". More precisely, frequentist statistics do not make probability statements on the population mean --- they only make probability statements on the estimates of the population mean. This is a well-known limitation of frequentist statisics that has caused much confusion and spawned many related questions on cross validated. (See, e.g., this thread.) Secondly, in Bayesian stats, we do have the sampling distribution of the sample mean. We may not specifically refer to it, though. As others have mentioned though, Bayesian inference is a type of likelihood inference. Once you have defined your likelihood, you have, by deduction, the sampling distribution of the sample mean. Whether you use that distribution is another matter though. In fact, there are variants of frequentist inference that bypass the likelihood, in that they only work with the moments of the sampling distribution and not the full distribution. See, e.g. the literature on method of moments . However, a "pure" Bayesian analysis will always involve the likelihood even if it is intractable, and therefore a sampling distribution is always implied. Just for completeness, there are also variants of Bayesian inference that do not involve a full definition of the likelihood, and hence I specifically refered to "pure" Bayesian inference earlier. An example for illustration \begin{align} X_i &\overset{iid}{\sim} N(\mu, 1) \tag{1} \\ \mu &\sim N(0, \sigma^2) \tag{2} \end{align} Here, equation (1) implies \begin{equation} \bar{X} = \sum_i^n X_i \sim N(\mu, 1/n) \tag{3} \end{equation} which is the sampling distribution of $\bar{X}$ . Of course, in Bayesian inference, we typically don't care about (3), since our interest will usually be in \begin{equation} p(\mu|X) = \frac{p(X|\mu)p(\mu)}{p(X)} \end{equation} However, it happens in this case, since $\bar{X}$ is a sufficient statistic, that \begin{equation} p(\mu|X) = p(\mu|\bar{X}) = \frac{p(\bar{X}|\mu)p(\mu)}{p(\bar{X})} \end{equation} Thus, you can also use the sampling distribution (3) to derive your posterior distribution, if you like .
