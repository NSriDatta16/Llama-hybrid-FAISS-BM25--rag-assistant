Logistic regression and assessment of continuous variables by seasonal categorical variable

I'm currently working on a logistic regression analysis in R where my response variable is 1 = used animal location and 0 = random location. I am modelling non-random habitat selection for a species of wildlife. I recently ran into an issue where I need to evaluate non-random habitat selection across 3 seasonal periods to determine if habitat selection varies by season. In other words, I need to determine if my continuous independent variables differ across season. Would it be appropriate to build a model with the continuous independent variables and include a seasonal categorical variable into the model? See example code below where R0A1 is defined as the used and random locations (1 and 0, respectively), MP_Scaled, MPHW_Scaled, HW_Scaled, YP_Scaled, AG_Scaled, and Shrub_Scaled are continuous variables, and Season is a categorical variable (1 = winter, 2 = preincubation, and 3 = summer). I recognize that logistic regression will treat one of the seasonal values as a reference category which is fine but need to determine if the continuous variables differ across season and if so, need to output the beta coefficients for each season. results_full
