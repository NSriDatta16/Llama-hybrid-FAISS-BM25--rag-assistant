By default, the tracking database** won't reduce in size - I suspect that if you look at the data and log file usage, you will find a large percentage in the unallocated (data file) and unused (log file) states. You will need to shrink the database or individual files to reduce the overall database size using the DBCC SHRINKFILE command as discussed at Shrinking the Transaction Log in SQL Server 2000 with DBCC SHRINKFILE . Hope this helps. ** or any database for that matter, unless the AUTO SHRINK option is enabled, however this isn't recommended: SQL Server Storage Engine Blog - Turn AUTO_SHRINK off!!
