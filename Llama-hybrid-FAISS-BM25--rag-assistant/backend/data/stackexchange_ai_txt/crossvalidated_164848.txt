There are a number of techniques for this sort of classification, depending on the amount of data you have. For 5k samples and assuming you have say ~100 attributes per sample, this is not a large data set. You may want to do some exploration of the data using k-Means clustering which will create clusters of your data into similar items. This might validate your earlier assumption/deduction that there are 8 clusters. There is a technique that is popular these days called Random Forests. While it is computationally more demanding it is relatively more forgiving in terms of data hygiene. You can quickly pick up pointers and toy examples on Random Forests using Python, on www.kaggle.com I am not sure if this is considered shameless self promotion or not but I have created a collection of self-learning materials in Data Science in the form of IPython Notebooks, available open source on github at http://learnds.com These are meant for developers who are familiar with Python to pick up a handful of useful techniques over a few weekends. It is not exhaustive but will give you a sense of methodologies and tools needed. Good luck! Nitin
