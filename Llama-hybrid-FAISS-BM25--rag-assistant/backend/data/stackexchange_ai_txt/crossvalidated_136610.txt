How to calculate the total error of a neural network

I know that my question sounds really simple, but honestly I don't know how to calculate it. The error = expected output- estimated output, but what does total error mean? Is it the sum of the error for all training samples? or the sum of the errors for all the neurons at the output layer?? Thanks in advance. EDIT I used MSE for error calculations
