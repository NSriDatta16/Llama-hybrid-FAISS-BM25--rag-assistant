Let's take a different example, a random variable $X$ having a Poisson distribution with parameter $\lambda$ . You can say $\mathbb E[X] = \lambda$ , so $\hat \lambda_1 = \frac1n\sum X$ is a method of moments estimator. You can also say $\mathbb E[X^2] = \lambda+\lambda^2$ , so $\hat \lambda_2 = \sqrt{\frac14+\frac1n\sum (X^2)}-\frac12$ is a different method of moments estimator. You can also say $\mathbb E[X^2-X] = \lambda^2$ , so $\hat \lambda_3 = \sqrt{\frac1n\sum (X^2) -\frac1n\sum X}$ is another method of moments estimator. You can even take the average of these three (or two of them) and get yet another method of moments estimator, and there are infinitely more possibilities. The second and third estimators are not good estimators: they are less natural and are biased downwards and have a higher variance than the first, but they are still estimators.
