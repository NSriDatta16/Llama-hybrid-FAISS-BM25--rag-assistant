De-normalizing Google Trends data can be very useful, but it is tricky, due to rounding errors: when comparing 2 queries of vastly different search volume, the time series for the less frequent query could appear to be 0 everywhere. To solve this problem, we have developed a method called Google Trends Anchor Bank. It's available here: https://github.com/epfl-dlab/GoogleTrendsAnchorBank A technical paper describing the method is available here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.13861
