How does WINBUGS determine the posterior density of a parameter with multiple chains?

I am a new user to WINBUGS. I am running a model with 2 chains. When my model has finished running I have the following posterior density plot of my parameter: The plot only shows one distribution (i.e., one line). Since I used 2 MCMC chains, did WINBUGS just take the mean values and produced one single distribution? Also how can I get the 2 individual distributions for each chain. For example, something like this, where the red line is Chain #1 and blue line is Chain #2:
