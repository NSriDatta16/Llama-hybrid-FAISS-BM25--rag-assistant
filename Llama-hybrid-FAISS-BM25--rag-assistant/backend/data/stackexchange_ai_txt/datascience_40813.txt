does xgb multi-class require one-hot encoding?

I was trying an xgboost from python with a multiclass single-label problem and assumed the label can be an integer indicating my class (as opposed to eg one-hot) . params = {'eta': 0.1, # 'objective': 'binary:logistic', 'objective': 'multi:softmax', 'scale_pos_weight':9, 'eval_metric': 'auc', 'nthread':25, 'num_class':6} dtrain = xgb.DMatrix(df_train_x,label= df_train_y) dvalid = xgb.DMatrix(df_val_x,label= df_val_y) watchlist = [(dtrain, 'train'), (dvalid, 'valid')] model = xgb.train(params, dtrain, 500,watchlist, maximize=True, verbose_eval=50,early_stopping_rounds=20) However I hit an error (1353150 vs. 225525) label size predict size not match and I note that my sample size is 225525 , number of classes is 6 , and 6*225525 is 1353150 so it appears that xgb is looking for one-hot ... however when i use one hot I get an error hinting that one-hot can't be used - dtrain = xgb.DMatrix(df_train_x,label= df_train_y) ValueError: DataFrame for label cannot have multiple columns !!!
