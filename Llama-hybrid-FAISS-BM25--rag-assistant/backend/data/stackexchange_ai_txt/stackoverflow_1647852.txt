Can you try the following scenario on the test server: Make two copies of the database on the server: [A] and [B]. [A] is the database in question, [B] is the copy. Restart server Run your process Drop the database [A] Rename [B] to [A] Run your process This would be like a hot database swap. If the second run takes longer, something on the server level is happening (tempdb, memory, I/O, etc). If the second run takes about the same time, then the problem is on the database level (locks, index fragmentation, etc). Good luck!
