This snippet is in PHP, and it's loosely based on some example someone else had on their website somewhere (sorry buddy, I can't remember). The basic concept is instead of using if, use a loop. function formatNumberThousands($a,$dig) { $unim = array("","k","m","g"); $c = 0; while ($a>=1000 && $c The number_format() call is a PHP library function which returns a string with commas between the thousands groups. I'm not sure if something like it exists in perl. The $dig parameter sets a limit on the number of digits to show. If $dig is 2, it will give you 1.2k from 1237. To format bytes, just divide by 1024 instead. This function is in use in some production code to this day.
