It sounds like the sample app is using a relative path for the library file, prepending XMLLite\Lib to the library filename. This could be happening as a result of a #pragma in the sample app code, can you run findstr on the source code to see if there are any references to XmlLite.lib ? http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/7f0aews7(v=VS.100).aspx for info on #pragma as it is used in this way. EDIT: Actually the projects in this sample are set up to reference an XmlLite that is installed with the sample code: G:\SlideshowExample>findstr /si xmllite.lib . PicasaExampleComponent\PicasaExampleComponent.vcproj: AdditionalDependencies="XMLLite\lib\XmlLite.lib" PicasaExampleComponent\PicasaExampleComponent.vcproj: AdditionalDependencies="XMLLite\lib\XmlLite.lib" PicasaExampleComponent\PicasaExampleComponent.vcxproj: XMLLite\lib\XmlLite.lib;%(AdditionalDependencies) PicasaExampleComponent\PicasaExampleComponent.vcxproj: XMLLite\lib\XmlLite.lib;%(AdditionalDependencies) You can either use that one or get the one you have installed with the SDK properly included.
