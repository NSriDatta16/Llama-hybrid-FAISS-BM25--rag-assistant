JQPlot Printing

Does any body have have a simple working example to print the JQPlot graph. I am struggling a bit with it. I need to print it in both IE and Chrome and I am even open to using 2 diiferent methods based upon browser detection. Also I need to print the X & Y axis lables along with the graph. Any help would be highly appreciated. Ragards
