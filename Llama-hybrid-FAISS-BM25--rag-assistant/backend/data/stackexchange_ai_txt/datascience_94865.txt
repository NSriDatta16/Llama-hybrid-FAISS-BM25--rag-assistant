Can we cross-validate the neuron no. and hidden layer no. of a feed-forward neural network?

Confused about tons of relevant info on the web, so I appreciate if anyone of you can clarify for me. I will use the model to binary classify for your reference. As for the problem, let's say in a feed-forward network with hidden layer no. to be decided, I want to know how many neurons I should put in (each) hidden layer(s), so What are the most commonly referred metrics to decide the no. of the neurons (in each hidden layer)? Recall, accuracy, precision or...? Can we use some kind of cross validations (e.g. Stratified K-Fold) to testify the performance of the network with different no. of hidden neurons and different no. of hidden layers in terms of the above metrics? Thanks a lot in advance.
