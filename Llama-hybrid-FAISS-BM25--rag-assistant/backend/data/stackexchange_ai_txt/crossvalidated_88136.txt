Modeling techniques for dichotomous data

I have dichotomous data where some of my independent variables are categorical, some are continuous and some are binary (0/1). My dependent is a binary response (Fail/NoFail, 0/1). The data is some readings collected every day over a period of time. The goal is to use this data and see if we can figure out cause of failure, the end response. Example data format Date, Type, Mileage, S1, S2, S3, ... , Response 03/02/2013,A,32000,1,0,1,..., 1 03/03/2013,B,32400,0,0,0,...,0 03/04/2013,C,45000,0,1,1,...,1 Can we do time series modeling? Any other modeling techniques that can be used?Any suggestions on what type of other exploratory analysis can be used to figure out patterns in data?
