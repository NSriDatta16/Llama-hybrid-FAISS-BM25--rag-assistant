When are variables too highly correlated to be included in PCA?

In various literature, it is stated that when 2 or more variables are highly correlated it causes problems in your PCA analysis. However, in the literature that I've read, it is not stated how high the correlation needs to be in order to be too high. The solution is to remove variables that are highly correlated. My question is: how much correlation is high enough to cause problems in a PCA analysis, in other words, when is correlation too high? EDIT: Asking in relation to ordination methods/ multivariate statistical analysis where the objective is to find directions of most change in the data/relations between variables.
