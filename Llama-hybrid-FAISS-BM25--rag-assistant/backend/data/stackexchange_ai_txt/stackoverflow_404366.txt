RE GUID's Watch out if this is going to be a really Really REALLY REALLY big database, lots of load, and fast access. At my last job, where we had databases of 100 to 500 million records, our database guys strongly argued against GUIDs, and for an appropriately sized decimal number. They felt that (under Oracle) the size difference in the internal storage for a string Guid - vs- a decimal value would make a very noticeable difference in lookups. ( Bigger keys = deeper trees to traverse) The random nature of GUIDs also reduces the fill-factor for index pages significantly - this dramatically increases tearing and disk I/O.
