Use the right tool for the right job. Linq-to-SQL covers a large portion of what you need to do on a daily basis in a typical line-of-business app - so use it there. Devs will get used to it, and will probably also begin to like it - it's really quite powerful and useful! But yes - there are defintily scenarios where a straight-up SQL query will be a lot easier to use - that's fine, no harm done - that's what ExecuteQuery is for. If you have a bunch of CTE's and complicated joins of various types - you might be able to express that in Linq-to-SQL, but it might be just too much effort and hassle to do it if you already have a T-SQL statement that works.... It takes time to get used to a new way of doing things - give it some time! I'm sure most of your dev will migrate to LINQ step by step. Encourage them, give them tips & tricks, help them where you can. But also accept that in same cases, tricky SQL statements might just be too tricky to rewrite in LINQ (if you already have them and they already work - just keep using them).
