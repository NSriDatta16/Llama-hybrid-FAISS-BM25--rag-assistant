They're (effectively) identical. You see a difference in the hg log --patch --rev X output size because log shows the diff of the result and (arbitrarily) its 'left' parent (officially p1), but that's not how it's stored (Mercurial has a binary diff storage format that isn't patch/diff based) and it's now how it's computed (p1, p2, and most-recent-common-ancestor are all used). The only real difference is, if you're using named branches, the branch name will be that of the left parent.
