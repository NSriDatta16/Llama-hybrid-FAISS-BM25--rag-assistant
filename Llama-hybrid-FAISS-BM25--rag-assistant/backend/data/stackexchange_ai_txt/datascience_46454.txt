Anomaly detection on multidimensional time series

I have relatively little knowledge of unsupervised machine learning. I'm working on a project that aims to find anomalies in a set of n data, measured every x ms, and we have no label on all these data. So I'm here to ask you which algorithms/approach should be the best? Edit : I'm working in an industrial context, and my data are sensor readings (temperature, pressure, power consumption, etc.) all from the same equipment.
