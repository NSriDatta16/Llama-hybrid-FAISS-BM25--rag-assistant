I think you're just accidentally confusing yourself by using slightly different methods. To answer your question - yes, in an interaction, if you compare the marginal means at different values (also called the 'pick-a-point' approach), you will eventually reach a point where there's significance (though you may be at a point beyond where your data actually go!). The common alternative is the Johnson-Neyman approach (with multiple comparison correction), which gives you the range of values over which the marginal means are significantly different. Now, I'm just going to repeat your inflection point analysis using a slightly different approach: ## Use the chngpt library to fins the inflection point > library(chngpt) > fit1=chngpt::chngptm (formula.1=BP~1, formula.2=~age, data = dtstudy, type="M01", ncpus = 1, + family="gaussian") > summary(fit1) Change point model threshold.type: hinge Coefficients: est Std.

They are similar, but the linear-spline is missing a key piece. The linear-spline term, called age_slope_change in the original question, is equivalent to an interaction between age_bin and age (after centering age on the inflection point). Recall that an interaction model is generally of the form: $Y = \beta _1X + \beta _2M +\beta _3XM + \epsilon$ This makes it clear that what is missing from the linear spline model is the term $\beta _2M$ - i.e., age_bin . That is, it does not model differences in the average outcome between the two groups. So if your question is "Does the slope change after the inflection point?" then the linear spline model is actually prone to false-positives!
