As mentioned here : Using TryGetValue() without locking is not safe. The dictionary is temporarily in a state that makes it unsuitable for reading while another thread is writing the dictionary. A dictionary will reorganize itself from time to time as the number of entries it contains grows. When you read at the exact time this re-organization takes place, you'll run the risk of finding the wrong value for the key when the buckets got updated but not yet the value entries. UPDATE: take a look at "Thread Safety" part of this page too.
