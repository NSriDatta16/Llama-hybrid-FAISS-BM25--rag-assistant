We've just been doing this sort of work non-stop lately and the approach we've taken is to have a look-up table or alias list. If you can discount misspellings/misheard/non-english names then the difficult part is taken away. In your examples we would assume that the first word and the last word are the forename and the surname. Anything in between would be discarded (middle names, initials). Berry and Bernard would be in the alias list - and when Tsakala did not match to Berry we would flip the word order around and then get the match. One thing you need to understand is the database/people lists you are dealing with. In the English speaking world middle names are inconsistently recorded. So you can't make or deny a match based on the middle name or middle initial. Soundex will not help you with common name aliases such as "Dick" and "Richard", "Berry" and "Bernard" and possibly "Steve" and "Stephen". In some communities it is quite common for people to live at the same address and have 2 or 3 generations living at that address with the same name. The only way you can separate them is by date of birth. Date of birth may or may not be recorded. If you have the clout then you should probably make the recording of date of birth mandatory. A lot of "people databases" either don't record date of birth or won't give them away due to privacy reasons. Effectively people name matching is not that complicated. Its entirely based on the quality of the data supplied. What happens in practice is that a lot of records remain unmatched - and even a human looking at them can't resolve the mismatch. A human may notice name aliases not recorded in the aliases list or may be able to look up details of the person on the internet - but you can't really expect your programme to do that. Banks, credit rating organisations and the government have a lot of detailed information about us. Previous addresses, date of birth etc. And that helps them join up names. But for us normal programmers there is no magic bullet.
