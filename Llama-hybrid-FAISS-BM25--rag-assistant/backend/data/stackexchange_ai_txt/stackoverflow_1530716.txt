To make all lines taller , to look the same as the line with the superscript, define a larger line-height for the entire paragraph or whatever value gives the effect you desire. It may look strange, but that's how you described your requirements. EDIT: In order to make all lines look the same when only one needs more vertical space than the others , ALL lines in the paragraph will have to be taller. This, as I said, may not an attractive solution. Maybe something can be done with a span making just the text with the sub/superscript smaller , apart from that I don't believe what you want can be achieved. But I'd like to see someone else's solution. EDIT2: Incidentally, I've tried a small html file containing line-height p { line-height : 1.5em; width : 25em; } Mary had a little lamb, its fleece 1 was white as snow, and everywhere that Mary went, the lamb 2 was sure to go. And the lines are all the same height in FF3.0.14 and Konqueror (I can't speak for other browsers)
