After a couple more days of thinking about the problem, I have two tentative answers. Select theta so that the transformed data is close to normal as measured by goodness of fit. For example choose theta to maximize the p-value of the Shapiro-Wik test. set.seed(1) x Maximum likelihood estimation of theta. Looking at the paper by Burbidge et al. I think the likelihood function for a single variable can be expressed as follows. IHS.loglik In both cases we get close to the expected theta, which is encouraging. But when I try the maximum likelihood approach on my real data it doesn't seem to give reasonable answers.
