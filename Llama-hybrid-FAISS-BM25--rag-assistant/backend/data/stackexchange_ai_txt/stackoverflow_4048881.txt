Jixed Bar Too Horozontally

Hi everyone I am currently doing a chat application and I saw jixedbar which is very suitable to manage multiple chat windows. Unfortunately, when there are too many divs within the jixedbar container element, it hides the additional chat titles with overflow-x: hidden (default jixedbar). I was wondering whether there's an elegant solution to get around this problem.
