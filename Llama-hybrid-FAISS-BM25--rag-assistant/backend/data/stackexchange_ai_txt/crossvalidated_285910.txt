Such guidelines exist, but either the odds ratio (OR) or the relative risk (RR) is fine. You only have to be sure that you interpret either one correctly. This is the advice given by Schmidt & Kohlmann (See below). Given that the relative risk is more intuitive, then it may be more advisable to use it. At least, this is the advice given by Deeks (See below). Deeks recommends the odds ratio only when it is obtained from case-control studies and logistic regression analysis. Additionally, the CI would be much better at communicating the uncertainty about the effect than using a p -value. Both are analogous either way. An additional outcome of interest for you could be the Number Needed to Treat, which is calculated from the absolute risk. In your situation using the 5% and 7% values you posted, one would need to treat ~50 people to reduce incidence by 1 person. This tool calculates all 4 metrics given the 2x2 contingency table, and returns confidence intervals using a variety of methods. It makes use of the epitools R package .
