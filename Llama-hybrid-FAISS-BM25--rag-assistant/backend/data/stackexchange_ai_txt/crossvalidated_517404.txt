In addition to LÃ©o's answer it can even be 'dangerous' to remove duplicates. Imagine you want to explore a dataset describing a problem for machine learning to see if there is any correlation between the features and the labels: If you remove the duplicates in the feature space, tsne has a higher chance to create clusters with specific labels. But if there is no correlation between features and labels (i.e. the same feature-combination can result in different labels) this may tric you into thinking there is a correlation because these duplicate points were removed and your tsne-plot will look 'cleaner'.
