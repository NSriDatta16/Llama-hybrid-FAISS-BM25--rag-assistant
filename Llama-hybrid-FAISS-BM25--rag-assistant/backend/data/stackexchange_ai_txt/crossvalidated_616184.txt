The first step in computing the SD is to compute the difference between each value and the mean of those values. You don't know the true mean of the population; all you know is the mean of your sample. Except for the rare cases where the sample mean happens to equal the population mean, the values will tend to be closer to the sample mean than to the true population mean. So the sum of the square of those differences will be smaller (and can't be larger) than what it would have been had you used the true population mean in the first step. To make up for the underestimation of the sum-of-squares, when calculating the average squared difference (the variance), you need to divide by a value smaller than n. Why is the correct denominator n-1? If you knew the sample mean, and all but one of the values, you could calculate what that last value must be. Statisticians say there are n-1 *degrees of freedom.
