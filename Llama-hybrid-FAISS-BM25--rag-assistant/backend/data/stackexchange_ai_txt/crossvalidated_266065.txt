You say: I don't think using bootstrap error really address this problem as it captures the model variance rather than the data noise. However, it does! Your understanding of the bootstrap is mistaken. The bootstrap is a completely non-parametric method of estimating a parameter's error. Here non-parametric means that the concept of a "model" is (almost) completely irrelevant. The parameter $\theta$ can be conceived as a method of moments estimator which summarizes the first order (e.g. linear) trend of the $X, Y$ relationship. Note also that this means that the bootstrap does not require the actual relationship between $X, Y$ to be linear, it could be sinuousoidal, quadratic, logistic, even Heaviside. The line $\theta x$ is a linear approximation to that value. Now with regard to estimation of error: if the data are actually heteroscedastic in the sense that error depends on the X, then the constant, model based error is an X-averaged estimate of the overall error. That is, if the lower 50% of X has 0.25 SD and the upper 50% of X has a 4 SD, then the residual error has 1 SD. If you repeat the study again and again with X collected in a fixed design (so that each value of X is the same, but Y differs), then the 1 SD residual error is actually correct and the confidence intervals are of actual size. However, if X can vary, then occasionally you oversample high X leading to overlarge error estimation or oversample small X leading to too-small error estimation. The bootstrap appropriately accounts for random design by considering sampling from the empirical distribution of X, thus simulating random differences in the X design and incorporating their added error in the CI estimation. The bootstrap accounts for hetereoscedasticity. Of note, the sandwich error, also called the heteroscedasticity consistent (HC) error estimate has been found to be the "first order approximation" to the bootstrap. So these two estimators are related.
