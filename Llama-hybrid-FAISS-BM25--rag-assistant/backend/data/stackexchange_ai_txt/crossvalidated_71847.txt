Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) for large samples

The Bayesian information criterion is defined as $BIC = -2 \text{ln}(L) + k\text{ln}(n)$, where $L$ is the maximized likelihood of the data, and where $n$ is the sample size. In case of a huge sample size, BIC tend to $\infty$. Is there any transformation that needs to be done in order to compute the BIC for large samples? Thank you,
