From the documentation The optional argument of longtable controls the horizontal alignment of the table. The possible options are [c], [r] and [l], for centring, right and left adjustment, respectively. Normally centring is the default, but this document speciﬁes \setlength\LTleft\parindent \setlength\LTright\fill in the preamble, which means that the tables are set ﬂush left, but indented by the usual paragraph indentation.
