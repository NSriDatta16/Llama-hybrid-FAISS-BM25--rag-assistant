Linear Relationship between Variables using Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

I want to perform PCA. But one of the assumptions of PCA is that there has to be a linear relationship between all variables (83 of them). Do I have to do the scatter plot matrix (83x83 matrix) between variables to see either they have linear or nonlinear relationship and filter them out if they're not satisfied? Or are there any other ways to transform all the variables to linear? Thank you for reading this post
