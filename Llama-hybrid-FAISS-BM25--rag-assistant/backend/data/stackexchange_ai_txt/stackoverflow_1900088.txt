Issue with WPF DataBinding to XML file

I'm in the process of creating a message application in WPF, as part of this I have a listbox which shows all the messages currently avaliable with the authors Title and Name. Anyway I'm currently in the developing but the data I wish to show isn't appearing but the titles do (Author: and Title:). Please be aware my XML file is a test that I know works from another project I have seen online. Any help would be appreciated thanks. XAML for the Databinding and ItemsSource template: XML File: Data/MontereyJack.jpg The Captain loves his cheese, but hates milk. Data/DiscoFortuna.jpg He disco dances when he's not selling organic vacuum filters. Data/HuunkelFroobenhammer.jpg Huunkel designed a better mousetrap, but lost the blueprint.
