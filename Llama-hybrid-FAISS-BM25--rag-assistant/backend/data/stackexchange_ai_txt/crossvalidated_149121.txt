To answer the question in the last paragraph, yes, there is, which is to look at predictions of the dependent variable given whatever values of the predictors you're interested in. The virtue of this approach is that it's agnostic to how you coded the predictors*, so you don't have to worry about contrast coding or the interpretation of coefficients or the like. * Well, there are some coding decisions that can actually change the model's predictions, such as whether you combine multiple distinct values into a single predictor, but whether you use contrast coding, effects coding, or dummy coding, and how you apply these methods, are not such coding decisions. Not in plain linear regression, anyway. But if you're ever unsure whether something will change the model's predictions, just try it and see.
