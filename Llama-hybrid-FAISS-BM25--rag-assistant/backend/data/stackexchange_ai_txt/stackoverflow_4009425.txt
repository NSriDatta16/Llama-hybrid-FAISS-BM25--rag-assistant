I've been trying to implement this in an app of mine and I had to just give up. I subclassed UIImageview like you have as well(which is a good option) and all my images are on a UIView that is a subclass of UIScrollView . You can pass your viewcontroller to the images themselves and change which view the imageview is a subview to when it reaches a certain boundary (I overrided the touchesMoved on the ImageViews themselves). The problem with this is it doesn't drag continously. The user has to literally select the image again when they dragged the image across a certain point because you're literally switching the uiimageview from one view to another. I hope this gives you some insight at least, I really haven't found a solution to this issue. You'd think a lot of IPad apps would be paving the way to drag images all over different views and more tutorials appear on the issue!
