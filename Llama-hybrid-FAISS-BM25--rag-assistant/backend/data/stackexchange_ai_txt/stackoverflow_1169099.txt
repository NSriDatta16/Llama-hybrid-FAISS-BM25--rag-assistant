How do you concisely get the average house price from an array of houses?

Assuming the @houses array is set up as follows: house1.price = 10 house2.price = 20 house3.price = 30 @houses This is the starting point of our calculation and we want to find the average price of a house: total = 0 average = 0 for h in @houses total += h.price end average = total/@houses.size This seems like quite a lot of typing just to get an average. Is there a better way?
