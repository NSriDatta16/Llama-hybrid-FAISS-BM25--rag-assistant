Percentages as the response variable in GLMM (glmer), proportional binomial or not?

After looking through several questions on stackexchange, and even applying many of the suggested methods I have come to a point where I would like to have an expert's advice if the methods applied on my dataset are correct. This is for my master-dissertation and up untill 1,5 months ago I never worked with R. I studied the micro-habitat characteristics for the ovipostion of the Pyrgus Malvae butterfly. I measured several environmental variables as the percentage of the hostplant site area, more specifically with an example: the percentage of dwarf-shrub cover per host-plant site, or the percentage of wild-boar digging per hostplant site. Each site equals a circle with a radius of 25 cm with the hostplant in the center. For each occupied hostplant I selected a paired unoccupied hostplant. The test I chose to use is a GLMM ( glmer from the package lme4 ) since I want to account for several random effects such as the hostplant species ( HP_spp ), the date on which I measured these variables ( VS_Date ) and the pair number ( Pair_nr ) of each occupied and unoccupied hostplant pair. In the GLMM I want to use my environmental variables as the response variable and use Occupancy (0 = unoccupied = no egg found; 1 = occupied) as the independent variable to check for differences within each environmental variable between the two levels of occupancy. I have performed 3 different kind of glmer : I will use one of my variables as an example here: VS_G = vegetation structure grass = the percentage of grass cover within a hostplant site. 1) standard glmer with family = binomial Note: VS_G is expressed as a decimal (i.e. 0.7 for 70% grass cover) GLMMS106_VS_G_Occ with this test I obviously get the error message: Warning message: In eval(expr, envir, enclos) : non-integer #successes in a binomial glm! And a resulting p-value of: #R Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) #R (Intercept) -0.665 0.290 -2.293 0.021869 * #R Occupancy -2.574 0.777 -3.312 0.000925 *** 2) After looking up this error I found out I had to change my test since I am working with proportional data, so I applied 2 tests with the cbind command and the weights command: 2a) glmer with cbind Note: VS_G is expressed as a integer (i.e. 70 for 70% grass cover), I created VS_G_inv = 100-VS_G ; so in case of VS_G == 70 , then VS_G_inv == 30 . GLMMS106_VS_G_Occ Hooray! no error anymore however the p-value seems of: #R Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) #R (Intercept) -0.58302 0.22478 -2.594 0.00949 ** #R Occupancy -0.96390 0.04594 -20.982 2b) glmer with weights Note: VS_G is expressed as an integer (i.e. 70 for 70% grass cover) and VS_Weights was created (= 100 for each site) GLMMS106_VS_G_Occ Same result as the cbind test: #R Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) #R (Intercept) -0.58302 0.22478 -2.594 0.00949 ** #R Occupancy -0.96390 0.04594 -20.982 So after discussing this with my supervisors I found out that via using the cbind or weights command my sample size is increased by a factor 100 in this case. This in it's turn results in these very low p-values. So now I am wondering if the first test is ok to use after all?
