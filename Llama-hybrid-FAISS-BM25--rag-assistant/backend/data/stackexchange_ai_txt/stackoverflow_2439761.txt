Every new instance of a PHP script "forgets" everything done in previous scripts. The usual way of establishing a "storage room" for data across page loads is sessions. A session is essentially a specific ID a user gets when visiting a page. That ID is stored in a cookie, or a GET variable that is appended to every URL. PHP keeps text files in a special directory that can contain session specific data. Every file is named using the session ID. The PHP manual has a thorough introduction here. pageone.php session_start(); $_SESSION["name"] = "Bob", pagetwo.php session_start(); echo $_SESSION["name"]; // Bob Now if you had an instantiated object, you could serialize it, store it in a session variable, and unserialize it back in the 2nd page. I don't think that can be done with static classes though. But this should be a good start.
