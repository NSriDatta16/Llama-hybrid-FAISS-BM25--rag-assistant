Questions Regarding Tabular Data and Implementing Machine Learning Methods on it

I have a .csv data set (N = 140) that I want to perform analysis on. Specifically, I want to find a relationship between the .csv's "P" (Predictor) cells and the "T" (Target) cells (pictured below). T_Summed is simply the sum of the T cells and P_Avg is simply the average of the P cells. An observation containing these values is pictured below. Using R, nearly every combination of running the P's against the T's (one variable against another) leads to a scatter plot that looks like this: Some of them have slightly more randomness/spread, but all of them had at least some data points with the 'vertical' shape shown in the plot above. My issue lies in the fact that I have extremely minimal knowledge of statistics or data analysis, so I do not know how to run an appropriate model that will fit a plot of this shape, how to validate it, and, if using a model with multiple independent variables, how to visualize it. The only things I know how to do are run a simple linear model, a multiple linear model (don't know how to visualize this), and a potentially misused k-folds cross validation. Here's an example of how I created one of the linear models in question with repeated k-folds cross validation: ex I am afraid that my lack of knowledge in statistics will lead me to search around the internet and almost arbitrarily implement solutions that I have little understanding of, thus making my analysis faulty, inaccurate, or misleading. Due to this, I decided to consult the statistics StackExchange with a few questions: Is the code block above, at least for a linear model, an acceptable way of using repeated CV? What alternative models should I possibly begin to explore for this data? How might I go about learning about how to implement them properly? Models with multiple IVs appear to me to be difficult to plot. If anyone has a suggestion for question number 2. that involves multiple IVs, how might I go about plotting them so that they are interpretable? Another question regarding multiple IV models: I do not know how to use feature selection. If anyone has a suggestion for number 2., how would you go about selecting features for your suggestion? I very much appreciate any support. Thank you
