dojo drag and drop: how to add handler for drop event

I have a simple list like this: item 1 item 2 item 3 And I use the dojo attributes to make the list sortable. It works without any problems, but how do I add a listener to the event when an item is dropped? If the user releases the mouse and the element snaps in place I want a javascript function to handle this event. How can I add it via markup?
