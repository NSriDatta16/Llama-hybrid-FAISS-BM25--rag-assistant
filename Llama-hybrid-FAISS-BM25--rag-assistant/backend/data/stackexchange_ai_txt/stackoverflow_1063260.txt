Get earliest timestamps for user's cards in a mysql data table

I have a database of users and a database of cards. The users see the cards repeatedly. I kept a record of every time the users saw the cards and how long they looked at the card. Now that I've got that data, I want to analyze it by considering the first time that each user looked at each card. I got a list of the average msToAnswer for each card from this code: SELECT `username`, AVG( `msToAnswer`) FROM `usercardinfo` WHERE `timeStamp` between '2009-04-01' and '2009-06-01' GROUP BY `username` Now I need a list of the earliest msToAnswer for each card. Each card has a distinct name.
