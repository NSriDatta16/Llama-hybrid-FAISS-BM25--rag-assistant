Hypergeometric, binomial, or something else for enrichment analysis of potentially shared molecular barcodes between groups?

I need to analyze three samples of molecular barcodes, two from blood and one from tissue. My question is which of the two blood samples is more similar to the tissue in terms of molecular barcodes. The number of unique barcodes in sample BLOOD-A is 3,000, in sample BLOOD-B is 20,000, and in TISSUE is 10,000. The differences between numbers of unique barcodes has no biological meaning, it's just related to the abundance of the speciment. "Unique" means that duplicated barcodes within group have already been deleted. However, between groups barcodes can be shared (so unique within but not between groups). Actually, it is the degree of overlap between blood and tissue barcodes that will ultimately determine similarity. The overlap between BLOOD-A and TISSUE is 1,000 barcodes. The overlap between BLOOD-B and TISSUE is 2,000 barcodes. Obviously, BLOOD-A is more similar to TISSUE because 33% of its barcodes are also found in tissue. Conversely, for BLOOD-B only 10% of barcodes are shared with TISSUE. However, due to different sample abundances, note that the total number of unique barcodes in TISSUE (10,000) is only half of that in BLOOD-B (20,000), which means that, in principle, I couldn't get more than 50% BLOOD-B barcodes overlapping to TISSUE. Conversely, for BLOOD-A I could get up to 100%, in principle. Also, note that some barcodes in TISSUE may not be found in either BLOOD-A or BLOOD-B, some may be found in both, and some may be found in only one of the two. I am getting a bit lost here to come up with a reasonable way to test whether BLOOD-A is significantly more similar to TISSUE than BLOOD-B. It looks like an enrichment analysis problem, but I excluded the hypergeo distribution because barcodes may be found in both BLOOD-A and BLOOD-B. Does anybody have any idea? Thanks in advance for any help! Roberto
