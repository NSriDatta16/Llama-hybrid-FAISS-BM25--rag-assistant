What you need to do is to incorporate day-of-the-week , changes in day-of-the-week effects , level shift effects , local time trends , specific days-of-the-month efffects, weekly effects, monthly effects, week-of-the-month effects , pre, contemporay and lag effects of holidays/events, ARIMA memory , long-weekend effects as needed while dealing with anomalous one-time effects and possible error variance effects . Take a look at http://www.autobox.com/cms/index.php/afs-university/intro-to-forecasting/doc_download/53-capabilities-presentation for some material on daily modelling. For example just yesterday I was reviewing some output for a daily series analysis that you may find interesting. If you wish to post your data in a single columnn csv file with starting date and country , I will try and take a look at it to help you sort out what can be done. In my opinion your well-intended but ad hoc piecemeal approach is just not going to provide you with a meaningful analysis. You can send your data directly to me in case you can't post it to the group. It would be better to post your data and give other readers an opportunity to feel your pain as you attempt to extract information by identifying a model. EDITED AFTER ANALYSIS OF DATA Since only 365 days was available no monthly effects. weekly effects , holiday effects , long-weekend effects et. al. could be identified .. I used one of my favorite toys (AUTOBOX which I helped to develop) and obtained what appears to be a very reasonable model. I plotted the data (365 daily values for 1 year) and AUTOBOX presented the ACF of the original series visually suggesting non-stationarity. AUTOBOX conducted a fairly exhaustive search process and concluded that the dominant model for this data include two trends and a day 1 effect . Note that this was done in a totally automatic way and uses heuristics crafted over some 48 years of development. It further found that day1 was both consistently unusual but also periodically inconsistent and constructed pulse (0/1) series to remedy the resultant inconsistancy. The final model yielded an Actual/Fit and Forecast graph and a graph of the forecasts here The FIXED_EFF variables reflect day-of-the week indicators where apparently DAY2 ( by it's omission )is not different from the overall average where DAY01,DAY03,DAY04,DAY05 and DAY06 are. The FIXED_DAY01 variable is a 0/1 variable with a "1" on day one of the month and a "0" elsewhere. This variable was not suggested by me but rather "discovered" by AUTOBOX. The two trend series I~T reflect the breeak in the overall trend at time period 42. The I~P variables reflect simple one-time pulses for a particualr day in the year. The model is presented here and partially here Thorough statsistical requires some validation that the model is sufficient thus we present a plot of the final residuals and the ACF of the model errors . All parameters are needed (statistically significant) and test for automatically selecting a power transform yielded negative results. Now as you requested .... you want a script to do these things write a script of your choosing to deteremine if there are trends or level shifts in your data write a script to determine what days of the month have a significant effect write a script to detect any anomalies/outliers for all time points write a script to generate a family of forecasts via monte carlo which will generate forecast distributions/confidence intervals to reflect the possibility of future anomalies arising Following is an example of the script that you can use to run AUTOBOX under R without you having to write the previous 4 scripts. 5) Move to the autoboxR directory. #setwd("C:/Users/jin/Desktop/Autobox/AutoboxR") setwd("~/autoboxR") Load the autobox library. library(autobox) Initialize the autobox package. autoboxInitPackage() #iErrorCode file=read.csv("saltlakedailyshipment.csv") file=file[,3] View(file) dim(file) length(file) Create a matrix with one column of file value #########################################frequency=7 demand Make the file as a autobox object. demand.autobox For the first forecast period For the second Forecast Period
