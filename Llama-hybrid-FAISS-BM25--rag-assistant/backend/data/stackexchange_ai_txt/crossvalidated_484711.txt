Logistic regression is a name for the whole model, i.e. linear estimator, logit link function (hence, logistic function is an inverse of it), and Bernoulli distribution as likelihood (maximizing it is equivalent of minimizing logistic loss). You need all the elements for it to be proper logistic regression. The above is standard definition is statistics, in machine learning the name is used in less formal fashion. Logistic loss needs bounded outputs, so you cannot use it without logistic function for the model. In machine learning, by default you just minimize loss, so the model may be changed to other model by switching the loss (e.g. to hinge). Moreover, in machine learning, the model may have other modifications, e.g. regularization, that are not a part of the standard statistical model.
