The elegant and Pythonic way to do it is to encapsulate the idea of a range of dates in its own generator, then use that generator in your code: import datetime def daterange(start, end, delta): """ Just like `range`, but for dates! """ current = start while current prints: 2009-12-22 20:12:41.245000 2009-12-23 20:12:41.245000 2009-12-24 20:12:41.245000 2009-12-25 20:12:41.245000 2009-12-26 20:12:41.245000 2009-12-27 20:12:41.245000 2009-12-28 20:12:41.245000 2009-12-29 20:12:41.245000 2009-12-30 20:12:41.245000 2009-12-31 20:12:41.245000 2010-01-01 20:12:41.245000 2010-01-02 20:12:41.245000 2010-01-03 20:12:41.245000 2010-01-04 20:12:41.245000 2010-01-05 20:12:41.245000 2010-01-06 20:12:41.245000 2010-01-07 20:12:41.245000 2010-01-08 20:12:41.245000 2010-01-09 20:12:41.245000 2010-01-10 20:12:41.245000 This is similar to the answer about range , except that the built-in range won't work with datetimes, so we have to create our own, but at least we can do it just once in an encapsulated way.
