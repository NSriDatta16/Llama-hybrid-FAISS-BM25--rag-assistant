In short, no. The confidence interval for the effect of parity in high-volume hospitals depends on the covariance matrix from the model, which isn't retrievable from the summary output you've posted. Generally you can use standard post-model estimation functions in common statistical packages ( oddsratio statement in SAS, contrast function in R, lincom in Stata) to solve the interaction terms. There is another simple way to get confidence intervals for the effect of parity in the high volume. As you noted, the presented summary output has appropriate point estimates and confidence intervals for the low-volume hospital group in the effects labelled as "parity" (multipswoCS and multipswithCS lines in output.) The simple solution is to rerun the model with a reversed dummy variable for the high_volume_hospital variable (so that 0 is high volume, 1 is low volume.) Then the will give you the odds ratios for the effect of parity in the high volume hospital group (which you can confirm as per your calculation above will be 2.92... The odds [of CS for a woman with prior cesarean births] for a woman in a high volume hospital is 0.33 times [8.865]so OR = 2.92 (8.86*0.33). and the confidence intervals reported on the parity rows will be the appropriate confidence intervals for the high-volume hospital group. (Credit to Paul Allison's Logistic Regression Using SAS , which taught me this trick... in the first edition this is covered on pages 95-96. )
