I would complement "Places where you can store something" with "... for you and other people to retrieve it". Or maybe reword that as "Places where you can store a collection of related things for you and other people to retrieve them." The meaning is really that generic. In contrast, file system and database have more technical definitions: "In computing, a file system is a method of storing and organizing computer files and the data they contain to make it easy to find and access them". See the wikipedia entry . Database is a collection of logically related data structured in way that is easily accessed, managed, and updated.
