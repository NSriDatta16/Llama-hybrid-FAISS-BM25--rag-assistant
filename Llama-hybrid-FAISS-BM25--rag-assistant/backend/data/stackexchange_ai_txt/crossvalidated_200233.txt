If the interaction term is statistically significant or otherwise important based on knowledge of the subject matter, then an attempt to produce a "single odds ratio of 'Treatment A vs Treatment B'" is at best uninformative and at worst misleading. The point of the interaction term is that the effect of the treatment might depend on gender. If that is the case, then the "single odds ratio" however determined is going to depend on the gender balance in your sample. Averaging coefficients, as noted by others, is not reliable. With an interaction of treatment by gender, even repeating the analysis by omitting the gender and interaction terms would lead to results tilted in the direction of the more prevalent gender in your sample. I suppose you could try to ensure that the gender balance in the underlying population is taken somehow into account in your analysis, but that also would tend to hide the important information about the treatment by gender interaction. The best advice here would be to avoid reporting a single odds ratio and present separately the results for males and females.
