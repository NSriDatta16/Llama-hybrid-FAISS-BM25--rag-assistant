Not entirely sure that I've understood you correctly. I gather that you want to know if you should expose the collection (subclassing) or wrap it (have a private field). As Robert says, it really depends on the case. It's pretty much your choice. Nonetheless I'd say that in many cases the better choice is to not expose the collection because the constraints define the object you are modelling and are not fully congruent with the underlying collection. In short: users of your object shouldn't need to know that they are dealing with a collection unless it is really a collection with some speciality e.g. has all properties of a collection but allows only a certain number of objects.
