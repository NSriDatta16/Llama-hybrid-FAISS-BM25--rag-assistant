Thank you very much for your answers. I realized that I could not compare directly AIC models with different orders of integration. Unfortunately delete EMISSION no Capability to remove outliers. The problem is such that it is necessary to analyze more than 6,000 sales of the series at the beginning of each month. See graphics models is very difficult. Taking into account your advice. I have done so. 1. logarithmic time series. 2. Do auto.arima () with D = 0 and D = 1. I took the best models at D = 0 and D = 1. Then using RMSE metric to choose the best model. If D=0 RMSE=0.50 If D=1 RMSE=0.69 If D=1 it's best model! So do correctly? tts_l
