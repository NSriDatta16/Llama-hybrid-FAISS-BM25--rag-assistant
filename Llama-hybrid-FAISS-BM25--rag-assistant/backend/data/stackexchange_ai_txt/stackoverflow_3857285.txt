Microsoft Project Server - Must Haves

Question: What should I look for in a candidate for a position of EPM Consultant? Wiki says: Enterprise Project Management (EPM), in broad terms, is the field of organizational development that supports organizations in managing integrally and adapting themselves to the changes of a transformation. I know that it stands for ePM is enterprise project management; but these(ePM and Project Server) are two different things. EPM is a methodology, while Project Server is a tool, probably to implement that. But, I am not sure how does it relate to Microsoft Project Server? I have been tasked to hire an EPM Consultant for MS Project Server 2010. Thanks for sharing your thoughts, in advance :)
