You can compare the speeds of the successful and unsuccessful throws and do so with a design that recognizes pairing, but there are challenges you need to address. First, you may have missing data, as when one person misses all the throws. Second, the averages will have a smaller variance than individual throws, and the variance will be smaller when you average more throws. Different variances for different observations violates one of the assumptions for a t-test (paired or not). So, you might consider a non-parametric statistical test.
