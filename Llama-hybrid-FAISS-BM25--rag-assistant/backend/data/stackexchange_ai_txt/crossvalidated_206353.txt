Assume $\xi$ has uniform distribution on $[0, 1]$. Let event $A$ be an indicator for $\xi \in [0, 0.7]$, $B$ = $\xi \in [0.3, 1]$, and $G$ be $\xi \in [0.2, 0.8]$ From simple geometric arguments it follows that $P(G | A) = 5/7$ and $P(G | B) = 5/7$, while $P(G|A, B) = 1$ (obviously if $\xi$ is both greater than 0.3 and lesser than 0.7, then it's definitely falls into $[0.2, 0.8]$ Now how can one arrive at that? Note that $P(G|A)$ can be written in terms of $P(G|A, B)$: $$ P(G|A) = P(G, B|A) + P(G, \neg B|A) = P(G|A, B) P(B | A) + P(G|A, \neg B) (1 - P(B | A)) $$ So $P(G|A)$ is just an average of $P(G|A, B)$ and $P(G|A, \neg B)$ with weight $P(B | A)$. By manipulating this value you can control the position of $P(G|A)$ on a range $$[\min(P(G|A, B), P(G|A, \neg B)), \max(P(G|A, B), P(G|A, \neg B)) ]$$ This suggests that unless the dependence between $A$ and $B$ is deterministic (that is, $P(B|A)$ is 0 or 1), $P(G| A, B)$ would be greater than $P(G|A)$ alone (assuming both $A$ and $B$ "work" in favor of $G$).
