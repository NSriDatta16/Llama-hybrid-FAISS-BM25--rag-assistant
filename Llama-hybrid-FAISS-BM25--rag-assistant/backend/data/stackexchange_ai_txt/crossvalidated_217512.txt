Trouble in ERGODIC Markov chain

I don't fully understand ergodic . And I have trouble in this problem(21.8) from book introduction to information retrieval . Consider a Markov chain with three states A,B and C, and transition probabilities as follows. From state A, the next state is B with probability 1. From B, the next state is either A with probability $P_{A}$,or state C with probability $1-P_{A}$. From C the next state is A with probability 1. For what values of $P_{A} \in [0,1]$ is this Markov chain ergodic? I thought that I can construct the matrix and compute the probability many times. And if the result matrix is stable and no-zero. But I guess this method is not so good. Thanks.
