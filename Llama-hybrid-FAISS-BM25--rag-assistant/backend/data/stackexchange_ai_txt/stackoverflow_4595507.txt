You could try Select * from some_table order by some_column asc This will sort the results by some_column and place them in ascending order. Use desc instead of asc if you want descending order. Or did you mean to have the ordering in the physical storage itself? I believe it's possible to specify the ordering/sorting of an indexed column in storage. It's probably closest to what you want. I don't usually use this index sort feature, but for more info see: http://www.stanford.edu/dept/itss/docs/oracle/10g/server.101/b10759/statements_5010.htm#i2062718
