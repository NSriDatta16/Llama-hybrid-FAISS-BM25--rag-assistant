Part I. No: Linearity is one example of monotonicity . A monotonic relationship between $Y$ and $X$ means " $Y$ never decreases as $X$ increases, but only increases or remains constant" (for positive monotonicity), or " $Y$ never increases as $X$ increases, but only decreases or remains constant" (for negative monotonicity). A positive linear relationship between $Y$ and $X$ fits the former relationship, and a negative linear relationship between $Y$ and $X$ fits the latter. While we cannot validly infer that "monotonicity implies linearity" in precisely the same way that we cannot infer that "food implies apples," we can infer that "linearity implies monotonicity" in the same way that "apples imply food." Correspondingly, a lack of monotonicity implies a lack of linearity, but a lack of linearity does not imply a lack of monotonicity. Part II. Pearson's $r$ is a fragile measure of linearity Pearson's $r$ is subject to particular assumptions in order to produce estimates which have reliable interpretations. For example, violation of the homoscedasticity assumption (familiar from linear regression) can produce more or less any value of $r$ in uncorrelated data (i.e. in data with no linear, and no monotonic relation) with the simple addition of a high leverage data point which is (1) an extreme value in the $X$ dimension, and (2) has a value of $Y$ for that extreme value of $X$ including some non-zero slope on the linear regression between $Y$ and $X$ . In this way, you can obtain an arbitrarily strong (and invalid) estimate of linearity, with an arbitrarily weak Spearman's $r_{\text{S}}$ .
