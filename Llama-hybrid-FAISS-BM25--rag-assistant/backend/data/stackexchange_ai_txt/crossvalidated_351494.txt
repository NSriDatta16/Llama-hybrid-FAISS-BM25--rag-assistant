Multiple classifier comparison with Bayesian statistics

I've been recently working on some classifier comparisons. I've come to realize, the critical distance diagrams introduced $\approx$ 10 years ago might not be the most relevant solution for this problem. Statistical Comparisons of Classifiers over Multiple Data Sets Are there any Python-based packages which solve multiple classifier comparisons via Bayesian sampling?
