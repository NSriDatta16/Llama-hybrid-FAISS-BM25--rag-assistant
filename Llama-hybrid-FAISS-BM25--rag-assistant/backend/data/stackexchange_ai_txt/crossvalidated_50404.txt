Bayesian Inference Notation Confusion

In Bayesian Inference the following notation is quite common: $P(H|D) = \frac{P(D|H)P(H)}{P(D)}$ where $D$ is data and $H$ is hypothesis. Moreover $P(D)$ is represented as total probability. $P(D) = \sum P(D|H)P(H)dH$ However in my opinion notation seems to be quite sloppy. It is confusing on two fronts: 1) In order for this to work H should be a partitioning of sample space of $D$ by definition of total probability. But if you look at this point of view, let's say $D\sim N(m,v)$ then its sample space is $-\infty$ to $\infty$. I don't see why a hypothesis should partition this sample space, and what is that partition exactly? Let's say that my hypothesis is $D \sim N(m',v)$. In reality there should be a selector function behind the scenes, but I cannot really put my finger on it. 2) I think that distribution of $D$ is independent of what I select as a hypothesis, because my selection doesn't have the power to change reality. Therefore $P(D|H) = P(D)$. And inference cannot be done. My interpretation is that in reality the notation is trying to partition a sample space of hypotheses. But how that should be properly written in a rigorous notation I don't know. Or my interpretation is wrong. Any help appreciated.
