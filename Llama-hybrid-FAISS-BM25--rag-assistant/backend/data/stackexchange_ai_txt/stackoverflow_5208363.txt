The problem lies in the naming of your partial file. Rails tries to be clever with partials and automagically exposes a local variable that shares the same name as the partial's file name. It does this because the most common use-case for partials to to bind an HTML fragment to an instance of something, ie: # the following is treated as: render :partial => "frobs", :collection = @frobs render @frobs Then, within your _frob.html.erb partial, you have a variable named frob which references the current instance from @frobs In your case, this is colliding with the flash method exposed by ActionView : a local variable will always trump a method name. Try re-naming your partial to something else (ie, flash_message), keeping the content the same and see if that works.
