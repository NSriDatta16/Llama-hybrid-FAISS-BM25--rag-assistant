B-trees are intended for page-based systems, where a given node fits into a page. To find an entry in a B-tree, it is only necessary to load in one page at a time, so you can do that. Even updating them doesn't require a large number of pages being in memory at the same time - I imagine the most difficult operation is a delete when nodes are being reorganised, but if it's implemented carefully even that could be done with relatively few pages in memory.
