Adding the input layer - units with a decimal

I took the course Machine Learning A-Z from Udemy and am trying to apply what I learned in the tutorials. Theye taught us in the "Adding the input layer" portion of an ANN that the units is based off of the input_dim. Normally the "units = (input_dim + 1) / 2". In the dataset that I am working with my input_dim=754. (754 + 1) / 2 = 377.5. Should I use 377.5 or should I round up or down to a whole number? #Adding the input layer and the first hidden layer classifier.add(Dense(units=377.5, kernel_initializer='uniform', activation='relu', input_dim=754))
