Maybe you could print your model_xgb.objective to check if it's the default one inferring from your input -- 'binary:logistics', if this is the case, and considering these two posts: https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/issues/5621 https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/issues/3892 when you use a custom loss function with objective='binary:logistics', then you needn't do preds = 1.0 / (1.0 + np.exp(-preds)) in the udf loss function .
