Since the Blackberry API does not have support for file sharing you are basically talking about writing a SMB or NFS client (depending on the flavour of the shared storage you want to access). Unless you've already done this kind of programming, you are probably better off to seek out an existing solution; the Blackberry API isn't the arena I would recommend learning advanced network programming in.
