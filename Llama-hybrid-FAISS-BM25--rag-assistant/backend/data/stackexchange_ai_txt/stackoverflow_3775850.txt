You've missed the "different objects from the same server" part from the same paragraph . Since you have "Single instancing" you get a separate server for each COM object instance, so calls to those instances can be processed in parallel and COM will not have to provide any mutual exclusion. Think of it this way. Threading models are there to provide thread safety - synchronized access to data shared between threads of the same process. You have one object per process, so there's no two threads will try to access the same object unless of course you try to pass a pointer to one object into another object method call.
