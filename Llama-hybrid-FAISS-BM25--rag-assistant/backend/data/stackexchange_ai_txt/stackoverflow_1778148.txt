Instead of using LWP::Simple , use LWP::UserAgent directly. For a starting point, look at how LWP::Simple::getstore initializes a $ua and invokes request. You'll want to call $ua->add_handler to specify a response_data handler to do whatever you want; by default (at least for the HTTP protocol) LWP::UserAgent will be reading up to 4Kb chunks and call the response_data handler for each chunk, but you can suggest a different size in the request method parameters. You may want to specify other handlers too, if you want to differentiate between header data and actual data that will be stored in the file or do something special if there are redirects.
