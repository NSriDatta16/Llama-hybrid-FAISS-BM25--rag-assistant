With the help of the comments on my above posted question I can narrow down to using confidence intervals for what I think should suffice the difference in the mean that I am trying to project. However, this statement is not from a very informed statistician. The graph above shows two forms of protein structures that are being simulated. X axis shows the amino acid positions in the protein and Y axis shows average root mean square fluctuation over 20 replicates. Error bars shows Confidence Intervals (CI) with a 95% confidence level, which I think means that the mean of the entire population lies within Â±CI of the sample mean. So the amino acid positions for which error bars are not overlapping have significant different fluctuations. I calculated the CIs using =CONFIDENCE(0.05,SD,20) command in LibreOffice. I hope it sounds reasonable?
