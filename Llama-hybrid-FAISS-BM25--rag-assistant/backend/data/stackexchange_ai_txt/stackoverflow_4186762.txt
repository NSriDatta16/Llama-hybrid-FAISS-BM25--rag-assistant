Watchdog-Timers in Java are not a simple thing, since threading is cooperative. I remember that in one project we just used Thread.stop() although it is deprecated, but there was no elegant solution. We didn't face any issues using it, though. A good example for a Java Watchdog implementation: http://everything2.com/user/Pyrogenic/writeups/Watchdog+timer
