If we pull back from today's emphasis on machine learning and recall how much of statistical analysis was developed for controlled experimental studies, the phrase "independent variables" makes a good deal of sense. In controlled experimental studies, the choices of a drug and its concentrations, or the choices of a fertilizer and its amounts per acre, are made independently by the investigator. The interest is in how a response variable of interest (e.g., blood pressure, crop yield) depends on these experimental manipulations. Ideally, the characteristics of the independent variables are tightly specified, with essentially no errors in knowing their values. Then standard linear regression, for example, models the differences among values of dependent variables in terms of the values of the independent variables plus residual errors. The same mathematical formalism used for regression in the context of controlled experimental studies also can be applied to analysis of observed data sets with little to no experimental manipulation, so it's perhaps not surprising that the phrase "independent variables" has carried over to such types of studies. But, as others on this page note, that's probably an unfortunate choice, with "predictors" or "features" more appropriate in such contexts.
