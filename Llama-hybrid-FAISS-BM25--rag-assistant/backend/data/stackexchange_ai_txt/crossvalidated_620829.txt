Harrell's online Regression Modeling Strategies discusses this matter in Section 5.3.6, a section evidently added since the second edition of the print version (Springer, 2015). In general, he does recommend separate bootstrap validation of the m models developed on each of the m multiply imputed data sets to start. That gives you m estimates of the set of model-performance values. Then average the model-performance values over the m models. In versions of the rms package starting with 6.6-0 (released a few months ago), there is a processMI() function to simplify this. The online link above contains an example of an ordinary least squares model, working through the imputation, the fits to the multiple data sets, and the bootstrap validation.
