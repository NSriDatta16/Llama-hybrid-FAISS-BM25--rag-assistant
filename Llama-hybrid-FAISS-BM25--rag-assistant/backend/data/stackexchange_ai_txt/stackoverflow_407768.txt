I have plenty of things in my class library which I share between projects: IoC container and dependency injection framework A full controller/observer framework, allows me to separate UI code from backlogic code A reasonable database-independent set of classes for executing SQL, takes care of some of the syntax differences, mainly function names Lots of other helper classes and utility methods for dealing with data Some standardized internal storage classes, like Tuple etc. Some custom collections, like Set , Heap , as well as plenty of utility methods for dealing with various types of collections The class library is added to when I need more stuff.
