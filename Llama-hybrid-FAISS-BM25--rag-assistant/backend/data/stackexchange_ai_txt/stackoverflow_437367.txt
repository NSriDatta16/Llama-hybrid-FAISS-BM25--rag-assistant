Performance counter for "Largest free region"?

I'm debugging an out-of-memory exception. When I get the exception, the "virtual bytes" performance counter indicates plenty of addressable space. The problem, however, is that the addressable space is badly fragmented, and the "Largest free region" (returned from !address in WinDbg) is too small. To measure the memory fragmentation, I would like to monitor the "Largest free region" in perfmon. Is there a performance counter that gives me this value?
