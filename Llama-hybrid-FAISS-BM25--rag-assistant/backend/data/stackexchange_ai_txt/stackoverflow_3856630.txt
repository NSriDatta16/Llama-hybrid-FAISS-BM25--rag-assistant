How to separate words in a "sentence" with spaces?

Background Looking to automate creating Domains in JasperServer. Domains are a "view" of data for creating ad hoc reports. The names of the columns must be presented to the user in a human readable fashion. Problem There are over 2,000 possible pieces of data from which the organization could theoretically want to include on a report. The data are sourced from non-human-friendly names such as: payperiodmatchcode labordistributioncodedesc dependentrelationship actionendoption actionendoptiondesc addresstype addresstypedesc historytype psaddresstype rolename bankaccountstatus bankaccountstatusdesc bankaccounttype bankaccounttypedesc beneficiaryamount beneficiaryclass beneficiarypercent benefitsubclass beneficiaryclass beneficiaryclassdesc benefitactioncode benefitactioncodedesc benefitagecontrol benefitagecontroldesc ageconrolagelimit ageconrolnoticeperiod Question How would you automatically change such names to: pay period match code labor distribution code desc dependent relationship Ideas Use Google's Did you mean engine, however I think it violates their TOS: lynx -dump «url» | grep "Did you mean" | awk ... Languages Any language is fine, but text parsers such as Perl would probably be well-suited. (The column names are English-only.) Unnecessary Prefection The goal is not 100% perfection in breaking words apart; the following outcome is acceptable: enrollmenteffectivedate -> Enrollment Effective Date enrollmentenddate -> Enroll Men Tend Date enrollmentrequirementset -> Enrollment Requirement Set No matter what, a human will need to double-check the results and correct many. Whittling a set of 2,000 results down to 600 edits would be a dramatic time savings. To fixate on some cases having multiple possibilities (e.g., therapistname) is to miss the point altogether.
