SQL Server Performance: Non-clustered Index + INCLUDE columns vs. Clustered Index - equivalent?

Hello SQL Server engine experts; please share with us a bit of your insight... As I understand it, INCLUDE columns on a non-clustered index allow additional, non-key data to be stored with the index pages. I am well aware of the performance benefits a clustered index has over a non-clustered index simply due to the 1 fewer step the engine must take in a retrieval in order to arrive at the data on disk. However, since INCLUDE columns live in a non-clustered index, can the following query be expected to have essentially the same performance across scenarios 1 and 2 since all columns could be retrieved from the index pages in scenario 2 rather than ever resorting to the table data pages? QUERY SELECT A, B, C FROM TBL ORDER BY A SCENARIO 1 CREATE CLUSTERED INDEX IX1 ON TBL (A, B, C); SCENARIO 2 CREATED NONCLUSTERED INDEX IX1 ON TBL (A) INCLUDE (B, C);
