Is CNN permutation equivariant?

If I use stacked CNN layers with 3x3 kernels, zero padding, and with no pooling layers, the output feature map will consist of feature vectors, each vector of which is related directly to the original 3x3 block of the input image, right? Therefore, for example, I could send the output feature map vectors as timesteps to LSTM and it would supposedly learn dependencies between clusters of the image given the image clusters have a temporal dependency.
