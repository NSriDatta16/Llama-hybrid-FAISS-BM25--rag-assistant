Ok this is more of a hack than anything else :) You normally under visual studio have 2 options: a) Exclude the duplicated DLLs or b) Set the Condition property of your duplicated DLLs to something different. Problem is that with both of these approaches, you are still gonna have them magically reset and get the warning like before.. What worked for us is the following solution: a) Go to your setup project and create a Custom Folder b) Set the DefaultLocation property of your custom folder to be the same as the one you need those DLLs to be placed. ie for ASP.NET applications the value is [TARGETDIR]\bin c) Then drag and drop ALL the duplicated dlls into this folder and you should get no warnings now. That's it. You should get no warnings for those dlls, if you have any extra just drag them into this folder. Hope this helps. -Konstantinos
