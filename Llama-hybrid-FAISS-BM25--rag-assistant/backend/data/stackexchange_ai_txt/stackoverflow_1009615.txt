How to detect when a Form is being dragged?

I have a Form object with a title bar displayed. I need a pure managed way(P/Invoke-free, both Mono and .NET compatible, preferrably a .NET 2.0 API) to detect when the FORM itself starts being dragged, changes location and when it is dropped(not any content). I did this in the past in Mono but I don't remember how anymore and I don't know if my solution was MS.NET-compatible... If anyone could provide an example, three event names for me to google more details or point me to a relevant StackOverflow question, I would greatly appreciate. So far, my search has returned no relevant results...
