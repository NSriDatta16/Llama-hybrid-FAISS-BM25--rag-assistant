How to capture HTTP packet with SharpPcap

I would like to capture all incoming HTTP packets of my machine. To do that I'm using SharpPcap which is a WinPcap wrapper. SharpPcap works very well but it captures TCP packets and this is too low level to do what I want. Does anyone know how can I easly get full HTTP requests/responses from all these TCP packets ? Thanks
