Linq skip first where (linq to objects)

I have the need to skip the first element that matches a predicate as a linq query. So far as I can tell the best I can do is something like this: var list = new [] {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}; var skippedFirstOdd = false; var skipFirstEvenNumber = list.SkipWhile(number => { if(number % 2 != 0) { skippedFirst = true; return true; } else { return false; } }); Which works (I think), but isn't very elegant. Is there a cleaner way to achieve this?
