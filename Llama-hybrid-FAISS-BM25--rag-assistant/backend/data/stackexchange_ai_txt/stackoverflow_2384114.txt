SQL: Show average and min/max within standard deviations

I have the following SQL table - Date StoreNo Sales 23/4 34 4323.00 23/4 23 564.00 24/4 34 2345.00 etc I am running a query that returns average sales, max sales and min sales for a certain period - select avg(Sales), max(sales), min(sales) from tbl_sales where date between etc But there are some values coming through in the min and max that are really extreme - perhaps because the data entry was bad, perhaps because some anomoly had occurred on that date and store. What I'd like is a query that returns average, max and min, but somehow excludes the extreme values. I am open to how this is done, but perhaps it would use standard deviations in some way (for example, only using data within x std devs of the true average). Many thanks
