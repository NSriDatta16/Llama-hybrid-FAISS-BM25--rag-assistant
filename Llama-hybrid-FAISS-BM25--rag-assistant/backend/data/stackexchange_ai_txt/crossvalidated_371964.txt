Since any would encompass either value for the categorical variable, this would still be a single dichotomous indicator variable and the results indicating any gender would be coded as missing values (i.e., as NA ). When conducting logistic regression with this as one of your explanatory variables, you can employ standard methods to handle missing data (e.g., multiple imputation or Bayesian methods). If gender is your response (which seems to be the case from the comments) then these data points are effectively useless, since there is no specified response.
