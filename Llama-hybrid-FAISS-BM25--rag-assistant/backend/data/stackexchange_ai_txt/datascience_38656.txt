Where to find state-of-the-art time series data deep learning approaches?

Just like this (which stopped updating) that shows the newest deep learning methods utilized in image recognition, is there some similar lists/summaries (in blog posts/paper/competitions etc.) about newest deep learning methods used in time series analysis?
