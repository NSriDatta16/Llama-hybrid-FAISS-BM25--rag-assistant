Can we force monotonicity for a subset of features in h2o gbms?

I was wondering if it's possible to force variables to be monotonic when building gbms in h2o? Ideally this would be enforced globally, although even the standard local constraint would be better than nothing. (example of my view of a local constraint : say that we want a variable x to be monotonically increasing -> if a tree is set to split using x but the resulting left average would be less than the resulting right average, then we don't make the split and move on to the next best candidate. Forcing monotonicity globally would be more involved - I only have a rough idea of how to do this and it could dramatically slow down the algorithm.) Thanks, Tom
