When I want to know the magnitude of an independent variable's relationship with my dependent variable, I would want to use a regression. This is one of the reasons that logistic regressions are still valuable statistical tools with neural networks. Though, if all you care about is being able to make a prediction, a neural network will outperform a traditional logistic regression model. Now, if you can make sense of all the weights and hidden layers and use that to tell me how independent variable X relates to dependent variable Y, my hat's off to you because that is no easy feat (untangling a neural net). When we want to talk about relationships rather than just making predictions, regressions are usually the way to go. In other words, it depends on what you are asking. If I wanted to predict whether or not a given student will pass a course in college, I would use a neural network model. If I wanted to know the relationship between passing a course and study time, I would use a regression model.
