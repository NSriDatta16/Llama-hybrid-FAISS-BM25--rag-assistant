Doesn't sound so bad to me, provided it meets the requirements. Are you trying to allow the customer to see and edit the queries? Are you trying to make it easier for development/testing? I certainly prefer this to embedding the queries in code. But there is a risk that this file will bloat with a myriad of slightly different queries (SORT ASCENDING, SORT DESCENDING, SUM(col1) + SUM(col2), SUM(col1) + SUM(col3), etc.)
