SVM-RFE is a embedded feature selection method because it training a classifier to get weights of features to rank them from highest to lower. However, it never gets feedback from classifier like wrapper models do. Therefore, it is a method between filter and wrapper to avoid computational complexity of wrappers and providing multivariate feature ranking in the concept of filter method.
