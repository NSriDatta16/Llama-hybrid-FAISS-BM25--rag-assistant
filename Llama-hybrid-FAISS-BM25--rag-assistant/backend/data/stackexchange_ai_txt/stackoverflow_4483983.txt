adding price rules to magento products

I'm trying to put some finishing touches to a magento project, but I have a problem. When adding products, I need to be able to add 3 vital pieces of information: wholesale cost of product - field available for that % discount on wholesaler list price delivery route (with price) chosen from a select list desired % profit margin Number 4 can be dealt with an extension I've purchased here: http://www.aitoc.com/en/magentomods_cost_based_pricing.html Problem is that the other two fields (2 and 3) I need to be able to factor in. Has anybody got any extensions that might be able to satisfy these criteria? Commercial extensions are fine!
