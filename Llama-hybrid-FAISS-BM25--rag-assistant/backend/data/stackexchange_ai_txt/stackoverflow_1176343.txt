Qt Creator, at least, uses an OTHER_FILES variable for .txt files and anything similar: OTHER_FILES += test.txt Adds "test.txt" to the "Project Files" pane in Qt Creator. If you want to group your files a bit, what you can try is adding a separate .pri file such as "External.pri", including your external files from there, and then including the .pri file in your .pro: Project.pro HEADERS += someclass.h SOURCES += main.cpp someclass.cpp ... include(External.pri) External.pri OTHER_FILES += license.txt todo.txt Which has the effect of creating a folder of sorts (called "External") in Qt Creator. If you have a bunch of external files it'll help keep things organized.
