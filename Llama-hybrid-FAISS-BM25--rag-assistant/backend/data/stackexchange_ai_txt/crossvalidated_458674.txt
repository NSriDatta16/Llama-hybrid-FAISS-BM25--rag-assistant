How to estimate a single AR model for multiple time series?

I have ACF of a time series data, I want to interpolate the ACF using AR model for which I need to calculate the coefficient of the AR model The problem is I have (6000x6000) matrix of ACF and I cant use individual sequence calculate the coefficients. Is there any method or algorithm available through which I can use a single model which can combine the information of all ACF to generate the coefficients of AR model? I have read a paper about the Burg algorithm for the segments of the data that effectively combines the data, but can I use that algorithm here for ACF?
