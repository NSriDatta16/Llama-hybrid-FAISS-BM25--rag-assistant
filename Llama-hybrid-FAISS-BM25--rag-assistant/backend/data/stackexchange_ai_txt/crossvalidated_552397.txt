Log transformation of input features for Random Forests and XGBoost

I have read articles mentioning that Random Forests and XGBoost does not require scaling or normalisation of features as decision trees identify thresholds or cut-points in the features. Is there any benefit to log transforming data in the event that my features comprise outliers, or does this not effect the thresholds or cut-points selected by Random Forests and XGBoost? Are the preparation of continuous features for Random Forests and XGBoost the same for classification and regression models?
