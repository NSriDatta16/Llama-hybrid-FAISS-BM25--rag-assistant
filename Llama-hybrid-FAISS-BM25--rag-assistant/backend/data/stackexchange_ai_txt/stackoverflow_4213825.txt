here is the association: catalog/product_compare_sidebar => /app/code/core/Mage/Catalog/Block/Product/Compare/Sidebar.php catalog/product_list => app/code/core/Mage/Catalog/Block/Product/List.php If you use eclipse PDT, just press Ctrl + Shift + T and type: *Catalog*Product_Compare_Sidebar to find the first class. UPDATE: Searching for "class Block " will give you all the available block types. If you use eclipse PDT, just press Ctrl + Shift + T and type: Block . The paragraph at the end of your link describes the most important one fairly well. Personnaly, I often create my own type and inherit from Mage_Core_Block_Template , or use it directly. UPDATE_2: In Mage_Core_Block_Abstract, you can see this method /** * Set block attribute value * * Wrapper for method "setData" * * @param string $name * @param mixed $value * @return Mage_Core_Block_Abstract */ public function setAttribute($name, $value=null) { return $this->setData($name, $value); } I think it must be called on each xml attribute somewhere. To know where, simply put a breakpoint here, or die here and look at the stack trace.
