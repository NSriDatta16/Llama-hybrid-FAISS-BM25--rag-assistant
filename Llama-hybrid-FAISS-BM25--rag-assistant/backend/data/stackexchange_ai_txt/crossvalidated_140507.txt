Expectation (covariance) between $X_j$ and $Y$ in logistic regression

Is there some way to explore the relationship of $E(X_jY)$ in a logistic regression? That is, $Y$ is a binary variable observed together with $p$-covariates $X$ (wlog centered). I am interested in calculating $E(X_jY) = {\rm Cov}(X_j,Y)$ for the $j$-th regressor but am helpless. We have $Y|X \sim {\rm Ber}(p(X))$ where $p(X) = \exp(\beta'X)/(1+\exp(\beta'X))$. Is there any way to calculate $E(X_jY)$?
