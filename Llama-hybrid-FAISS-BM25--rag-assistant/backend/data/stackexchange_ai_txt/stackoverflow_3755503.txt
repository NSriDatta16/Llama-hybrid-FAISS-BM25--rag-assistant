One of my coworkers did this. A nice feature of this concept was that you don't have a ton of POSTS whenever the user 'changes pages', since they are actually not ever changing a page until they submit their data for the final time. He did this for product registration software, which was nice. Our servers were only taking a hit when the user initially requested the page, and then when they submitted it. The major, MAJOR downside to this concept is that most web developers are not expecting this. My coworker (and you) have a cool idea - but unless it is well implemented, with comments, 100% valid HTML, and a host of other good design principles in place, it can be confusing since most web developers have basically never seen this done before. His site was a nightmare to work with, as he did not actually know what engineering web software meant, and it was all slapped together. My organization never pursued this (potentially useful) idea because his implementation was so poor. So, when I looked at this idea here were the trade-off I came up with: 1.) You cannot require any server-side interaction during intermediate pages. 2.) The initial page loading is longer, but there are no intermediate page requests (better optimization). 3.) This is vastly different than anything anyone usually does, which means you need to be especially careful with documentation. 4.) This design concept facilitates totally stand-alone web software to be easily deployed without the web. 5.) You might be increasing complexity for avoiding page loads, but maybe not. I'm not sure. All together, I think it just depends on what you want to accomplish. My coworker really just wanted to see if he could do it, which he could. However, how he did it was really pretty bad, to the point where everyone else connected his poor implementation with a poor idea it was fairly sad. Mostly, I think if you follow good web design practices this wouldn't be too bad of a thing to pursue. What are your goals though? I'm sorry I couldn't directly answer all of your questions. I hope my experiences are still helpful in answering if I think it is a bad idea or not. -Brian J. Stinar-
