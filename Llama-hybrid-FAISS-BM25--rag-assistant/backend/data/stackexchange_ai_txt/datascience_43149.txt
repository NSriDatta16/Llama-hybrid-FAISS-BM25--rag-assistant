If you want a good and solid start for deep learning, I would suggest to start with the book "Deep Learning" by Ian Goodfellow et al. After that you'll have a good base that you can expend by the many different tutorials, articles and courses available online. However, I would also add that before doing that, you should take some basic "machine learning" class (should be available at your University). Many people these days go straight to deep learning and implementing Neural networks because it is relatively easy, but than they lack the understanding to improve it or use it to its fullest potential.
