How to track config files of submodules in Git?

In Git, how can I organize work to track local config files of a library, which is a git submodule? In details: the library has normal files that are tracked, and default config files that are in it's folder, but not tracked, in order to avoid resetting or overwriting them (they're listed in .gitignore). All the files are in lib's folder or subfolders. I started tracking one of the projects, that use this lib, in Git too. Now there's a dilemma: if I make the lib in this project a submodule, I won't be able to track the config files (Git will ignore them, since they're in the submodule folder). tracking everything as a big project is a bad idea, as I understand. if I do track config files in the library, how can I avoid resetting them to default values? Do I make a branch in the working project and pull from master every time? Then, what if I edit the library and a config file in it? This must cause a merge conflict, doesn't it? I guess this is not new, but I couldn't find any advice. I'll appreciate learning from your experience guys.
