You are using "Info Gain" as the attribute to select your features. If you aren't certain whether that is accurate enough, I would try basic feature importance. If you are using a tree model, it should be built in. If you are using a Neural Network, use permutation feature importance. That way you can plot the importance, and decide to use the top N features. If you are interested in a particular class, you might want to calculate the feature importance of only that class' data points after training the model on the dataset as a whole. That way you can see which features are most correlated with the class of interest
