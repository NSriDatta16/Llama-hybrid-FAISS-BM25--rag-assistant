Eclipse Ganymede HTML editor incredibly slow when editing attributes

I recently upgraded to Eclipse Ganymede from Europa and now I'm finding that when I'm editing JSP files the IDE crawls when editing HTML attributes (but not JSP attributes). Has anyone experienced this, or have any suggestions? Also if you can point me to a better place to ask Eclipse related questions, do tell. Thanks!
