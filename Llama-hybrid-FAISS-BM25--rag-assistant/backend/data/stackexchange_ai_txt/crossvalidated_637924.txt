What's the difference between shift equivariance and translation equivariance in CNN?

In the context of convolutional neural networks(CNN), it is said that convolution operations are equivariant to translation / shift, as the weight-shared kernel scans over an image, i.e. if we move the image by one pixel, the output is also moved by one pixel (if we don't think about the abandoned edge of an image). However, some papers say "convolution operation is equivariant to translation ", while others say that "convolution is equivariant to shift ". What is the difference between these two terms? As I'm not a native speaker of English, I'm not sure when to use which. I Googled these words but I found no results for me to understand the difference. (Some say that convolution operation is invariant to shift/translation, but I don't think this expression is true as I think "invariance to operation X" means that the output does not change by operations X. Would you tell me if I get this wrong also on the term invariant/equivariant?)
