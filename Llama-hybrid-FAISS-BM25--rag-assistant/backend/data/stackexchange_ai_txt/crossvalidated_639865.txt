The question is asking about the procedure currently known as naive Bayes (with various alternate spellings). This is an entirely distinct issue from the provenance and naming of Bayes' Theorem. Checking the paper mentioned in dpritch's answer, they give a reference to the paper Kononenko, I. (1990). Comparison of inductive and naïve Bayesian learning approaches to a In Current trends in knowledge acquisition, Eds. B. Wielinga et al. Amsterdam Press IOS as the first mention of the term 'naïve Bayes'. Online searches show no mention of minor variations of that term before then. So 1990, is most likely the first appearance of the -term- 'Naive Bayes'. As to when the method first appeared, under any name, is a bit more murky. Russell and Norvig, Artificial Intelligence: a Modern Approach gives in its notes that the procedure had been used in pattern recognition since the 50's and explicitly in Robertson and Spark Jones (1976), Relevance weighting of search terms, Journal American Society for Information Science 27, 129-146. (but without naming it as naive Bayes). So TLDL, classification using multiple factors 'naively' or out of expedience assumed to be independent was probably started in the 50's, but that procedure didn't get the name 'Naive Bayes' until Kononenko 1990 which has references to prior art).
