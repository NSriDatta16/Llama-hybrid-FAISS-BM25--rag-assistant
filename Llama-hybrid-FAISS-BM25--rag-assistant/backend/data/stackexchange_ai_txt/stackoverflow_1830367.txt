You don't need the _ in your code. It should be: 'tasks/new' %> The first error is because you don't need to put the _ inside the :partial parameter. Rails takes care of that. That's why you get double __ because Rails will put one for you. The second error is your real problem. The error suggests that @task is nil. This is true because the partial only knows what the container view knows, and your view in that particular moment hasn't called the action from the proper controller. As you (Baby Diego) already found out and indicated in one of your comments below, you needed to create an instance of a Task in your partial. I don't know if there is a more elegant solution, but maybe someone can suggest something better in the future. Thanks to MattMcKnight for informing us that the partial itself does only know what the container view knows.
