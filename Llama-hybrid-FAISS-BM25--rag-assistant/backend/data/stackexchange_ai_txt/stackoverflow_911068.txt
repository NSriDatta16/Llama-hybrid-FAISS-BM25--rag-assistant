Mouse keys is a useless feature. First of all, while it emulates mouse movement, it doesn't allow right-clicking, and the ability to drag and drop instead of simply click doesn't function at all in my copy of XP. Also, you're limited to using the 5 numpad key for clicking (and supposedly the insert/delete keys, which aside from being far enough away from the num 5 to be a pain in the ass, are terrible keys to assign those functions to) which isn't at all convenient for a righty like me. And not to make a problem even more frustrating, even though its one word, "mousekeys" in all the windows literature, to find the drag/drop help article in their pathetic index requires searching for "mouse keys". Typical. I'm using Autohotkey, at least until I get Linux.
