How to disable drop on wpf webbrowser control

How can I disable dropping of files on a System.Windows.Controls.WebBrowser? From the documentation it would seem that this behaviour should be disabled by default as it is inherited from the UIElement.AllowDrop Property. However dy default I can drag and drop files on to a WebBrowser control. Further to this it seems I can't disable this supposedly none-default behaviour. For example if I explicitly set the value of the property to false in XAML ..and/or in code-behind, i.e. webBrowser1.AllowDrop = false; Then I can still drag and drop files onto the control. How can I disable this behaviour and remove the security risk it creates?
