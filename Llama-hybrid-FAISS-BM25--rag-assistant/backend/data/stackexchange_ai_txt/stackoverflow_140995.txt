Sql Server does a good job of managing statistics if you have enabled auto-create and auto-update of statistics (you should), so ignore the statistics recommendations. Take the indexes and analyze them to make sure you can handle the extra space requirements, and also make sure they aren't duplicating some other index that has similar columns. You can often consolidate indexes by just adding a column or two (paying attention to the order of columns) or by adding an included column (covering index). If the index is on a table with heavy OLAP use, you want to limit your indexes to maybe 5-10. For tables that rarely get inserts or updates (less than several per second), space limitations should be the only concern. The tuning wizard recommendations can be a great learning tool. Take the indexes, go back to the query plan and try to figure out why exactly the recommendation was made.
