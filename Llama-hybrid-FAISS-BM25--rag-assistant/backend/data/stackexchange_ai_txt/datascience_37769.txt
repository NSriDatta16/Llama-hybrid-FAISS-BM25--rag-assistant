You seek to augment the external validity of your model. The most common way of doing so is by applying k-fold cross-validation to verify that your model generalizes well on unseen data. In k-fold cross-validation, the original sample is randomly partitioned into k equal sized subsamples. Of the k subsamples, a single subsample is retained as the validation data for testing the model, and the remaining k âˆ’ 1 subsamples are used as training data. The cross-validation process is then repeated k times, with each of the k subsamples used exactly once as the validation data. The k results can then be averaged to produce a single estimation. This will reduce the variance of your model and will reduce its error on unseen data.
