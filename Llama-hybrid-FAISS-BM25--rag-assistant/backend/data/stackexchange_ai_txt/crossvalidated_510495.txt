How can I tune my Random Walk Metropolis Hastings algorithm on the fly?

I just have a very general question. I've recently started to use Random Walk Metropolis-Hastings (RWMH) to sample from a distribution in order to calculate integrals. But I've noticed that the efficiency of integral calculations is highly dependent on the standard deviation of the proposal distribution of my sampler. In my precise case, I'm sampling from a function which is defined as $p : \mathbb{R}^{d} \mapsto \mathbb{R}^{1}$ where $d$ is the dimensionality and I'm testing the accuracy of my integrals as I increase the dimensional of it (i.e. increase $d$ ). However, I've noticed that the performance severely decreases as $d$ increases, and after a brief reading of some literature it seems the 'optimal' scaling for a Gaussian proposal distribution follows $\sigma = 2.38*d^{-0.5}$ . However, I've noticed that changing the value of 2.38 to smaller values has helped my convergence. So, to conclude, is there a way to self-tune my proposal distribution on the fly? Perhaps adapting the value of 2.38 as I sample samples from my Markov Chain? Hopefully this question makes sense! And Thank you for any help in advance!
