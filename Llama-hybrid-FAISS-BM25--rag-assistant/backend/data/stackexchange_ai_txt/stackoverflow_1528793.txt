You need to remove the svn:eol-style property from your file. Subversion didn't care about line endings in your file until this property was added. To quote the subversion book : This means that by default, Subversion doesn't pay any attention to the type of end-of-line (EOL) markers used in your files. The book then goes on describing how you can make subversion care about the line endings by setting the svn:eol-style , which is exactly what you don't want.
