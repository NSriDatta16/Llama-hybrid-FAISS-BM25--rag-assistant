If your expression is really just returning a scalar value based on the presence of matching rows, that can be done inside your stored procedure without using a CTE: SELECT CASE WHEN ( EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM orgstruct.tOrgs AS orgs WHERE orgs.prnt = p_OrgID ) ) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END INTO p_exists FROM sysibm.sysdummy1 ; For more sophisticated queries that really do require CTEs, you also have the option of embedding the CTEs inside a user-defined function, and then calling the function from the stored procedure.
