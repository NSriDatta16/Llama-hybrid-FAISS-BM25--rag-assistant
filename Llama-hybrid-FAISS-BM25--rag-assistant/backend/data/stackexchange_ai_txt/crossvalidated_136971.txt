No, PCA is not very appropriate, because PCA does not involve any kind of discrimination between classes. Instead, look at Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) . LDA looks for a linear combination of features (like PCA does) but it looks for the combination that will separate classes, e.g. to separate your o1 from your o2 o3 o4 o5. Your problem isn't described in much detail but it may be that the whole world of classification algorithms (and feature selection for classification) is useful to look at.
