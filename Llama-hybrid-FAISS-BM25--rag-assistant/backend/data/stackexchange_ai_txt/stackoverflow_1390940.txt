to-url makes a string into a REBOL datatype of URL! What you want is to detect if a string conforms to the rules for a URL. That is nor easy or fool proof as many strings can be URLs in the real world, eg: http://xxx ftp://xxx frag cgi-bin/script.php If you want to capture the more common cases (eg those that start with http:// , https:// etc), then consider using parse . This script almost does the job : link text What it missing is some charset definitions (I think the code must have been hurriedly cut'n'pasted from somewhere else).... alpha: charset [#"a" - #"z" #"A" - #"Z"] digits: charset [#"0" - #"9"] alphadigit: union alpha digits ...and an example of how to use it: Assuming you have saved it locally as uri.r: url-parse: do %uri.r parse "http://sss" parse-url/url == true parse "sss" parse-url/url == false
