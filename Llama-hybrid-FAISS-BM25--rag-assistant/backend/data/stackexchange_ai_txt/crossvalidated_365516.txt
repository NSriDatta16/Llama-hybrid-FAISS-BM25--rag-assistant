Panel. Panel data is also called "longitudinal" data, as it involves a cross-sectional unit $i$ observed multiple times $t$. It is called a "panel" because, when the matrix of data is sorted first by $i$ and then by $t$, there are "panels" of time series for each unit $i$. Note that the cross section need not be an individual and the $t$ variable need not be time. It could be classes in a school, for example, where you observe multiple schools, or penguins in a penguin colony, where you observe multiple colonies. Typically with panels you apply methods that take advantage of the repeated observations, and that respect the fact that within-group observations are likely to be correlated.
