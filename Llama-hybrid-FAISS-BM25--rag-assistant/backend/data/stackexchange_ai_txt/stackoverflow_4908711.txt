design web application which consume many web services

problem is existing applications on our organization required to enter same data multiple times, data naming conversions not consistent across applications. currently there are many WCF and asmx web services already deployed for existing applications. But I don't have control over any of those services and also they are host on different countries. I can request small modifications for existing application (e.g. link to new application with required quarry strings.) To overcome repetitive data entering process I have to find solution. currently what in my mind is create web application and keep business logic layer with reference to all required services. need to request to do some modifications on existing applications to connect new application and it will map required data and made the connection between separated applications. following are few questions currently facing, To do a task there may be many services required, if one service not respond on middle of the process how I can rollback the process ? since all are service calls it may take more time to do a simple operation but i need to increase performance of the applications, how I can improve performance while handling many services on one application?
