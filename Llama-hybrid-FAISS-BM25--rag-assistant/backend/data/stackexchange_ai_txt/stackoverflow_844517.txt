In your example you show that each node links to every other node. If this is the case throughout your setup, then the diameter is 1. If your setup is a line like so in a linear formation: n=1, n = 2, n = 3, ... n Then your diameter is (n+1)/3. If your setup is more irregular, with a series of N number nodes and K number of links, then your diameter is at least logN/LogK Edit: To clarify, I'm calculating the average shortest distance between pairs of nodes. n1 - n2 - n3 (n+1)/3 = 4/3 n1-n2 = 1 hop n2 - n3 = 1 hop n1- n2 - n3 = 2 hops (1+1+2)/3 = 4/3
