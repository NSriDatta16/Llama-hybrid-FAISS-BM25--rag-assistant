I have had an attack on my web server where .html files were copied by FTP into a public html directory. How do you know they were copied via FTP? The FTP password was very strong. Not really very relevant. FTP sends passwords unencrypted - so even assuming that the files were delivered via FTP, if the password was sniffed its irrelevant how much entropy it has. I'm trying to determin whether PHP initiated the FTP transfer You can't tell what the client was. Even if, like HTTP, the protocol provided for collecting information about the user-agent, there is no way of determining the accuracy of this information (it's sent by the client, therefore can be manipulated by the client). Your FTP server log should have recorded details of which IP address / user account uploaded which files and when. But don't be surprised if there's nothing relevant in there. C.
