A few Mac OS X specific answers (general ones are covered in other replies): 1) In 32 bit OSX, address space is mapped 4/4 (i.e. kernel gets the full 2^32 AND each app does), which requires flushing the TLB twice on each syscall. In 64 bit there's plenty of room to map the kernel and the application into different address ranges. 2) Objective-C programs use the new ABI/runtime on 64 bit x86 machines. This gets you C++ compatible exceptions, non-fragile instance variables, and some speedups.
