couchdb read authentication

how can i handle read authentication in couchdb? i know roles can be defined in seperate databases but i want to implement read authentication on document level. i am thinking about using node.js but it does not seem an elegant solution because couchdb also has a http server and i dont want to add one more (or another application server like ruby or python). is there anyone working on this? Thanks.
