process scheduling question

For example, a process waiting for disk I/O to complete will sleep on the address of the buffer header corresponding to the data being transferred. When the interrupt routine for the disk driver notes that the transfer is complete, it calls wakeup on the buffer header. The interrupt uses the kernel stack for whatever process happened to be running at the time, and the wakeup is done from that system process. Can you please explain the last line in the paragraph which I have emphasised. It is about waking up the process which has been waiting for some event to occur and thus has slept. This para is from Galvin. By the way can you suggest some good book or link for studying unix operating systems? Thanks.
