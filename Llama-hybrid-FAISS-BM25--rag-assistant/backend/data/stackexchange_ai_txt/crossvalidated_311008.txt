What are the downsides of bayesian neural networks?

Bayesian neural nets (BNN) are very popular topic. With development of variational approximation it became possible to train such models much faster then with Monte Carlo sampling. BNNs allow such interesting features as natural regularisation and even uncertainty estimation. So, the question is: why haven't we still completely migrated on BNNs? I can assume that variational inference does not provide enough accuracy. Is it the only reason?
