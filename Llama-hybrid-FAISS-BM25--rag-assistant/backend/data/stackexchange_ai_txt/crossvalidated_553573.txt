D&D - Confidence Interval for enemy armor class

In dungeons and dragons, characters and monsters have two properties called Attack Bonus( $AB \, \in \, \mathbb{Z}$ ) and Armor Class( $AC \, \in \, \mathbb{N}$ ). Let $AB_c$ be the character attack bonus and $AC_m$ the monster armor class. When a character attacks a monster, he can either hit or miss. To know the result, a $20$ sided die is cast, and we look at its result $D$ . If $D$ is between $2$ and $19$ , then the attack hits if $$ D + AB_c - AC_m \geq 0 \quad,$$ otherwise it misses. If $D=1$ , it is also considered a miss. If $D=20$ , the attack is called a critical, and always hits. You know $AB_c$ , but do not known $AC_m$ . As you perform attacks, you can narrow the possible values of $AC_m$ . For instance, assume $AB_c = 7$ and you attacked twice, with $D_1 = 5$ and $D_2=16$ . Your game master(GM) tells you that you missed the first attack, but hit the second. Therefore, you can infer that $13 \leq AC_m \leq 23$ . Moreover, if you attack again with $D_3 = 15$ , and the GM tells you that you missed, then you know for sure that $AC_m = 23$ . If the enemy $AC_m$ is higher than your hit range ( $19+AB_c$ ), then best conclusion is $19 + AB_c \leq AC_m$ , you can not know $AC_m$ for sure. Notice you can still hit him when $D=20$ . The Fun part Assume your GM is a hardcore roleplayer and as such he does not allow you to see the die result! He rolls the dice and looks secretly at the result. The only thing you know about your attack is his description: "As you swing your sword, the enemy raises his shield and blocks!" (you missed the attack), and "You strike swiftly, leaving a scar on your foe, if he lives that is!" (you hit). In a session, you attacked the monster $n$ times and recorded $h = (h_1, \ldots, h_n)$ , a sample vector where $i$ -th entry is $h_i = 1$ , if you hit, or $h_i = 0$ , if you missed. Given $\alpha \, \in \, [0,1]$ , how do you provide a $1-\alpha$ confidence interval (or credible interval) for $AC_m$ ?
