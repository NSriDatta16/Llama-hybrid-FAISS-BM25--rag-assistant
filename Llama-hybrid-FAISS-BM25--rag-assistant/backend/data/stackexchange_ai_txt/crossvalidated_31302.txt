Using Bayesian model diagrams to present both model description and results (posteriors)?

The model diagrams in "Doing Bayesian Data Analysis" , John Kruschke creates diagrams like this: To represent The following BUGS/JAGS code: He discusses this representation in his related blog post, Graphical model diagrams in Doing Bayesian Data Analysis versus traditional convention I just wrote one out for my rather complicated model and had a real moment of clarity. The diagrams are generic representations of probability density functions- they don't really reflect the flat priors stated in the model (although technically, the x-axes are not labeled). I haven't actually read the book, but I think it would be even more useful to use this diagram to present both the model structure and the results, i.e., replace these generic distributions with the posterior probability density of each parameter (e.g. $\textrm{N}(\textrm{figure of }M_0,\textrm{ figure of }T_0)$ (rather than a single distribution to represent both parameters as is the case below. I have three questions: Are there any potential technical (statistical) issues with this approach? I only ask because I haven't seen results presented alongside the model description in this way. Are there any other suggestions for how to make this do a great job of communicating results? One idea that I had was to present an indexed beta (e.g. a random effect for 1...n categorical treatments, in the model above it would be beta1[i] ) as overlapping densities (one for each treatment effect)? How could I make this presentation be more intuitive to readers not familiar with hierarchical modeling? (I think this is the most intuitive presentation that I have found so far, but there may be room for improvement)
