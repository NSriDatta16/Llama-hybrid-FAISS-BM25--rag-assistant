This problem is a generalisation of the classical coupon-collector problem . A reasonable way to find the solution would be to frame the process as a Markov chain. The random variable of interest here is the hitting time for the final state in the chain. I will suggest some basics to get you started on the problem, but you will need to have a look at material on hitting times for Markov chains to get a full solution. To generalise your problem slightly, suppose you originally have $m$ objects in your set and you are selecting $k > 0$ random objects on each draw, via simple random sampling. If we let $K_n$ be the number of objects that have been selected (at least once) after $n$ draws then the process $\{ K_n | n \in \mathbb{N} \}$ is a discrete Markov chain with transition probabilities taken from the hypergeometric distribution : $$p_{i,j} \equiv \mathbb{P}(K_{n+1} = j | K_n = i) = \frac{{i \choose k+i-j} {m-i \choose j-i}}{{m \choose k}} \quad \quad \quad \text{for all } i \leqslant j \leqslant i+k.$$ Now, if you form the Markov chain with states $0,...,m$ , starting state $0$ and transition probabilities given by this equation then the random variable you are looking for is the hitting time for the state $m$ . Getting the exact distribution for the hitting time is a somewhat involved exercise (it can be done by finding the eigen-decomposition of the transition probability matrix and using this to derive the CDF for the hitting time). Alternatively you can simulate the Markov chain a large number of times to estimate the distribution of interest. (The other answer here gives you a direct simulation of the process, but you can probably make this more efficient by simulating the Markov chain.) I won't go further and give a full solution, but this ought to give you an idea of the general direction we could go to try to derive the distribution of the quantity of interest.
