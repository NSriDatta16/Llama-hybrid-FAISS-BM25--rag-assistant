There are several solutions to your problem. There are two forms of outliers: Additive outlier (also called as pulses) Level shifts (also called as break in trend). I'm assuming you would need step 2 what you call as breakout detection. There are variety of methods and tools that could help you in this: Open Source Software: Change point package in R software Break point package Robust Anomaly Detection from Netflix Breakout detection by twitter there are two commercial version, that I have worked with great success: 1. SAS using UCM and ARIMA frame works 2. SPSS time series outlier detection It is beyond the scope of one answer to mention pros and cons of these methodologies. I must say RAD from Netflix and Breakout detection from twitter performs worse in your data. What this tells you in my opinion that Statisticians have developed elegant methods like the one in changepoint package that is able to easily detect breakpoints in your data. I have also had excellent success using SAS/SPSS. Below are some of the results from applying all the 4 open source packages. Twitters breakout is the worst which does not recognize any breaks in your data. Netflix's RAD does point out all your additive outliers/pulses but fails to recognize level shift around data point ~1351.Both changepoint and breakpoint detects correctly level shifts in ~1351 and 1353 respectively. I'll expand my answer in the future.
