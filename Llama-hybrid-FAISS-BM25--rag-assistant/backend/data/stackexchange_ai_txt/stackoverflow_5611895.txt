workflow and Toolbox

I have Toolbox for Activity where I have Activities listed and on right side I have designer where Workflow designer is placed. From my Toolbox I can drag and drop Activites into designer It works fine. Now to increase the usability experience I want to double click on Activity in toolbox and it should be added automatically into desinger as the last activity in sequence workflow ? How can I do this ?
