Why doesn't this e-mail display correctly in Lotus Notes?

I'm building an e-mail with PHP, following the RFC as closely as I can, and this appears to work in other clients (gmail, outlook), but not in Lotus Notes. The client sees everything including the first boundary and below as raw text. Any ideas what I'm doing wrong?
