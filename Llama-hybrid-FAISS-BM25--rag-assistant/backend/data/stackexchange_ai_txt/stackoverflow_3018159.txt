rails ajaxful rating rating_averate doesn't update

I impleneted ajaxful rating on a Store model with 3 dimensions. I am caching rating average for each dimension as well as the overall average rating. The individual dimension rates are being saved and shown correctly and everything works fine except, the "rating_average" does not update (still at 0) even after multiple users have updated it for a specific record. Thanks
