It's an internal server error, which return status code 500 in response. This may be caused by incorrect request, but as well server code or overload may be the reason. If you have access to server, check event logs. See also 500 EOF when chunk header expected Why might LWP::UserAgent be failing with '500 EOF'? 500 EOF instead of reponse status line in perl script Apache 1.3 error - Unexpected EOF reading HTTP status - connectionreset Error 500! UPDATE On the other hand, if it's not response message, but a real exception, then it may be simply a bug, just like in old java And workaround may be putting getResponseCode() inside of try/catch and call second time on exception: int responseCode = -1; try { responseCode = con.getResponseCode(); } catch (IOException ex1) { //check if it's eof, if yes retrieve code again if (-1 != ex1.getMessage().indexOf("EOF")) { try { responseCode = con.getResponseCode(); } catch (IOException ex2) { System.out.println(ex2.getMessage()); // handle exception } } else { System.out.println(ex1.getMessage()); // handle exception } } Talking by connections number limit, read What Is - Maximum number of simultaneous connections How To - Close connections
