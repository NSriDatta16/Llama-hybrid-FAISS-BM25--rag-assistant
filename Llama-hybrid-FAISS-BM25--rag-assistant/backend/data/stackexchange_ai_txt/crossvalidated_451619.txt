What does it mean when PCA does not produce a reduction in dimensionality?

I am a beginner in PCA, I am trying to apply it on a dataset I have. The features are different geometrical parameters with different units and variability, I do standardize the features matrix by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. For the PCA, I use the PCA() method in sklearn wich is based on the singular value decomposition (SVD). Once I fit the model I get the following results if I choose just 4 components: Is this telling me something about my features? or there is something fundamentally wrong in my approach? Thank you!
