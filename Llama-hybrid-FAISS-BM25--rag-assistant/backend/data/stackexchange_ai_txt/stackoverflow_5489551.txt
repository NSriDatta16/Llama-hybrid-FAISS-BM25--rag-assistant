Not in PHP, no. The paragraph will be rendered in the browser; a number of variables can influence the actual height: Operating System font size settings, Zoom settings, availability of fonts.... therefore, the height can be determined only in client-side JavaScript after the page has been rendered. The jQuery framework has the convenient .height() that will give you the computed height of a HTML element and bridges a number of cross-browser issues one would have to take care of manually: Lorem Ipsum Dolor amet.... $(document).ready(function() { alert("Height is "+ $("#paragraph").height() + "Pixels"); } );
