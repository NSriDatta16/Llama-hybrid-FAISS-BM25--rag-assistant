Is this a valid markov chain?

I have the Markov chain presented in the image. It hast 4 states S=(1,2,3,4). The transitional probabilities are all $\frac{1}{2}$ and the direction from one state to another is given by the arrows. Is there an error with the original problem? We have 3 arrows from state 2, so $p_{24}=1$, but $p_{21}=\frac{1}{2}$. Can you confirm that this is not possible?
