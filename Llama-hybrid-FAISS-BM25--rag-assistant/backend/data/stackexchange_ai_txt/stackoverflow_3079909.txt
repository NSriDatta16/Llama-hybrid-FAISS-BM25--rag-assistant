silverlight synchronize isolatedstorage with database

Since use of isolatedstorage storing for silverlight can provide a method for storing userdata locally and whikle not connected to the internet, I'm interested in hearing your thoughts about intelligently synchronizing dbdata and silverlight isolatedstoragedata. I've currently implemented a solution, but it seems a bit complex to me, so I'd like to hear if I could have done it differently. I have a list of documentobjects that I save to the isostore. the document has (datetime)DateModified and (bool)DeleteOnSync properties which are essential to the syncrhonization. When the user connects to the internet, the app will check the list of documents stored in the db with the list in the isostore and join the two lists into one where (if the two objects share id) only the newest document (the one with newest DateModified) is selected. When the list has been joined there will be a lookup of "DeleteOnSync" in which documents with this property set to true will be deleted from both db and isostore. It then saves this new list to both the db and the isostore. Does this make sense?
