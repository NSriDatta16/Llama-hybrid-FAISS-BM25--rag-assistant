If you're already using spring in your application, then it makes sense to use Spring WebServices to access to the service. The manual has a chapter on how to use Spring-WS from the client . The good news here is that Spring-WS has no requirement on the target service WSDL, in fact it actively discourages it. You can invoke the webservice using a variety of bindings, such as JAXB or raw DOM if you choose. The docs cover all the options.
