The results of your second model suggest that you don't have enough data to fit a model with two random slopes reliably this way. When you fit random slopes in that second model, you ask for a random slope of SL within each of CYR and Station , with each of those those slopes correlated with the corresponding intercepts. The random slopes and intercepts are constrained to follow normal distributions, and you fit the corresponding normal variances and correlation coefficients. See this page , for example. That adds 4 more parameters to estimate than in the first model with only two random intercepts. The warning boundary (singular) fit corresponds to the very small variances for the random slopes associated with SL : approximately 0.0001 or less for both. At least one of those variances couldn't be reliably distinguished from 0, even though the model converged numerically. Furthermore, the correlation between random slopes and intercepts for CYR is exactly 1, which is also a sign of a singular fit. The lme4 package reference manual page for isSingular discusses the problem and ways to proceed. Quoting in part: While singular models are statistically well defined (it is theoretically sensible for the true maximum likelihood estimate to correspond to a singular fit), there are real concerns that (1) singular fits correspond to overfitted models that may have poor power... (3) standard inferential procedures such as Wald statistics and likelihood ratio tests may be inappropriate. That last point argues against using a standard Anova to compare the two models. If you think that both random slopes are important, based on your understanding of the subject matter, then you could take the advice on that manual page to use partially or fully Bayesian approaches. Otherwise, you could consider reducing the complexity of the model, perhaps by removing the random SL slope with respect to CYR , which seems to be the major source of difficulty.
