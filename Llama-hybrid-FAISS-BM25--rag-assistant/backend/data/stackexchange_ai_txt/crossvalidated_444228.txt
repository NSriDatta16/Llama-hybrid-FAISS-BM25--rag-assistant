OP describes categorical data and should use approaches from that domain. I highly recommend the netCoin package in R. https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/netCoin/vignettes/netCoin.html It will check for coincidences using Haberman. By coincidences and co-occurrence here mean two features occurring on the same objects far more than chance. Haberman accounts for number of times each feature occurs and total number of objects but I think not for some objects having more features.Then netcoin will plot an interactive network graph with edges representing high coincidences. If you wish to compare objects instead of features just transpose the dataset. To test interactions (features 1, 2, 3, predict feature 10) user will have to create the columns themselves, such as multiplying the True False version of each feature. Alternatively vcd, Visualizing Categorical Data, could help. https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vcd/vignettes/strucplot.pdf . Features 1,2,3 predicting feature 10 is called conditional probability. Finally OP could try to predict each column using machine learning classification models and then trying to explain those models via packages like DALEX.
