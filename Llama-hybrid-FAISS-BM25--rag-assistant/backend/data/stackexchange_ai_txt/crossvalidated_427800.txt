Amar Sagoo has a very good article explaining this . To add my own attempt at an intuitive understanding: Mean deviation is a decent way of asking how far a hypothetical "average" point is from the mean, but it doesn't really work for asking how far all the points are from each other, or how "spread out" the data are. Standard deviation is asking how far apart all the points are, so in incorporates more useful information than just the mean deviation (which is why mean deviation is usually only used as a stepping stone toward understanding standard deviation). A good analogy is the Pythagorean Theorem. The Pythagorean Theorem tells us the distance between points in two dimensions by taking the horizontal distance and the vertical distance, squaring them, adding the squares, and taking the square root of the total. If you look at it closely, the formula for (population) Standard Deviation is basically the same as the Pythagorean Theorem, but with a lot more than two dimensions (and using distance from each point to the mean as the distance in each dimension). As such it gives the most accurate picture of the "distance" between all the points in your data set. To push that analogy a little further, the mean absolute deviation would be like taking the average of the horizontal and vertical distances, which is shorter than the total distance, while the sum absolute deviation would be adding the horizontal and vertical distances, which is longer than the actual distance.
