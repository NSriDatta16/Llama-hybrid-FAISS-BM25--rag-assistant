I agree with Bill K. Standard MVC is not that important when dealing with rich client. It is a great model when writting web apps as events (clicks in your browser) are quite different than your view (HTML render). With standard GUI, a better model is something called PAC (presentation/abstraction/Control). Here the presentation is (the view + the event handler), the controller manage the exchanges between the presentation and the abstraction. And the abstraction is your business model. This way you have a controller that manage the link between the GUI part (view + user events) and your abstraction. You have a PAC agent for any piece of GUI you develop and a clean separation between them. Another article about something better than MVC related to PAC : HMVC . Quite old, but it is practical and it helps understanding things.
