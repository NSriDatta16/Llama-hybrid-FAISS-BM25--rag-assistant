Why do real-world high dimensional data often have much lower inherent dimensionality?

In a previous year exam about data analysis, there was a question that I'm confused about. Here's the question: Explain why it is natural to expect that in real-world high dimensional data the inherent dimensionality of data points will be smaller than the number of coordinates. How is the smaller number of relevant new co-ordinate axis found in PCA? I'm confused about the real-world high dimensional data being smaller than the number of coordinates. I'd really appreciate if someone can point me in the right direction.
