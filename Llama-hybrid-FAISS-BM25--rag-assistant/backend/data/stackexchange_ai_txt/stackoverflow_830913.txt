Runtime.exec() is a deceptively nasty little spud to work with. I found this article (old, but still relevant) to be quite helpful. You can always skip to Page 4 for some highly gankable sample code. :-) At a glance, your code needs to handle both proc.getOutputStream() and proc.getErrorStream(), which is a good reason to handle those streams in separate threads.
