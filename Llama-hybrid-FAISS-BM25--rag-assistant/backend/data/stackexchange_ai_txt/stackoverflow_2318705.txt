As the rest have said make sure you identify your bottlenecks first. As far as your concerns about the DB goes i would suggest creating some indices on your tables to speed up slow queries (only when identified) http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.2/static/sql-createindex.html CREATE [ UNIQUE ] INDEX [ CONCURRENTLY ] name ON table [ USING method ] ( { column | ( expression ) } [ opclass ] [, ...] ) [ WITH ( storage_parameter = value [, ... ] ) ] [ TABLESPACE tablespace ] [ WHERE predicate ] Please make sure to do some reading on when and when not to use an index
