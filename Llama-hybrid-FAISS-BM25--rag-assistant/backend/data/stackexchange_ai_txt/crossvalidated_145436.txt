Why are all my p-values so low in logistic regression model?

I'm trying to make a regression model to explain a dependent variable that follows a binomial distribution - I have data on the number of successes and the number of trials for each observation. The proportion of successes to trials ranges from about 0.2 to 0.97. I have ~30 independent variables I am choosing from for my model, some of which are continuous, some are discrete, some are percentages. In researching how best to model this situation, I thought it made sense to use logistic regression. I am working in MATLAB and have implemented this using a generalized linear model for a binomial distribution with a logit link function. From what I can tell the fact that my independent variables vary in data type is okay. I have tried doing this for many different combinations of independent variables, and my results keep showing that the p-values for all of the independent variables are 0 (out to many decimal places). Note also that SSE is quite high. Generalized Linear regression model: logit(FC) ~ 1 + DDP + SCHabs + Train + Exp_hab + Exp_ratio + Sch_tot Distribution = Binomial Estimated Coefficients: Estimate SE tStat pValue __________ __________ _______ ___________ (Intercept) -0.4451 0.0060914 -73.071 0 DDP 0.0036999 8.0929e-05 45.718 0 SCHabs 1.7664 0.025142 70.259 0 Train 2.0887e-05 9.8255e-08 212.58 0 Exp_hab -6.8407 0.25137 -27.214 4.4104e-163 Exp_ratio -0.1891 0.016817 -11.245 2.4572e-29 Sch_tot 2.9644e-06 1.5103e-08 196.28 0 30 observations, 23 error degrees of freedom Dispersion: 1 Chi^2-statistic vs. constant model: 3.05e+05, p-value = 0 SSE = 2.74 e+09 EDIT: Here is the same output when I run the regression in R: Call: glm(formula = cbind(FC, NotFC) ~ DDP + SCHabs + Train + Exp_hab + Exp_ratio + Sch_tot, family = binomial, data = regdata) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -185.628 -28.537 -1.076 45.945 244.305 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -4.453e-01 6.089e-03 -73.13 At first I thought maybe it was a multicollinearity problem, but the standard errors are low, none of the values in the correlation matrix are above 0.65, and a collintest did not flag any issues. Next I thought maybe I have too many independent variables in my model, so I tried using just a single independent variable. I tried several of them, no improvement. I then tried using stepwise regression to minimize the SSE. This added in all of the variables I included in the data table, as well as many of the cross terms. Only 1 p value was insignificant, which still seems absurd.

I did this many times, and every time this meaningless variable also had a p-value of zero, which obviously can't be right. What's going on here? What am I doing wrong? EDIT: Here are scatter plots of the key variables from the regression above. A few of the discrete variables, like DDP and LWE, have lots of zeros in them. Which are meaningful, real zeros. I thought about maybe coding them as binary variables instead. I also include a correlation matrix plot. EDIT AGAIN: Here is a public dropbox link to a .csv file with my data. Note the dependent variable I am modeling is "FCperHab" which is calculated by dividing "FC" by "Hab". For context, these are data on states in India. I am trying to explain the percentage of habitations in each state that have full access to drinking water. https://www.dropbox.com/s/w5gzdznhuad59gp/regdata_CV.csv?dl=0
