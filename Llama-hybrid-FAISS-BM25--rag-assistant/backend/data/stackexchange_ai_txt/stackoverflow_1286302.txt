How do you swap UIButton positions by swiping and/or dragging?

I'm currently writing a program where I have UIButtons arranged in a square. in a NIB. I swap the buttons by taping one one then another using "Touch Up Inside" events. I want to make them swap by swiping one in the direction of another and by dragging one on top of another. I haven't been able to figure out how to do this. Ive been looking in the Apple documentation for weeks but I really don't know how to make sense of it. Can someone tell me what I need to dd to my code to do this? Here is my code: #import "squareViewController.h" static UIButton *matrix[2][2]; static int firstButtonRow, firstButtonColumn, secondButtonRow, secondButtonColumn; static BOOL isFirstTouch = YES; static CGPoint gestureStartPoint; @implementation squareViewController @synthesize diamond; @synthesize heart; @synthesize spade; @synthesize club; - (void)viewDidLoad { matrix[0][0] = [diamond retain]; matrix[0][1] = [heart retain]; matrix[1][0] = [spade retain]; matrix[1][1] = [club retain]; } - (void)ButtonTapped:(id)sender{ int row = 0, column = 0; for(row = 0; row
