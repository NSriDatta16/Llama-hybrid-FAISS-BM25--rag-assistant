Does it matter that the model is created in the form of SVM? If no, I have seen a clever 6-D visualization. Its varieties are becoming popular in medical presentations. 3 dimensions are shown as usual, in orthographic projection. Dimension 4 is color (0..255) Dimension 5 is thickness of the symbol Dimension 6 requires animation. It is a frequency of vibration of a dot on the screen. In static, printed versions, one can replace frequency of vibration by blur around the point, for a comparable visual perception. If yes, and you specifically need to draw separating hyperplanes, and make them look like lines\planes, the previous trick will not produce good results. Multiple 3-D images are better.
