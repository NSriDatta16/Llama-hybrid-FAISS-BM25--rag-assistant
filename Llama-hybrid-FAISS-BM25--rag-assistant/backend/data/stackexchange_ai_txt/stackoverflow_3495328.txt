It sounds like whichever system you're using at the moment (if you're using one at all) does not make to-do lists a priority or put to-dos/tasks in your view every morning that you log in. Sounds like you need something that: Allows you to assign different tasks/to-dos to different modules of a project Keeps an organized view of which task/to-do has been assigned to which project Sets alerts for each separate to-do/task (due date, percent completed, etc) Keeps the tasks/to-dos easily viewable (from the dashboard, or put in a prioritized view as soon as you open a project) A company that I do contract work with, WORKetc, can do all of this. On top of this, they have a huge amount of other project management features, to name a few: Collaboration on all aspects of a project Unlimited sub projects Gantt charts Project dependancy Timesheet/milestone billing To-dos, tasks, easily assignable to specific people/specific projects/specific sub projects, with necessary alerts The cool thing about WORKetc is on top of being a project managemement tool, WORKetc also has CRM and billing features. It is essentially a total business management platform and that way if you're using other CRM or billing software you can get rid of it entirely, and not have to worry about integrating seperate projects. Even if you don't use these features, I bet its still a better bargain than the majority of the other ones you'll see! Pricing/website link: http://www.worketc.com/sign_up
