Hypothesis testing involving pathological distributions

Given a very large number of samples $n$ from the population, suppose that I am trying a standard hypothesis test on the means: $$\begin{align}H_0:&\overline{x}\leq\mu_0\\ H_1:&\overline{x}>\mu_0 \end{align}$$ I am interested in the power of my test as I increase $n$. If I am given nice probability measures associated with null and alternate hypotheses (s.t. Gaussians), my task is pretty easy: I can readily characterize the power as a function of $n$ and my significance level (and show how it increases as you add more observations). Now, suppose that the probability measure associated with $H_1$ is pathological in that it has no mean (e.g. Cauchy distribution) or the mean is infinite (e.g. appropriately-parametrized Levy distribution). The probability measure associated with $H_0$ still has a finite mean. I believe this hypothesis test can be written down as follows: $$\begin{align}H_0:&\overline{x}=\mu_0\\ H_1:&\overline{x}~\text{infinite or undefined} \end{align}$$ Is there a way to perform such a test, supposing that my number of observations from the population is very large ($n\rightarrow\infty$)? I think there should be some way, considering that as one increases $n$, if the underlying distribution has a mean, then the average should converge to it by Law of Large Numbers. And, I am assuming that if if the underlying distribution has no mean, the average doesn't converge to anything. However, can one make a precise statement about the power of a statistical hypothesis test in terms of $n$ in that case? What would a test that separates these two hypotheses look like? I wonder if one can prove that in such a case there exists a test that has power of 1 for a finite sample size... EDIT : Attempted to clarify what the second hypothesis test might look like.
