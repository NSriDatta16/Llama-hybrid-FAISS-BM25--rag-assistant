What is the proper naming scheme for dataset parts?

Excuse me I'm not an English speaker and I have no idea whatsoever whether there is any standard naming scheme. And since I don't want to use names I have read in some books I will be overly descriptive. Let's suppose I want to describe a dataset containing data for prediction of weather pollutants. Each row of this dataset consists of daily averages of some weather parameters for a particular (current) day, daily average of pollutants for the previous day, daily average of pollutants on the current day (this value will be predicted) What is the name of single row in this dataset; What is the name of single cell in single row; What is the name of part of this dataset that will be input of this model (in this case weather parameters, and pollutant for the previous day); What is the name of part of the dataset that model will predict based on the part in latter point; I have some guesses but I'll post them when I get some answers. References to books/articles would be appreciated. PS. If anyone knows proper Polish translations I would also be very interested :)
