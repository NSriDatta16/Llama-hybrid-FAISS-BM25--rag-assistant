Do you get this same problem if you start a new test project in VS2008 and debug? If not, then maybe you would be better off creating new csproj files and dragging your existing code files into the new project. Personally, if your visual studio installation is stable (othe r2008 projects build ok), I would rather go that route that to go mucking with global state in your registry.
