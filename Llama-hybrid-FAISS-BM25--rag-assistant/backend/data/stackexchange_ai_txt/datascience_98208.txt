You do not need train a new model. You can find an existing neural network architecture that has been trained for "dog"/"not dog". One option for continuous video input is use Python's OpenCV package which has a VideoCapture class which can read from an input stream. Individual frames can be extracted the stream. The model would predict "dog"/"not dog" on the frames. Something like this: import cv2 video = cv2.VideoCapture(0) while True: _, frame = video.read() print(model.predict(frame))
