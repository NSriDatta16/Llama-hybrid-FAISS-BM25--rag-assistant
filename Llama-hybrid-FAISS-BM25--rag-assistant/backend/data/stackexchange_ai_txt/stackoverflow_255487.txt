A project management tool for team members, customers or users. One of the most important parts is interacting with people, a project management tool allows you show the progress/milstone and organized the feature request, defect and resources along with other features like forum, nofications and document uploading. This gives your customer a clear view of the project. Redmine works very well for me.
