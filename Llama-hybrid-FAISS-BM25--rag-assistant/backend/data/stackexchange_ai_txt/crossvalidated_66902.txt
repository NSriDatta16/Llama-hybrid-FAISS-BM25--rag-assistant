All: Rapidminer WEKA milions of more use the libsvm library, which are the same implementations. The only actual difference is how they use it. As underlying code of libsvm is just a numerical optimizator, there is a number of thing that can influence the quality of resulting classifier. First of all, libsvm requires definition of a eps parameter that is used in the optimisation process as a threshold value - this is the most common difference between libraries. The second thing is use (or lack of it) of shrinkage heuristics, which guides the optimisation process, and with previously mentioned eps variable can lead to different results. Those were "deep" reasons for such behaviour. The most simple explanation is... data preprocessing - SVM does not work well on the raw data (which have large disproportions in the input data dimensions), there are at least few possible ways of dealing with it: squashing the data linearly to the [-1,1] dimension-wise transform the data through C^(-1/2) where C is adata covariance matrix and again - each "meta library" can use its own method of such preprocessing. And the way it is done greatly influences the results.
