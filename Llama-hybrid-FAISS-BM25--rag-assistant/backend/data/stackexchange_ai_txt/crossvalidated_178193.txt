Alright, you can hit me now - after a couple of days of thinking I figured the answer out myself - but in any case that someone should have the same problem, please continue reading: The answer is very (!) simple. Since this method is called proportional odds logistic regression, the coefficients are of course the same for every level of the dependent variable. And you get two thresholds for three DV levels (thresholds are the negative intercept, thus you'll notice a minus-sign below) You just do this: log_pred_probs1 notice the two intercepts AND the subtraction of the first level's probability! and finally log_pred_probs3 It's easy as that. Cheers!
