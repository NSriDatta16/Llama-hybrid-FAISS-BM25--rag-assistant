Inverse Wishart Prior for linear model

I know some bayesian methods employ an inverse wishart distribution for the prior distribution of the covariance matrix in a linear regression. I.e. for the model: $$Y=X\beta+\epsilon$$ Where $\epsilon \sim N(0, \Sigma)$ , some methods will use $\pi(\Sigma)\sim W^{-1}(A,v)$ . My question is however, what should the matrices/values $A$ and $v $ be? I read somewhere that $v$ was degrees of freedom but could not work out of what... should $v$ be $n-p$ where $X$ is $(n \times p)$ and how should $A$ be chosen?
