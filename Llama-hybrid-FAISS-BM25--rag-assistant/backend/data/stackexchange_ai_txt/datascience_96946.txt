3 points: If the feature is certainly or very most of the time is not available during prediction the no you cant use it If it is sometimes available and sometimes not, you must include no-comment bugs into your training as well and choose a default value which means no-comment (e.g. 'no-comment' string! or None) In case they are available only for training, you can still benefit from them during EDA. Extracting keywords, topics, etc. from them will help you understand the situation of different labels and possibly helps you validate your labels, score them and/or understand the relation between other features (by clustering-like analysis) If you want to use them, be careful how you do it. You have a bunch of categorical and/or numerical features and if you want to put text feature next to them you need to thing about feature representation. For example if you want to use TF-IDF, you suddenly introduce potentially thousands of features which may kill the information of your main features. So try to make it as sparse as possible like extracting keywords or topic from those texts and use those as categories. If you use any embedding to model them, check if you need to normalize your feature set as the scale of embedding values and other numerical features might be different Hope it helped. Good Luck!
