You can't share variable values among separate requests - think of each request like the entire program is starting and finishing each time, even if there are several requests happening at once. You could look into storing data in a cache layer (for example, memcached) however it sounds like you need to cache your database if it's under heavy load. I'd recommend caching your database (again memcached or file-based storage; serialize() data first) and then when that problem is solved store the chat data in the database (which is in turn cached). You need to store it persistently somewhere.
