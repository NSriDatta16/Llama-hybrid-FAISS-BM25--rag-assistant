Cross validation for variable selection and coefficient shrinkage?

Is cross validation an appropriate technique for variable selection and regression coefficient shrinkage? A former colleague of mine used 10-fold CV to compare the regression coefficients from the 10 training models. Variables were kicked out if the coefficients changed sign. The average coefficient values for the remaining variables was then used to estimate the coefficients of the final model. Does this homebrewed methodology sound like a valid technique?
