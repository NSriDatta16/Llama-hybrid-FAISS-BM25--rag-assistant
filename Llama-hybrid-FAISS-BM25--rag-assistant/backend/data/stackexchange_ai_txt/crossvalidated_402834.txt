where can find good and in depth explanation for expectation, manipulation of expectation, sampling instead of expectation?

I look for a book or online source, for better understanding the expectation, expectation inside the expectation or sampling for calculation of expectation. for example, in Richard S. Sutton's Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction book, equation 13.5 I want better understanding the procedure and how manipulation of the expectation.
