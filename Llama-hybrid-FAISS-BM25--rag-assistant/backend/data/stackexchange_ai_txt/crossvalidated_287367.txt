Autoencoder with Mixed Data

Is it reasonable? The categorical features can be binary ("true" or "false") or strings, which are one-hot encoded. Some continuous features may be integers, which are treated as real values. If an autoencoder is an appropriate approach for such mixed data, what would be a reasonable loss function? Any other suggestions?
