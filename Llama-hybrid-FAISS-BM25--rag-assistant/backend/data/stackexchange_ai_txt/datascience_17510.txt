How does one deploy a model, after building it in Python or Matlab?

I have been playing around with a lot of different machine learning models (clustering, neural nets, etc...), but I am sort of stuck on understanding what happens after you finish building the model in Python or Matlab. For example, let's say that I trained a basic neural network model for a binary classification problem. How does one deploy that to colleagues, for example, so that they can load in the dataset to spit out a prediction? I have trained a model, but what happens to that model, now? How do I "save" that model that I just trained in Python? I see a lot of tutorials on how to pre-process data, train the model, spit out the statistics and predictions; but, what comes next ? Obviously Facebook, Google, and anyone else heavily involved in machine learning / AI applications are creating a framework to use their models. But, is there software that allows you to pull in data and then apply it to your Python code? Is this what Weka, TensorFlow, and these other packages do?
