Modeling Interest rates based on another rates

Below plots shows Red and Blue lines, those represents 2 different interest rates products. I have a forecast for the Blue line, how can I create the same for the Red line? I have noticed that there is a very strong correlation between them. Next, I have decided to verify the spread between those 2 lines and assume that the historical spread should be similar in the future. E.g historical spread on the average is 0.1% then if Blue line hit 1% [in the future] we get 0.9% for the Red. Next, I can repaeat for another tenors: 1 week, 3 months, 1 year etc. On the other hand, I think that working independently for each tenor I may miss some part of information. It is obvious that if there is a real interest rate shock it will imapct 1 day/1month/1year interest rates product. Could you please give me some hints/key words for such analysis?
