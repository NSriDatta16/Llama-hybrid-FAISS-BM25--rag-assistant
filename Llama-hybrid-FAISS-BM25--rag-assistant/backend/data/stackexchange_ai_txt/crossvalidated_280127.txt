The whole idea of Bayesian statistics is different from a frequentist approach. In this way I think to use the terms of significance is not accurate. I guess it is up to the reader to decide if the results (distribution) you get from your model for your $Î²$ 's are for him reliable or trustful. It always depends on the distribution itself. How skewed and wide is it and how much of the area is below zero? You can also find a nice lecture about the topic here at 41:55 : https://vimeo.com/14553953
