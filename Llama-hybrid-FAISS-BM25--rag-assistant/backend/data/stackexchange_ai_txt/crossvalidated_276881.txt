Interpertation of coefficient and marginal effect in logit model

My problem is that I am not able to interpret my results. I am confusing coefficient and marginal effect interpertation. Dependent Variable: PVO Method: ML - Binary Logit (Newton-Raphson / Marquardt steps) Sample: 1 80 Variable Coefficient Std. Error z-Statistic Prob. marginal effect C 2.657619 3.658793 0.726365 0.4676 EOH -0.09404 0.167246 -0.5623 0.5739 -0.013880599 PRO -5.5753 2.310915 -2.4126 0.0158 -0.822914575 CES -0.53666 0.4531 -1.18443 0.2362 -0.079211606 NFM 1.856624 0.945254 1.964154 0.0495 0.274037702 HEX -0.0005 0.000384 -1.29073 0.1968 -0.000073062 LIA -0.19821 0.374566 -0.52917 0.5967 -0.029255501 FUE -1.63151 2.169999 -0.75185 0.4521 -0.240811319 RIH -0.94564 0.650952 -1.45269 0.1463 -0.139575726 CAB -5.32912 4.25525 -1.25236 0.2104 -0.786578555 NOM -1.24661 1.014906 -1.2283 0.2193 -0.183999931 McFadden R-squared 0.671579 Mean dependent var 0.179487 Log likelihood -12.0557 LR statistic 49.30457 Avg. log likelihood -0.15456 Prob(LR statistic) 0 10% Level of significance These are my results. Poverty is my dependent variable and EOH denotes education of household head (independent). By taking the dummy variable: Is it true if I interpret:EOH as possessing a significant coefficient with negative sigh (-0.094)? Here does the negative sigh shows that if education of household head increase, poverty will decrease or the probability of being poor will decrease? The negative coefficient -0.094 means that if EOH increase by one unit on average (other variables held constant), that has no educationent the estimated logit(pov) will decrase by 0.094 units suggesting a negative relationship between the two? As we take the marginal effect that shows a household with an educated household head has greater ability to get rid of poverty 0.013 times than household that has no education?
