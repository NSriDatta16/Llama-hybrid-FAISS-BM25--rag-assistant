Diagnostic output of the Oracle Query Optimizer

There are many instances where we are not happy with the decisions that Oracle's cost-based-optimizer makes regarding the query execution plan. Using hints, less-than-straightforward query transformations, index reorganization and instance parameters we then try to coax it into doing what we think makes more sense. It is very much taking stabs in the dark, and the results can vary widely between the development, staging and production servers (no matter how hard we try to synchronize statistics and such). Is there a way to get diagnostic output from the Oracle server to illustrate what alternatives the CBO has looked at, and why they have been discarded? I am thinking of a feature like EXPLAIN PLAN, except that it enumerates all possible (or at least many) execution plans and their associated costs.
