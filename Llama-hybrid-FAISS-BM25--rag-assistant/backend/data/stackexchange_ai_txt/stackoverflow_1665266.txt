From wikipedia : ... 2-satisfiability can be solved in polynomial time. As Aspvall, Plass & Tarjan (1979) observed, a 2-satisfiability instance is solvable if and only if every variable of the instance belongs to a different strongly connected component of the implication graph than the negation of the same variable. Since strongly connected components may be found in linear time by an algorithm based on depth first search, the same linear time bound applies as well to 2-satisfiability. I won't pretend to understand most of that paragraph, but it would appear that there is an algorithm which can be used to solve the 2-SAT problem, and it is described within that referenced document ( A linear-time algorithm for testing the truth of certain quantified boolean formulas ). It can apparently be purchased online for about $20 USD. I'm Not sure if that's helpful or not, but there it is! update: A free PDF of the same document can be found here . Credit goes to liori for the find.
