Interpretation of fractional regression (GLM quasibinomial with logit link) coefficients

I am writing a research paper commenting theresults of the following regression, which is a GLM quasibionomial regression with a logit link (the outcome variable capfactor ranges between 0 and 1). formula Here is the summary of the results: z test of coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 0.976206 0.104157 9.3724 I am strugguling to interpret the coefficient in human-understandable terms. I am aware of this answer Logit-link GLM Summary Interpretation , but still I am not able to formulate a satisfactory result statement. How can I derive something like an 'average marginal effect' interpretation from the coefficient? Something along the lines of: 'On average a 1% increase in the input variable yields to a x percentage points decline in the capfactor variable'.
