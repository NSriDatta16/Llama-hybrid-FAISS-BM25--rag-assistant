Should I use mean centering or not?

I am using a logistic regression model. I want to see interaction effect of a continuous Independent variable on the relationship of another binary independent variable and the dependent variable(DV is also binary). Should I use the direct product of the continuous and the binary variable or I should first do mean-centering for the continuous variable in my case? Just to add here, I have tried both techniques and getting better results with mean-centered DV but I want to know if I should also do mean-centering for binary variables or not?
