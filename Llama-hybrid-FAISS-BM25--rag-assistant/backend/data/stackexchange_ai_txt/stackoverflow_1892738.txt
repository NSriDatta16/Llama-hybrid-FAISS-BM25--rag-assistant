The fragment of a URL is not sent to the server, it’s meant for local usage only: […] the fragment identifier is not used in the scheme-specific processing of a URI; instead, the fragment identifier is separated from the rest of the URI prior to a dereference, and thus the identifying information within the fragment itself is dereferenced solely by the user agent, regardless of the URI scheme. So there is no way to remove it from a request with mod_rewrite since the server doesn’t know anything about the fragment. But the client obviously does know. So you can use some client side techniques like JavaScript to remove or adjust the fragment.
