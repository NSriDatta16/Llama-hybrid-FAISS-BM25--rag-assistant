I am assuming from your question, code, naming conventions, and comment that you are working with a beta prior on a binomial likelihood. Let's start by defining the Bayes Factor (BF) which is $BF_{12} = \frac{Pr(D|H_1)}{Pr(D|H_2)}$. Here I am using the notation from the Kass and Raftery http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~kass/papers/bayesfactors.pdf paper a worthwhile read if you'd like to learn more about Bayes Factors. Now the question is how to calculate $\Pr(D|H_i)$? To do this you need your likelihood and prior. Assuming binomial likelihood and beta prior you calculate the integral, good notation here helps. Here is the integral: $\Pr(D|H_j)= \int_0^1 \Pr(D|p,H_j)\pi(p|H_j)$. In this case the 2 separate hypthesis are a bit different in approach. The first one assumes the two $p_i$s are the same therefore the priors must have the same values of the parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$. So the Typical Bayesian calculus of prior times likelihood ad integrating out the $p$ parameter yields $m1 ={n_1+n_2\choose x_1+x_2}\frac{ \Gamma(\alpha+\beta) }{ \Gamma(\alpha) \Gamma(\beta) }\frac{ \Gamma(x_1+x_2+\alpha)\Gamma(n_1+n_2-x_1-x_2+\beta)}{\Gamma(n_1+n_2+\alpha+\beta )}$. Note that this result is obtained by incorporating the null hypothesis of equality ($p_1=p_2$) into the likelihood and prior. For the second hypothesis you have no constraint on $p_i, i=1,2$. Although not stated in the OP I will assume independence of $p_i$s. Therefore, a similar integral of the product of 2 likelihoods (but this time with different $p_i$s and 2 priors gives $m2 ={n_1\choose x_1}{n_2\choose x_2}\frac{ \Gamma(\alpha_1+\beta_1) }{ \Gamma(\alpha_1) \Gamma(\beta_1) }\frac{ \Gamma(\alpha_2+\beta_2) }{ \Gamma(\alpha_2) \Gamma(\beta_2) }\frac{ \Gamma(x_1+\alpha_1)\Gamma(n_1-x_1+\beta_1)}{\Gamma(n_1+\alpha_1+\beta_1 )} \frac{ \Gamma(x_2+\alpha_2)\Gamma(n_2-x_2+\beta_2)}{\Gamma(n_2+\alpha_2+\beta_2 )}$ Now these two values ($m_i,i=1,2$) can be easily calculated for the specific values of $n_i$, $\alpha_i$, $\beta_i$, for $i=1,2$ in the OP. This can be done in R language for example via the corresponding choose() and Gamma() functions to calculate $m_i$ and then divide $m_1/m_2$.
