Apart from Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course and Datacamp I will also add the 10 course specialization - Data Science Specialization by John Hopkins University offered on Coursera. It covers pretty much everything from importing and cleansing of data, to the application of Machine Learning algorithms and showcasing your results. Regarding your project, the first step is ensure what you want to do, what is the problem statement or the right question. Second step, get the data. Stock market data is mostly open for use. Third step, feature selection and engineering which is essentially selecting or building features which will help in determining relationship and finding structure/pattern. There are many machine learning algorithms which you can use. Time series analysis is used mostly for this problem domain but since it is little complex you can try out different classification techniques like kNN, Naive Bayes, SVM to determine if the stock will be good or bad. Choose a data science tool where you can implement your algorithm. It could be either R, Python, SAS, MATLAB to name a few. All the best.
