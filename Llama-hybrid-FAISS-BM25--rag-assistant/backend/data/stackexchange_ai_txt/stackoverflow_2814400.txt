Run sysinternals file monitor and process monitor to find excessive I/O. Most easily done when peformance drags when they run particular reports or programs. Partner with your Oracle DBA to monitor the database peformance. Partner with the sysadmin to monitor the disks that the Oracle tables reside on. You're looking for poorly-executed queries resulting in full table scans, matrix results, etc.. Have sysadmin/netadmin monitor network saturation. Copy production data and code to another, isolated test system and measure performance. See where CPU and Disk performance go through the roof. Note that FileMonitor output is .csv format and will quickly overwhelm Excel. But Excel can treat that .csv as an external datasource and you can connect it to a Pivot Table. Just use the Pivot Table wizard, point to the report file (.txt) and measure the application name, dataset filename, and bytes read/written. You'll quickly find the files that are being hammered with I/O. Sometimes solutions are simple, such as wrapping thousands of database updates with a transaction.
