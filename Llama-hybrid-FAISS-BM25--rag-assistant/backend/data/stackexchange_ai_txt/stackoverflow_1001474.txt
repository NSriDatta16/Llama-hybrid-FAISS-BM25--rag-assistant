You can dynamically add a where clause to your IQueryable expression like this: var finalQuery = opportunities.Where( x => x.Title == title ); and for the date similarly. However, you will have to wait to create your anonymous type until after you've finished dynamically added your where clauses if your anonymous type doesn't contain the fields you want to query for in your where clause. So you might have something that looks like this: var opportunities = from opp in oppDC.Opportunities join org in oppDC.Organizations on opp.OrganizationID equals org.OrgnizationID select opp if(!String.IsNullOrEmpty(title)) { opportunities = opportunities.Where(opp => opp.Title == title); } //do the same thing for the date opportunities = from opp in opportunities select new { opp.OpportunityID, opp.Title, opp.PostedBy, opp.Address1, opp.CreatedDate, org.OrganizationName };
