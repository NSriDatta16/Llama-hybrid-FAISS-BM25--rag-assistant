I did this for a client a while back -- at deployment depending on a property set in a production.properties file I changed out the hibernate.dialect in the cfg file using Ant (you can use any xml transformer). However this would only work if the Hibernate code is seamless btw both DBs i.e. no db-specific function calls etc. HQL/JPAQL has standard function calls that help ion this regard like UPPER(s) , LENGTH(s) etc. If the db implementations must necessarily be different then you'd have to do something like what @matt suggested.
