ASP.NET - collaboration between designer and developer

Our organization has dedicated designers who design the page and cut it up in Dreamweaver. That's worked well in the past with ASP and PHP sites. Now we're trying to make it work with .NET, but are struggling because of the structure of a project in ASP.NET. How does everybody collaborate with developers? The specific points I am looking for are: -Transferring Dreamweaver content to Visual Studio -Changing HTML inputs to server controls -Giving designer access to finished Visual Studio product so they can tweak layout Thanks!
