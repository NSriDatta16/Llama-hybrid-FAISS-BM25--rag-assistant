Because, as you say, a log-difference only approximates percentage changes. When something goes up by 10% and then down by 10%, you are not back at the original value. Log-differences are symmetric. See also Are log difference time series models better than growth rates? . This follows from Taylor-expanding the log as in $$ \log(x)=\log(x_0)+\frac{1}{x_0}(x-x_0)+\text{Remainder} $$ so that $$ \log(x)-\log(x_0)\approx\frac{x-x_0}{x_0}, $$ where the approximation is good when $x$ and $x_0$ are close.

The dark green curve is the log-function, the light green the Taylor approximation $\log(x_0)+(x-x_0)/x_0$ so that the red bar is the approximation error at the new value x_n : Code: x_0
