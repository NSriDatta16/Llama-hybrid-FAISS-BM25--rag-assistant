In general, if you encrypt a file with k-bit AES then again with k-bit AES, you only get (k+1) bits of security, rather than 2k bits of security, with a man-in-the-middle attack. The same holds for most types of encryption, like DES. (Note that triple-DES is not simply three rounds of encryption for this reason.) Further, encrypting a file with method A and then with method B need not be even as strong as encrypting with method B alone! (This would rarely be the case unless method A is seriously flawed, though.) In contrast, you are guaranteed to be at least as strong as method A. (Anyone remembering the name of this theorem is encouraged to leave a comment; I've forgotten.) Usually you're much better off simply choosing a single method as strong as possible. For your second question: Yes, with most methods, an attacker would know that the first layer had been compromised.
