Turns out this is what you have to do: Go to Organiser Go to Project tab Select your project Select the Delete button on the right hand side where it says "Derived Data includes Index, build output and logs" Close the project or workspace. Re-open the project or workspace. Note that the comments are correct. This approach does delete the index, and build output in addition to the logs. It does warn that "The first indexing and rebuild of a project after that may be slower".
