correlation or co-movement of two time-series in R

I have two financial time series, which are showing the same behavior. Frequency and time frame is the same. I want to prove that they are correlated / prove their co-movement. Is Pearson correlation a good idea? Or are their other ideas? Any help will greatly be appreciated!
