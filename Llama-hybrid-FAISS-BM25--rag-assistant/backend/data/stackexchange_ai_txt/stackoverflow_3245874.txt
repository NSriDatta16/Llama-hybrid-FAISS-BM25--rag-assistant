fatal error Varien_Autoload not found

Goodday everyone, I installed magento with the sample data I refreshed the page and everything seemed to work. My complete shop was filled with sample data. A couple of minutes after I refreshed again and since then I keep getting this error: PHP Fatal error: Class 'Varien_Autoload' not found in /var/www/vhosts/shop.cyberned.com/httpdocs/app/Mage.php on line 53 I double checked if Varien_Autoload exists and it is there in lib/Varien/Autoload.php It looks like that file is not included for some reason but I would have no idea how to get that fixed. So my question is: how do I get this fixed?
