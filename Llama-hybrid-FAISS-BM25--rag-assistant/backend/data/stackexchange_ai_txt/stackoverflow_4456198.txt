How do I hide 4 alphanumeric characters in PNG using steganography in C?

I've seen a bunch of sample code that does a lot more than I want to do and it seems to have more overhead than I would like (perhaps this is unavoidable). All I want is to hide/retrieve a 4 letter message (word) in/from a PNG file. These 4 letters will never change. It will always be the same 4 letters. It's purpose is simply to act as a simple kind of fingerprint. All of the examples I see seem very complex and involve compressing text files and such. Does anyone know of any sample code that has been written that is relevant to this kind of endeavor? Any language is fine -- mine will eventually need to be C or Obj-C.
