As others have said, this is all about string interpolation. The constant pragma fails in interpolative contexts, so you have to use something that will work. As already mentioned, Readonly is one option. You can also use the old "assign a read-only value to a typeglob trick". our $FILES_PATH; # declare FILES_PATH scalar to keep strict happy. *FILES_PATH = \'files'; # Assign to typeglob so $FILES_PATH points to a string literal while( ) { # read the files }
