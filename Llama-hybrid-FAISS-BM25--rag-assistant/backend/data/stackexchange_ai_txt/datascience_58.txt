You can check out vowpal wabbit . It is quite popular for large-scale learning and includes parallel provisions. From their website: VW is the essence of speed in machine learning, able to learn from terafeature datasets with ease. Via parallel learning, it can exceed the throughput of any single machine network interface when doing linear learning, a first amongst learning algorithms.
