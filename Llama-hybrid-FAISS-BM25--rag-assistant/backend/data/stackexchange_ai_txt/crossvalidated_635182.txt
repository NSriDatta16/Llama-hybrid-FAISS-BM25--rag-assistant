What is the most appropriate index for categorical data clustering?

I am trying to replicate a study published by Bai & Liang, 2022 which focuses on clustering purely categorical data which are mostly found in the UCI repository . In my experiment for K-Modes, I have observed that the indices which includes the Normalized Variation of information (NVI), Normalized Information Distance (NDI), Normalized Mutual Information (NMI), Adjusted Mutual Information (AMI), and Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) are no better than random labelling, upon checking with the published paper, the values for NMI and ARI that were reported by the authors where are all above 0.5. However, the Folkes-Mallows Index seems to show relatively good values. I wanted to know why is this happening, that is I am trying to investigate this observable deviation. My first suspicion is that the number of optimal clusters is just too high, which makes comparing between the original cluster label (ranging between 2 clusters to 4 clusters) and the generated clusters labels too difficult. For context I ran K-Modes 100 times and I averaged the values of the indices which is reported in this table: Given the reported values, I am wondering if NVI, NID, NMI, AMI and ARI are really a good measures for categorical data clustering, or should I use measures of internal consistency, like running a Latent Class Analysis on each cluster to check for internal consistency as an alternative measure for clustering performance. Furthermore, I am also wondering if Chi-Square distance might also be a good alternative.
