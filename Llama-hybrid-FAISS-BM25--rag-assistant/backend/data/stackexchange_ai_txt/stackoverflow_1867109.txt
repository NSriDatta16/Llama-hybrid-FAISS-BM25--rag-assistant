mjv is right. You can use double-buffers and overlapped I/O. That way your crunching and the disk reading can be happening at the same time. Then I would profile or stack-shot the crunching to make it as fast as possible. With luck it will be faster than the I/O, so you will end up running the I/O at top speed without pause. Then things like file fragmentation come into the picture.
