grep solution: command | grep -E "^([^ ]+ ){4}r" What this does (-E switches on extended regexp): The first caret (^) matches the beginning of the line. [^ ] matches exactly one occurence of a non-space character, the following modifier (+) allows it to also match more occurences. Grouped together with the trailing space in ([^ ]+ ), it matches any sequence of non-space characters followed by a single space. The modifyer {4} requires this construct to be matched exactly four times. The single "r" is then the literal character you are searching for. In plain words this could be written like "If the line starts with four strings that are followed by a space and the next character is , then the line matches." A very good introduction into regular expressions has been written by Jan Goyvaerts (http://www.regular-expressions.info/quickstart.html).
