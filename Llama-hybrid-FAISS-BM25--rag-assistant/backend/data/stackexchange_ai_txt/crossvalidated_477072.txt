I believe from what you have given that you could make a multinomial logistic regression in R. Here, you obtain which variables (Gender, AgeGroup etc.) are predictors for a drop out at 1, 2, 3 or 4. You can even add numerical data to it as well in case you have that. A good idea is to read a bit more about the logistic regression, the possibilities and limitations your dataset may have, here . Edit: After being notified by Antoine, the link refers to Logistic Regression in R, Richard Blissett, 2017. Other references could be: Multinomial regression in R, Iegor Rudnytskyi, 2018 on R-bloggers, here .
