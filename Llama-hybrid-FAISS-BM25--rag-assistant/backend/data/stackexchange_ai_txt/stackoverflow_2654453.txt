Prevent overlapping DragDrop Images in Flex

I am trying to create basically a puzzle in Flex Builder 3. I display images from an array onto a canvas that can be dragged and dropped around the canvas. My problem is that I don't want the images to be able to overlap each other. Any ideas on how to prevent this?? They can overlap as you drag but not when dropped, they need to "snap" to the nearest point that is not already occupied by another image.
