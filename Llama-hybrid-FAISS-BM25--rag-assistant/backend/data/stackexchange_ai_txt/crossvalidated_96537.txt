From the R documentation on factanal : The print method (documented under loadings ) follows the factor analysis convention of drawing attention to the patterns of the results, so the default precision is three decimal places, and small loadings are suppressed. From the R documentation on loadings : Small loadings are conventionally not printed (replaced by spaces), to draw the eye to the pattern of the larger loadings. The default value of cutoff ("loadings smaller than this (in absolute value) are suppressed") is .1, so you can infer that the absolute values in those spaces are $ If you want exact values, you can wrap your factanal() function in print(...,cutoff=0) .
