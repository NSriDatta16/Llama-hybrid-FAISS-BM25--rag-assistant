php joomla template (how-to?) the proper way

Greetings all, I just wanted to know what is the proper way to do template's in Joomla? If i have four boxes in footer (4 columns) how can i automate them in the template so their content inside can be managed from the back-end? So far, i have seen custom html block modules and using those. But wouldn't it be funny if there are loads of such blocks and than managing them from modules individually? Now suppose if i have a slogan/tag line for my website; and i want it to be managed from backend.. Do i need to create that custom block even for such single line? May be i am going to wrong direction. Can someone guide me please? Regards, Jhon.
