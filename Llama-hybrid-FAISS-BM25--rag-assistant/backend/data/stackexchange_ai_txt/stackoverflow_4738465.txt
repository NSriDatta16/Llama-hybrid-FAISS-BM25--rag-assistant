Getting javascript events to an object that's covered up

I'm trying to build a jquery app where I have a fixed image and a second draggable image. I need the fixed image to display z-index on top of the moveable image -- the fixed image is a picture with an alpha cut-out hole for a face like you might find at an amusement park. The problem is that as soon as the moveable (face) image is overlapping with the fixed image, click and drag events get captured by the fixed image which is on top and don't get to the moveable image. So it's no longer moveable. Here's my code... $(function() { $("#face").draggable(); }); How can I get the face object to be draggable when it's behind the fixed background? Can I manually fire the mouse events on the object underneath? If so, how do I invoke them so the jquery-ui draggable() works properly? Can I somehow get the fixed image just not to capture events? Or do I need to write my own draggable mechanism by hand?
