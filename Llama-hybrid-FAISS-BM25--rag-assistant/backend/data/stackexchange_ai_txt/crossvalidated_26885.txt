If you are concerned about sample size and significance, good concepts to start out with include effect size and power (while on the topic of CIs, you might want to include accuracy as well) As noted previously, 95% CI refers not to probability but to confidence; it is not the likelihood that the current CI contains the population parameter, but that out of 100 CIs 95 CIs will succeed in capturing the population parameter. The true probability remains unknown (unless you take a Bayesian approach), see Explorations in statistics: confidence intervals .
