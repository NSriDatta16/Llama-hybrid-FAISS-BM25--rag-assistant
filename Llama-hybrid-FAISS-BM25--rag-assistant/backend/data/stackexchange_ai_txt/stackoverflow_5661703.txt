I usually store global scripts in a single common file, and each page has its separate script file. You can store page specific script files along with the page (in the same folder) or replicate the directory structure of the site inside a common "scripts" folder (useful if you have many many script files), both ways I have the script files named as their page counterpart, to make mappings easy. Also, you can use namespaces to further organize your code.
