Quoting David Flanagan 1 : As a special case, for the new operator only, JavaScript simplifies the grammar by allowing the parenthesis to be omitted if there are no arguments in the function call. Here are some examples using the new operator: o = new Object; // Optional parenthesis omitted here d = new Date(); ... Personally, I always use the parenthesis, even when the constructor takes no arguments. In addition, JSLint may hurt your feelings if you omit the parenthesis. It reports Missing '()' invoking a constructor , and there doesn't seem to be an option for the tool to tolerate parenthesis omission. 1 David Flanagan: JavaScript the Definitive Guide: 4th Edition (page 75)
