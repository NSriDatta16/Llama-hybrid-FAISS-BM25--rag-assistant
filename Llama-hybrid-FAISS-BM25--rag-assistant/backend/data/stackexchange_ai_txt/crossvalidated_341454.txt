For the problem you describe, you could use the Proportional Hazards survival model as developed by Cox. Consider each car an object, which may obtain a major failure ( the event , as sampled in this application of the Proportional Hazards model). You can define the model by \begin{equation} \lambda(t \mid {\it {\bf X}}_i) = \lambda_0(t)\,exp(\beta_1\,X_{i,1},\beta_2\,X_{i,2},\ldots\,\beta_{p}\,X_{i,p}) \end{equation} where $\lambda_0$ is the average survival time and each parameter $\beta_j$ an explanatory variable which influences how long each car remains on the road (the different spare parts in your prediction problem). Each parameter $\beta_j$ indicates the weight of each indicator variable $X_{i,\,j}$, actually a boolean being $1$ when part $j$ was replaced in the car, and $0$ when not.
