Getting the location of the user.config file of any .net application

I have a main application that saves settings to a user.config file. I have a second app that needs to read a setting from this file. Is there a simple/elegant way to get the location of the user.config file of the main app? I guess i could build up the path manually from [Application.LocalUserAppDataPath][CompanyName][AppName + some sort of guid][App version] but that seems mightily hacky.
