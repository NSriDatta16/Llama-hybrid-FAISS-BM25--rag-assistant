It may be worth noting that the TFS2010 build process is based around Workflow (including the box-dragging UI if you prefer to use that). It's not as central as WPF or WCF, but it definitely has its uses. One issue I've seen is that worfklow is more fundamental to an application than the others: replacing a UI with WPF doesn't require a ground-up rearchitecture to work. Likewise, creating a WCF web-service layer doesn't require ground-up rearchitecture. Integrating workflow usefully often requires much bigger and deeper changes to be effective, making the barrier to entry that significant bit higher for most systems I've looked at.
