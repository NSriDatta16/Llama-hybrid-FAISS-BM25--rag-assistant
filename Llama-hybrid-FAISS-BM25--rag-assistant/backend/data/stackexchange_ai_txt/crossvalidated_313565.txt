First, Bayes theorem doesn't make predictions. It's a mathematical law. But you have to get the probabilities right for it to work. Second, you may be thinking of a Bayesian approach to data analysis. This does depend on priors but a) Sometimes (often) a uniform prior is chosen b) Other times, the prior is based on actual data. Third, Kahnemann and Tversky really have nothing to do with this. They talk about how people reason with probability, even if the probabilities are given to them. For instance, a 10% risk of death is not viewed the same way as a 90% chance of survival. K & T do a lot of damage to the notion of a "rational human" but that's more about economics than statistics.
