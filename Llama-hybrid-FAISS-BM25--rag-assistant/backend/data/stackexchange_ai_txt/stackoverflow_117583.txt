Going by the example further down the page, the callback function can take as many of the parameters as you need: onDrop: function() { $('droppable_demo').highlight(); } In this case, they have used none of the callback parameters. To this end, presumably to access all three as mentioned in the paragraph you quoted, you can define: onDrop: function(dragged, dropped, event) { }
