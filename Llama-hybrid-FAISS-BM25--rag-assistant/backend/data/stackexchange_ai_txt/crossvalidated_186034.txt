Here are three examples (taken from Greenberg, Introduction to Bayesian Econometrics, if I remember correctly) for transition matrices, the first two for the reducible case, the last for the irreducible one. \begin{eqnarray*} P_1 &=& \left( \begin{array}{cccc} 0.5 & 0.5 & 0 & 0 \\ 0.9 & 0.1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0.2 & 0.8 \\ 0 & 0 & 0.7 & 0.3 \end{array} \right) \\\\ P_2 &=& \left( \begin{array}{cccc} 0.1 & 0.1 & 0.4 & 0.4 \\ 0.5 & 0.1 & 0.1 & 0.3 \\ 0.2 & 0.4 & 0.2 & 0.2 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1% \end{array} \right) \end{eqnarray*} For $P_1$ , when you are in state 3 or 4, you will stay there, and the same for states 1 and 2. There is no way to get from state 1 to state 3 or 4, for example. For $P_2$ , you can get to any state from states 1 to 3, but once you are in state 4, you will stay there. $$P_3=\left( \begin{array}{cccccc} 0.5 & 0.5 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0.9 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0.1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0.8 & 0 & 0.2 \\ 0.7 & 0 & 0.1 & 0 & 0.2 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0.1 & 0.9 & 0 \\ 0.9 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0.1 & 0% \end{array} \right)$$ For this example, you may start in any state and can still reach any other state, although not necessarily in one step.
