Self Selection bias for estimating a valiable correlated to the selector

I am trying to find a way to see if a measured variable between two groups is significantly different. This would normally be done through a t-test if the two groups were randomly selected from the population. However, in my case the two group are not randomly selected. They are selected by a binary variable which is strongly correlated to the measured variable. As a toy example say we are trying to find if having a profile on an e-commerce site causes users to spend more. If we look at the two groups (with and without a profile) there is a statistically significant greater mean spend by the group who has a profile. However we know that users that expect to spend often are more likely to set up an account in the first place since they are more engaged. Is there a way to compensate for this so that one could confidently assert that encouraging users to create a profile is likely to increase revenue for the e-commerce site?
