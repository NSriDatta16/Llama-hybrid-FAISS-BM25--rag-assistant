The link grammar parser provides some deep grammar information like connection between nouns and various kinds of post-noun modifiers (see M and many other). However postprocess the resulting parse graph can be tedious, if you are only interested in tagging and/or NER, take a look at: http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/tagger.shtml http://nlp.stanford.edu/ner/index.shtml Link grammar and the Stanford parser are two of the best current parser for English. You should be able to get descent results.
