Unable to build for Ad Hoc using Xcode

I have an app that builds and runs just fine on either the device or simulator. I want to send it to a friend to test, but I can't seem to build using the Ad Hoc provisioning profile. The profile was created and moved to the Xcode icon on the tray... The provisioning profile appears in Xcode Organizer. What am I doing wrong?
