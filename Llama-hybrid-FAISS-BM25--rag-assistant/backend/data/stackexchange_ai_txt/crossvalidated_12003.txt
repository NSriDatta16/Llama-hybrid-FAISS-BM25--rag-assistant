As @Dirk Eddelbuettel already mentioned, your questions is not very clear. In fact, I think you are asking two questions. The first question is related to your M(C)AR assumption. The second question is about (an) appropriate R package(s). (1) "Testing" for MAR To test if age has an effect on the missingness of your score variable, you could run a simple logistic regression model with age as a predictor variable. Your response variable is 0: score is not missing, 1: score is missing (see also @mbq's answer and @Macro's comment). Given the assumption that younger children are more likely to not report math scores, we expect to see a significant negative effect of age . ## Make up some data set.seed(2) ## Younger children are more likely to not report math scores, ## so I use a Poisson distribution to model that behaviour missData summary(glm(miss ~ age, data=dfr, family=binomial)) [...] Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 5.9729 1.4946 3.996 6.43e-05 *** age -0.7997 0.1760 -4.544 5.53e-06 *** --- [...] (2) (Some) Missing data related R packages Some of these packages also have functions to explore patterns of missingness (e.g., missing.pattern.plot() in the mi package).
