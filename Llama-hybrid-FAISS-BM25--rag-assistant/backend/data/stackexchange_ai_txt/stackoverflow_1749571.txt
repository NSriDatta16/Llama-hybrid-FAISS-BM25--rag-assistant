What is the purpose of having both NSMutableString and NSString?

Why does Objective C provide both class NSString and subclass NSMutableString rather than just provide NSMutableString? Isn't a NSString equivalent to "const NSMutableString"? In C++, you have only one string class, std::string, and if you want a constant you declare a const std:string. I'm interested in knowing why I shouldn't just use NSMutableString everywhere and never bother with NSString? There must be a reason, or the language designers wouldn't provide both. maybe it takes up less storage or something?
