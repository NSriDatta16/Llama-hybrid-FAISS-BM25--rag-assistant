The demos on jqueryui Sortable show no extra draggable call, as far as I can see: http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/ . Have you tried to do with a sortable call only? EDIT: I can see that your code is similar to the "Draggable + Sortable" example on the jqueryui site. However, that example always clones the element at the top and inserts the clone into the sortable list, so that's not what you want to achieve.
