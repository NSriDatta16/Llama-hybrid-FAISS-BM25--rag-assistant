I'd generally make a separate test. If I'm testing a "get" type method, the test setup would insert the object (generally by way of some mock framework) I expect to get as necessary, it just wouldn't be asserted against in the same way the actual get would. This does mean that if the add implementation breaks, both the tests for the get and the add will fail in one way or another, assuming proper coverage. But that's kind of what you want anyhow, right?
