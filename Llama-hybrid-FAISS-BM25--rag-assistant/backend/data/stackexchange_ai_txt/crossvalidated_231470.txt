Since you are doing dimensionality reduction already (via PCA), then a simple thing to do would be to use the shorter length as your base, and split any longer series into multiple (redundant) series. Say you start with two time series, $x_t$ and $y_t$, where $t=1,2,\ldots,n$. However $y$ has a secular trend, so you want to difference it, and use $\Delta y_t=y_{t+1}-y_t$ instead. A simple option is to increase the dimensionality of your "data" from 2 to 3, adding a "look ahead" version of $x$. So now your data would be $x_t$, $x_{t+1}$, and $\Delta y_t$, where now $t=1,2,\ldots,n-1$. Here the idea would be that if the two $x$ series have the "same information", then the PCA will tell you this. Without knowing more about your particular data and application, I cannot say whether or not this technique would be appropriate (e.g. in terms of causality or your system dynamics).
