Forecasting time series based on a behavior of other one

Apologies for this vague and unclear question, I have no background in statistics. I have two vectors of time series data, covering a six month period. The data is in daily intervals (except for weekends). The first vector contains the stock volume for a company on each of the days. The second vector contains an external volume variable (the number of Google searches) taken on the same date. As visible on the graph above, (which is out of scale etc.) there is some type of relationship between the two. I want to model the two time series as to predict a future stock volume values. So far I have briefly looked into: support vector machines for regression: but when I plotted the data on a scatter graph there isn't any clear relationship, so this made me think that the SVM approach would fail. time series analysis: this approach confused me because there isn't any obvious trends in the data Can anyone offer any advice on what I approach I should take?
