Binary classification on imbalance data with missing values and almost equal dimensions?

I have a data set with following qualities : Attributes: 500 Instances: 1500 Class Ratio: 1:15 Missing Values: Yes ~5% How should I perform classification on this data which can give me best results. The following things I have tried so far so far: Replaced missing values with mean (For time being, will be performing NA imputation using sophisticated methods) PCA (dimensionality reduction, reduced no. of columns from 500 to 30 with almost 90% data quality) Oversampling the minorities Ada boost algorithm for classification Am I correct in my analysis? Although I am getting 100% accuracy overall and for both classes also. Is there anyway I can oversample this data without doing PCA ? I have tried SMOTE but that is throwing some colnames() error which I have no clue of. Is there any package in R for any algorithm like ada boost , random forest , ipred which can take care of cost-sensitivity for such analysis? Or may be a tuning parameters for these algorithms by which I can set the cost parameter for minority class?
