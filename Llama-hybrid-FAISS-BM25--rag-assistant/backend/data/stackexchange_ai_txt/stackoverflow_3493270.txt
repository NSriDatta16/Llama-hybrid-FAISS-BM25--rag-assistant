I found a way that requires just a little more setup, but is much easier for non-developers: Instructions for your users/testers: Install Xcode following Apple's instructions Double-click the attached application - the iPhone simulator will launch, install the app and start it automatically. How to set it up: Download and unzip (to a folder on your desktop or wherever) 'Simulator Bundler' from: http://github.com/landonf/simlaunch/downloads Set your XCode build target to the required Simulator configuration (iPad/iPhone/which iOS version) Do a 'Build and archive' Find it: select 'Archived applications' in the Organizer, right click the relevant build, select "Reveal archived application in Finder" Drag the application (yourAppName, no extension) onto the Simulator Bundler app Done. This will create a self-contained Mac OS X yourAppDisplayName.app file in the same folder (with your app's icon as the icon) that you can stick up on an FTP server or email to your users/testers. -- I think it's much neater/slicker than having to explain where to copy files, how to launch the simulator and so on.. And if anything gets messed up they can just uninstall via the familiar tap-and-hold + (x) gesture in the simulator UI, then double-click the app you sent them again. You can also produce several of these packages changing the bundle identifier between builds, allowing them to be installed side by side in your testers' simulators; say for getting some user feedback on different UI designs, or configure one for Production and one for Staging/QA servers, so your content editors can check their changes before they go live or whatever.. The ability to reinstall the app from a desktop icon is also very convenient for localisation testing: launch the simulator, uninstall the app if present, set the required region format and language, double click the icon on your desktop, test; repeat for each required locale. (guarantees a fresh install each time, I've found that switching language with the app installed can result in all sorts of strange behaviour)
