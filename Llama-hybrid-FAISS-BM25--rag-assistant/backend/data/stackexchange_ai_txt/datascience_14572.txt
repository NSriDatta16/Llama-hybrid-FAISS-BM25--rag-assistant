Reinforcement learning is the intersection of machine learning, decisions & control, and behavioral psychology. The intersection can be approached from all the three sides. Let me give you a short description from every angle- Machine Learning From the ML perspective, RL is the paradigm of learning to control. Think about how you learned to cycle or play a sport. These learning tasks are not supervised - no one tells you the correct move to make in a board position, or exactly the amount of angle to lean sideways to balance the cycle. They are also not completely unsupervised since some feedback is observed - whether you won or lost the game after a sequence of moves, how frequently do you fall from cycle. Thus, RL is learning to make good decisions from partial evaluative feedback. Control & Decision theory In control theory (and AI planning), perfect knowledge about the world is assumed, and the objective is to find the best way to behave. However, for many problems knowledge about the world is not perfect. Hence, exploring the world could increase our knowledge and eventually help us make better decisions. RL is balancing the exploration-exploitation trade-off in sequential decision-making problems. Behavioral Psychology The simplified goal of behavioral psychology is to explain why, when , and how humans make decisions. We consider humans as rational agents, and hence psychology is also to some extent trying to explain rational behavior. One can study the biological principles of how opinions are formed, which have close connections to temporal difference learning and eligibility traces. RL is the paradigm to explain how humans form opinions and learn to make good decisions with experience. This was a short description from every important perspective.
