I've done this, the way Jon Hess mentions first. Assuming you're using Interface Builder version 3: Drag and resize your GUI (tableview from what I understand?) component to fit into the enclosing area the way you want it. Click it to select it. Press Command-Shift-I to open the inspector window for this GUI component. The inspector window should now actually show that you've selected a "Scroll View". Click the "ruler" heading to be able to set the sizing. You'll see to the right an animated representation of how your GUI component will behave within its enclosing GUI component, and to the left another represenation of the same, without animation, but with four springs and two struts that you can turn on or off. Turn all six things on, making them red. Voil√† :-)
