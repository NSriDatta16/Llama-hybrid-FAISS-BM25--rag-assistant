The reason it's not supported natively is because we want to discourage developers from doing it. Areas are not associated with controllers; they're associated with routes . We wanted to discourage developers from trying to apply authorization or other security-sensitive filters to areas since they can be bypassed. See How can we set authorization for a whole area in ASP.NET MVC? for more information.
