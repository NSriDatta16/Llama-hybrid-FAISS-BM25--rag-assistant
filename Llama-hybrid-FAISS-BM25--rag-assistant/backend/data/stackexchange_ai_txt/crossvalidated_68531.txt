You cannot reach the conclusion that "the probability doubles for females". But your figures are a little misleading since the $y$-axes do not start from zero. It also seems that the percentages are just approximations from the figures. We can always interpret regression coefficient as the association between $X$ and $Y$ on average . Subject specific coefficient is the association between $X$ and $Y$ holding constant the random effects, and it describes how an individual's probability of missing depends on gender. There is no concept of "average female/male individual" here. Population average coefficient is the association between $X$ and $Y$ based on averaging over the random effects, rather than the typical one for an individual subject. According to your cause, the population average estimate fits your need.
