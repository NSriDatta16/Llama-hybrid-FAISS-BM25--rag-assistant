The biggest one is making sure you don't put pointers into 32-bit storage locations. But there's no proper 'language-agnostic' answer to this question, really. You couldn't even get a particularly firm answer if you restricted yourself to something like standard 'C' or 'C++' - the size of data storage, pointers, etc, is all terribly implementation dependant.
