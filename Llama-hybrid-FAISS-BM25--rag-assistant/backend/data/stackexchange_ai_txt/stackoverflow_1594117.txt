The gold standard for natural language processing is Wordnet at http://wordnet.princeton.edu/ . This has an active user group, has semantics and syntax associated with words, and interfaces with other NLP tools. If you are thinking of doing computation with the words you should definitely have a look. However selecting words at random does not generate a useful sentence and I suspect you will be disappointed with the results. Have a look at toolkits such as OpenNLP where there are many tools including part-of-speech (POS) which you will certainly need. Even when you have sentences that may have valid syntax, you will need to read the work of Chomsky and others. His "Colorless green ideas sleep furiously" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorless_green_ideas_sleep_furiously illustrates the problem.
