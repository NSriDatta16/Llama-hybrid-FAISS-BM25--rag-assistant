Negative binomial distribution for bounded data

Why is the negbin distribution required when the analyzed count data is bounded? I don't really understand the following: "The Poisson distribution can form the basis for some analyses of count data and in this case Poisson regression may be used. This is a special case of the class of generalized linear models which also contains specific forms of model capable of using the binomial distribution (binomial regression, logistic regression) or the negative binomial distribution where the assumptions of the Poisson model are violated, in particular when the range of count values is limited or when overdispersion is present." --- Wikipedia
