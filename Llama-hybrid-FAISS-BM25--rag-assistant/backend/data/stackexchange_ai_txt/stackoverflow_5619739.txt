Paperclip association question

I have two model User and UserAgent User has one UserAgent & UserAgent belongs to User And UserAgent using Paperclip to upload file to server Using this has_attached_file :agreement, :path => "#{Rails.root}/public/upload/new_agreements/:id/:basename.:extension" This working fine.It is creating folders needed to upload the file. But i need to create the folder like this :path => "#{Rails.root}/public/upload/new_agreements/User:id/:basename.:extension" That means I need to upload the file according to the User.id but not UserAgent.Id Is there any way? You can ask questions if u don't understand the question.
