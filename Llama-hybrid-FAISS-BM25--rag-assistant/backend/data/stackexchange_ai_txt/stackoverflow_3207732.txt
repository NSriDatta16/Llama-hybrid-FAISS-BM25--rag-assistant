How can I tell a shortcut from a file in a C# drag and drop operation?

I have a C# .NET 3.5 app that I have incorporated the DragDrop event on a DataGridView. #region File Browser - Drag and Drop Ops private void dataGridView_fileListing_DragDrop(object sender, DragEventArgs e) { string[] fileList = e.Data.GetData(DataFormats.FileDrop) as string[]; foreach (string fileName in fileList) { //logic goes here } } My question is, how can I differentiate a windows shortcut from an actual file? I tried: File.exists(fileName) in an IF block which is useful to filter out directories that have been dragged in, however shortcuts get through. Is there anyway on to tell a shortcut in the data passed in by the event data, or by querying the file system once I have the name?
