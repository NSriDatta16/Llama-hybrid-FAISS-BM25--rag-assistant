Interpretation of VAR and causality

I have two time series( X1 and X2 ) each having 900 records. I wanted to establish relationship between them and put it in equation. I did following things: 1) Checked for correlation and it came out as 0.80. As I wanted to build robust model, I read further and came to know that correlation is not the right way to find relation between time series as there might be the case of spurious regression. 2) Then I tested both time series for stationarity and I got below p-values. Time series X1 X2 ADF test 0.28 0.07 KPSS test 0.01 0.01 That means I can safely conclude that there is no unit root and both series are stationary. 3) Then I checked for lag length using VARselect and I got below results VARselect(mydata, lag.max=8, type="const") $selection AIC(n) HQ(n) SC(n) FPE(n) 4 2 1 4 $criteria 1 2 3 4 5 AIC(n) 9.536526 9.518359 9.517730 9.514627 9.515910 HQ(n) 9.547980 9.537448 9.544454 9.548987 9.557905 SC(n) 9.566621 9.568517 9.587951 9.604911 9.626258 FPE(n) 13856.729981 13607.265067 13598.708504 13556.586100 13574.003525 6 7 8 AIC(n) 9.518960 9.522675 9.528970 HQ(n) 9.568591 9.579942 9.593872 SC(n) 9.649371 9.673149 9.699507 FPE(n) 13615.481638 13666.186272 13752.515062 I guess that means I should choose 1 as lag length since AIC(n) is highest for 1 . Please correct me if I am wrong. (Data I have is daily for last 3 years.) 4) After performing Johansen's test, ###################### # Johansen-Procedure # ###################### Test type: maximal eigenvalue statistic (lambda max) , without linear trend and constant in cointegration Eigenvalues (lambda): [1] 4.868739e-02 8.650614e-03 -2.834784e-19 Values of teststatistic and critical values of test: test 10pct 5pct 1pct r I guess, it means with 90% confidence, we can say both series are cointegrated at levels. 5) Then I ran Granger test to find out interdependence grangertest(mydata, order=4) Granger causality test Model 1: X2 ~ Lags(X2, 1:4) + Lags(X1, 1:4) Model 2: X2 ~ Lags(X2, 1:4) Res.Df Df F Pr(>F) 1 968 2 972 -4 1.273 0.2788 and I don't know how to interpret this result. 6) Then I ran VAR since both series are stationary and cointegrated at level. > myvar summary(myvar) VAR Estimation Results: ========================= Endogenous variables: X1, X2 Deterministic variables: const Sample size: 978 Log Likelihood: -7412.001 Roots of the characteristic polynomial: 0.9838 0.9403 0.3227 0.256 0.1759 0.1286 Call: VAR(y = mydata, p = 3, type = "const") Estimation results for equation X1: ===================================== X1 = X1.l1 + X2.l1 + X1.l2 + X2.l2 + X1.l3 + X2.l3 + const Estimate Std.

How should I interpret Granger and VAR results? With this approach, how can I put X1 and X2 in equation term? Please let me know if I misinterpreted or missed anything. Thanks for your time and reading.
