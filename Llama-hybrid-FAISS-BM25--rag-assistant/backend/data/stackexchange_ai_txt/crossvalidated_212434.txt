In R, if you read the documentation for the function ?family , you will see the default links in a list at the top: Usage family(object, ...) binomial(link = "logit") gaussian(link = "identity") Gamma(link = "inverse") inverse.gaussian(link = "1/mu^2") poisson(link = "log") quasi(link = "identity", variance = "constant") quasibinomial(link = "logit") quasipoisson(link = "log") You might notice that the default links tend to be the canonical links for the various distributions. However, you can specify alternative links (e.g., family=binomial(link="probit") ), if you prefer. Any function that maps the range of the parameter being fitted (e.g., for logistic regression $\pi_i \in (0, 1)$) to the possible range of the model's right hand side (always $(-\infty, \infty)$) can be acceptable. In fact, you can use a function that doesn't meet this standard so long as the data in your sample don't cause the fitted parameter to go outside of the acceptable range. (For instance, people sometimes use the identity function as their link with count data, or with proportions—e.g., polling results—when the fitted values aren't near the bounds.) I suspect you would benefit from an overview of the generalized linear model and link functions. It may help you to read my answer here: Difference between logit and probit models , which ends up doing some of that even though it was written in a different context. You can also peruse some of the threads categorized under the link-function tag.
