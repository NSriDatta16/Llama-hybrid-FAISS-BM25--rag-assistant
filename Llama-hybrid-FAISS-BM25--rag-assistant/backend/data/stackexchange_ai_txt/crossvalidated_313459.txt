Find out p-value

The average order rate (Orders with revenue > 0) is 58% in the population. How likely is it that the observed sample order rate or greater is because of random chance? I am not able to upload data set here, however, there is a column (named order) having (0 and 1) values. The order rate is based on a variable that has 1/0 values. We want to compare the order rate of sample vs the order rate in the population and then to find out the likelihood of seeing the sample order rate simply because of randomness. How to find out p-value?
