Need help with a large ASP.NET application

We have an ASP classic ERP (very large application) that we want to rewrite using ASP.NET. I am looking for a way to organize the application so we are going to be able to separate every program / webpage (over 400) from each other. Every program needs to be independent because many developers will work on the project at the same time. Visual Studio seems to make a DLL for every assembly so I was wondering if it’s a good idea to make a huge solution with one project per DLL. Ex. : Customers.aspx + Customers.aspx.vb (compiled) for presentation Customers.DLL for the object entity CustomersManager.DLL for business logic CustomersData.DLL for data access This way, we would be able to deploy every program separately without altering the others. We would also have over a thousand DLL to manage… Does it seem to be a good solution for a large scale application? Anyone has a better idea? Thanks
