Interpretation of coxph and cox.zph function result

My output from coxph() and cox.zph() function as follows Call: coxph(formula = Surv(survival.d) ~ stage, data = pancreatic, ties = "breslow") coef exp(coef) se(coef) z p stageM 0.2567 1.2927 0.3988 0.644 0.52 Likelihood ratio test=0.44 on 1 df, p=0.5095 n= 41, number of events= 41 > resid chisq df p stage 1 1 0.32 GLOBAL 1 1 0.32 Sorry for the unorganized output, I am new here so I also want to know how to paste my output properly Anyways, global p value from coxph()function is 0.5095 and p value from cox.zph() is 0.32. So how should I interpret this output? cox.zph() is to check the assumption of proportional hazards model. So based on this I could say assumption holds. However, coxph() is not significant; stage covariates do not make a significant difference on survival rate. Thank you in advance
