I'd probably use something like: (into #{} (mapcat get-origlabels (range *song-count*))) In general, "into" is very helpful when constructing Clojure data structures. I have this mental image of a conveyor belt (a sequence) dropping a bunch of random objects into a large bucket (the target collection).
