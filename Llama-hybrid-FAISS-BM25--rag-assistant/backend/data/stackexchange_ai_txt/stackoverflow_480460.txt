How to efficiently render and process video streams using GPU?

I plan to develop a tool for realtime video manipulation using C++, Qt and OpenGL. Video overlay isn't an option since shaders should be used for frame processing. At the moment I imagine a following sequence of steps: Decode video (CPU) Preprocess it (optional, CPU) Transer it to video memory (GPU using DMA) Further process it using vertex and fragment shaders (GPU) Render it (GPU) I'm looking for some general advice explaning what extentions or technics can be used here. Is there a good reason to use Direct3D instead?
