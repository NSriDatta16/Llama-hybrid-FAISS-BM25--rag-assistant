Palette textures will be expanded on load for the GPU in the iPhone so you won't gain any advantage by using them other than storage size. Your best bet for a cartoon style game is to explore using PVRTC compressed textures (like NeARAZ says) and 16-bit textures (RGBA4444 for alpha, RGBA5551 for punch-through, RGB565 for opaque textures). Using a mixture of both is my own approach.
