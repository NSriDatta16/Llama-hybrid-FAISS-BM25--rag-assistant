Pixel space is fine for exact reconstructions, but suppose your decoder outputs the right answer, shifted over by a couple pixels. This will have a terrible loss in pixel space, but might be fine in feature space. This can result in the network being too conservative in some cases. For many applications, this makes "perceptual" losses superior, when exact reconstruction matters less than perceptual quality. It also implicitly confers a Gaussian noise assumption, resulting in blurry outputs (as in VAEs) in pixel space, whereas "blurriness" in feature space may well still be nice and sharp in pixel space (depending on the manifold defined by the feature space of course).
