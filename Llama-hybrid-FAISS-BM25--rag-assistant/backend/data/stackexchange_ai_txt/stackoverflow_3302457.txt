Serializing Object - Replacing Values

I've got a collection of around 20,000 objects that need to get persisted to my database. Now, instead of doing 20,000 insert statements, I want to pass all the records in using an XML parameter. As far as serializing the object and passing it into the procedure goes, I'm all set. However, I'm wondering if anyone has an elegant way to do the following: In our C# code base; we have some static values that represent a NULL when saved to the database. For example, if an integer equals -1, or a DateTime equals DateTime.MinValue; save NULL. We have our own little custom implementation that handles this for us when saving objects. Is there any way I can do something similar to this when performing the XML serialization? Right now it's outputting -1 and DateTime.MinValue in the XML. I do have an extension method ( IsNull() ) that will return true/false if the value being saved is the null default value. Any suggestions? Tips/Tricks?
