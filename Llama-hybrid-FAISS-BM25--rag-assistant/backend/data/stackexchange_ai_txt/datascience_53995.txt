What does embedding mean in machine learning?

I just met a terminology called "embedding" in a paper regarding deep learning. The context is "multi-modal embedding" My guess: embedding of something is extract some feature of sth,to form a vector. I couldn't get the explicit meaning for this terminology and that stops me from fully understanding the author's idea and model mechanism I check the dictionary and search on line,but the explanation is based more on the real life meaning rather than meaning as a machine learning terminology. And that raise a more generalized and frequently met question, when you find some machine learning terminology/word that you can't understand well, where can you get the solution, some specific way to google? join a machine learning group? raise a question in stack exchange?
