First, I will use some notation to make things easier: $SD(X) = $ standard deviation of $X$ $SD(Y) = $ standard deviation of $Y$ $Var(X) = $ variance of $X = SD(X) \times SD(X)$ $Cov(X,Y) = $ covariance between $X$ and $Y$ $Cor(X,Y) = $ correlation between $X$ and $Y$ Now that you have that down, I should explain what these things mean. Standard Deviation is the measure of how far values deviate from their average value. A low standard deviation indicates that data points tend to be close to the average. A high standard deviation indicates that data points tend to be far away from the average. Covariance is the measure of "joint variability" between two variables (X and Y in this case). Positive covariance means that when values of X increase, values of Y generally also increase. Negative covariance means that when values of X increase, values of Y generally decrease. Zero covariance means that when the values of X increase, this has no effect on Y. Correlation is a standardized way of thinking about covariance. Now on to formulas, then on to your example. $$ N = \text{number in sample from your population} \\ \mu_X = \text{average of X} \\ Var(X) = \frac{1}{N} \times \sum_{i=1}^N (X_i - \mu_X)^2 \\ $$ In your sample, for $N_X = 5$. This means there are 5 observations of $X$ in your sample. $\mu_X$ is the average of $X$, which is calculated like this: $$ \mu_X = \frac{(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5)}{N_X} = \frac{(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5)}{5} = \frac{15}{5} = 3 = \mu_X $$ Now, to calculate variance of X, we use the formula I stated above, which uses summation notation. I will show you the calculation here: $$ Var(X) = \frac{1}{5} \times \{ (1 - 3)^2 + (2 - 3)^2 + (3 - 3)^2 + (4 - 3)^2 + (5 - 3)^2\} \\ = \frac{1}{5} \times \{ 4 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 4 \} = \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 = Var(X) $$ Now that we have the variance of $X$, we can easily get the standard deviation of $X$, since we know that $[SD(X)]^2 = Var(X)$. $$ SD(X) = \sqrt{Var(X)} = \sqrt{2} = SD(X) $$ Now you have the standard deviation of X. We need to get $SD(Y)$ in the same way: $$ \mu_Y = \frac{(3+6+9+12+15)}{N_Y} = \frac{(3+6+9+12+15)}{5} = \frac{45}{5} = 9 = \mu_Y $$ $$ Var(Y) = \frac{1}{5} \times \{ (3 - 9)^2 + (6 - 9)^2 + (9 - 9)^2 + (12 - 9)^2 + (15 - 9)^2\} \\ = \frac{1}{5} \times \{ 36 + 9 + 0 + 9 + 36 \} = \frac{1}{5} \times 90 = \frac{90}{5} = 18 = Var(Y) $$ $$ SD(Y) = \sqrt{Var(Y)} = \sqrt{Var(Y)} = \sqrt{18} $$ Now we move on to covariance, which uses the following formula: $$ Cov(X,Y) = \frac{1}{N} \times \sum_{i=1}^N (X_i - \mu_X)\times(Y_i - \mu_i) $$ This seems tricky, but here is the arithmetic: $$ Cov(X,Y) = \frac{1}{5} \times \{ (1 - 3)(3 - 9) + (2 - 3)(6 - 9) + (3 - 3)(9 - 9) + (4 - 3)(12 - 9) + (5 - 3)(15 - 9) \} \\ = \frac{1}{5} \times \{ (-2)\times(-6) + (-1)\times(-3) + (0)\times(0) + (1)\times(3) + (2)\times(6) \} \\ = \frac{1}{5} \times \{ 12 + 3 + 0 + 3 + 12 \} = \frac{1}{5} \times 30 = 6 = Cov(X,Y) $$ We are almost done! Now we need to calculate correlation, which is just a standardized way to represent covariance that lets us compare two variables with different sized numbers (correlation of ear size to height; sure, they will be correlated, but height will vary a lot more than ear size because the units of height are much larger, causing a larger variance). $$ Cor(X,Y) = \frac{Cov(X,Y)}{SD(X)\times SD(Y)} $$ We know all of the above values, so we can calculate straight-away! $$ Cor(X,Y) = \frac{6}{\sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{18}} = \frac{6}{\sqrt{2 \times 18}} = \frac{6}{\sqrt{36}} = \frac{6}{6} = 1 = Cor(X,Y) $$ This result makes sense, as we see that every time $X$ increases by 1, $Y$ increases by 3. This happens for every movement, meaning that every time $X$ moves, $Y$ will respond linearly, in the same amount, in a perfectly correlated fashion. There you have it, Variance 101.
