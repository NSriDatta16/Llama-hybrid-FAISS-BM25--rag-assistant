Estimating Markov transition probabilities from sequence data

I have a full set of sequences (432 observations to be precise) of 4 states $A-D$: eg $$Y=\left(\begin{array}{c c c c c c c} A& C& D&D & B & A &C\\ B& A& A&C & A&- &-\\ \vdots&\vdots&\vdots&\vdots&\vdots&\vdots&\vdots\\ B& C& A&D & A & B & A\\ \end{array}\right)$$ EDIT : The observation sequences are of unequal lengths! Does this change anything? Is there a way of calculating the transition matrix $$P_{ij}(Y_{t}=j|Y_{t-1}=i)$$ in Matlab or R or similar? I think the HMM package might help. Any thoughts? eg: Estimating Markov chain probabilities
