There are a number of ways to achieve this, all depending on your needs. I found resizing/dragging many windows slows the UI down a lot, and as such I ended up hiding the iframes on start of resize/Drag with a border to help navigation. There are some jquery plugins that achieve part of this functionality, but many struggle with iframes. The bring to front can also be improved at points and may not work in all situations.
