UIPOPOVER for Iphone? or is it fake?

Can anyone take a look a this ? : http://www.woowoomac.com/storage/awesome-note-iphone-note-todo-app-menus.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1268581762429 As we know iphone 4.0 does not support UIPopovers - any idea how did they manage to create a pop over like that ?
