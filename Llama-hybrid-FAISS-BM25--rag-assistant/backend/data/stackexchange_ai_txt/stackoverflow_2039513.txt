Web App GPS Polling

So it looks like mobile phones these days are capable of providing gps data ;) I'm building a django app with a mobile edition that I want to be location aware. My question is, how does one access GPS data? Is there a standard, or do you have to custom code for android/iphone/other. Ideally, I'd imagine it being provided in the HTTP request in the same way you get information such as the IP Address and User Agent.
