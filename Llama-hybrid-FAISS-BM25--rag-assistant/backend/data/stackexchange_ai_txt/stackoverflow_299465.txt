Web-based document sharing for small organizations

In the past I have used nexo.com to share documents with sales, marketing, PR, and technical people for a small startup. But I wonder if there is a better solution to allow different types of geo-graphically dispersed workers to get to a variety of uploaded documents. I don't want to have to build or host this myself, and free or cheap is always nice. I read about Confluence, but it seems to be way more than what I need. I simply want access-controlled folders in the cloud.
