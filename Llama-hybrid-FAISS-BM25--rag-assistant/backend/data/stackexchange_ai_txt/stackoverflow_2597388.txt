Drag and drop between frames - chrome

I have a website http://fewbs.com . I have a shortcuts (bookmarks) section onto the left. Here I provide menus and submenus and drag and drop of shortcuts and menus. Though I have been able to do it in IE and FF but its not working for opera and chrome. In IE it works by default, in FF by using -moz-user-focus: ignore; -moz-user-select: none; . Can anyone suggest how may I be able to achieve the same in opera and chrome?
