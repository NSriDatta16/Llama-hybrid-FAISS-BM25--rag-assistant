DVark, As noted in the accepted answer, for your scenario, RenderAction is the most appropriate. I thought I'd link a little article that distils my thinking on the topic (i.e. when to use RenderPartial vs RenderAction): http://cbertolasio.wordpress.com/2010/09/21/mvc-html-renderaction-vs-html-renderpartial/ hope it helps [edit] - as an aside. a year or so ago, i got myself into a few scrapes by not appreciating the power of RenderAction, in favour of RenderPartial. as a result, i had littered the shared view space with lots of partialviews in order to access them from a variety of sources. the moral of the story: know your 'territory' before planting your flag.
