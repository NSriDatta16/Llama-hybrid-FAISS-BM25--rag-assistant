Yes, there are issues with reporting only k-fold CV results. You could use e.g. the following three publications for your purpose (though there are more out there, of course) to point people towards the right direction: Varma & Simon (2006). "Bias in error estimation when using cross-validation for model selection." BMC Bioinformatics , 7: 91 Cawley & Talbot (2010). "On Over-fitting in Model Selection and Subsequent Selection Bias in Performance Evaluation." Journal of Machine Learning Research , 11: 2079-2107 Bengio & Grandvalet (2004). "No Unbiased Estimator of the Variance of $K$-Fold Cross-Validation." Journal of Machine Learning Research , 5: 1089â€“1105 I personally like those because they try to state the issues more in plain English than in Math.
