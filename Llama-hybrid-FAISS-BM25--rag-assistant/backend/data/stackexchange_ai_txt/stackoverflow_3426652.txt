Trying to use jQuery on my Nokia gives me this error: TypeError: "Object $ (result of expression $) does not allow calls."

flickr Here's a simplified demo: http://jsbin.com/emugo3 try { $(function () { $.noop(); $("#hello").text("it works"); }); } catch (e) { alert(e.message); } The user agent for my phone's browser is: NokiaE71x/ATT.03.28 Mozilla/5.0 SymbianOS/9.3; U; [en]; Series60/3.2; Profile/MIDP-2.1 Configuration/CLDC-1.1 AppleWebKit/413 (KHTML, like Gecko) Safari/413 I've tried googling this error and I've seen people with really old versions of Safari having the same issue, but I haven't seen a solution yet. Does anyone know anything I can try?
