Facebook auth token and asp.net mvc

We have an ASP.Net MVC site that needs to authenticate to facebook to post photos to a user account. All fine so far. Facebook redirect back to the mvc site. Again fine. The url that facebook replies with include the access_token BUT this is prefixed with a # char and MVC strips this and the token from the url so the controller and action get nothing useful. This is using the user agent type of authentication. If we use the standard auth then it works fine but this doesnt give enough access rights. Anyone got any clues ?? Thanks
