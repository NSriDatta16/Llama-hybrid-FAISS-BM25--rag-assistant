Sessions are the right choice. The "global variables are bad" argument is a good one, but it's describing global variables , not session variables and pertains to how you organize data being passed among methods within your application. Storing data between pages can be done in only one of three ways: Store the data in hidden fields or cookies (so everything gets passed back and forth for each page request). You could do this by just serializing your XML and other fancy data, but it sounds like a terrible idea. Store the data in a database , flat file. This is a fine idea, but you'd still have to do the serializing work yourself. Store the data in a session . This is exactly the same as option #2, except that C# is doing the serializing for you, and then saving the results in a flat file. You do not have to do any work to separate the data of one user from another. Every visitor gets a unique session, and the data you store there won't ever be applied to another user (excluding a malicious attack such as a hijacked session).
