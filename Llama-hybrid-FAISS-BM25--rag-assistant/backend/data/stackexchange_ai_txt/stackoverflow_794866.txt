Rolling your own can be as easy as writing the grammar in the first place! It's a great way to learn about parsing, glean a more intimate knowledge of your programming language, and most of all it's fun. The method is called Recursive Descent . It usually comes out much more simple and elegant than what a parser generater, and you'll never have to find a Yacc port/fork again :) For a great tutorial, check out Jack Crenshaw's Let's Build a Compiler Otherwise, Lex and Yacc are the tradional tools while Boost::Spirit is C++ specific and more modern. I would recommend Boost::Spirit as it will help cement the C++ paradigms in your programming.
