How can you test that the slope of lines through pre and post treatment data are significantly different from each other

I have two data sets of time series, estimated fish populations, one pre treatment (n=36) and one post treatment (n=11). The means of the two data sets are not significantly different owing, I think, to high variability in both. If you fit a line to each data set, the pretreatment data shows a positive line slope while the posttreatment line shows a negative line slope. How can you test the two line slopes to show a significant difference between the two?
