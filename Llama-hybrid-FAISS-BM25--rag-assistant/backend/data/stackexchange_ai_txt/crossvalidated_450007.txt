Correlation between two time series of very different frequency?

I am wondering if there is a limit to calculation of the correlation between two vectors symbolizing events of VERY different frequency. A = events that can appear in the millisecond area B = events that appear only several times in 15 minutes. Does it make sense to correlate such unevenly spaced vectors at all? Is there a ratio of the two occurrences where correlation is impossible?
