You need to study (or search for) "power calculations" which allows you to determine your sample size and your test power. You can calculate power for your running test from your sample size and some other factors such as variance and the type of the test used and sometimes other factors. A power > 0.8 is usually considered as appropriate. If your test power sufficed, then it is fine, although you should still state in your limitations that your sample size and power were not pre-determined before the experiments. It is strongly advised to calculate power and sample size Before the experiment (a priori), however many studies still ignore this and calculate their power on journal request (after everything is finished and even the article is written!); but many journals still publish them. So it is still a possibility, although not the best choice. However, if your sample size did not suffice to obtain a good power, you should consider your current study as merely a pilot study and calculate a proper power based on your current pilot study, and according to the proper power, determine and hit a new sample size (and run new experiments until reaching the pre-determined sample size). Now you have a "a priori" power and sample size calculation. And I agree, for being able to clearly answer, the responders need to know about the study design, its goals, the details about the variables and their nature (type), and extra details such as statistical analyses determined etc., in an organized way.
