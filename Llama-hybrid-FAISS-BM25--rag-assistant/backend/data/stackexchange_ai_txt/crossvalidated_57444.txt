NMDS for biomass

I would like to make a NMDS with biomass of different prey groups in stomach content of fish. I have already made one where the data matrix consists of 0 and 1, and this one went fine but are not able to do it when adding the actual weights. I have used the MASS and vegan package. When using binomial data matrix: mymetaMDS and this works fine. But when I try to create the dissimilarity matrix with the weight data matrix: mymetaMDS Error in if (any(dist Any suggestions any one?
