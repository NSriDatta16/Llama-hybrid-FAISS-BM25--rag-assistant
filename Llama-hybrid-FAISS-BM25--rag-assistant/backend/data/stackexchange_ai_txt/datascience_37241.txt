CNN filters are used for edge detection only. These edges are basically detected by a mathematical functions and as a result get more and more complex in deeper layers (cascading functions) enabling it to detect complex features. In your question 2 points need to be noted: Traffic lights are not pure red, green or yellow. They may have intensity differences which will get reflected in the image matrix. CNN can capitalise on those differences. The weights of CNN filters are randomly initialised, so given you have a large data-set CNN will eventually learn which out of the R,G,B channel is contributing to a specific colour. Also intuitionally a Traffic Signal is not a light only. It consists of a 3 light device. Consider this, a B/W image is shown to you of a Traffic Light in which a particular colour is on and the colour label is known. You will associate the colour label with the position of the bulb, even though you do not know the colour. Same will happen in a CNN, if the channels have identical values for each colour CNN will learn to recognise from the position of the bulb.
