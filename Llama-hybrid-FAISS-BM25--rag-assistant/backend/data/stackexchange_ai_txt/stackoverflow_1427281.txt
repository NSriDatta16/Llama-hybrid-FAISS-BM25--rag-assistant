Vici.CoolStorage: filter with ManyToOne and ManyToMany relation

I got an exception in Vici.CoolStorage 'Unable to cast object of type 'System.String' to type 'QueryExpression' when using the following filter on the .List() method of my Event class: Event.List("has(Resource where has(Teams where TeamID = @TeamID))", "@TeamID", teamID); -> Event - Resource = ManyToOne relation (Resource property) -> Resource - Team = ManyToMany relation, plural=true (CSList Teams property) I want to retrieve all Events with a Resource that belongs to the specified Team (teamID). Is this possible in the Vici.CoolStorage filter syntax? ps. teamID = Guid
