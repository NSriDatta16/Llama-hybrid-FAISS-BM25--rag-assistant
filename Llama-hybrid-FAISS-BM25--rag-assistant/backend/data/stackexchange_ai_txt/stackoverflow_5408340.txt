spring-mvc can not decode chinese characters

I have read this jsp page encoding problem and this Save Chinese characters with Spring-MVC / Java I had the following code fragment in web.xml since the start of my project and it seems to injected correctly: characterEncodingFilter org.springframework.web.filter.CharacterEncodingFilter encoding UTF-8 forceEncoding true characterEncodingFilter /* And the http request has this header "content-type:application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8" set but the log line shows this: Request Body Bean:[UserBean@4a8da092 fristname = '??', lastname = '??'] Also something wield is that I use NetBeans, if I mouse over to the variable firstname and lastname, they are shown correctly. Not sure what else do I need to get it working. Any help would be appreciated.
