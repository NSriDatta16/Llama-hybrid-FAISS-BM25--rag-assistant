You could also use array_reduce which is generally used for, well, reducing an array. That said it can be used to achieve an array format like you want by simple returning the same items as in the input array but with the required keys. // Note: Uses anonymous function syntax only available as of PHP 5.3.0 // Could use create_function() or callback to a named function $plan = array_reduce($plan, function($reduced, $current) { $reduced[$current['id']] = $current; return $reduced; }); Note however, if the paragraph above did not make it clear, this approach is overkill for your individual requirements as outlined in the question. It might prove useful however to readers looking to do a little more with the array than simply changing the keys.
