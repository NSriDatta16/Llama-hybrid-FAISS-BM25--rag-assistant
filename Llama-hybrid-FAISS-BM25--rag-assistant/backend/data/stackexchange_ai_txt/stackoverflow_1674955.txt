My Boss found the answer: It appears that the “ ” tags in the jnlp file are more restrictive with the newer JRE. According to the Sun documentation : “For an untrusted application, system properties set in the JNLP file will only be set by Java Web Start if they are considered secure, or if the property name begins with "jnlp." or "javaws.".” It looks like the untrusted status causes the application to launch a second time with the appropriate properties. after recompiling and fixing a hopefully unrelated issue where newlines were causing the signed APPLICATION.JNLP and the launch.jnlp to not appear to be "the same", the debugger is now working.
