NO . What you have discovered is the idea behind IRLS (Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares): see Can you give a simple intuitive explanation of IRLS method to find the MLE of a GLM? for an exposition. But this is just one numerical method for computing the maximum likelihood estimates (really a version of Newton's method), and not necessarily the best one. Generalized linear models (GLMs) provide a general framework for formulating statistical models, and have led to terminology and unified methods that permeate modern statistics. That should not be reduced to "just" a numerical optimization method. So yes, they are connected, and that connection leads to IRLS, that the Newton method can be formulated as iteration of approximating weighted linear regressions. But that does not mean that using a GLM conceptually is the same as using WLS. For instance, GLMs as logistic regression can be used with binary outcomes, and it is not clear how WLS could be used directly in that case. GLMs as a modeling framework is much richer than WLS.
