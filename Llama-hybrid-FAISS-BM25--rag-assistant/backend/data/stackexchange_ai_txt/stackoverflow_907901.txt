Style question about existing piece of code (C/C++)

I just hope the following doesn't seem to you like redundant jabber :) Anyway, there is that: for (p = fmt; *p; p++) { if (*p != '%') { putchar(*p); continue; } switch (*++p) { /* Some cases here */ ... } } And I wondered why the writer (Kernighan / Ritchie) used the continue in the if statement. I thought it was for the mere reason that he deemed it would be more elegant than indenting the whole switch under an else statement, what do you think?
