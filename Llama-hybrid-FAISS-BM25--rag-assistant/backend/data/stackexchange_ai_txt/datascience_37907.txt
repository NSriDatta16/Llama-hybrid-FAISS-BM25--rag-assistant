As mentioned before, there are already libraries for that, however if you want to dive a bit deeper, I suggest you to have a look at something called Naive Bayes. It is a simple algorithm that anyone can understand, if that gets your attention and you want something more sophisticated, then search for RNN and LSTM... Have fun.
