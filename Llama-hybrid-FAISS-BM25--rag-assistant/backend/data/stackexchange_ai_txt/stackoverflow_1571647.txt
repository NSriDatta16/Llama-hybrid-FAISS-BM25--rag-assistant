Groups are just an organisational tool, and you can use them in the way that is most logical to you. Often developers will put their Model, View and Controller classes in separate groups. You might also want to put header files in their own group to reduce clutter. I create a group for "utility" classes like categories, and a group for each main component of the application, for instance "Inspector" or "Preview". In those groups, the classes are further organised into Model, View and Controller groups. It's up to you though, just do whatever feels natural.
