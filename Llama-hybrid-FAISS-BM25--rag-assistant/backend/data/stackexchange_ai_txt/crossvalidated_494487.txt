According to that logic, if COVID kills someone at 72, it's taken away 10 years, but if it kills someone at 92, it's given them an extra 10 years, which is absurd. Death can only take years away. You can't have an average years lost of zero, because that would require some to be negative. Other comparisons: A football player averages two goals per game. After they've scored two goals, the ref ejects them from the game. Has the ref cost the team any goals? You're offered a game in an underground casino where you roll a die until you get a six. Every time you roll something else, you get a dollar. After rolling the die six times without ever getting a six, the government raids the casino. Has the government cost you any money? You kill an 82 year old person. Have you committed murder?
