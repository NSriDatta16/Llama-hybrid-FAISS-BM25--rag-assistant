What is Bayesian PCA and its cousin?

When I think of the phrase "Bayesian PCA" I think of two things, but these two things are what I have contrived rather than conventional notions. I would appreciate guidance on what these approaches a called. Method 1: To eigenstuff from another process Suppose I model a random data matrix $\mathbf{X}_{m \times n}$ according to some distribution $F_{\mathbf{X}_{m \times n}}$ . Then I sample (via Monte Carlo methods) from its posterior and perform an SVD-based PCA on the sample(s). From this we can analyze estimated densities over the principal components. If someone were to mention "Bayesian PCA" this is what I would guess that they meant (but I don't know). Method 2: From eigenstuff into another process In this approach we start from the singular values and orthogonal matrices as the data generating process. That is we would model $$\Sigma := \nu U E V^*$$ where $U$ , $V$ are Haar-distributed random orthonormal matrices (see Mezzadri 2006 ) and the diagonal of $E$ , denoted $\text{diag}(E)$ follows $$\text{diag}(E) \sim \text{Dirichlet}(\vec \alpha)$$ and $$\nu \sim \text{Exponential}(\lambda).$$ We could then use $\Sigma$ in a variety of statistical models that have such a positive semi-definite matrix. In this approach the data matrix is generated from the singular stuff rather than the singular stuff being generated from some other process. Question Okay, so outside of my own thoughts and notes, how should I refer to these methods?
