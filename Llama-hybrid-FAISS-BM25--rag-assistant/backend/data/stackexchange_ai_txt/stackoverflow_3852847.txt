You need to edit the app-config file to enable transparent chrome and visible = false. Then you need to change the WindowedApplication tag to and app your custom skin. You need to add control buttons for close etc, since that functionality isn't present in a web-app (since you have changed the tag). Also you need to add drag functionality. If you like to make your application re-sizable you need to add that too, manually.
