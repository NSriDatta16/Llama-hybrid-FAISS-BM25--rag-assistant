Embedding Lua in C++: Accessing C++ created through Lua, back in C++ (or returning results back from Lua to C++)

The title probably sounds a bit recursive - but this is what I am trying to do: I have C++ classes Foo and Foobar; I am using tolua++ to export them to Lua In Lua: function wanna_be_starting_something() foo = Foo:new() fb = Foobar:new() -- do something foo.setResult(42) -- In C++ int main(int argc, char argv[]) { MyResult res; LuaEngine * engine = new LuaEngine(); engine->run('wbs-something.lua'); // I now want to be able to access the stored result, in variable res }; So my question is this: how do I pass data from a C++ object that is being manipulated by Lua, back into a C++ program?
