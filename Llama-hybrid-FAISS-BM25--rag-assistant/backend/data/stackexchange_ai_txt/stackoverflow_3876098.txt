You can detect IE6 like so: if (Request.UserAgent.IndexOf("MSIE 6.0") > -1) { // The browser is Microsoft Internet Explorer Version 6.0. } However, you probably don't want to do that. Better to handle this on the client side using jQuery (now supported officially by Microsoft) and use feature (object) detection instead of browser version number detection which will make your code more robust and future proof.
