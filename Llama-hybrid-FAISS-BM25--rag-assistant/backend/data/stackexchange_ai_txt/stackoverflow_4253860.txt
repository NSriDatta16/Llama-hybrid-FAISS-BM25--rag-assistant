How can I replace/override an uploaded file?

I want to be able to upload a file and on each upload to override/replace the existing file with the newest version. from django.core.files.storage import FileSystemStorage fs = FileSystemStorage(location='C:/temp', base_url='/attachments') class Import(models.Model): file = models.FileField(upload_to='data', storage=fs)
