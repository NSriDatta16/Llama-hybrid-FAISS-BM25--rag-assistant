GAM: set knot locations for first but not second smooth term

I'm modelling a time series of detection records for two different viruses. My outcome variable is the count of virus detections per month through time. I have included a cyclic spline for month to capture cyclical patterns in annual virus detection records. For this cyclic spline I have set knot locations as I read here that this can help to reduce bias and error. However, I have also included a second spline to capture long-term trends in virus detection records. Q: How will the knot locations be set for my second spline s(Time) ? Will the knot locations for this spline also be dictated by my call knots = knots - this is not my intention, nor what I want. If possible, I would like to set the knot locations for s(nMonth) but let the gam() function set/decide the knot locations for all other smooths/splines that may be included in my model. Is this possible? knots
