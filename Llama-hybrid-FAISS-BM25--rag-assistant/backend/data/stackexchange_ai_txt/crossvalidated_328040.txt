The strong law of large numbers requires only that the random variables have finite mean $\mu$ for the sample average to converge almost surely to $\mu$. There is no requirement that the variance be finite. The weak law of large numbers also requires only that the random variables have finite mean $\mu$ but has the weaker conclusion that the sample average converges to $\mu$ in probability (instead of almost surely as with the strong law). Here too, there is no requirement that the variance be finite, though the proof is easier for the case when the variance is assumed to be finite.
