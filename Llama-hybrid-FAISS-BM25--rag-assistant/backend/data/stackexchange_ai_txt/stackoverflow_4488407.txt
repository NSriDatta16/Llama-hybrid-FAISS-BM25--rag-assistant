Pros It is the easiest way to the same height. It avoids using float or position:absolute for purposes for which they were not intended. It provides a simple way for beginners to produce side by side layouts in CSS without polluting their HTML with non-semantic tags. Cons It doesn't work in IE7 and earlier and so you either need to define a different layout for those browsers or mess around with floats or position:absolutes to produce CSS for those browsers which works equally well in other browsers anyway. To create a colspan or rowspan effect requires nesting one table inside another. It encourages people to build grid layouts rather than taking a more flexible approach.
