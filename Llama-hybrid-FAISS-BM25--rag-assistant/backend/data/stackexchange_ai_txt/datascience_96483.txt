Predicting events from set of Time Series

I just want to get a general direction for my problem, as I have almost no experience with data science. I want to predict an event based on multiple trajectories. E.g., for two given trajectories, a collision is imminent. So the input would be the two trajectories, and the label for these trajectories would be "dangerous". Similarly, any other pair of trajectories would be "not dangerous". A trajectory is a set of points, where each point is an x,y coordinate and may contain other information such as lane, size, etc. Of course, the order of points is important as this is a series over time. I can freely generate trajectories and their labels for training purposes. At the end, I want a classifier that can classify trajectories as dangerous or not dangerous. Question is, how should I proceed?
