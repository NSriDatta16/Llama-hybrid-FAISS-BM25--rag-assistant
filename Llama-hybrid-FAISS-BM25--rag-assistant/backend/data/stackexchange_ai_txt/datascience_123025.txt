How to train a VQ Gan Based on Pretrained Language and Image Encoder?

I have trained the dual encoder model (separate language and vision encoders) using the ideas here . However, this looks like an image look up model rather than an image generation model. What would the code look like to use those pretrained model with a VQGAN (preferably with tensorflow)? Any tutorial will be sincerely appreciated.
