Flash Movies start as soon as the first frame is loaded. By default, the Flash IDE embeds all ActionScript classes in frame 1, so the entire code will be loaded when the film starts. You can build a preloader by embedding your program classes in a later frame, and having only the preloader code in frame 1. Then you can use the first couple of frames to set up a preloader that will wait for the file to finish loading and then jump to a later frame. Have a look at this Tutorial
