RDL is XML, but very complicated XML. What you want is basically the ReportViewer rewritten in WPF. Not a small task at all. One thing that springs to mind is requesting the report directly from the server and capturing the returned HTML, and embedding that HTML in a WPF control that can render it. But I've never tried that. Generally speaking, so far, there is not a good solution for mixing Reporting Services and WPF/Silverlight.
