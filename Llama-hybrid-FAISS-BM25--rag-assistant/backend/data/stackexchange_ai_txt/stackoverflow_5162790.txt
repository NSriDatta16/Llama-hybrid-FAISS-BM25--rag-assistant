A very basic way would be to assign each button a number & use that in a function call from onClick(). You'd just have a global array of booleans (I used boardPosition) Private Sub button1_Click(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) _ Handles button1.Click boardPosition(1) = IsCreated(1) End Sub Then just have: Protected Function IsCreated(byVal buttonNumberClicked as integer) If boardPosition(buttonNumberClicked) Then return true else return false End If End Function This is assuming you've just created 100 buttons...Not an elegant solution but it'll work. Edit: Clean up.
