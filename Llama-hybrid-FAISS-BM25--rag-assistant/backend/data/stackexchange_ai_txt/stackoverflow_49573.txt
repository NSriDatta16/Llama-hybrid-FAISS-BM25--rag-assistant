Not sure there is anything perfect for this. MyXAML was kicking about a few years ago that enabled you to add forms in XML as opposed to embedding them into the binary. Not sure if that project is dead or not. WinForm does have the flow layout control already However if you want to do this kind of thing properly I think the only answer is to move to WPF.
