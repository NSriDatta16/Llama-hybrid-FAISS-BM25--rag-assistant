The first argument to transform() is the self argument. From your Traceback , it can be concluded that data is being passed to the self argument. This happens when you do not create an object of the class you want to use your function from. (Assuming the function is not decorated with a @staticmethod , which in the case of transform , is not.) Check if you have unintentionally initialized pca as pca = PCA . For pre-processing script - pca = PCA(n_components=2) pca.fit(train_features) scaled_train_features = pca.transform(train_features) # save pca in a pickle file with open('pca.pkl', 'wb') as pickle_file: pickle.dump(pca, pickle_file) For the other script where you want to use the fitted pca - with open('pca.pkl', 'rb') as pickle_file: pca = pickle.load(pickle_file) scaled_data = pca.transform(data)
