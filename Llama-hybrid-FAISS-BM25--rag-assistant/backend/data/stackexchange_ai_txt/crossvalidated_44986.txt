By converting an interval scaled set of numbers with a given correlation (mostly concentrated around 0) over to a 1/0 scale you, on average, drove the pairs further apart on the squared distance scale. In thinking about this for its implications to coders it is probably that the unnecessary conversion of interval data to binomial data is going to decrease the power of your investigations into the data relationships. An investigation into count data outcomes conducted with Poisson regression is likely to reveal more than if the outcomes were coded into 1/0 depending on whether the counts were above or below any particular cutpoint. There's probably a proof that could be exhibited but demonstration of probability theorems is not what SO is about. If you want a more mathematical explanation, there is always the stats.stackexchange.com interface.
