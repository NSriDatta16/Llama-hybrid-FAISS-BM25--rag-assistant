Confidence metric for a single prediction in multiclass classification?

Are there any particular methods (Naive Bayes, SVM, RF, etc) that can provide some estimate of 'confidence' along with the class prediction for a test feature set in which the true class is unobserved? If so, can someone point me towards some readings to learn more about them.
