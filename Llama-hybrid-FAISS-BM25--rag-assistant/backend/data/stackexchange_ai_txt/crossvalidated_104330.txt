Help in convolution operation

I am stuck in understanding how the output of convolution operation is obtained. Can somebody please show the steps? The question is an image is processed by applying 3*3 mean filter . What is the impulse response? The formula is $g(m,n) = \sum_{\alpha = 0}^{M-1} \sum_{\beta=0}^{N-1} f(\alpha,\beta)h(m-\alpha,n-\beta)$ The image function $f$ = 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 h = 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 The result of the operation (obtained in Matlab) is g(m,n) = 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 3 2 1 0 0 2 4 6 4 2 0 0 3 6 9 6 3 0 0 2 4 6 4 2 0 0 1 2 3 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 I cannot understand the steps how to do it in paper, can somebody please show the few steps how to go about it ? Based on the reply and the formula, I have worked out one example, but the answers don't match with the formula and the other technique. For convolution at pixel f(0,0) the answer = 0. But I am getting 0 using the formula and 1 using the drag method. The cell to which this result will be mapped is g(0,0) and I have put the answer there. For convolution of pixel element at f(1,1) = 1 also, when I evaluated I am getting answer 2 instead of 4. The result should go to g(2,2). But how do I get values for g(5,0) since the original image f has no fifth row!! How to calculate values for fifth and sixth rows? Please let me know what is wrong in my understanding. Is my coordinate system incorrect? Shall really appreciate.
