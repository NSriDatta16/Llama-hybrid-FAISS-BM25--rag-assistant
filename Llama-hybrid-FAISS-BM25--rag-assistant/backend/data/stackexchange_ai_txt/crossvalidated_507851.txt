Yes, people have tried this before. Please have a look at the following papers (I suggest in that order): Time Series Classification from Scratch with Deep Neural Networks: A Strong Baseline ( https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06455 ) [source code: https://github.com/cauchyturing/UCR_Time_Series_Classification_Deep_Learning_Baseline] Deep learning for time series classification: a review ( https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.04356 ) [source code: https://github.com/hfawaz/dl-4-tsc] More advanced methods (like transfer learning) on top of 1-D CNNs are discussed in the following papers: 3.) Timage -- A Robust Time Series Classification Pipeline ( https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.09149 ) [source code: https://github.com/patientzero/timage-icann2019] 4.) InceptionTime: Finding AlexNet for time series classification ( https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10618-020-00710-y ) [source code: https://github.com/hfawaz/InceptionTime] Please also have a look at the corresponding repositories containing the source code for each approach.
