Creating same login page for different users

I have one login page used by all users on the site. However, once they login, they go to different pages. The users are currently stored in different tables in the database and I need to check to see which page I should navigate to. Does this mean that I should add all these users to a single table and specify the kind of user? What's the best way for me to organize things?
