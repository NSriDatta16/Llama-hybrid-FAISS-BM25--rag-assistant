Mike's explanation of how PHP dynamically allocates the internal hash table for arrays is spot on. The doubling of size is very performant for dynamically allocating arrays. However, the $_SERVER, $_REQUEST, $_POST, $_GET, and $_ENV superglobals are all of a fixed size when the script starts. They are also generally not edited (I discourage it). It's very likely that they are created with hash tables that are just big enough to fit their current size. Any addition would then trigger the dynamic expansion algorithm to rebuild and copy to the hash table.
