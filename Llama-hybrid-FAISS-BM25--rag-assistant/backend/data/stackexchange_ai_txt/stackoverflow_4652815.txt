I can only recommend that you don't use GCJ. It isn't Java. The compatiblity matrix on their web page is far from encouraging. It doesn't implement Java 1.2 completely yet, let alone all of 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6. The project appears to be falling further and further behind, and it never had 100% Java compatibility as a stated goal in the first place.
