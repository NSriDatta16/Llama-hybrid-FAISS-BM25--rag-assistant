I would say that if you end up needing to use Ctrl+F to find the function you're looking for, it's probably time to start breaking the file up. Likewise, if you're needing to use Ctrl+F to find a certain piece of code within a long function, it's probably time to start separating it into multiple functions (or work on writing more concise code). Bugs will be much more difficult to track down (and more time consuming to fix) if you're having to spend a lot of time spelunking through the code. Whenever you're breaking up files or functions though, try to separate them in ways that make sense; and not just to you, but also to the average human being. Assuming that you're the only person that will look at your code is foolish. If you come back to the project after a few years of absence, you may very well be a different person than you are now.
