The decision whether to use Powershell or a Custom activity is for me based on who is responsible. If you have an activity that is created by the build master (for TFS) and therefor reusable for all the teams in the organization, I create a custom activity. If the project team is responsible (for example a deployment script), the I use the powershell. I create an argument where the team can enter the path of the powershell script that needs to execute to deploy. The project team can optionally choose to enter a value in that argument. The project team can also maintain their powershell deployment script themselves without the help of the build master. So in short: A reusable activity: Custom activity Activity for the team only: Powershell
