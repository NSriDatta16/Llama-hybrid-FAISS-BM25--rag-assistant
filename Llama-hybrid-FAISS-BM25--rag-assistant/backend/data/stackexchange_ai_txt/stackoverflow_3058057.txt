This feature is non-standard , some implementations like the Mozilla (Spidermonkey and Rhino) and the Google Chrome (V8) include it, but I would highly discourage its usage, because it isn't part of the specification. Those implementations make RegExp objects callable , and invoking those objects is equivalent to call the .exec method. In Chrome (and Firefox 2.x) even when you use the typeof operator with a RegExp object, you get "function" (because they implement the [[Call]] internal method). typeof /foo/ == "function"; // true Also IMO I don't see the benefit of using: regexp(str); Versus: regexp.exec(str); This is slightly documented here by Mozilla.
