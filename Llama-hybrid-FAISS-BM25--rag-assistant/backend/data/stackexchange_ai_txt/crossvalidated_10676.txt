Using an SVM for feature selection

Lets say I have a highly dimensional classification problem with a lot of noise, and I want to improve my results by removing some of the noisy variables. I've read several papers on using SVMs for feature selection, but I'm at a loss as to how to implement this in R. Are there pre-existing packages that do this, or am I going to have to roll my own?
