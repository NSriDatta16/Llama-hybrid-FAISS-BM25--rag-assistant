This is not a direct answer, but when I checked last time (and I find the language very interesting) I didn't find anything ready for real-world. The idealist in myself always wants to try out new languagages, very hot on my list (apart from the aforementioned very cool Clean Language) is currently (random order) IO , Fan and Scala ... But in the meantime I then get my pragmatism out and check the Tiobe Index . I know you can discuss it, but still: It tells me what I will be able to use in a year from now and what I possibly won't be able to use... No pun intended!
