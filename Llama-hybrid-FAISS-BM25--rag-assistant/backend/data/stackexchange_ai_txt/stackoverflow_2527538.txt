i figured out the problem. what i did was recreate a dummy project and named the project sample. then i created a new development and distribution provision and called it sample. i deleted all the provisions i had currently on my system and added the new ones by selecting both files and dragging it over into the xcode organiser. i also deleted the provision on my iphone by going to settings -> general -> profile -> clicked on remove. then i selected in xcode build -> build and it was successfull. what i was doing was i was a clicking on build and run and whenever i do that i get this error posted above. but when i do a regular build with the device selected in xcode it is 100% sucessfull with no errors. i had to try it in itunes connect to see if the app is sucessfull and i did an upload and it worked!. i cant believe it.
