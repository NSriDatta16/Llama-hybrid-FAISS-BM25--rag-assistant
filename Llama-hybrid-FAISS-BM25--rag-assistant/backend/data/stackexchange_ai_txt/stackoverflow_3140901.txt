Ok, it is a non-answer, but I would throw away the exception specification and never use it again . EDIT: I read too fast, and I didn't see you did not write the class yourself. Best way to get rid of warnings in msvc is via #pragma warning(push) followed by #pragma warning(disable:xxxx) where xxxx is the warning code : #ifdef _MSC_VER #pragma warning(push) #pragma warning(disable:xxxx) #endif ... #ifdef _MSC_VER #pragma warning(pop) #endif EDIT: It is perfectly safe to disable the warning. Exception specifications are evil, and the compiler is only telling you it is disabling them for you. Even if it breaks the standard.
