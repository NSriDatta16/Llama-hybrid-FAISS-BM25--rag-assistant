Initialize a Jagged Array the LINQ Way

I have a 2-dimensional jagged array (though it's always rectangular), which I initialize using the traditional loop: var myArr = new double[rowCount][]; for (int i = 0; i I thought maybe some LINQ function would give me an elegant way to do this in one statement. However, the closest I can come up with is this: double[][] myArr = Enumerable.Repeat(new double[colCount], rowCount).ToArray(); The problem is that it seems to be creating a single double[colCount] and assigning references to that intsead of allocating a new array for each row. Is there a way to do this without getting too cryptic?
