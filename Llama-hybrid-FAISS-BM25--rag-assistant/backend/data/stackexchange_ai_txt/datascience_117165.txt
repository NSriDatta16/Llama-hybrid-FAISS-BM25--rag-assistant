Quite general question, how you will divide your time working as a data scientist depends mostly on the job position itself, your company, and your skills. Personally, I am not a fan of, as you say it, black-box AI APIs and I think people will have hard time accepting it - it's black-box. Here's a JetBrains survey about the state of BigData in 2021 (not sure if there's 2022 version somewhere) that you can use to see what other people involved in data analytics are working with: https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/devecosystem-2021/big-data/ Other useful resource could be the StackOverflow survey: https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#overview These are not data science specific, but I think there's enough empirical information about this sector. Hope it helps.
