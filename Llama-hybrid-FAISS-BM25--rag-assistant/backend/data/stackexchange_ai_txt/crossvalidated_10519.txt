Comparing multiple time series in R

If I have many time series that I'd like to compare to see if there are relationships between the variables, (I have several dependent variables and many more independent variables) how might I go about doing this (I'm working in R, just fyi)? I haven't really found too many examples seeking to compare and explore the relationships between many variables. In particular, I'd like to see if the variation in my independent time series drives variation in the dependent time series, and I'm so new to statistics (and R) that I'm really not sure how to approach this problem. Here is some sample data (I know there are 2 missing values, and I may choose to treat Y2 as an independent variable since I think Y2 and Y1 may be correlated. The column labeled "covariate" is years since last flood, because I think this might be important too): year Y1 Y2 X1 X2 X3 X4 X5 covariate 1 40 92 0 0 20.6 91 503 3 2 54 65 0 0 21.7 33 175 4 3 59 75 1 1 22.2 34 94 5 4 68 53 8 9 22.2 24 86 6 5 5 20 20.6 5 185 7 6 76 65 8 13 22.2 32 119 8 7 76 55 16 18 23.3 0 153 9 8 82 58 18 2 24.4 19 0 1 9 60 57 28 24 23.33 0 223 2 10 58 46 18 3 22.78 0 184 3 11 49 48 2 1 23.33 0 110 4 12 28 76 0 3 22.78 0 213 5 13 56 61 0 1 22.78 12 123 6 14 105 53 56 24 23.33 0 122 7 15 99 43 28 13 24.44 0 154 8 16 119 47 46 35 23.33 0 182 9 Any guidance would be much appreciated as I'm not really sure how to proceed here.
