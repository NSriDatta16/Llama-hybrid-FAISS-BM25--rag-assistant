This slide by Yann LeCun makes the point that only models with a feature hierarchy (lower-level features are learned at one layer of a model, and then those features are combined at the next level) are deep . A CNN can be deep or shallow; which is the case depends on whether it follows this "feature hierarchy" construction because certain neural networks, including 2-layer models , are not deep.
