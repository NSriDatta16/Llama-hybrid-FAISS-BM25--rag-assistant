How to make use of known constants when modeling from data?

As a (perhaps contrived) example, let's say we want to discover from some empirical data Coulomb's law for an electric field: $$F = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \cdot \frac{|q|}{r^2}$$ In this case we would have a matrix whose columns include force $F$, charge $q$, and radius $r$; as well as perhaps some columns containing irrelevant features. We also know in advance the values of $\epsilon_0$ and $\pi$. Supplying that matrix as input to some out-of-box machine learning tools may indeed have us find that $$F = c \cdot \frac{|q|}{r^2}$$ for some $c$ that is close to but probably not exactly $(4 \pi \epsilon_0)^{-1}$. My question is: how do we inform such systems to make use of the known constants so that it may more closely approximate the true form of the equation? Would it useful to include, for example, an entire column containing only $\pi$ and another entire column containing only $\epsilon_0$? Edit: It may be the case here that $\epsilon_0$ is the interesting quantity to be discovered (in addition to the form of the equation). However, the question still stands regarding how to make use of $\pi$.
