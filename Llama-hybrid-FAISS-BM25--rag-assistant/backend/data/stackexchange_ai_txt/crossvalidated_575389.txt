Statistical Models for "Prioritization"?

Are there any general classes of statistical models that are able to perform "ranking and prioritization" tasks? For instance, suppose a hospital has: data on patients (e.g. age, height, weight, etc.) the reason why they came to the hospital (e.g. chest pain, car accident, etc.) the triage decision associated with each patient who came to the hospital (e.g. ICU, sent home, etc.) what happened to that patient (e.g. died, almost died, full recovery, released from hospital, no real problem, etc.) Are there any statistical models that can be used to "triage" patients? The closest thing I have seen to this is "Learn to Rank" models - but I am not sure if this can be used for the problem I have described. Can a Machine Learning approach be used for this kind of problem? Thanks!
