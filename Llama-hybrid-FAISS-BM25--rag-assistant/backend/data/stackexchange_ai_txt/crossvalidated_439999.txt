To be clear - your prior assumes that youâ€™ve observed ( $2-1 = 1$ ) successes and ( $50-1 = 49$ ) failures for an effective sample size of $N_1=50$ . The posterior does not sample from the prior but rather combines the likelihood with the prior to arrive at the posterior distribution over $\theta$ (conversion rate in your case). Since the posterior mean is as a weighted average between the prior and observed means, the corresponding means of model A and model B are: $\hat{\theta}_A=\frac{N_1}{(N_1+N_2)}\cdot\frac{\alpha}{\alpha+\beta} + \frac{N_2}{(N_1+N_2)}\cdot\frac{\alpha+n_A}{\alpha+n_A+\beta+(100-n_A)}$ $\hat{\theta}_B=\frac{N_1}{(N_1+N_2)}\cdot\frac{\alpha}{\alpha+\beta} + \frac{N_2}{(N_1+N_2)}\cdot\frac{\alpha+n_B}{\alpha+n_B+\beta+(100-n_B)}$ Where $N_1$ is the effective sample size of the prior, $N_2$ is the number of new observations, $n_A$ is the count of successes observed for model A, and $n_B$ is the count of successes observed for model B As you can see, your results are not illogical - you are observing that the posterior is overwhelming the prior in the case of model B (double the data, 7x the conversion / success rate): $\hat{\theta}_B=\frac{50}{150}\cdot\frac{1}{50} + \frac{100}{150}\cdot\frac{21}{150}$
