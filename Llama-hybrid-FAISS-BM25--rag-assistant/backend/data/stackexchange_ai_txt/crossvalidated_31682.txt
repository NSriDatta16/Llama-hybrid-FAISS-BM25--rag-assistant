Solution for error message in minitab

I have used minitab software to fit time series model and predict. For some models I got the following error message; "Fitted model may be nonstationary or noninvertible. Completion of computation impossible." Using another package the relevant models were fitted. What is the reason for that kind of error message and Is there solution to fix that error?
