I don't know how Stata works, but I doubt it is doing anything like what you are doing. It is more common to use the likelihood as @FrankHarrell notes. It may help you to read my answer here: Why do my p-values differ between logistic regression output, chi-squared test, and the confidence interval for the OR? More specific to your question, how good an approximation a Taylor expansion with a given finite number of steps is depends on ( a ) the function being approximated, and ( b ) what you are willing to consider 'good'. For this case, looking at the values of the odds ratio at +1 SE, the delta method's approximation does not seem very good to me: or + or.se # [1] 12.11861 exp(b +se) # [1] 16.38827
