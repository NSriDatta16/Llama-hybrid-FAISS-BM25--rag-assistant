I think std::map can easily solve this problem. The key of the map would be the number, and value would be the times/frequency the number occurs. So the average can be calculated as, int average = (m[key] * key) / count; Where count is total number of numbers, so it calculates the average of each group over all numbers, as you didn't clearly mention what you mean by average. I'm also assuming that each distinct number forms its own group!
