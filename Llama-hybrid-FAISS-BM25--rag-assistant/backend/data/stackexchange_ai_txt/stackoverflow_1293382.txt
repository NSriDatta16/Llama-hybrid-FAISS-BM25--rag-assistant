My proposal (note that this does not create the sum of the distinct values): This is not exactly elegant, maybe there's a nicer way to do this. My goal was to keep hard-coded sections minimal. To create a distinct sum some kind of grouping needs to be applied in the for-each. Thinking about it, this question looks a little bit like a homework assignment to me.
