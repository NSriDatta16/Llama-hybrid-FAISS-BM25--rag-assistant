A Wilkinson dot plot is a handy graphics for visualizing counts. It's a histogram of stacked dots. Here is a Wilkinson dot plot of the sample data, split by deprivation. It's easy to notice for example that all counts are multiples of 5. With the sample data, one dot represents one patient. With the full dataset, it would probably be necessary to summarize so that the chart doesn't get cluttered, eg. one dot can represent 10 patients. PS: Color is under-used in this dot plot. It will be great to color by age (or by average age, if dots represent multiple patients of similar age). Unfortunately, I hit the limits of ggplot2 , so in R at least it would have to be a custom-made chart. R code to make a Wilkinson dot plot. # Adapted from: # https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49330742/change-y-axis-of-dot-plot-to-reflect-actual-count-using-geom-dotplot library("tidyverse") dataset % mutate( deprivation = factor(deprivation) ) counts % count( deprivation, diffr_days ) binwidth % ggplot( aes(x = diffr_days, fill = deprivation) ) + geom_dotplot( binwidth = binwidth, dotsize = dotsize, method = "histodot" ) + coord_fixed( ratio = binwidth * dotsize * yheight ) + facet_wrap( ~ "deprivation" + deprivation, ncol = 2 ) + scale_x_continuous( limits = c(0, 15) ) + scale_y_continuous( limits = c(0, 1), expand = c(0, 0), breaks = seq(0, 1, 5 * 1 / yheight), labels = seq(0, yheight, by = 5) ) + labs( x = "Time in hospital (days)", y = "Number of patients" ) + theme(legend.position = "none")
