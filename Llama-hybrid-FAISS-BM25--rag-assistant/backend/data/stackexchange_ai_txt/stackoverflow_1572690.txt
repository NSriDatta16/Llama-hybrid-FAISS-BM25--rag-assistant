You can also export your visio model as an xmi file and open it with other (free) UML tools as ArgoUML (but first, you need to transform the xmi file, e.g. using this free service http://modeling-languages.com/content/xmi2-tool-exchanging-uml-models-among-case-tools , since the XMI standard is not as standard as it should be) This way, others cannot only visualize the file but also modify it. Caveat: the graphical layout organization of your model will be lost, only the information about the content is stored in the file
