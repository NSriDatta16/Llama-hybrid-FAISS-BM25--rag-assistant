In your code, nothing will happen when your text is less than 8 characters long. Also, I don't see any condition under which your width becomes smaller. It only becomes larger (by 9) with each iteration. By the way, you appear to be multiplying by 9 as an average character width. You can use Canvas.TextWidth to determine the actual width required by the text without estimating. If you want to use "9" anyway, you should name it as a constant to make clear what it is. Quick and dirty using TextWidth: const MAX_EINGABE_WIDTH = 450; MIN_EINGABE_WIDTH = 191; procedure THauptform.edtEingabeChange(Sender: TObject); var Width: Integer; begin // Scale Width := edtEingabe.Canvas.TextWidth(edtEingabe.Text); if Width > MAX_EINGABE_WIDTH then Width := MAX_EINGABE_WIDTH else if Width
