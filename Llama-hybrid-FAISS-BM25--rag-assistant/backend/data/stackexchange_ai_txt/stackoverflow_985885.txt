Most linux distributions contain a mail command (from the mailx package). You can attach a file from the command line using the -a option: mail -s 'file attached' -a /path/to/file someone@example.com That said, most mail systems won't be happy with 600MB attachments. The ncftp package has a number of commands that may be useful for automated transferring of files over FTP, in particular the ncftpput command (see the manpages for more information). Depending on where you are sending the file, if the other end supports ssh, it might be better to use tools like scp or ssh and rsync. With public key authentication, you don't even have to worry about embedding a password anywhere. If you are doing backups, consider a tool like Duplicity (but not for a full zip file as it loses most of its advantages) as it supports a number of protocols, performs compression on-the-fly and can perform incremental backups. Oh, and the backups are encrypted and digitally signed to ensure their integrity.
