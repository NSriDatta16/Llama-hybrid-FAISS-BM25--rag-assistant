how to know if the difference between test and train RMSE is significant to say its overfitted/under-fitted

I am trying to figure out if the model is overfitted/under-fitted based on RMSE values on test and train errors. On the training data, the RMSE is 0.283 On the test data, the RMSE is 0.758 since RMSE(test) > RMSE(train) , I want to conclude that the model is overfitted but is this difference significant enough to conclude this? It's a Random forest regression model and Y(dependent variable) values are in range(2-7).
