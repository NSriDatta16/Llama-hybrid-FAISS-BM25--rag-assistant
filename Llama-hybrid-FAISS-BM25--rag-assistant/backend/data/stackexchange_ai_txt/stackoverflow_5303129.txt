After deciphering the question and reading the comments up to three times, your concrete problem turns out to be the following: I want to change the hash fragment in the URL when I change a tab in the UI. Using query strings isn't the solution. They are server side and not controllable from the client side on without firing a HTTP request (or, "refreshing the page" as you call it yourself). Hash fragments are however controllable from the client side on. It's extraordinary easy as well: just use it as-is in tab links. tab1 tab2 tab3 The webbrowser will change the hash fragment in the browser address bar by itself. I however assume that you already have a jQuery function which already shows the desired tab content when any of those links is clicked (and doesn't return false from the function!).
