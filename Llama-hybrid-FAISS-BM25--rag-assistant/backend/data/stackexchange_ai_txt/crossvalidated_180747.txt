Bayesian vs. frequentist view

I have tried to figure out the difference between the two views of looking at the world: Bayesian and frequentist. Can someone please let me know if I have it right? (Please do not refer me to some old thread or article that is pages long. Simply just confirm if the statement below is correct, and if not, what is wrong with it.) I have got he impression that the frequentist conducts a measurement and believes the world to be exactly what his results state. Bayesian, on the other hand, has a prior/neutral view of the world, and he only uses the measurement data to update his views. I.e. he finds a balance between his prior view, and the view of the frequentist. Correct?
