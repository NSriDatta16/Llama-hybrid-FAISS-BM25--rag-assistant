Polling seems to be the only way to go. When a Drag+Drop operation is started within the browser, it seems to cancel out everything else that's going on. You can witness this by putting "onmouseover" events on something on the page, then starting a DnD operation and dragging over it. The events will not fire. It seems only a coincidence of how the browser internally handles "drag and drop" that it causes onfocus() to be fired for the textarea in IE and Safari. I doubt there is much defined in the W3 specification... not that it matters, W3 is crap, and besides nobody adheres to it completely. In my question I stated the luxury of emptying out the textarea after each use, so I feel that polling for: textarea.value.length>0 is hardly any cost and shouldn't be much of a performance concern. But, alas, it specifically has to do with dropping content into a textarea. Down-mod away to sooth your pain.
