If a variable is coded as yes/no/unknown, is it categorical or ordinal?

The dataset has ten variables, and I am trying to conduct a cluster analysis. The ten variables are coded yes, no, or unknown. And I converted the character values ('yes', 'no', 'unknown') to numeric values ('1', '0', '(blank)'). If the variable is coded in 'yes', 'no', or 'unknown', can I leave the 'unknown' value as blank or do I need to re-code the values to 1, 2, and 3 in ordinal way? (e.g., 3 = yes, 2 = no, 1 = unknown) If the variable is coded in 'yes', 'no', or 'unknown', do I need to set the variable as categorical (using as.factor ) or as ordinal (using as.ordinal )? If the total proportion of 'unknown' is about 60% in my dataset, would it be appropriate to conduct the cluster analysis? I first coded the values in 1 = yes, 0 = no, blank = unknown. And I used 'EGAnet' package to conduct the cluster analysis. And I tried two ways. One is setting the variables as categorical variable with 2-level. Another one is replacing the missing ('unknown) values using this code: data and setting the variables as ordinal variable (3-level: "" Finally, I run the EGAnet EGAglasso to see the clusters and correlations among the variables. However, I got different results depending on whether I set the variables as categorical or ordinal.
