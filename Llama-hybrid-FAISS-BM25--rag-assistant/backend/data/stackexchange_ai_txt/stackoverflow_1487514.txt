Not an answer to your question, but a general improvement. I'd recommend using JOIN syntax to join your tables together. This would change your query to be: SELECT Agents.aid FROM Agents INNER JOIN Orders ON Agents.aid = Orders.aid INNER JOIN Customers ON Customers.cid = Orders.cid WHERE Customers.city='Duluth' GROUP BY Agents.aid HAVING count(Agents.aid) > 1 What variant of SQL are you using?
