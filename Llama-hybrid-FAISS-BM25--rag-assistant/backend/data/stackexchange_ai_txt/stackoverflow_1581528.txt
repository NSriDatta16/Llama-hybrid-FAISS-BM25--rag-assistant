All Magento work can be done without touching a single core file which is the way you should do it (except perhaps for the locale files since those are easy to merge). I have written a script which lets you scatter your project files all over Magento's installation root without increasing the difficulty of managing your source code (and without checking in a single Magento core file). How does it work? Soft links. You could actually accomplish the same without my script by creating soft links by hand, but this just makes it easier (deployment/update to a live server is always one command). I'm not sure about Windows support, it could work within cygwin but I haven't tested. I do development on Windows but run a virual machine (VirtualBox) with my LAMP stack on it sharing the files with the Windows via Samba so I run the script via command line on the Linux guest and edit my files with Netbeans via the Samba share (and I can commit changes via Netbeans' subversion module).
