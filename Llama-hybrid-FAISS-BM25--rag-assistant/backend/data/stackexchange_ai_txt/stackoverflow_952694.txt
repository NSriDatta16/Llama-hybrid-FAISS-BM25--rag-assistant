Can I see shader preprocessor output?

I am using #defines, which I pass runtime to my shader sources based on program state, to optimize my huge shaders to be less complex. I would like to write the optimized shader to a file so that next time I run my program, I do not have to pass the #defines again, but I can straight compile the optimized shaders during program startup because now I know what kind of shaders by program needs. Is there a way to get the result from shader preprocessor? I can of course store the #define values to a file and based on that compile the shaders during program startup but that would not be as elegant.
