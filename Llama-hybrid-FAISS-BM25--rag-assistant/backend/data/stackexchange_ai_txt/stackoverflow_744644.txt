A big problem in MOSS is that customers aren't really sure how to organize their data (in terms of sites, subsites, etc.) until user data has accumulated and it's too late to re-organize. UI changes (look-and-feel) are relatively easier, so if you really have to nail down one thing, make sure it's how data is to be organized. Example: Will it be one site collection for each line of business or one big site collection with subsites for each LOB? This also affects how data will be secured, and that's also a big pain to revise later.
