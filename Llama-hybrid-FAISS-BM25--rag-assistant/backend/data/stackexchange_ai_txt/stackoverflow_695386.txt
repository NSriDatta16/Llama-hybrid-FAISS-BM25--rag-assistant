I may be oversimplifying here but if you artificially fragment the disk won't any tests you run will be only true for the fragmentation created by your fragmenter rather than any real world fragmentation. You may end up optimising for assumptions in the fragmenter tool that don't represent real world occurrences. Wouldn't it be easier and more accurate to take some disk images of fragmented disks? Do you have any friends or colleagues who trust you not to do anything anti-social with their data?
