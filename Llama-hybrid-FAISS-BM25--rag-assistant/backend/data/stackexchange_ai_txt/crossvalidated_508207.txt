Are F1 score and Dice coefficient computed in same way or different way in image segmentation (two class segmentation)?

On page 8 of the paper An automatic nuclei segmentationmethod based on deep convolutional neuralnetworks for histopathology images , the authors show performance of their deep model on test sets. They have clearly mentioned two separate columns for F1 score and Average Dice Coefficient (ADC) ( This answer does not answer my specific question): Suppose the test set consisted of 4 images then Average Dice Coefficient (ADC) would be the average of Dice coefficient of 4 predictions of the input test images. They have defined F1 and Dice Coefficient as: This is where my doubt comes. In binary segmentation (I mean two class segmentation, foreground or background) , we get a sigmoid output. It consists of values in range [0,1], while ground truth contains only 1 and 0. Is it like for Dice coefficient, we take the sigmoid map as it is and compute Dice by (2*prediction*ground truth)/(prediction+ground truth) and for F1 we threshold sigmoid map so that it contains only 1 and 0 and then compute precision, recall and F1 by finding TPs, FPs and FNs? Is this the correct thinking or am I wrong? To clarify my way of understanding here is an example: Example input image, ground truth and prediction, my example above considers 2x2 output and ground truth instead of 256x256 output and ground truth as in image below:
