Finding Child Objects in ViewBox/Canvas Object

I've implemented a drag and drop that is mostly working in my Silverlight 4 app. Once the users have dropped the shapes onto the canvas, I wanted to use Size & Child Decorators . I've tried to implement the sample code. Code below is problem section of much larger app. xmal - c# code - private void Camera1Canvas_MouseLeftButtonDown(object sender, MouseButtonEventArgs e) { var sendingObj = sender as Canvas; if (sendingObj == null) return; foreach (UserControl l in VisualTreeHelper.FindElementsInHostCoordinates(e.GetPosition(null), sendingObj)) { if (l.Parent == Camera1Canvas ) { adorn.AdornedElement = l as FrameworkElement; adorn.adorned_MouseLeftButtonDown(l, e); break; } } base.OnMouseLeftButtonDown(e); } My problem is that when VisualTreeHelper.FindElementsInHostCoordinates is called on left mouse click event, it returns no elements when I click on any object. I sure that it is a coordinate mapping issue, but as this is new ground for me, I'm unsure how to fix it.
