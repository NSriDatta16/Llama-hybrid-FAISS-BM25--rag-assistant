Python TimeSeries Error: ValueError: view limit minimum -36834.64916714945 is less than 1 and is an invalid Matplotlib date value

I'm creating a time series model in Python. I converted a int field that counted the days (1,2,3,4) to a datetime field using the following code: from datetime import datetime, timedelta start = datetime.strptime('2016-01-01', '%Y-%m-%d') df['Day'] = [start + timedelta(x) for x in range(730)] I checked and it worked. The first date starts with 01/01/2016. I checked the dtypes of my two columns. The Day column is a datetime64[ns], while the revenue columns is float64. When I try to plot the following code, I get an error that says I'm receiving this error: ValueError: view limit minimum -36834.64916714945 is less than 1 and is an invalid Matplotlib date value. This often happens if you pass a non-datetime value to an axis that has datetime units. I'm a little confused as to what's causing this since my datatype on the day columns is a datetime. rolling_mean = df.rolling(window = 12).mean() rolling_std = df.rolling(window = 12).std() plt.plot(df, color = 'blue', label = 'Original') plt.plot(rolling_mean, color = 'red', label = 'Rolling Mean') plt.plot(rolling_std, color = 'black', label = 'Rolling Std') plt.legend(loc = 'best') plt.title('Rolling Mean & Rolling Standard Deviation') plt.show() plt.close()
