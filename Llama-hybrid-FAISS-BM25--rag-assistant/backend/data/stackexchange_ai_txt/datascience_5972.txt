How to learn spam email detection?

I want to learn how a spam email detector is done. I'm not trying to build a commercial product, it'll be a serious learning exercise for me. Therefore, I'm looking for resources, such as existing projects, source code, articles, papers etc that I can follow. I want to learn by examples, I don't think I am good enough to do it from scratch. Ideally, I'd like to get my hand dirty in Bayesian. Is there anything like that that? Programming language isn't a problem for me.
