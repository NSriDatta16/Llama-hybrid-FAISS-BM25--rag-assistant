System::Object to int or double in C++/CLI

I'm taking some information from data base and i want to use it in calculations. But due to what i'written, i'm not able to convert it to number. I recieve System::Object^ . here is the part of code: OleDbConnection ^ cnNwind = gcnew OleDbConnection(); cnNwind-> ConnectionString = L"Provider = Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0;" L"Data Source = C:\\temp\\A.mdb"; try { // Open the database cnNwind->Open(); Console::WriteLine(L"Connected to database successfully!"); // Count the customers OleDbCommand ^ cmProducts = gcnew OleDbCommand(); cmProducts->CommandText = L"SELECT ID FROM Table1"; cmProducts->CommandType = CommandType::Text; cmProducts->Connection = cnNwind; // Print the result Object ^ numberOfProducts = cmProducts->ExecuteScalar(); Console::Write(L"Number of products: "); Console::WriteLine(numberOfProducts); } catch (OleDbException ^ pe) { Console::Write(L"Error occurred: "); Console::WriteLine(pe->Message); } // Close the connection if (cnNwind->State != ConnectionState::Closed) { cnNwind->Close(); } Console::WriteLine(L"The database connection is closed..."); I want to use numberOfProducts as a digit. I mean type double or integer . How can i transform it?
