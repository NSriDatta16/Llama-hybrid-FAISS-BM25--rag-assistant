Thanks for all the helpful suggestions. Despite being flagged as answer to the problem my answer is that there seems to be no good solution. I tried using parallel statements, different storage characteristics, presorted temp. tables and other things. The operation seems not to be bound to any characteristic visible through traces or explain plans. Even query parallelism seems to be sketchy when CLOBs are involved. Undoubtedly there would be better options to deal with with large CLOBs (especially compression) in an 11g environment but atm. I am stuck with 10g. I have opted now for an additional roundtrip to the database in which I'll preprocess the CLOBs into a size optimized binary RAW. In previous deployments this has always been a very fast option and will likely be worth the trouble of maintaining an offline computed cache. The cache will be invalided and update using a persistent process and AQ until someone comes up with a better idea.
