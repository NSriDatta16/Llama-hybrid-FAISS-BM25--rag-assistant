Find similar stores on the basis of their monthly sales values and trend

I have a bunch of stores data and I want to find similar stores (Time period 1 year, monthly data) based on combination of two steps: 1) Month on month sales value of store A should be similar to month on month sales of store B. I intend to use clustering techniques like k means, hierarchical etc for this. Once we have potential stores similar to a particular store based on sales value the next requirement is: 2) The sales pattern/trend every month should be similar to other store i.e. if the sales for store A increases for first 3 months and then decreases for the next 2 months , then the other similar store should also have the same pattern. I am not sure how to handle this 2nd part. Should I scrap step 1 and treat this problem as a time series clustering problem and use algorithms such as DTW or is my initial approach correct and there exists some technique which could specifically help in solving (something like correlation) step 2 i.e. sales trend problem
