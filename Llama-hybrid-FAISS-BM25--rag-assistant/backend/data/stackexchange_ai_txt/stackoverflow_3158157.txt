To train the PoS tagger, see this mailing list post which is also included in the JavaDocs for the MaxentTagger class. The javadocs for the edu.stanford.nlp.tagger.maxent.Train class specifies the training format: The training file should be in the following format: one word and one tag per line separated by a space or a tab. Each sentence should end in an EOS word-tag pair. (Actually, I'm not entirely sure that is still the case, but it probably won't hurt. -wmorgan)
