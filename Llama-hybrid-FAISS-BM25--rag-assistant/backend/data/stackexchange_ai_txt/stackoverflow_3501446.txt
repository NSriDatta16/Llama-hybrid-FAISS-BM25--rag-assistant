UIScrollView doesn't remember the position

Has anyone ever had the problem that a UIScrollView , which gets moved by [UIScrollView setContentOffset:...] doesn't "remember" it's new position? It however does, if the user scrolls via touch-and-drag. Symptoms: If the UIScrollView doesn't remember the new position, it "flips" back to the original position it last remembers (which is the position which has been used via touch-and-drag) whenever it's being touched. Interesting: This only happens in 4.0 and didn't happen in 3.1 This only happens if pagingEnabled == YES is set
