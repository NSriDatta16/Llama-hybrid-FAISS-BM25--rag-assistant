Do I have a serious memory leak problem?

I'm building a windows form application in C# that reads from hundreds of file and create an object hierarchy. In particular: DEBUG[14]: Imported 129 system/s, 6450 query/s, 6284293 document/s. The sum is the total number of object I've created. Objects are really simple by the way, just some int/string properties and strongly typed lists inside. Question : is normal that my application is consuming about 700MB of memory (in debug mode)? What can I do for how to reduce memory usage? EDIT : here is why i have 6284293 objects, if you're just curious. Imagine a search engine, called "system". A system have more queries inside it. public class System { public List Queries; } Each query object refers to a "topic"; that is the main argument (eg. search for "italy weekend"). It ha a list of retrieved document inside: public class Query { public Topic Topic; // Maintain only a reference to the topic public List RetrievedDocuments; public System System; // Maintain only a reference to the system } Each retrieved document has a score and a rank and has a reference to the topic document: public class RetrievedDocument { public string Id; public int Rank; public double Score; public Document Document; } Each topic has a collection of documents inside, that can be relevant or not relevant, and a reference to its parent topic: public class Topic { public int Id; public List Documents; public List RelevantDocuments { get {return Documents.Where(d => d.IsRelevant());} } } public class Document { public string Id; public bool IsRelevant; public Topic Topic; // Maintain only a reference to the topic } There are 129 systems, 50 main topics (129*50 = 6450 query objects), each query has a different number of retrieved documents, 6284293 in total. I need this hierarchy for doing some calculations (average precision, topic ease, system mean average precision, relevancy). This is how TREC works...
