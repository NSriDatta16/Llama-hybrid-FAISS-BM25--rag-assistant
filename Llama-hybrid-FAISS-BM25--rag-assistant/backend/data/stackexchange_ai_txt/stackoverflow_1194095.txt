How can I set a tabindex in a foreach loop in an ASP.NET MVC view?

How can I set the tabindex value of a set of checkboxes within a foreach loop in ASP.NET MVC? My current solution uses a Response.Write to output the checkboxes, but I'd rather find something more elegant. Does anyone have a good solution? This code does not work: Country: x.Text), "Choose country...", new { tabindex = 8 })%> Sales Processing Methodology: " name="processing-methodologies" class="checkbox" value=" " tabindex=" "> "> This does: Country: x.Text), "Choose country...", new { tabindex = 8 })%> Sales Processing Methodology: " + method.Value + @" "); i++; } %> Edit: The code that wasn't working produced tabindex="" .
