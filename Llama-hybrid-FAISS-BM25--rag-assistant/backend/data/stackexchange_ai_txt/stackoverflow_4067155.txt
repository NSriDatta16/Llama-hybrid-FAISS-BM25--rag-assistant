What sort of "weird results" are you getting? The code you posted has no obvious problems in it (you aren't changing @associationsToRemove while iterating over it, so "don't delete from a list you're iterating over" doesn't apply), so I'm inclined to suspect that the actual problem is in agentConf->RemoveAssociation .
