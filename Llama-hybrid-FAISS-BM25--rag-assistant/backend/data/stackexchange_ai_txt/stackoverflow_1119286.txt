I'm not aware of an elegant way to achieve this. However, using a bit of lateral thinking...you could make sure that all your controllers use prepend_before_filter . That way, if your module uses before_filter you'll know that it will always be the last filter because the controllers will always be adding their filters to the beginning of the filter chain.
