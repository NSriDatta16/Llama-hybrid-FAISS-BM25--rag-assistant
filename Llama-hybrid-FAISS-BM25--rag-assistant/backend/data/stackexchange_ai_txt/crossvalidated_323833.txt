What are some quality metrics of a Bayesian Probabilistic Model?

I'm building a Bayesian Probabilistic Model and have been researching ways to assess the quality of the model but haven't found much. Any recommendation would be much appreciated. [Edit: Providing more context] I'm building a model that will predict the likelihood that an event will occur given a number of past events.
