Linear model with AR hidden state

Suppose everyday I want to predict the temperature reading taken somewhere in a city. I have some explanatory variables, say humidity and wind speed. And I have data for $K$ cities. So the data look like date city humidity wind temperature 2000-09-01 London 70 12 15.0 2000-09-01 London 50 6 15.3 2000-09-01 London 80 7 15.5 2000-09-01 Paris 60 4 16.0 2000-09-02 London 80 1 18.0 2000-09-02 London 81 2 18.2 2000-09-02 Paris 60 4 16.0 Number of readings per day is random. Suppose $K = 250$ and some cities have 900+ rows and some cities have only 30 rows. The model I want to build is to have a hidden "normalised" temperature of each day for each city which follows an AR process $$\tilde{T}_d^{city} = \alpha\tilde{T}_{d-1}^{city} + \epsilon,$$ and the observed temperature is $$T_d^{city} = \mu+X\beta+\tilde{T}_d^{city}+\eta,$$ where $X$ are my explanatory variables, $\mu, \alpha Is there any literature on such model or similar ones? How can I fit this model? NB The temperature example is for illustration only. I know it's wrong to have a constant $\alpha This is not a regression with AR error but similar. Regression-AR deals with one long time series while I have 250 time series with different lengths.
