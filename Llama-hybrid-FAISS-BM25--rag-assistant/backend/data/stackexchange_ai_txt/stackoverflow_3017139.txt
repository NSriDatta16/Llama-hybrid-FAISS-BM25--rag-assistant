Since you get no points for having 100% OO purity follow Swingline Rage's advice. You could also make it pure just by renaming the class ;-) Only thing is, if you use Interfaces instead of Abstract Classes and inheritance you are less likely to get burned. Interfaces can inherit from each other but you probably won't need it. A little harder to write but you can use them the same way. http://www.codeproject.com/KB/cs/abstractsvsinterfaces.aspx Interface or an Abstract Class: which one to use? "what about shared code in the base class?" - You can stay DRY if you Use static classes and call them (it's not a sin to use some procedural techniques in OO). Q#2 in the stack overflow topic above looks interesting but I can't vouch for it.
