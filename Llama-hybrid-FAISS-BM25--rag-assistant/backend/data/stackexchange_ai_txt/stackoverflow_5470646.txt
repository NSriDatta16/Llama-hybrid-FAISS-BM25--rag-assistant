Regular Expression matching with start tag and closing tag as a new line

I've been producing a letter compilation system (to save people time after a questionaire has been filled in) and near the end of the project we've found a bug. Long story short it would take many hours to fix without this regular expression - which is why I'm asking for your fine help! We have some text that contains the following... " This is the start of the paragraph This is some more of the paragraph. And some more"; I basically need a regular expression that can search for the opening tag, " ", and also the first new line it comes across "\r\n"? and then insert the contents into a variable I can then use (with the removed but the new line codes, "\r\n", left in place). I'm using PHP and the text (like the example above) is stored in MySQL. Please help! I promise I'll learn these properly after I've fixed this bug! :)
