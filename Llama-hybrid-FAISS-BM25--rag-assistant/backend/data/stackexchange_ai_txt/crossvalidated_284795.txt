After almost a month, it struck me (and the comment from @John Madden helped as well). Logistic regression (the MLE estimates to be precise) is calculated by Newton-Raphson algorithm. And this algorithm can be actually rewritten as Iterative Reweighted Least Squares. In WLS, the weights are $w = 1/\sigma^2$. Which is same as the $V$ matrix, which contains variance a well.
