Is there a test (in R) for predicting the proportion of "successes" to "failures"?

As I understand it, binomial logistic regression is good for predicting the probability of a "1" outcome from a discrete binomial distribution. What if instead, one wanted to predict the proportion of 1's to 0's (the proportion of sick to healthy, or animals with full stomachs to empty stomachs, etc...). I thought the prop.test in R was a good solution, but it doesn't seem built for scenarios where the data consists of multiple explanatory variables and/or factors with multiple levels. My data could look something like this (with many more replicates and site values [a to z]):
