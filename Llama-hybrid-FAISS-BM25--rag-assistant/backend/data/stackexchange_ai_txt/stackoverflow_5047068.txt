Team Foundation Server 2010 branching setup

We're setting up a brand new TFS 2010 server, without having used TFS before (or, frighteningly enough, no other central source management system). Here's the general structure our small team (of 6-7 programmers) talked about setting up, and I'm curious, based on others experience working with TFS, if this is a good idea or not (these names are just descriptive and not what we're planning to use): $/ Our Organization's Collection/ .Net technology projects/ class libraries projects/ Project 1/ Project 2/ Project 3/ etc.../ ASP.NET projects/ Project 1/ Project 2/ Project 3/ etc.../ Windows Workflow Foundation projects/ etc.../ WPF projects/ etc.../ Other non .NET source code/ SQL/ Server configuration/ (and so on) Will we regret this structure after a year of using it? An application would span many parts of this structure - would that be a problem to manage? At what level do we set up release/main/dev branches? Thanks for any input and guidance!
