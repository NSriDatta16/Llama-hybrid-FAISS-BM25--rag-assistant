Good Ajax Chart/Graphic Library

I know there has been several discussions on JavaScript chart/graphics libraries, and there is many out there. What I need is one that can: Zooming and panning Data point manipulation (like when click on a data point, highlight other data points within the data series with the same certain parameter of the clicked one) Dynamically change data point values (e.g.: dragging a data point dynamically updating the line shape) Error bar support, horizontally and vertically Select data points on the chart Seems like Flot may have most of the features, if not all(not sure about 3, and 4), but would like to see if I don't miss out on there nice libraries.
