Do the series have to be described by the same number of lags in a Moving Average Model to fit a VARMA model?

Besides the other requirements for VAR, do the series have to be best described by the same number of MA terms to be included in a VARMA model? As I understand it, the AR in VAR equals the lag of the peak of the Cross-correlation function rather than the actual AR terms the series are best described.
