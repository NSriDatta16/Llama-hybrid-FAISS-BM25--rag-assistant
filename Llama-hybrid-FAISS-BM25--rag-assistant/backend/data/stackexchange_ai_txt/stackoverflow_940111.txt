I'm just going to try to reap the bounty, so don't shoot me if I am completely on the wrong track :) If your application is "setting there forever waiting for a response" than you could do the request in a separate thread and after spawning your requestThread you could just say requestThread.join(max_time_to_wait); the next call would check if the requestThread is still alive and if it this then try to kill it. You application will move on after a time-out and it's not the most inelegant solution...
