Java to Clojure rewrite

I have just been asked by my company to rewrite a largish (50,000 single lines of code) Java application (a web app using JSP and servlets) in Clojure. Has anyone else got tips as to what I should watch out for? Please bear in mind that I know both Java AND Clojure quite well. Update I did the rewrite and it went into production. It's quite strange as the rewrite ended up going so fast that it was done in about 6 weeks. Because a lot of functionality wasn't needed still it ended up more like 3000 lines of Clojure. I hear they are happy with the system and its doing exactly what they wanted. The only downside is that the guy maintaining the system had to learn Clojure from scratch, and he was dragged into it kicking and screaming. I did get a call from him the other day saying he loved Lisp now though.. funny :) Also, I should give a good mention to Vaadin. Using Vaadin probably accounted for as much of the time saved and shortness of the code as Clojure did.. Vaadin is still the top web framework I have ever used, although now I'm learning ClojureScript in anger! (Note that both Vaadin and ClojureScript use Google's GUI frameworks underneath the hood.)
