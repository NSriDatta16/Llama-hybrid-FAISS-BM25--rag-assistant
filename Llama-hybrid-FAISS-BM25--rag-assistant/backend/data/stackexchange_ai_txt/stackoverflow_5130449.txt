How to cancel a google map marker drag operation?

As you see in the following code, the Markers are draggable. In some cases, If a marker is dropped in a wrong area(polygon) I would like to cancel the drop event and consequently the marker come back to its original location automatically. function placeMarker(latlng, color, isDraggable) { var marker = new GMarker(latlng, { icon: getIcon(color), draggable: true }); map.addOverlay(marker); GEvent.addListener(marker, "dragend", function () { //redraw polygons again }); GEvent.addListener(marker, "click", function () { var latlng = marker.getPoint(); map.openInfoWindowHtml(marker.getPoint(), latlng.y + ", " + latlng.x); }); return marker; } The question is how can I cancel the drag event of marker when it's already dropped in dragend event?
