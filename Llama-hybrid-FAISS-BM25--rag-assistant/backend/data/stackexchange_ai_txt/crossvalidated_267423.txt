Optimizing black box functions without Bayesian Optimization

I have a black box system which accepts a data instance $\boldsymbol{x}$ and outputs a corresponding $y$. I don not know the exact mathematical formula of the system. What I want to do is maximizing $y$ by tweaking $\boldsymbol{x}$. Since I don't have the exact formula of the system, I cannot use gradient descent to do this. One idea in my mind is to add random noise to $\boldsymbol{x}$ which results in $\hat{\boldsymbol{x}}$, and then sample corresponding $\hat{y}$ from the system. By doing this I could use Bayesian Optimizaton to find an $\hat{\boldsymbol{x}}$ which maximizes $\hat{y}$. My question is: Is there any other methods to tackle this problem? Can you point me out any paper/book/tutorial? Thank you
