On the derivation of the kalman filter in general, many good references exist. Among them, Simon, D. Optimal State Estimation: Kalman, H Infinity, and Nonlinear Approaches Durbin, J. and Koopman, S.J. Time Series Analysis by State Space Methods Gibbs, B.P. Advanced Kalman Filtering, Least-Squares and Modeling: A Practical Handbook For your precise question about the EM estimation with state-space models, perhaps you can turn to section 6.3 of Shumway, R.H. and Stoffer, D.S. Time Series Analysis and Its Applications: With R Examples where it is nicely explained.
