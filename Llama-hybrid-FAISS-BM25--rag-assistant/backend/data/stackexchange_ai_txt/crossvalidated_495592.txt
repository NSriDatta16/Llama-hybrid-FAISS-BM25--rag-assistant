For all analyses, you can perform the analysis you would have performed had you had a randomized experiment, except that you need to include cluster-robust standard errors with pair membership as the cluster. So, for continuous outcomes, you can use a linear regression of the outcome on the treatment; for nominal outcomes, you can use a multinomial logistic regression of the outcome on the treatment (or just a regular logistic regression for two-level outcomes). If you're using a version of MatchIt prior to 4.0.0 and you use nearest neighbor matching (the default), you will need to create a new column in the match.data() output containing pair membership. I have code to do that here . Otherwise, the subclass variable in the match.data() output contains pair membership. MatchIt 4.0.0 will be on CRAN soon, but for now you can install it using devtools::install_github("ngreifer/MatchIt") .
