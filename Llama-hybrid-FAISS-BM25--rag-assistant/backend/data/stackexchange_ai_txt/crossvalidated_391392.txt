Terminology for Bayesian Posterior Mean of Probability with Uniform Prior

If $p \sim$ Uniform $(0,1)$ , and $X \sim$ Bin $(n, p)$ , then the posterior mean of $p$ is given by $\frac{X+1}{n+2}$ . Is there a common name for this estimator? I've found it solves lots of people's problems and I'd like to be able to point people to a reference, but haven't been able to find the right name for it. I vaguely recall this being called something like the "+1/+2 estimator" in a stats 101 book but that's not a very searchable term.
