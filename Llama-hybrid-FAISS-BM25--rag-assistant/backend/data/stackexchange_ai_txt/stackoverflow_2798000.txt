In your scenario, it seems that the parent is aware of the type of child. Can't you just use properties in this situation? : ListOfCountriesVM exposes a property for SelectedCountry. In the parent VM, the implementation of SelectedCountry simply returns ListOfCountriesVM.SelectedCountry. You could do this for any Parent View Model that is aware that it owns a ListOfCountriesVM. In my experience, messaging/event aggregation should really only be used in scenarios where the publisher doesn't care who's listening or how many listeners there are. For example: Sending notifications to other modules in the application Sending notifications to view models in the same module that you can't guarantee exist. In your situation, the subscriber, (the parent) already knows who the publisher (the child) is, so a simple solution using properties seems to be the most appropriate. I don't think this particular scenario warrants a messaging or event based solution.
