Because your response is a ratio between 0 and 1, it might be possible there is a heterogeneous (skewness) between data. In this case, logistic regression can not take into account this heterogeneity very well. An alternative model is beta regression. Beta distribution is a good choice to consider heterogeneity and skewness between data. Also, there is a R package to do this regression.
