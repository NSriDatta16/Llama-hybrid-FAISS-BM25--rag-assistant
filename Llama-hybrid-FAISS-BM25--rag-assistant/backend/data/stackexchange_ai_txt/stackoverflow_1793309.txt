How do these page output caching settings work?

I am revising for exam 70-562 on ASP.NET application development and the last chapter on caching has brought up a few questions: What is the difference between Response.AddCacheDependency(...) and Response.AddCacheItemDependency(...)? The former uses a CacheDependency object and the latter is an item in the cache, but a CacheDependency object itself references an item in the cache. In page output caching, the following properties can be set: -NoStore for secondary storage -Location for caching localtion (what is downstream - I know this is from server to client - but what this setting mean for this property?) -Shared - this means user control output can be shared between pages. Any example of how this works? Thanks
