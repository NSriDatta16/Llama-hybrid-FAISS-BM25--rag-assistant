Well you're breaking the VM specification, section 4.10 : The number of method parameters is limited to 255 by the definition of a method descriptor (ยง4.3.3), where the limit includes one unit for this in the case of instance or interface method invocations. Note that a method descriptor is defined in terms of a notion of method parameter length in which a parameter of type long or double contributes two units to the length, so parameters of these types further reduce the limit. I suggest you overcome the obstacles in changing the generated code... I'm pretty surprised it works on Linux, to be honest. I wouldn't be entirely surprised if the bytecode it generated was strictly invalid, and it just happens to be working for you at the moment. While it's always tempting to try to find ways of keeping with the existing code and ignoring the limits, I think in this case you should turn your attention to reducing the number of parameters immediately.
