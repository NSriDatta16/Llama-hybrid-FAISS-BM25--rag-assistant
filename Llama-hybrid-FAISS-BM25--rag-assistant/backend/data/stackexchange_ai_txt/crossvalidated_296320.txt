During oversampling of rare events, why are the beta coefficients of the independent variables not affected, but only the intercept?

I have followed the King and Zeng paper and understand the consistency of the prior correction after oversampling in logistic regression. But I am trying to understand why the beta coefficients of the independent variables are not affected by the exercise? If I correctly, there is a proof of this in Minski's 1977 paper. But I cannot find that proof on the internet. Could anyone explain this to me in little detail?
