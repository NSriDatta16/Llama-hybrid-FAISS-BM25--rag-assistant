Testing accuracy is higher than training accuracy

My testing accuracy is way higher than my training accuracy. I have used feature selection and split the data into training, validation and test sets. anova_filter = SelectKBest(f_classif, k=4) rng = np.random.rand X_train, X_val, Y_train, Y_val = train_test_split(X, Y, test_size = 0.40, shuffle = False, random_state = rng) X_val, X_test, Y_val, Y_test = train_test_split(X_val, Y_val, test_size = 0.50, shuffle = False, random_state =rng) #fitting the dataset anova_svm.fit(X_train, Y_train) #Predicting Values Y_pred = anova_svm.predict(X_val) X_train_pred = anova_svm.predict(X_train) training_data_accuracy = accuracy_score(Y_train, X_train_pred) testing_data_accuracy = accuracy_score(Y_val, Y_pred)
