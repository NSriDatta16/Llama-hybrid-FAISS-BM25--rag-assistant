The span tag just tells the browser to apply what ever style changes are included within the span and if there is no styling within the span then there would be no formatting applied to the enclosed text. This is a bit different from the div tag which incorporates a paragraph break even if no styling options are included within a div. So it is useful when you want to apply styles to elements without placing them in a separate block. cheers
