XGBRegressor score (R2) vs. eval_metric (RMSE)

According to the API Reference , XGBRegressor().score() returns R2. However, according to the XGBoost Paramters page, the default eval_metric for regression is RMSE. In my understanding, scoring and using an evaluation metric is the same. So what am I missing here? Does XGBoost use different defaults for its native API and the Scikit-Learn API? Or do these two options mean something different? Thanks a lot!
