Repositories should normally not work in their own independent transactional unit, so they most often use the 'existing' database connection. This way you can do multiple repository (database!) operations in a single transaction. How to implement this depends on your developing platform. Java EE for example has ways to inject the current Entity Manager into objects or ways to get it by code. You can also implement this manually by storing a reference in a thread local storage .
