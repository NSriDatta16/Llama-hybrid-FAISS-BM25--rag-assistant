I want to build a crime index and political instability index based in news stories

I have this side project where I crawl the local news websites in my country and want to build a crime index and political instability index. I have already covered the information retrieval part of the project. My plan is to do: Unsupervised topic extraction. Near duplicates detection. Supervised classification and incident level (crime/political - high/medium/low). I will use python and sklearn and have already research the algorithms that I can use for those tasks. I think 2. could give me a relevancy factor of a story: the more news papers publish about an story or topic the more relevant for that day. My next step is to build the monthly, weekly and daily index (nation-wide and per cities) based on the features that I have, and I'm a little lost here as the "instability sensitivity" might increase to the time. I mean, the index from the major instability incident of the last year could be less than the index for this year. Also if to use fixed scale 0-100 or not. Later I would like to be able to predict incidents based on this, e.g. whether the succession of events in the last weeks are leading to a major incident. But for now I will be happy with getting the classification working and building the index model. I would appreciate any pointer to a paper, relevant readings or thoughts. Thanks. PD: Sorry if the question does not belong here. UPDATE : I haven't yet "make it", but recently there was a news about a group of scientists that are working in a system to predict the events using news archives and released a relevant paper Mining the Web to Predict Future Events (PDF).
