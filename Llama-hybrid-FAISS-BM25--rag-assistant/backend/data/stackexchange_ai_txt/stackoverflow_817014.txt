I've just been digging into how Kutano 's right-side bar works as I'd like to do the same. This doesn't directly help your question as I don't have an answer yet, but here's what I know: Kutano doesn't appear to be a normal Explorer Bar, as there's no entry for it in HKCR\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Explorer Bars , nor does it appear in the View|Explorer Bar menu. The following entries in the registry referencing the Kutano sidebar DLL: HKCR\AppID\{6D6036C6-692F-4211-903B-943D94E1CCC3} kutano_ie_client HKCR\CLSID\{18D81A5F-F8A5-4B78-A6CC-7E37DCAFC0BB} Kutano Add-on TypeLib {24DA2415-9F99-403F-801B-A74AE4101C27} HKCR\CLSID\{2AE98FD7-4E58-4400-8113-B5018ED48676} Kutano Sidebar TypeLib {24DA2415-9F99-403F-801B-A74AE4101C27} HKCR\CLSID\{2F698BD8-48CD-45B4-ACDF-67F92082EE7E} MenuItem TypeLib {24DA2415-9F99-403F-801B-A74AE4101C27} HKCR\CLSID\{A5B02961-E212-4195-A77D-6E1346C2DE18} kutanoSidebarExtInterface Class TypeLib {24DA2415-9F99-403F-801B-A74AE4101C27} HKCR\CLSID\{E163FD8B-2ADD-4F2E-86E8-7678D008ED43} KutanoToolbarBtn Class TypeLib {24DA2415-9F99-403F-801B-A74AE4101C27} HKCR\TypeLib\{24DA2415-9F99-403F-801B-A74AE4101C27} kutano_ie_client 1.0 Type Library HKLM\Software\Classes\AppID\kutano_ie_client.DLL AppID {6D6036C6-692F-4211-903B-943D94E1CCC3} Some of these are more apparent as to what they do than others. Delving about with Spy++ it seems to add an extra Shell DocObject View to the window hierarchy: TabWindowClass ATL:63CB39A0 Kutano_SplitterWindow AtlAxWin90 Shell Embedding Shell DocObject View Internet Explorer_Server It does leave the original in place and appears to continue to use it: TabWindowClass Shell DocObject View Internet Explorer_Server This seems somewhat different and more involved than your HP example, but hope it might glean some information to the same end. I've a thread about this on the MSDN Internet Explorer Extension Development forum.
