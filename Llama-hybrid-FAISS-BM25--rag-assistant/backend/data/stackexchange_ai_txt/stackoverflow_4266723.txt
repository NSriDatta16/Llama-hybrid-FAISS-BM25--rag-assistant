Creating simple graphical component that can be dragged and dropped RCP eclipse

i am in a process of making an automation tool. I choose Eclipse RCP to develop that. i have hardly any knowledge on RCP/swings/UI creation in java but good in core java. I followed a tutorial from internet and created a simple RCP app which has two views and a simple menu. i have gained knowledge on the basic thing like workbenchadvisor,actionbaradvisor , viewpart and also on dragdroplister. I want to create simple graphic components on one view which can be dragged and droppped to other view. what should create the grphical components with ? swings or something else.. and how to implement the dragdrop for that components.. Please help thanks for the reply i created drag and drop for buttons.i am able build my own figures using GEF but when i include org.eclipse.draw2d package in my project. its throughs error 'Missing constarint:Import Package:org.eclipse.draw2d:version="0.0.0" ' can some one tell me what would have gone wrong and also i have two views. i should be able to move my figures any where in that view. i know this can be done in perspectives but not sure how it can be done ![alt text][1]
