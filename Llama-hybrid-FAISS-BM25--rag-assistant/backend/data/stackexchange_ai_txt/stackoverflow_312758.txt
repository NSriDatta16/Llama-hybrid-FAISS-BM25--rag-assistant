Open and close your connection per business operation If you are talking about a client/server application, I would recommend closing each connection as soon as you are done using it. While each individual application instance might take a small performance hit opening the connection, your application as a whole will scale better. This is somewhat dependent on the database server you are using. SQL Server will handle different numbers of concurrent connections based on the hardware it is installed on. If you want to scale up a client/server app to thousands of desktop, a small DB server might not handle all those desktops with open connections but could very well handle thousands of desktops with only some of the connections open. I saw this first hand a few years ago. An application that was deployed to a few departments with no trouble was then deployed across the entire organization. The application was soon very, very slow. The organization was considering buying a very expensive chunk of hardware for their DB server to gain some performance. I recommended they open and close the db connection after each business operation. Luckily they had architected the application so that this was not a difficult change. They made the change and rolled it out during one of their weekly network updates. Overnight the application performance had improved significantly. They saved thousands of dollars.
