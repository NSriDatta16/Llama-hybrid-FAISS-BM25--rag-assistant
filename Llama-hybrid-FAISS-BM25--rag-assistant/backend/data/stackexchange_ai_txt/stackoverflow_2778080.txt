Call trace in Android

I want to know how to do method tracing for Android applications. I mean, a sequence of calls on each object, not a stack trace. It's very similar to this question (Call trace in java) , but on different platforms (jvm-PC vs dvm-Android). I have no control over the start arguments of dalvik, thus I cannot specify a java agent (or am I wrong here?). Is there another way to do method tracing? Thanks!
