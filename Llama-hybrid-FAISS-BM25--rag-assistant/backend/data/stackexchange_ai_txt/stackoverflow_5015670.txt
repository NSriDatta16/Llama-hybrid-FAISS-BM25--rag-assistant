You use the attributes parameter (there is no direct link to the paragraph, open link and search for "STEP 3: Embed your SWF with JavaScript" headline) to assign an id or a class to the object. You could then use document.getElementById() to get the object, once it has been created. Or use #id or .classname from CSS, just the way you would expect it to work. Caution, though: attributes.class would cause an error (it's a reserved keyword), you have to use attributes.styleclass to set the classname.
