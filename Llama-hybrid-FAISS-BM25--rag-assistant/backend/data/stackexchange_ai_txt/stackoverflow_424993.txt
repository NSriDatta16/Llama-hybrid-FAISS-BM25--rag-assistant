Multi-threaded applications are significantly more difficult to write, and maintain. I think you will start seeing more applications which leverage multi-threading thanks to advances in both hardware, but also in advances in the technology stack. Microsoft has a set of extensions that I believe are being added into the runtime called ??Parallels?? I know they call the LINQ enabled version PLINQ. Essentially it tries to remove a lot of the error prone plumbing from multi-threaded algorithims. Only time tell however, and I would wager there were still be plenty of single threaded applications out there because they won't algorithims that justify the performance cost of spinning up threads.
