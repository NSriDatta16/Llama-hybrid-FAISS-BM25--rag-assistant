You can organize all your java classes/annotations/interfaces into separate jars. Just ensure that there is a seam.properties file in the META-INF folder. When seam starts up, it scans all jars in the classpath to see if they have that file. If so, it adds them as possible components. So you can just include these various jars in your war. I've never found a way to include xhtml files from separate wars/jars and have them actually function in a war. We currently use the overlay feature of maven to combine various wars into a big one. It combines the various faces-config, components.xml and xhtml files into one large war that we deploy.
