UIView transformation to SVG matrix

I am currently embedding an image into an exported SVG document and am running into an issue with the transformation matrix on a UIView that I am scaling and moving. My output currently pushes the matrix into the attribute transform transform="matrix(view.transform.a, view.transform.b, view.transform.c, view.transform.d, view.transform.tx, view.transform.ty)" This all works perfectly fine with the exception of the tx and ty values of the transformation. For some reason when I scale the view these values start getting weird , and I'm not sure what is going on. Obviously core graphics is handeling the matrix a little different than svg is, but does anyone know what the difference is?
