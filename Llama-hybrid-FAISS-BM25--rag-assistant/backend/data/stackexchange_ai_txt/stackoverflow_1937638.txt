As I understand it, subclassing is not encouraged because Objective C allows a subclass too much access to the internal workings of its superclass. The suggested alternative to writing a subclass is to write a delegate, in this case a UINavigationControllerDelegate. You can then encapsulate the specific behavior you want to extend into this delegate class, and link it up to the UINavigationController whenever you need it.
