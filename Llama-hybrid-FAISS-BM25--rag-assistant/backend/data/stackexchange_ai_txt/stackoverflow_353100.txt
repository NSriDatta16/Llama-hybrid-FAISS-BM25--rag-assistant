jQuery fadeIn, fadeOut effects in IE

The below fadeIn , fadeOut effect works fine in Firefox 3.0 but it doesn't work in IE 7 ... Whay is that and what's the trick? The idea is of course to get a "blink" effect and attract the attention of the user to a specific row in a table. function highLightErrorsAndWarnings() { $(".status-error").fadeIn(100).fadeOut(300).fadeIn(300).fadeOut(300).fadeIn(300).fadeOut(300).fadeIn(300); $(".status-warning").fadeIn(100).fadeOut(300).fadeIn(300).fadeOut(300).fadeIn(300).fadeOut(300).fadeIn(300); } Update: Found the stupid problem ... ".status-error" points to a tr-element. It's possible to the set the background-color and fade it on a tr in Firefox but not in IE. Changing the "CSS pointer" to ".status-error td " made it point to the td below the tr and everything worked in all browsers.
