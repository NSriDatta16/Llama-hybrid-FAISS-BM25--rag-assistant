These scenarios should be remarkable similar. In survival analysis, it is helpful to think about the cumulative observation time as informative regarding the precision and standard errors. For instance, in a sample where 200 die, if another 5,000 are observed who do not die, they can contribute to the precision of the estimates of HRs. Deaths remain the main (but not sole) driver of power. In Cox models this is made explicit by the risk set. Considering that approximately half the sample lives past 1,500 days it's perhaps not a coincidence that in scenario 2 you subsample in an arbitrary interval around the median survival for the two balanced groups (e.g. $\pm 200$ ). That does not mean that, on average, the number of person-days of observation will or will not be the sample in the two scenarios. The more powerful sampling strategy will be the one which has a highest person years of observation period, provided all the appropriate modeling assumptions are met. Suppose we consider person-days of observation for one treatment group. The actual distribution of event times will determine whether the subsample of events falling in a symmetric interval around the median actually comprises a greater survival time. As an example, consider survival times exponentially distributed. set.seed(123) surv gives > sum(i) ## PD-fu in scenario 2 [1] 338.1843 > mean(replicate(1000, sum(sample(surv, n)))) ## average PD-fu in scenario 1 [1] 485.7077 so the unconditional sample includes more persons having longer event time follow-up, and hence would be slightly more powerful.
