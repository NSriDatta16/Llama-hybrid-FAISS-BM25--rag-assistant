Computing Posterior Probability of a Model being the correct one

Let $x\sim N(\mu,\sigma^2)$ and $\mu\sim N(\xi, \tau^2)$. To test whether $\mu 0$, in Bayesian inference it's usual to take the perspective of hypothesis testing as model selection. In that perspective, $M_1:\mu 0$ . There are at least two ways to compute $P(M_{True}=M_1|x)$. The easy one seems to use the fact that $P(M_{True}=M_1|x)=P(\mu (to save space-time I won't write $\xi(x)$ or $w$ formula) The second way to calculate the $P(M_{True}=M_1|x)=\frac{\int l_k(\theta)\pi_k(\theta) d\theta \ \ P(M=k)}{\sum_j\int l_j(\theta)\pi_j(\theta) d\theta \ P(M=j)}$. I'm trying to do by the second way. However, I get $P(M_{True}=M_1|x)=1-\Phi(-\xi(x)/w)=\Phi(\xi(x)/w)$ This is based on the book Bayesian Essentials , page 40. Any help would be appreciated. Edit: for the second way, we define $$\pi_1(\mu)=\frac{\exp\{-(\mu-\xi)^2/(2\tau^2\}}{(2\pi \tau^2)^{1/2}\Phi(-\xi/\tau)}\mathbb{I}_{\mu 0}$$
