The natural choice would of course be to pass the result as std::vector . If you don't want to use this approach there are two options: Let the client of the code supply the storage of the result, in this case it would be a good idea that the client passes the size of the supplied storage as well. Allocate space for the result inside with new , I think this is a better, more robust choice. You will of course have to make sure that the client later deletes the memory with the correct version of delete or provide a special mechanism to deallocate the memory.
