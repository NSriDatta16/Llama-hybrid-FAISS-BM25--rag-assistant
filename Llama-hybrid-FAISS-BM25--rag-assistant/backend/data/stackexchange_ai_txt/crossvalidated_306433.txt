First things first. As many other people said you can use other metrics but the average is the "default" option. As a default option, one would set a function that works under some mild conditions Now, If you think about it, a random forest is a collection of trees and each of these trees has the objective to estimate your numeric response variable. Additionally, as @David Ernst correctly mentions: There is no reason to think some trees should have more predictive weights as others, nor a way to determine such weights. Furthermore, there is no reason to think that these trees will have different standard deviations. Again, under mild conditions! That being said, the average should work because of the Weak law of large numbers
