What are some ways to train, test and render an RL autonomous drone in a simulator?

I completed the Udacity nanodegree in Deep Learning but found the final project to be extremely difficult since the only visual feedback were from plots via matplotlib (rotor speeds, x/y/z coordinates, x/y/z velocity, etc). Is there any way to render the learning per episode as done in openai gym? A quick search for Python game engines only confused me more in terms of which one to use. Here is a link to the final project, ie. fly a quadcopter using DDPG algorithm: https://github.com/udacity/RL-Quadcopter-2 It has a physics_sim.py , task.py , agent.py and a main ipynb notebook.
