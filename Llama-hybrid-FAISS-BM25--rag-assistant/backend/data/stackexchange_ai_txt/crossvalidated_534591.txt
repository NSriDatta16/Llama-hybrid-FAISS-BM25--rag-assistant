Confidence interval for measure that lies within [0, 1]

I have some metrics that all lie within [0,1], and I have multiple measurements of each. For example, one measure is accuracy (for a machine learning application). Accuracy will always lie within [0,1], and given multiple rounds of N-fold cross validation, there will be multiple measurements of accuracy. So let's say I have 50 values of accuracy, how can I form a confidence interval around accuracy, such that the confidence interval does not extend above 1 or below 0? More generally, how can I compute a confidence interval around an average of multiple measurements of a variable that always lies in [0,1], but does not necessarily adhere to a uniform distribution (e.g., a [0,1] truncated normal distribution)?
