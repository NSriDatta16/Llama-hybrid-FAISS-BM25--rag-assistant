Code coverage statistics on major projects

I am trying to find out the code coverage statistics on major projects/major companies: For example: What is the code coverage of the PERL code base? According to one of the answers on this post , it is 70% What is the code coverage of some of the projects at Microsoft? Any other libraries for which these statistics are available.
