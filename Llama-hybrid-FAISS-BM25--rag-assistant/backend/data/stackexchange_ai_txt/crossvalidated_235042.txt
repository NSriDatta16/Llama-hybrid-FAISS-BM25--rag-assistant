Defining the learning rate in Neural Network / MLP

Long story short, I have been reading some stuff on neural networks recently, and realized that the MLP algorithm depends on a parameter $\alpha(t)$ which is the learning rate. Does $\alpha(t)$ have a general functional form? I'm wondering about this because some of the texts write $\alpha$ as $\alpha(t)$, while others write simply $\alpha$ and assign it a fixed number like $0.01$ or $0.1$ etc... By the way, I found this source online: http://users.ics.aalto.fi/jhollmen/dippa/node22.html I don't know if the functional forms they provide for $\alpha(t)$ are applicable to feedforward neural networks. Thanks. Ikjyot Singh Kohli
