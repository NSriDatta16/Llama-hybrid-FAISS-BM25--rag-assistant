if I can use the t-test to claim that one dataset provides significantly better results than the other I wanted to point out that the expression "statistically significant" has been discouraged by the American Statistical Association . (But personally, I don't feel too strongly against it) use confidence intervals (or some other method) to show that one performs better than the other one Confidence intervals can be interpreted as the range of values compatible with the observed data given the assumptions. In fact, it's been suggested that they should be renamed compatibility intervals (see Is the interpretation of a "Compatibility Interval" (Greenland, 2019) valid in general? and links therein). So it seems to me that reporting confidence intervals is appropriate in your case from that little bit I can tell. I would also note that there is a duality between p-values and confidence intervals since the 95% confidence interval is the range where the p-value becomes greater than 0.05 (or whatever alpha you chose to determine the interval). So the confidence interval is often considered a more informative alternative to the p-value for reporting results.
