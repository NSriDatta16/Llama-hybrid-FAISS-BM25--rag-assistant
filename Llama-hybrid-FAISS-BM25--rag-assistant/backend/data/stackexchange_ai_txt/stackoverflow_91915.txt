I certainly have. Historically and on recent projects. Years ago I worked in organisations where templates were everything. Then I worked other places where the templates were looser or non-existent or didn't fit the projects I was working on. Now the content of the software design is pretty much governed by what I need to describe to get the idea across to the audience. "before writing a single line of code" there wouldn't be a a lot of detail. The documents I produce before I start coding are meant to get the idea of what we need to build across to the affected teams and senior management so they introduce high level architecture, functionality, technologies, risks and scope. Those last two are really important. The rest is to show other teams where you need to interface with them and to leave managers with a lingering notion that cool stuff is happening.
