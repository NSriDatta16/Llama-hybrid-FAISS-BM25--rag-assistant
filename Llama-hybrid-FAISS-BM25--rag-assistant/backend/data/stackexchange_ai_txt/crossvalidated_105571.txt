Training error and logistic regression

Suppose we have a training data set with variables $a,b$ and $c$ and binary outcome variable $y$. We fit a logistic regression model to this data set: $$\text{logit}(p) = \hat{\beta_0}+ \hat{\beta_{1}}a + \hat{\beta_{2}}b + \hat{\beta_{3}}c$$ When we get the predicted probabilities from the training data set using the logistic regression model, are we supposed to get perfect classification? Or this depend on the threshold we use?
