Unable to upload file using django

I'm unable to upload a file using django. When I hit submit button I get "This webpage is not available. The webpage at http://127.0.0.1:8000/results might be temporarily down or it may have moved permanently to a new web address." error in chrome. For the file upload HTTP query the corresponding webserver's log entry is: [02/Jul/2010 17:36:06] "POST /results HTTP/1.1" 403 2313 This is the form: Content Based Image Retrieval System entry in urls.py: (r'^results$',upload_and_search), view that handles the file upload: def upload_and_search(request): if request.method != 'POST' or request.FILES is None: output = 'Some thing wrong with file uploading' handle_uploaded_file(request.FILES['queryImage']) output = 'success' return HttpResponse(output) def handle_uploaded_file(f): destination = open('queryImage', 'wb+') for chunk in f.chunks(): destination.write(chunk) destination.close() EDIT: I've also tried changing the destination line destination = open('queryImage', 'wb+') to destination = open(os.environ['TMP']+'\\'+filename, 'wb+') . Its still giving the same error. Also the file I'm trying to upload is less than 2.5MB. EDIT 2: I've added a print statement in the first line of upload_and_search .Its not printing anything. i.e.. its not not even entering the function. I also checked if something is wrong with my url mapping by directly accessing the url http:// 127.0.0.1:8000/results. Its working fine. I think there is some problem with server configuration. I've no clue how to configure this server or what to configure. I'm stuck! I've no clue about what to do.
