I don't mean to be a h8r, but I'm not convinced in the merit of the 'Last_query_cost'... it just seems to over simplify what the cost of a query really is. Obfuscation for a lack of education. :) Personally, I pay more attention to the execution path laid out in the EXPLAIN, and the SHOW SESSION STATUS LIKE 'Handler_%' values to see what is actually done.
