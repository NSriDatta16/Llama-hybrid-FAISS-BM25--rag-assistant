Traditional method: store all the previous answers to questions in fields on subsequent pages, so that the last form contains the entire submission (only not all visible). Drawback: file uploads are annoying to remember, amount of data can get large. Common method: throw answers-so-far into the session or cookies as you go along, picking them out at the end. Drawback: concurrent operations end up with unpredictable conflicting results. File uploads still annoying. I would avoid cookie/session storage solutions for this. Modern method: have a simple (long) single form, but use JavaScript to show only part of it at once. On clicking ‘Next’ you simply hide the previous page worth of content and show the next. The last button is the real submit button.
