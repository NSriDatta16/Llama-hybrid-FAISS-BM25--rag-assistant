Sentiment Analysis on long and structured texts

I'm trying to learn how sentiment analysis based on machine learning techniques works by reading guides online and papers from the academic world and I'm struggling to understand the following: Why don't people run - or, at least, hardly ever - sentiment analysis on the long and structured text like newspaper articles or speeches transcripts? I noticed it's pretty common analyzing reviews and newspapers headlines as they are short in terms of characters. So... I was wondering if it is just because of the computational power and time required to train ML algorithms (thinks about neural networks) or because of other reasons. Can someone help me to understand?
