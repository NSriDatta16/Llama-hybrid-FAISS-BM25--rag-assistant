Google is probably serving you ISO-8859-1. At least, that is what they serve me for the User-Agent "AppEngine-Google; (+ http://code.google.com/appengine )" (which urlfetch uses). The Content-Type header value is: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1 So you would use: result.content.decode('ISO-8859-1') If you check result.headers["Content-Type"] , your code can adapt to changes on the other end. You can generally pass the charset (ISO-8859-1 in this case) directly to the Python decode method.
