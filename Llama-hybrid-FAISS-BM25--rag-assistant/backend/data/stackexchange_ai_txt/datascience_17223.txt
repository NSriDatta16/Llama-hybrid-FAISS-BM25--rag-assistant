How to extract most occuring words based on month & what tool to use?

Hi guys I'm very new to data science, I have intermediate background on programming and have used Pentaho Data Integration tool once for DB migration & data cleansing. Let's say I have this kind of data: item_details, timestamp Wooden chairs, 01-07-2017 Plastic chairs, 02-07-2017 Stainless table, 11-07-2017 Decorated window, 12-07-2017 and so on I want to know based on monthly time frame what are the top trending items in that month. Let's say in January the top 3 item is: 1. Table 2. Chairs 3. Window In February : 1. Door 2. Chair 3. Cupboard .. And so on How can I achive this and using what kind of tool? (preferably free or open source tools, can be GUI based or script library, having a visualization or dashboard is a plus) Thanks for the help. Sorry for noob questions
