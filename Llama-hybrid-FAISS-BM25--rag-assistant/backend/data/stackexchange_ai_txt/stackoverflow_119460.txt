The best thing to do here is to use a HTML parser. With a HTML parser you can look at the table rows programmatically, without having to resort to fragile regular expressions and doing the parsing yourself. Then you can run some logic along the lines of (this is not runnable code, just a sketch that you should be able to see the idea from): for row in table: i = 0 for cell in row: # skipping row 1 event = name starttime = row[0] endtime = table[ i + cell.rowspan + 1 ][0] print event, starttime, endtime i += 1
