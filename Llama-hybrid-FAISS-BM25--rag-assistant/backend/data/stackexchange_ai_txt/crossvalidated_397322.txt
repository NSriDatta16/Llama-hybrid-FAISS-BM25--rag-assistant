How to calculate significance for an A/B test for average revenue per daily active user over a 1-week test period?

One simple approach is to use "per active day" metrics. e.g. "revenue_per_active_day" . However there is a fundamental flaw with this approach. e.g. during a 7-day period, let's say user 1 is active on 1 day and generates 1 dollar of revenue. and let's say user 2 is active on 7 days and generates 7 dollars of revenue. These two users would both have "revenue_per_active_day" of 1 dollar and thus have exactly the same impact on the A/B test analysis result, whereas in reality the more active user would have more impact on ARPDAU (average revenue per daily active user), so basically we're biased against heavy users / biased towards light users. A potentially better approach (not sure) is to treat each day of the test period as a separate A/B test and use the "repeated measure ANOVA" statistical test to determine whether or not the test group mean is different from the control group mean in a statistically significant way. Repeated measures design - Wikipedia ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeated_measures_design ) Repeated Measures ANOVA ( https://statistics.laerd.com/statistical-guides/repeated-measures-anova-statistical-guide.php ) However this is inherently complicated. The vanilla case of Repeated Measure ANOVA (rANOVA) assumes "sphericity" ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUXdWUHJRqA ) but almost always the assumption of sphericity is violated. There is a way to adjust for this but it's not perfect ( https://statistics.laerd.com/statistical-guides/sphericity-statistical-guide-2.php )
