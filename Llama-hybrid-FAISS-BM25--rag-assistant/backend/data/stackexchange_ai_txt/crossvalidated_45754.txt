Interpreting Logit Interaction Term Coefficients (continuous * categorical)

I have the following output from a logistic regression model. Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -2.6023448 0.0694696 -37.460 I am using these coefficients to draw the predicted probabilities such that. $$\text{Prob} = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}$$ where $$z = B_0 + B_1X_1 + \dots + B_nX_n.$$ I realize that interpreting these interaction terms can be challenging. However, I generate the main regression equation and use that to formulate the probability curve. However, I'm not sure how to make sense of any of the "our_bid:zipcode" variables? What about if my model output was: (instead saving zipcode as a factor, I make it a continuous variable) Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -2.6023448 0.0694696 -37.460 Would interpretation being easier with this approach? Keeping with the log-odds, how can I make sense of the log-odds effect that this model expresses for the interaction term?
