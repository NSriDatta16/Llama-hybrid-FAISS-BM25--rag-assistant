Best methodology for file uploading (how does YouTube do it?)

What is the best method to follow for uploading files to server using my website? Each user will upload some files to his profile. Should I place all files in a single directory or do I need to create folders for each user and keep the files there? How does YouTube do this? How should I store the uploaded info in database? What's the most efficient approach to do this when handling large number of users and files? I don't want to know about the usage of API. I want to know the best approach for file organization.
