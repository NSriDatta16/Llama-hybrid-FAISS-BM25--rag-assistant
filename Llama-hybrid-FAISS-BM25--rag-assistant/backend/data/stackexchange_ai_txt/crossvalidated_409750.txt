What is the encoding in variational autoencoders?

The question is actually less broad than it sounds. I generally do understand how variational autoencoders work. From the encoding step we get four parts: mean $\mu$ standard deviation $\sigma$ random value from normal distribution $\epsilon$ sample $z$ For the training process of the autoencoder, the decoder is fed with the sample $z$ . If we wish to generate new samples, we manipulate the code that is fed to the decoder. What output from the encoder to use for a pure encoding purpose (given a fully trained VAE)? Please provide explanations and if possible a mathematical intuition / reasoning. If you have additional sources where this aspect is explained, please add links. I'm deliberately and specifically using VAEs, that is not the question here.
