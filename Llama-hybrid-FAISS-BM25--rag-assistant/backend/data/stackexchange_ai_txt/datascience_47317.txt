Big data online class

Being an IT engineer, I am exploring the Big Data specialization and wishing to earn a certificate in that field to help me get a new job later. I've been looking around and found these two specializations: Data Science Specialization from John Hopkins University Big Data Specialization from UC San Diego I was hoping someone with experience in the field to advise on which to pick as it will be a big investment in time (months) and effort. Any other suggestion out of the list is welcome. Thank you! PS: Let me know if I'm posting in the wrong section as this is a really genuine question!
