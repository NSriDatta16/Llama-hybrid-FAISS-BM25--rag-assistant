SQL: Datatype choice for values -1, 0 and 1

Consider a table whose job is to store a rating of an object. The column of interest here is the one called RATING . The valid range of values to store is: 1 0 -1 The first thought was to store as a tinyint smallint . This would store only one byte two bytes per row. Given the tinyint's range of 0 to 255 smallint's range of -32768 to 32767, would it be suitable here? Is there another datatype more suitable? The space taken is trivial for the expected size of the table & database. The user interface will be responsible for ensuring that those three values will be chosen by way of an enum. Question : can you suggest a smaller storage size or any clever setups to store one of these three values without sacrificing any ease-of-understanding? Other considerations: storage space isn't a terribly large concern this value will be summed to get a total rating this may be a case of micro-optimization SQL Server 2008
