The biggest problem I have hit is the lack of good canvas control which you may need if you really want to create nice UI. Banshee for example has a whole bunch of custom controls written by Aaron Bockover from scratch using Cairo. As flexible as this solution is, it requires a very deep knowledge of Gtk, Cairo and everything else involved. However, don't take my opinion as an discouragement. Gtk+ and by extension Gtk# is a terrific environment and it is very easy to quickly create very visually compelling GUIs with it.
