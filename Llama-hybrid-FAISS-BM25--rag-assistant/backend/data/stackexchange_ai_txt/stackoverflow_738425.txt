ReportViewer: Combine Multiple Reports into one report

I have a report that I need to run multiple times, with different data input each time. Each report has a page header that uniquely identifies it, the actual body of data, and then a footer that contains the page count in a [x of y pages] format. Obviously I could run each report separately, but I need the page numbers to be across all reports. So that if I'm running it two times, and the first time it has 3 pages, and the second time it has two pages, the footer shows [x of 5 pages] at the bottom of each report. I tried creating a master report and just embedding the report, but it doesn't show the page header then, I've also considered running them separately, and passing in a parameter to adjust the page number, but I would obviously need to render each report, find out the page total, then re-render each report to have the correct page total at the footer. Any suggestions? Anything I'm obviously missing?
