Dealing with missing values?

I have a data set that contains the prices of 1000 UPC items in 17 different supermarkets. The problem is that the same 1000 items are not in all 17 stores. On average, only 10 of the stores have a given item. I'm wondering how to approach this (note- I'm trying to estimate the pricing premium for each of the 17 supermarkets using regression.) I figure I can drop some items that are relatively rare, or impute missing values, or run an unbalanced design of some kind. What would you recommend and why?
