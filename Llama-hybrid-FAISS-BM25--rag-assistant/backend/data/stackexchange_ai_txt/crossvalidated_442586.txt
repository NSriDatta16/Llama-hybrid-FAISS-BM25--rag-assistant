Neural Networks and numeric variables

I want to predict condominium prices with a neural network. Some of my variables are numeric but are not assumed to relate to the price in form of a mathematical funktion (linear, square, ...). For example the floor or the number of flats in one building. You can not say, which floor is the best or that the more flats in one building, the lower the price in general. Should these variables be cut into categorical variables (Dummies, e.g.: 1-5 flats; 6-10 flats; 10-...)? Or will the network find a way to detect the differences in a numeric variable, even though the higher the value the higher is the product of the variable and its weights. I hope you can get my point, since in linear regression it is very important to cut those variables if they are not related in a linear way. Scrabyard
