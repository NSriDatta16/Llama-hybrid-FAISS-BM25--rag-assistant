Managing temporary files in a small .NET program

My question is about handling temporary files in a small .NET program. This program/utility just does the following with two URLs: Download each URL to a string (WebClient.DownloadString). Save each string to a temporary file. Call WinMerge (Process.Start) to diff the two files (in read-only mode for both files). I currently have the Simplest Thing That Could Possibly Work: save URL1 to windows/temp/leftFileToDiff.txt save URL2 to windows/temp/rightFileToDiff.txt. This works great - as WinMerge only needs to run in Read Only mode the files can be overwritten by running my program multiple times and nothing bad happens. However, I would now like to change the temporary file names to something meaningful (related to the URL) so that I can see which is which in the WinMerge view. I also want to clean these files up when they are no longer needed. What are my options for this? My next simplest idea is to have a specified folder where these are stored and just to zap this every time my program exits. Is there a better/more elegant/standard way? Thanks.
