Going from java to groovy isn't a lot of work. No where near what would be needed to move to a less Javaish language like clojure. I really like groovy for one-off apps and for scripting existing java code. I've used it to parse data from REST calls and feed the data to a JMS queue. I've used it to create scrambled test data for a partner from our production data. For stuff like that it is amazing. If the goal is to learn a dynamic language to add to the toolbox, Python and Ruby are both good choices. They run on the JVM and have native versions. Both are well supported on a large number of platforms. If the goal is to learn an alternative JVM language, groovy is an excellent choice. Both Scala and Clojure would also be good choices. I used to stick to the "learn a new language every year rule" from The Pragmatic Programmer, but that was before I had kids. Now I learn a new building toy every six months.
