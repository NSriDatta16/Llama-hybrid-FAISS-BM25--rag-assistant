You need to know more than average, median, and standard deviation to have a probability distribution of the scores, and you need that distribution to figure out how many students did better. If you assume a probability distribution (or know the distribution because the teacher graded on that curve), the number of students that did better would be (cdf(maximum possible score) - cdf(student's score)) * number of students , where cdf is the cumulative disribution function for that distribution.
