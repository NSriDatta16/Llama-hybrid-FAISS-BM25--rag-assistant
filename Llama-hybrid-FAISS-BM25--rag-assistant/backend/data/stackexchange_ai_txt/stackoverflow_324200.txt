What advice can you give me for writing a meaningful benchmark?

I have developed a framework that is used by several teams in our organisation. Those "modules", developed on top of this framework, can behave quite differently but they are all pretty resources consuming even though some are more than others. They all receive data in input, analyse and/or transform it, and send it further. We planned to buy new hardware and my boss asked me to define and implement a benchmark based on the modules in order to compare the different offers we have got. My idea is to simply start sequentially each module with a well chosen bunch of data as input. Do you have any advice? Any remarks on this simple procedure?
