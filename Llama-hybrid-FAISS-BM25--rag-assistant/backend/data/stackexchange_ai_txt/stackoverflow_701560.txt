SQL Server 2005: How to automatically include database name and brackets in queries

Good day, In SQL Server 2005, when I write a new query, I like to drap and drop table and column names from the object explorer. However, when I drag and drop a table, is there a way to automatically include the database name? (example: when I drag and drop the table Table1 in the query designer, I would like to have Database1.dbo.Table1 instead of just Table1) Also, is there a way to automatically include '[' and ']' around the column and table names? Thank you!
