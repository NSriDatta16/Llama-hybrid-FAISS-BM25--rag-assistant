Prevent Directory browsing and file retrieval without querystring token

I've got a paid download package that I want to host on a deep folder of one of my webservers. I've turned off directory browsing in .htaccess with the Options -Indexes But I'd also like to further lock down these valuable files by requiring a token be present on the Querystring before the server would let them go. Is this possible? Is their a better approach that is free and does not require passwords?
