If you are using ClearCase, make sure you use the UCM that comes with it and Composite Components. It makes all of your branching/merging effortless. I am talking about major re-org branches that run for 6 months involving tens of thousands of changes include directory renaming, file renaming, etc that automatically resolve 99.9% of the deltas. Also, we only use SnapShot views, not dynamic views. Our snapshot views load faster than you can drag and drop (Windows) the same source tree from a network drive. The only gripe I have about UCM is that history cannot span components. If you split up a component into multiple new components, each new component starts at /main/0.
