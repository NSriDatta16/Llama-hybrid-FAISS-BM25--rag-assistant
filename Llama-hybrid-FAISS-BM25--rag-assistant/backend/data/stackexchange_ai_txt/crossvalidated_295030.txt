How to include seasonality in GLM(Genralized Linear Modeling) for time series forecasting?

The below count is a monthly count of policies sold, it is seasonal in nature glmUsPolicyCount I am able to write the below code to forecast. How can I specify seasonality in the above model and use it for forecasting? Should I create dummy variables to indicate seasonality and use them as regressors?? glmPredUsPolicyCount I am not authorized to share data Any help will be appreciated!
