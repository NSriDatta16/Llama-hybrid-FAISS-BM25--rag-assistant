JVM, JBoss, and MySQL should be enough. In fact, it is more than enough ;-) If you want to use Enterprise JavaBeans, then JBoss, or a similar JavaEE Application server is necessary. However if you want to develop Java Web applications that do not need EJB, you can install a lighter weight Java server, commonly known as a Servlet Container. A popular and easy to use Servlet Container is Apache Tomcat.
