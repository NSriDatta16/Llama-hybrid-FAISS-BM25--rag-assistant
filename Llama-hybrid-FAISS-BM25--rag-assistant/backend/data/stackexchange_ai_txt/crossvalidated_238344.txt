How to pass labeled features to NN

I want to create some model of human behavior. Basically - it's expected to answer for question if some particular user will agree or not agree for some action. Feature list for it is: user_id interacting_user_id some_normalized_value some_enumerated_value .... Supposing usage of NN, how to standardize user_id and interacting_user_id? This model is supposed to be used in system when number of possible values for user_id and interacting_user_id will be increasing over the time, to possibly quite big numbers. Is there any better option than creating separate pair of input layer neurons for each user? Reason for putting user ids into features: Let's suppose, that this is about trading service and we want to predict probability of doing business for some pair of users under certain conditions (date, price, .....). I have not many information about particular user, so it would be hard to get some features like age, sex, or others, especially when it's hard to determine how relevant they are to the result. I suspect, that there is big variance between different users. I suspect there are some social interactions between users, so some specific pairs of users can produce significantly different results than average due to their specific relationship. Most important - I want to combine somehow knowledge about population behavior with knowledge about specific user's behavior. So for example - if there is no knowledge about specific user model will predict using population knowledge, as soon as some behavior history will be recorded it'll start to use more user specific data.
