Random Forest for predicting dummie variable

I am using a Random Forest model for predicting a target variable wich is basincally 1 and 0 (I have created a dummie variable from a categorical variable). But after running the model I get a predicted variable wich is not only 1 and 0 (as expected) but some values in between (0.something). How can I restrict the predicted value to only 1 and 0? Thanks!!
