This seems really really really low. What am I missing here? Quantities such as the AIC, which involve the use of the log-likelihood, are only meaningful relative to other such quantities . Remember that the likelihood function is defined only up to a scaling constant, so it can be scaled up or down at will. Consequently, the log-likelihood is only defined up to a location constant, and it can be shifted up or down at will. This holds also for the AIC, since this quantity is just the log-likelihood, shifted by a penalty on the number of parameters. That is the reason that it is said that AIC should only be used to compare models. In computer routines the likelihood function is generally defined directly from the sampling density without removing unnecessary constants, so in this case the scaling issue may not be a factor. In the R Bloggers post you link to, there were $n=800$ data point used in the logistic regression. The log-likelihood from the numbers you give is: $$\hat{\ell} = (727.9-2 \times 8)/(-2) = -355.95.$$ Thus, the average log-likelihood per data point is $\hat{\ell}/n = -0.4449375$ , which corresponds to a likelihood value of $0.6408643$ for a single data point. This is not particularly low, and ought not be cause for any alarm.
