I will have a folder for all javascript, and a sub folder of that for 3rd party/shared libraries, and sub folders for each component of the site to keep everything organized. For example: / +--/javascript/ +-- lib/ +-- admin/ +-- compnent1/ +-- compnent2/ Then run everything through a minifier/obfuscator during the build process.
