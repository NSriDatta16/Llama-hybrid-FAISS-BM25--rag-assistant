Well one way of approaching this is to convert the image file into binary format and save the binary into a database. I have used php to convert the images into blob format and store these blobs on a mysql database. When the files are in the database you can use php scripts to convert the blob back into the mime type like jpeg or gif and display then on the webpage. So your files are then centrally stored on a database, you can place the scripts which convert the blobs into images on any number of servers. I have never found any open source software to use this method of storage but it is fairly straight forward to create the scripts.
