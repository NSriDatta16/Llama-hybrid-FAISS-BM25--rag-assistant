What is the difference between these two Breusch-Pagan Tests?

Using R on some data and trying to see whether or not my data is heteroscedastic, I've found two implementations of the Breusch-Pagan test, bptest (package lmtest) and ncvTest (package car). However, these produce different results. What is the difference between the two? When should you choose to use one or the other? > model bp bp studentized Breusch-Pagan test data: model BP = 3.3596, df = 1, p-value = 0.06681 > ncvTest(model) Non-constant Variance Score Test Variance formula: ~ fitted.values Chisquare = 3.858704 Df = 1 p = 0.04948855 These example shows that according to the tests, my data is in one case heteroscedastic and in the other case homoscedastic. I did find this question here so bptest might be studentized and ncvTest might not be, however, what does this mean then?
