In my opinion, FFT wouldn't be an appropriate approach for analyzing the asynchronous, irregular data you've described since FFT is intended to capture sinusoidal-like regularities. There is an approach that might work and for which R modules are available. Translation into Python would be entirely possible. I'm referring to Andreas Brandmaier's Permutation Distribution Clustering (PDC). Brandmaier describes his method as follows: Permutation Distribution Clustering is a clustering method for time series. Dissimilarity of time series is formalized as the divergence between their permutation distributions. The permutation distribution was proposed as measure of the complexity of a time series. Here's a link describing the R modules: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pdc/pdc.pdf The CRAN modules are here: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pdc/index.html
