If you target the Adobe AIR runtime, you can leverage the NativeProcess API that was introduced in AIR 2.0. This API allows you to spawn external processes and communicate with them via stdin and stdout. If you're feeling adventurous and want to do something undocumented and completely unsupported, you can tap into the LocalConnection internals by interacting with the memory mapped file of the Flash Player. There's more detail on the osflash.org/localconnection site. This approach has some limitations and isn't supported. I don't recommend it. As mentioned in some other answers, you can also use a socket connection to send/receive data.
