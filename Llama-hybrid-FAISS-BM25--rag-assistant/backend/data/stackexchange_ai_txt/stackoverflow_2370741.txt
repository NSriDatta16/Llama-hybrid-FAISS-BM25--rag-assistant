At the university we read the book "Concrete Mathematics" by Knuth, Graham and Patashnik. This is a math book with topics selected for computer science students. Several year later, I checked the book again and noticed that I've used every single topic in the book at least once (with the exception of Stirling numbers). In most cases knowing some math helps to solve problems with less work, more elegant or to implement faster solutions. It also depends on the kind of work you are doing. I.e. math is more important when you concentrate on algorithms, than when you concentrate on engineering problems.
