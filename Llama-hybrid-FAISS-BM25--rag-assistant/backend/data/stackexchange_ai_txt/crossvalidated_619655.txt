How do I select a KNN model?

I am considering methods of selecting an optimal K Nearest Neighbors model for classifying a pixel as representing a refugee's blue tarp or not. See https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/billbasener/pixel-values-from-images-over-haiti . The data set has 63,241 observations. I have normalized intensities of red, green, and blue to between 0 and 1, performed 10-fold cross validation, and determined maximum average F1 measure as a metric to optimize. Should I consider 100 values of K linearly spaced between 1 and 63,241 inclusive? Should I consider 100 values of K between 1 and 100 inclusive? If I wish to perform bidirectional selection by transforming the training observations for the KNN model, would I simply begin the previous process again?
