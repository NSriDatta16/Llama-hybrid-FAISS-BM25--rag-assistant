If I am getting you right, you are trying to predict the absolute price, and not just the change in price from the last time step. This task is much more difficult than just predicting the change in price from the previous time step, as the net accurately needs to memorize what the price in the previous time steps were. I suggest you calculate the log returns from each time step to the next and input these values into the RNN. The log return at time step t is equal to log(price(t)/price(t-1)) . The log is a small addition, which can help as log returns are additive (they still reflect the price change after adding log returns of different time steps together). Then your model could predict a change in price from the most recent time step. This is one way of doing this, but remember that predicting prices is not a trivial task and "good results" are very hard to achive.
