Ajax data to be collected in tooltip

How should I proceed in achieving the following: I need to get the data from another server which is a jsp page it has the data related to the information i want to show in tooltip. The code for this is working and I can make ajax call to get the response. The concern is that I want the contents of qtip library to fit in the page since the page doesn't allow cross domain contents. If I will try to just reference the contents of qtip saved on my website(the domain is different from the page which I am using) it wont allow to do this. so is it fine embedding the contents in the main form or there is some other optimal way?
