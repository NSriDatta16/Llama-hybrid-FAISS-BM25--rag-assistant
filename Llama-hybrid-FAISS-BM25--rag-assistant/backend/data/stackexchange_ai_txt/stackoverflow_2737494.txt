I wouldn't worry about patent/license issues between JPEG and PNG. The only choice you need to make is this: Is file size more important than image quality? If small file size is important, PNG won't be a good solution. Lossless compression on most images is way less efficient than JPEG compression. With JPEG you can pick the quality level you want, trading off image quality. With PNG, you have no lossy compression, so the file size is what it is. And don't forget that file size is important for upload and download times, as well as the cost of storage.
