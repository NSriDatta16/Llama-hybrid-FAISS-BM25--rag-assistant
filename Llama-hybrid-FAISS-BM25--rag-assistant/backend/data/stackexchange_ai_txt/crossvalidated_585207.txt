Training data is left skewed, however the resulting predictions are normally distributed

I am training a random forest regression model in R using 3 years of historical data. This is the histogram of the left skewed y data: When I use the model to predict on new data the results are normally distributed, this is the histogram of the normally distributed forecasted Å· data: Is this a normal operation of the random forest algorithm? A problem with my implementation?
