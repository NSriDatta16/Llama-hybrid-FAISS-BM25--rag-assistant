If you need to call bubble sort, why won't ordena(alunos, tam); work? ( Hint : where is the contiguous memory where you store an entire sequence of records?) (Hint #2: does it make sense to try to sort before you have read in all the records?) By the way, I urge you most strongly to indent your code to make it readable . Not only will you get a better grade, but it will make it easier to help you. I'm pretty confident that the call I suggest won't work, but because almost all your code is in the left margin, I'm not sure. You also might want to ask what are the different tasks here (read one record, read all records, sort all records, print records from a single colleage) and see if you can't find a way to organize your code such that you are using one of the available language constructs to separate one task from another. (I'm being deliberately cryptic because I don't know what you've yet to study. You should definitely ask your instructor or teaching assistant about this question.) I think you also might wish to consider whether your bubble sort is doing the right thing. I suggest you "play computer" by executing your code by hand on an example where tam == 3 .
