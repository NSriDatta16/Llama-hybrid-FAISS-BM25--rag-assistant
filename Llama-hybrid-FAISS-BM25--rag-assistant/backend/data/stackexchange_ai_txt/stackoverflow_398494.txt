What I try to do is separate the config settings that will be different for deployments to different environments into separate files, organized by logical functions, and then NOT include these files in the deployment scripts... If you're coding in .Net, then settings that are in common across multiple apps can be stored in machine.config... again, don't put them directly in machine.config, but create a reference to a separate file (using a custom defined configSection and configSource="" attribute, to create an indirect reference to that separate file...
