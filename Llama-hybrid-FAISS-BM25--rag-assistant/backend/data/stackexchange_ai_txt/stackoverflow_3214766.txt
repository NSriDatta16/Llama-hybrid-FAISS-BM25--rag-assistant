Function calls carry a performance cost for stack based languages, like Fortran. They have to add on to the stack and such. Because of this, most compilers will try to inline function calls aggressively, if it is possible. Most of the time the compiler will make the right choice on whether or not to inline certain functions in your program. This automatic inlining process will mean that there is no extra cost for writing your function (at all). This means that you should write your code as cleanly and organized as possible, and it is likely that the compiler will do these optimizations for you. It is more important that your overall strategy for solving the problem is the most efficient than worry about performance of function calls.
