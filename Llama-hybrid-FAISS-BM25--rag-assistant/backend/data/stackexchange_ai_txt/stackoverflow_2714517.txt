Getting "A valid signing identity matching this profile could not be found in your keychain" warning

I hope to test my app on iPod Touch I created development provisioning profile. I dragged downloaded .mobileprovision file to Organizer There is a yellow triangle warned that "A valid signing identity matching this profile could not be found in your keychain" The others distribution provisioning profiles have no any problem. I checked my connected iPod Touch. Organizer also said that: OS Installed on "interdev"'s iPod 3.1.3 (7E18) Xcode Supported iPhone OS Versions 3.1.1 (7C146) 3.1.1 (7C145) 3.1 (7C144) 3.0.1 (7A400) 3.0 2.2.1 2.2 2.1.1 2.1 2.0.2 (5C1) 2.0.1 (5B108) 2.0 (5A347) 2.0 (5A345) iOS 3.1.3 Xcode 3.1 Do I need to upgrade Xcode?
