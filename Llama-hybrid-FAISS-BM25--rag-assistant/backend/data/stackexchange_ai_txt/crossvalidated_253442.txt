Conditional vs. Exact Maximum Likelihood Estimation

I am reading through the Hamilton book on Time Series Analysis. There are numerous references to estimation of models using both exact log-likelihood estimation and conditional estimation. From what I've gathered so far exact likelihood estimation has to be done with any number of numerical optimization techniques. However, the log of the conditional likelihood function can be estimated via OLS on a constant and $p$ of its own lagged values. It seems to me that the conditional log likelihood estimation is computationally easier than the optimization method, and it only requires $t - p$ values of $y$ instead of $t$. However, since the exact likelihood is well...exact I would think it would be the preferred method, especially considering how fast optimization algorithms are on a modern computer. Which should I prefer when implementing MLE for a time series model? The book doesn't exactly make this clear. It does however specify that the exact and conditional method of estimation have the same large-sample distribution making this question more interesting.
