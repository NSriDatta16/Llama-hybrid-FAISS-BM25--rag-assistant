Storing my ObJ-C class online. (amazon web services?)

Okay this is a fairly broad question. This is my first App and I'm not sure the best way to go about this. The app is on the IPHONE. I have a 'Restaurant' class. The restaurant has many different attributes and opening times. I currently store a restaurant in an instance of nsdata (it complies to NSCoding) LOcal storage is easy and I just use nsdata. I have just built in an import/export function. I want these two methods to "post" a restaurant to the web and "get" a restaurant from the web. I know I can do this with NSUrlConnection and I have it up and working. However I want to be cleverer about it. For instance what if I want to take my online list of restaurants that have been submitted and build a web interface that can also interact with the data? This is what I am thinking so far: Create a 'toString' method that will convert my class into a textual representation. Then store the string on a server. This will replace storing nsdata online. Does this sound appropriate? However, I want to be able to query the amount of restaurants and have a bit more control over my online 'database'. Is XML the answer? I was about the start looking into Amazon Web Services and learn either Json or Rest. Any bits of advice? Thanks Dan
