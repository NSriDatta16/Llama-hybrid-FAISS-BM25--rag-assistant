Access 2007 Linked table Performance

I have an Access 2007 application (previously in Access 2003) that is running into some performance issues when the linked database tables are on a network drive. In 2003 the application worked perfectly fine. Now in 2007 the speed of data retrieval using sql and a recordset is degraded pretty poorly. The exact area that i am encountering the issue is on: DIM rs AS NEW ADODB.RECORDSET rs.Open tsSql, CurrentProject.AccessConnection, iKeyset, iLock The iKeyset is set to 0 and iLock is set to 3 the rs.Open command is taking from 4 - 5 seconds which is an issue due to the fact that on some of my forms this can happen multiple times on load. any thoughts? EDIT: not to mention that I believe that opening and saving forms in design view appears to be slower than normal under these circumstances.
