Well, I solved this problem. In SelectedIndexChanging event of GridView I loop through custom colored cells, remove CSS class definition and restore it after next row is selected. It's somewhat brute-force programming and, honestly, it looks ridiculous to me, but it works. Here is the code: protected void GridView1_SelectedIndexChanging(object sender, GridViewSelectEventArgs e) { int i = 0; for (i = 4; i LO_Index keeps index of currently selected row, I used it for other purposes in code and here it just came handy. Anyway, if you know more elegant solution I would be glad to try it.
