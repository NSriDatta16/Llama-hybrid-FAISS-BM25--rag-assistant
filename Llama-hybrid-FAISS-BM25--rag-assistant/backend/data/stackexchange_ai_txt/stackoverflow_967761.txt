Apart from the component (which comes as a bit of a surprise to me), you could use a tag with the escape parameter set to false to generate any mark-up you want. For example: Bear in mind it's a little less elegant than the panelGroup solution, as you have to generate this for both the start and end tags if you want to wrap any of your JSF code with the div tag. Alternatively, all the major UI Frameworks have a div component tag, or you could write your own.
