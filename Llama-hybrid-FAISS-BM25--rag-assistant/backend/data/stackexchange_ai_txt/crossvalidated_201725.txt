Face authentication system using Convolution Neural Network (CNN)

I'm working on developing an face authentication system using Convolution Neural Network (CNN). I know that the CNN can be used to classify two classes. However, my problem is how can I train the CNN as the training set in the face authentication system should be only for the clients users?. In other words, how can I train my CNN using only one type of data? My dataset consists of 106 persons, each one has 50 images. Is there any idea on how can I divided my dataset to be suitable for the face authentication system? your help in this regard is highly appreciated.
