Comparing logistic regressions

What is an appropriate way to test whether two logistic regressions are significantly different from one another? Essentially, I have two similar logistic regressions made from two different sets of data, and one made from the two data sets combined. I'd like to be able to perform further analyses on the whole data set using the regression made from combining the data sets, but first I have to be sure that the relationship is not significantly different from either of the two original regressions. I'd also like to know if the two separate original regressions are different from one another. Is there a straightforward way to do this? Thanks!!
