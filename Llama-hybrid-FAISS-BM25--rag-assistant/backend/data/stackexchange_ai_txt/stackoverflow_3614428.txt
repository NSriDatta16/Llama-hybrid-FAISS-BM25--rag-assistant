Keep them in 3 separate tables and do a UNION ALL in a view if you need to merge the data into one resultset for consumption. How you store the data on disk need not be identical to how you need to consume the data so long as the performance is adequate. As you have it now there are no columns that do not apply for any of the presented entities. If you were to merge the 3 tables into one you'd have to add a field at the very least to know which columns to expect to be populated and reduce your performance. Now when you query for a holiday alone you go to a subset of the data that you would have to sift through / index to get at the same data in a merged storage table. If you did not already have these tables defined you could consider creating one table with the following signature... create table EventBase ( Id int PRIMARY KEY, Date date, Name varchar(50) ) ...and, say, the holiday table with the following signature. create table holiday ( Id int PRIMARY KEY, EventId int, Location varchar(50), CalendarId int ) ...and join the two when you needed to do so. Choosing between this and the 3 separate tables you already have depends on how you plan on using the tables and volume but I would definitely not throw all into a single table as is and make things less clear to someone looking at the table definition with no other initiation.
