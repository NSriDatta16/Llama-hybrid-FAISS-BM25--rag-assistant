How do I interpret the results from a basic interaction plot from the R effects package?

Using the method in this post , I have made a plot to visualize the interaction between two predictor variables using the effects package in r , but I'm not really sure what I am looking at. Tide heights and rain averages are continuous. 8 bins were the maximum the function would allow me to use. The following is the call to effect producing this plot: R > plot(effect(term="rain.avg2:tide.avg",mod=bkrain9.lm,default.levels=8), main="", xlab="Precipitation - 24hr average (cm)", ylab=expression("TCB Concentration - CFU*100m"*L^-1),multiline=TRUE) Plot updated. Could somebody explain the purpose of this plotting feature in context to predictor interactions? Background: For a class project, I have created a linear regression model to evaluate the effects of the interaction between two predictor variables (tide height and precipitation) on bacteria concentrations. Thermo-tolerant coliform bacteria concentrations were sampled at 5 sites in a day, where a sample time was recorded at sampling completion. I took an average of these for roughly 20 days, and calculated an associated 24hr average of precipitation before sampling completion, and a 50 minute (the sampling duration) average of tide height before sampling completion.
