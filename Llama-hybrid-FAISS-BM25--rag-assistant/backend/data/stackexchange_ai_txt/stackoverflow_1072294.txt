So, write your own, at least for these stored procedures. Are there so many of them? It's way to late for me to try this, but you can: take one of your stored procedures. Create a new typed DataSet in Visual Studio. Drag this SP from Server Explorer onto the design surface. See whether the parameters collection is correctly updated. I'm not suggesting this as your ORM technology, only as an experiment to see whether table-valued parameters are supported by this designer (and, presumably by the designer for SqlCommand , SqlDataAdapter , etc). If it works, then it gives you at least a bad way of quickly generating the code you'd need in an ORM: copy the code from the dataset.designer.cs file into your own code. It's then possible, if you really need to know, to figure out what the DataSet Designer is using to pick up the parameters - you could then use it yourself, in your own code generation.
