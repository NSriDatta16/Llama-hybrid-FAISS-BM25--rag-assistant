How to Convert a Metafile to Image by Drag'n'Droping in a Winform

I develop a Winform Application with the framlework .NET 3.5 in C#. I would like to allow the user to drag&drop a picture from Word 2007. Basically the user open the docx, select a picture and drag&drop them to my PictureBox. I've already done the same process with picture files from my desktop and from Internet pages but I can't go through my problem with my Metafile. I've done few researches but I didn't find any solutions solving my issue. Here is what I've done on my Drag&Drop event : private void PictureBox_DragDrop(object sender, DragEventArgs e) { if (e.Data.GetDataPresent(DataFormats.MetafilePict)){ Image image = new Metafile((Stream)e.Data.GetData(DataFormats.MetafilePict)); } } I can obtain a stream with this code : (Stream)e.Data.GetData(DataFormats.MetafilePict) but I don't know how to convert it into a Metafile or better an Image object. If you have any idea or solution, I'll be glad to read it. Thanks,
