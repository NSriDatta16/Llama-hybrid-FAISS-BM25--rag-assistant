If you're just looking to persist a value between instantiations of your BroadcastReceiver, store the result in a private Preferences object. You can read the stored value in at the beginning of each onReceive() , and the write it back out at the end. Something like: public static final String PREFS_NAME = "com.examples.myapplication.PREFS"; public static final String KEY_COUNT = "notificationCount"; private int currentCount; public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) { SharedPreferences values = context.getSharedPreferences(PREFS_NAME, Activity.MODE_PRIVATE); currentCount = values.getInt(KEY_COUNT, 0); //Sets to zero if not in prefs yet //Do your magic work here //Write the value back to storage for later use SharedPreferences.Editor editor = values.edit(); editor.put(KEY_COUNT,currentCount); editor.commit(); } You could also write to the global standard preferences with PreferenceManager.getDefaultSharedPreferences(context) instead, which wouldn't require you to define a name.
