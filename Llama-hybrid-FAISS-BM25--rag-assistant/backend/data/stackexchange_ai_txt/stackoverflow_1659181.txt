Looking at the documentation for dbus_connection_close() , the only thing that may be invoked is the dispatch status function to indicate that the connection has been closed. So, ordering here is something you probably want to pay attention to .. i.e getting notified of a closed / dropped connection prior to things left in the message queue. Looking at the source of the function , it looks like the only thing its going to do is return if fail, i.e. invalid connection / NULL pointer. Otherwise, it (seems) to just hang up. This means yes, you probably should flush the message queue prior to hanging up. Disclaimer : I've only had to talk to dbus a few times, I'm not by any means an authority on it.
