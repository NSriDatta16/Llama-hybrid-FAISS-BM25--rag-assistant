You can work with random variables that take on values in the extended real numbers $\bar{\mathbb{R}} = \mathbb{R} \cup \{ -\infty, \infty \} $ . This set is just like the real numbers, except that there are two special elements for "negative infinity" and "positve infinity" that are defined using standard limiting behaviours for real numbers. It is not problematic to work with random variables that can taken on these values, and in some contexts (e.g., survivial analysis and the analysis of Markov chains) it is extremely useful. (For an example in survival analysis, see here ). In your case you have a random variable that is a positive integer, so you can work on the extended natural numbers $\bar{\mathbb{N}} = \mathbb{N} \cup \{ \infty \}$ . Your random variable will obey the standard laws of probability over that set, including the norming axiom and the countable additivity axiom. Using these axioms you have: $$1 = \mathbb{P}(\tau \in \bar{\mathbb{N}}) = \sum_{k \in \bar{\mathbb{N}}} \mathbb{P}(\tau = i) = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \mathbb{P}(\tau = k) + \mathbb{P}(\tau = \infty).$$ Re-arranging gives the common-sense rule: $$\mathbb{P}(\tau = \infty) = 1- \sum_{k=1}^\infty \mathbb{P}(\tau = k).$$ There are no measure-theoretic problems here. The set $\bar{\mathbb{N}}$ is countable (i.e., it is cardinally equivalent to the integers) so the underlying measure theory is the same as it would be for an integer random variable that can't take on infinite values.
