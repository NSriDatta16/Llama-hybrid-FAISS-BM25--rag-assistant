Normalizing logistic regression coefficients?

With my limited understanding of the logistic regression, I understand that the coefficients in logistic regression are the odds ratios. Does it make send to normalize them (divide each one over the overall sum)? I guess NO, can anyone explain why? in this case is there a way to relate the different predictors' coefficients to have a comparative understanding?
