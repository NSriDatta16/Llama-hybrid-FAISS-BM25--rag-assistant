Steps to upload an iPhone application to the AppStore in xcode4

as xcode 3 and xcode 4 is totally different. i'm a bit lost to submit app to app store. Do i still need to duplicate "Release" to create "iphoneDistrubition" configuration. Or can I straight away use Release? Is Archive in xcode4 = Build in xcode3 for the purpose of submission app. If Archive = Build, the icon of the app is very blur in xcode4 organizer. Is that normal? Is there any other additional steps to follow in xcode4 to submit app to appstore. Thanks for any help. =)
