Wix Directory Problems

I have two questions about the directories with using fragments in Windows Installer XML. I got this fragment file from the heat.exe: and I have this wix installer file: So far. Now when i generate this files to wixobj, the compiler shows errors because the files can't be found. The files are in a directory called "Test". And in the file it's named SourceDir. For a lil workaround i can copy the test directory and call it SourceDir ;-). So my Setup will be created. How can I do it without a second directory? EDIT: Problem is done . Now i install my package. But whatever i do, the files will be installed to C:\Test. But I want it to be installed in my Program Files Directory. In many examples i can do it, like in the file, but i have to know the guids. But we do wix for getting all files from one directory, without to put our hands on. So how to install the files into the program files directory?
