This boils down to a programming problem, specifically understanding how R handles a non-standardized response in the LHS of the formula when fitting a binary response. The proportional odds logistic regression (POLR) is a method for ordinal/polytomous response data, it models the cumulative probability of a response. However, the estimation method is far afield of standard GLMs. The text "Generalized Linear Models" from McCullogh and Nelder covers this in more detail. Essentially, your zeta is like an "intercept" term for each thresholded response, estimated with a common slope term in each case. The estimation is done with an EM algorithm. But then you fit the GLM. The binomial family of GLMs is not a ordinal/polytomous analysis. R has transformed the response to an analyzable form for you, and with no warning. When you call "factor(y)", R codes each level of Y to a numeric value and assigns a numeric value based on alphabetical order. When you fit a binary analysis, you expect positive cases to take a numeric value of 1, so any other case can take a value of 0. Your logistic regression is just giving you the probability of randomly sampling a value of Y taken at it's alphabetically-first ordinal level. It's rubbish and has no relation to the output from POLR.
