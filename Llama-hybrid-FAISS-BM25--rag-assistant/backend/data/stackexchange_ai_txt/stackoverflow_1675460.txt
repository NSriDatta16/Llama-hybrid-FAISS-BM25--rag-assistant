Catalyst is a MVC framework that you can use to make Restfull services It runs under apache2/mod_perl2 It is simple and elegant but IMHO not as much as most of the "new" MVC frameworks Yeah .. it is light. Dont think it is really flexible .. :( .. EDIT: - The "new" frameworks I said are the ones that have good test frameworks to use (like rails/spring/Seam, with catalyst it is not easy to do tests besides the normal unit tests) and also a lot of developers working to build applications to them (the community around these frameworks are far more active). That's why I dont think Catalyst is really flexible too.
