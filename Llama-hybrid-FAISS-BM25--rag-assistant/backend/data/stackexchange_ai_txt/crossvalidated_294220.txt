Answering my own question: $p_z(g^{-1}(x))$ is not a probability density function of $x$ because it doesn't integrate to 1. $p_z(g^{-1}(x))\lvert det(\frac{\partial(g^{-1}(x))}{\partial x})\rvert$ is the probability density function of $x$, and I think in the GAN paper, the $p_g(x)$ represents this expression.
