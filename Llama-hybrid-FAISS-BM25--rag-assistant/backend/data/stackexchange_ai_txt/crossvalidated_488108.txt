Out of curiosity, does the error arise when you use an alternative estimator? It could be that the estimator is for some reason getting stuck at a singularity. You may just try the following: mod.alt_est . Alternatively, you may need a Bayesian solution to help regularize the estimation and force it away from a singularity (try blme package if the allFit function doesn't produce an estimator that works).
