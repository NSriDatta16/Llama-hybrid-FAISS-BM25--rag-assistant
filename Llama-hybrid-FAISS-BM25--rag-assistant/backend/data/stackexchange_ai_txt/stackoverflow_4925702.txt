I think its a good idea if 1) the services you all from the controllers themselves invoke other services, and it is getting to be unmanageable. 2) you are struggling with a situation where you need to call two services at a high level but are having trouble making it work design-wise As kohlehydrat mentions, they are very useful with SOAs, but I disagree in that a Facade is a design pattern -- it isn't exclusive to anyone application style. If you use a facade, you end up with one, well organized high level service for your application (if you do it right).
