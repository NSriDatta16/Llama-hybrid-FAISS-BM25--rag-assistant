classification of bugs ownership by their content (improve score for log analysis)

I'm doing a little project in which given a dataset of bugs and their relevant owner, I'd like to predict the "final owner" of a non-analyzed bug (bugs tends to assign back and forth between different owners and I'm referring to the "real/final owner" as the final one based on the dataset). Number of classes/labels is 6 The data I use to make these decisions relays mostly on the bug's content which can be a subset of the following: Error logs Python tracebacks Panics Panics traces I'm also using SMOTETomek to balanced the dataset (it creates artificial training data) - this alone increased my results by 10-15%. However, I'm still getting a very low score (around 65%) when applying a set of classifiers (Each is being trained against the above mentioned data) Example for classifiers I've tried: SGDClassifier, MultinomialNB, BernoulliNB, LinearSVC, RandomForestClassifier, LogisticRegression, DecisionTreeClassifier, ExtraTreeClassifier, etc. My pipeline looks as follows: def train(self, algorithm, X_train, y_train): model = Pipeline([ ('vect', CountVectorizer()), ('tfidf', TfidfTransformer()), ('smote', SMOTETomek()), ('classifier', algorithm) ]) model.fit(X_train, y_train) return model where each algorithm in the pipeline is one of the above mentioned classifiers (it's being run in a loop for each one) Initially I thought that the root cause for this fairly low score is the way I'm sanitize the data. For example: For errors, I'm relaying on regex to clean timestamps, thread ID, etc. For python tracebacks I'm getting rid of line numbers and taking just func names Later on I was surprised to find out that even without cleaning the data, I'm getting the same score, so it made me think I'm missing something My features are simply text I cleaned from the logs and (each feature is just a long string) and the labels are (each) simply a number that correlates to a class. How can it be that no matter what I do (cleaning the logs vs leave it untouched) faces me with the same score? Am I using the wrong steps in the pipeline? missing steps? Any help will be appreciated as I've no clue where/how to proceed.
