I think the most important thing here is to develop an intuition about statistics and some general statistical concepts. Perhaps the best way to do this is to have some domain that you can "own." This can provide a positive feedback loop where understanding about the domain helps you to understand more about the underlying statistics, which helps you to understand more about the domain, etc. For me that domain was baseball stats. I understood that a batter that goes 3 for 4 in a game is not a "true" .750 hitter. This helps to understand the more general point that the sample data is not the same as the underlying distribution. I also know he is probably closer to an average player than to a .750 hitter, so this helps to understand concepts like regression to the mean. From there I can get to full-blown Bayesian inference where my prior probability distribution had a mean of that of the mean baseball player, and I now have 4 new samples with which to update my posterior distribution. I don't know what that domain is for you, but I would guess it would be more helpful than a mere textbook. Examples help to understand the theory, which helps to understand the examples. A textbook with examples is nice, but unless you can make those examples "yours" then I wonder if you will get enough from them.
