The mean and standard deviation are population properties. As you increase your number of observations you will on average get more precise estimates from your sample for both the population mean and standard deviation. It sounds like you are confusing the standard error of the mean with the standard deviation. The standard error of the mean is the standard deviation of your estimate of the mean. The standard error of the mean (i.e., the precision of your estimate of the mean) does get smaller as sample size increases. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_error#Standard_error_of_the_mean
