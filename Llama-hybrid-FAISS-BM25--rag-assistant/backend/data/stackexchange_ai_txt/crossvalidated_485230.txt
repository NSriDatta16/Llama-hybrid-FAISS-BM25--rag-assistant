Dealing with highly "unbalanced" regression problems

I am currently working on a model that estimates hurricane intensities based on satellite images. Naturally, the target variable is highly skewed, i.e. while the mean is around 70-80, a few values can go up to 180. Of course, an accurate estimation is arguably more important for these extreme values, as the potential damage is roughly squared with wind speeds. I am wondering whether the following approaches are valid: On the training set, randomly draw samples with replacement, where the probability for each sample is inverse to the probability of this label in the whole dataset or Setting the sample_weight to this inverse value when training the neural network Simply do not bother with balancing the targets Implement a custom loss that e.g. multiplies the ground truth with the squared error, leading to a much higher weight of these observations. This would be somewhat similar to 2. I am pretty sure that for the validation and test set no modifications should be taken. Any ideas here?
