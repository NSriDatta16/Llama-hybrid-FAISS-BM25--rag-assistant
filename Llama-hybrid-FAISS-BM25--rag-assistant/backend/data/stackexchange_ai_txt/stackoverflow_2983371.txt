As already said, it is not the language here to make the difference; assembly could be cool or fast for computations, but when the processor have to "speak" to peripherals, the limit is given by these. In this case the speed is given by your hard disk speed, and this is a limit you hardly can change wiithout changing your hd and waiting for better hd in future, but also by the way data are organized on the disk, i.e. by the filesystem. AFAIK, most used filesystems are not optimized to handle fastly tons of "small" files, rather they are optimized to hold "few" huge files. So, changing the filesystem you're using could increase your copy speed, as far as it is more suitable to your case (and of course hd limits still apply!). If you want to "taste" the real limit of you hd, you should try a copy "sector by sector", replycating the exact image of your source hd to the dest hd. (But this option has some points to be aware of)
