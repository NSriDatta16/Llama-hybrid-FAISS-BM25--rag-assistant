DataTable filter expression with DateTime and less-or-equal operator problem

I have the following code: DataTable t = new DataTable(); t.Locale = CultureInfo.InvariantCulture; t.Columns.Add("Date", typeof(DateTime)); DateTime today = DateTime.Now; DateTime yesterday = today.AddDays(-1); DateTime tomorow = today.AddDays(1); t.Rows.Add(yesterday); t.Rows.Add(today); t.Rows.Add(tomorow); string filter = string.Format(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture, "Date >= #{0}# AND Date I'm expecting that the filtered t.DefaultView now contains all three "days". But for some reason the last date from the range isn't included. It seems operator for DateTime type works like a . Where is the problem? Is that a bug? Any suggestions how to overcome that? Update. Got some responses about DateTime type and comparison operators. Thanks. But now I want to direct attention to filter expression . Ok, say I have the folloving loop: foreach (DataRow r in t.Rows) { DateTime date = (DateTime)r["Date"]; if (yesterday This loop should show the same result like foreach (DataRowView v in t.DefaultView) Console.WriteLine(v["date"]); from the previous example, yes? No! Here works as I'm expecting and the result is all three days. Why? Update #2: solution. As Joe has noted - the problem is about fractions of a second. If I format upper and lower bounds with Round-trip date/time pattern (to preserve fractions of a second) - everything works just fine: string filter = string.Format(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture, "Date >= '{0}' AND Date
