Is this enough information to fully define a neural network?

Background: A recent paper describes using machine learning to predict the outcome of chemical reactions. In the supplementary information (see pages S77-S78), the neural network used is described. I would like to try implementing this network as a first project for learning neural networks and TensorFlow. However, I don't know enough to tell whether the description in the supplementary information is complete. Question: Does the supplementary information (see pages S77-S78 only) provide enough information to implement the network? Or did the author leave a lot out (perhaps on purpose)? Description of the data for non-chemists: The paper considers one specific type of chemical reaction. For this reaction, you have to combine five types of species: molecule 1, molecule 2, a catalyst, a base, and a solvent to dissolve everything. For each species, there are multiple options. You could use a water-based or an alcohol-based solvent, for example. There are thousands of possible combinations for this chemical reaction. We have data that pairs each combination with the reaction yield, a number between 0 and 1. We have a bunch of vectors, basically, and we want to predict the yields of new combinations.
