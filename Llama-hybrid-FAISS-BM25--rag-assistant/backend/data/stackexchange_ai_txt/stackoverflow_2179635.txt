Your application is useful as a tool to convey this information, and you should definitely include it if users are clamoring for more visibility and transparency into the data it collects. A user's response to the information, however, will largely depend on what the organizational culture already does with it. For example, does management aggressively encourage users to keep calls short and deal with as many customers as possible, and fire those who don't meet quotas? If so, that's going to provoke an equally strong reaction from users to keep their calls short when they discover they've been a bit on the longer side. ("Uh-oh, I'm getting to the 2-minute mark. I'd better hang up and fake a disconnection to avoid getting my average call length too high.") Conversely, if management simply encourages everyone to do a good job and provide excellent customer service, this information can be synthesized by users in the overall context of this work. ("I've spent a lot of time on this customer -- I should see if I can wrap things up shortly, or escalate him if I can't fix this problem.")
