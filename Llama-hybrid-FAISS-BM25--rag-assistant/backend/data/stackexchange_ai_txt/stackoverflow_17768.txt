"... Let's Build a Compiler ..." I'd second http://compilers.iecc.com/crenshaw/ by @sasb . Forget buying more books for the moment. Why? Tools & language. The language required is Pascal and if I remember correctly is based on Turbo-Pascal. It just so happens if you go to http://www.freepascal.org/ and download the Pascal compiler all the examples work straight from the page ~ http://www.freepascal.org/download.var The beaut thing about Free Pascal is you can use it almost whatever processor or OS you can care for. Once you have mastered the lessons then try the more advanced " Dragon Book " ~ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_book
