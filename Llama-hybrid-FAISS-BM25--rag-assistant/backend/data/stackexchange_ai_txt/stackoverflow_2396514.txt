A process is only a component of a methodology. A methodology has: A process aspect: what tasks are to be carried out? A product aspect: what things are to be used and/or created? A people aspect: what people and teams are going to do all this? A time aspect: how does all this get organised in time? A modelling aspect: what modelling units (language) are used to capture all this? This is a simplified interpretation of the more formal definitions that you can find in ISO/IEC 24744 Software Engineering - Metamodel for Development Methodologies . Still, the terms "method", "methodology" and "process" are used by different people with different meanings. After 20 years working in this field, I think that trying to agree on a standard use is futile. :-)
