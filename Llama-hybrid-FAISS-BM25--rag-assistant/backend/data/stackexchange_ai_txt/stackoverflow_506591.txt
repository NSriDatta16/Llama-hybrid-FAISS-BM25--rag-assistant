In the project properties, look under Configuration Properties -> Linker -> Input -> Additional Dependencies, for each of your project's configurations (Debug, Release, etc). Also, look for #pragma comment(lib, ...) directives in the code. As you've added the C:\xpressmp\lib folder to the library search path in VC++ Directories, check that only the library file name is specified under Additional Dependencies, and this does not include the path (i.e, xprm_rt.lib , not ..\..\xpressmp\lib\xprm_rt.lib ). Also, have you tried each of the solutions in the LNK1104 error documentation ?
