I agree with @rolando2, as I believe mistakes made during the coding process could be the cause of such a high $\alpha$ . Though my guess is that it is due to item redundancy - something you mentioned in your question. Another plausible cause could be your sample. I have analyzed survey data from many sources, and from my experience, it is clear that responses to organizational surveys are often quite lazy, in that it is common to see many respondents answer the same way across the entire survey. This is why I prefer organizational surveys that are both short and easy to read, as doing both makes it less likely for respondents to answer lazily.
