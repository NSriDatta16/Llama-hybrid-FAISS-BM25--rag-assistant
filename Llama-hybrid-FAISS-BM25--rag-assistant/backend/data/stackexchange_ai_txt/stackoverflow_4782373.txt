As others say, use Stopwatch class. However, a good method for using this is to run your test procedure once before starting the stopwatch, to get everything JITted, cached, etc. Then within the timed section, run the test 1000 times to get an average. Repeat the whole business several times to get averages, since timing is always variable.
