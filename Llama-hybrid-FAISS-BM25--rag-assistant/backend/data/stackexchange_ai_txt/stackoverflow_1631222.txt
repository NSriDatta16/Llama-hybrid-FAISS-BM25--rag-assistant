You make a lot of assumptions in your question that aren't necessarily true. The type of the a column in any DBMS tells you nothing at all about the nature of the storage of that data unless the documentation clearly tells you how the data is stored. IF that's not stated, you don't know how it is stored and the DBMS is free to change the storage mechanism from release to release. In fact some databases store CHAR fields internally as VARCHAR, while others make a decision about how to the store the column based on the declared size of the column. Some database store VARCHAR with the other columns, some with BLOB data, and some implement other storage, Some databases always rewrite the entire row when a column is updated, others don't. Some pad VARCHARs to allow for limited future updating without relocating the storage. The DBMS is responsible for figuring out how to store the data and return it to you in a speedy and consistent fashion. It always amazes me how many people to try out think the database, generally in advance of detecting any performance problem.
