What's the point in checking the training's data accuracy?

I am seeing a tutorial in Machine Learning and it checks the accuracy of both the training and testing datasets. For example: ridge01 = Ridge(alpha=0.1).fit(X_train, y_train) Which gives: Training set score: 0.93 Test set score: 0.77 I am wondering since the training dataset was visible shouldn't it have 100% accuracy? Therefore why is it a different value and why is it important?
