Logistic regression: age covariate within age group strata

I am using logistic regression to calculate the OR of falling using certain predictors (e.g. strength), age is also a confounder. The effect of age appears linear - risk of falling incrementally increases with age. Age also has a weak/negative correlation with strength. When age is added as a covariate to the full group (n=2000), strength is significant. However, I have been advised to consider splitting my group into different age groups i.e. 2-3 age group strata. If I do this, firstly groups are uneven (e.g. old n=1500, very old n=500) and secondly strength loses significance in the old group; age also loses significance in both groups. I struggle to understand the difference between age as a covariate and age group strata. I have seen the following post - Cox regression: age covariate within age group strata - but I am struggling to apply this to my analysis as it is a retrospective observational cohort study and the effect of age is linear. I would be really grateful if anyone could explain (simply) how the analysis of age as a covariate and age group strata differs? And also why I might be losing significance for strength when using age strata?
