The layout of distinct lines in an HTML page is not really something that a message bundle can deal with, it's just not suitable for the task. If you need multiple lines to be displayed, then realistically you're going to need multiple messages, with multiple entries in the properties file. Perhaps you could cook up something which iterates over a sequence of properties, with something like this in your properties file: error.code.1=This is error message. error.code.2=This is next line of error message. It then becomes the job of the JSP to render the sequence of messages. Not very elegant, though, but I can't think of a better solution right now :)
