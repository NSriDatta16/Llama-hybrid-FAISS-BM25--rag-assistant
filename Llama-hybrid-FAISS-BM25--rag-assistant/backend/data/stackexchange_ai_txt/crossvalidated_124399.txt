Based on the adonis {vegan} help page, your predictors variables can be continuous or factors. The response variables (Y) must be a dissimilarity matrix. So then I would say that because you can make a dissimilarity matrix based on categorical data (for example, using the daisy function in {cluster}), it is possible to use categorical data as the response. I would recommend reading this paper by Anderson and Walsh (2013) on testing the null hypothesis in perMANOVA, ANOSIM and the Mantel test.
