There are a couple of possible solutions: You could use a background image on the .jspTrack which is the width you require and centered e.g. .jspTrack { background: #fff url(/path/to/image.png) repeat-y 5px 0; } This way even through the .jspTrack is the width of the .jspDrag it's background makes it look less wide. You could try using negative margins on the .jspDrag to pull it outside the .jspTrack e.g. .jspVerticalBar .jspTrack { width: 5px; background: #c4c4c4; } .jspVerticalBar .jspDrag { margin: 0 -5px; width: 15px; background: #363636 } Possibly you could use left instead of the negative margin. Both of these solutions are untested but they should give you a good start...
