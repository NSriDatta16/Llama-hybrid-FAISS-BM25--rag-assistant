checking linearity assumption in logistic regression for continuous variable, truly linear?

One assumption of running a logistic regression is that the continuous predictors are linearly related with the log odds. However, wouldn't it technically be better if it was shaped as is the logit function below, not really linear? I understand that the logit function is roughly linear when probabilities are between .3 and .7, but what about for very high or low probabilities where you test your assumption and it might not look, strictly speaking, linear?
