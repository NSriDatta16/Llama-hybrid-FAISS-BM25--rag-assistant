My preferred choice would not to store the the data in a fixed-width delimited string in the first place. :) The way I think about it is this: Who cares the most about the actual storage of the data? If the string format is an artifact of some legacy system and not an essential part of business logic (i.e. if you were to change storage mechanisms you'd get rid of the string) then hide it behind the repository. If it's an essential part of the data but you are abstracting it from the business logic, put it in the service. If you do leave it in the repository, you can create a special class for manipulating that string and pass it in (as an interface) to the repository. That way you can unit test the string-handling code like crazy (and reuse it else where if needed) and leave your repository simple.
