I would examine the code coverage with whatever testing tool you use, if a code coverage is available for your testing framework. I personally like to work with either Microsoft Testing Tool or NUnit Testing Framework . I can then right-click my tests project and Test with NCover (while using NUnit), which will run the tests and tell me the percentage of code covered for each of my objects and tests. I say that when you'll be done checking the code coverage which would result of at least a 98% code coverage, your code is likely to be well tested.
