Your first problem is easy. You could do it by setting a foreign key on list . You'd set it up to CASCADE updates and deletes (so that DELETE FROM messages WHERE messageID = 5 would automatically delete all rows in list where messageID = 5 as well. You'd need to use InnoDB as the storage engine for this to work... For the second problem, that's easy as well. Just insert the new rows in one query: INSERT INTO list (senderID, receiverID, messageID) VALUES (sender_x_id, receiver_4_id, message_1_id), (sender_x_id, receiver_5_id, message_1_id); And then remove the others in another: DELETE FROM list WHERE receiverID = receiver_1_id AND messageID = message_1_id
