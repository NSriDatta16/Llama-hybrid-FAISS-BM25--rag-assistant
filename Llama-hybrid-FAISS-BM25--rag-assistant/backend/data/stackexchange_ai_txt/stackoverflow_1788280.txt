How to simulate the top site message bar that StackOverflow uses in Rails for the flash[:notice] and flash[:error] messages

I want to render my Rails flash[:notice] and flash[:error] messages in a bar at the top of the screen, similar to the message bar that StackOverflow uses when you get a new badge etc. Does anyone know how I can achieve this elegantly? Extra credit to make it slide in.
