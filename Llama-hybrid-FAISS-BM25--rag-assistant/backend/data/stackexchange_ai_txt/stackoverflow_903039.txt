There is value in using a tool to provide visibility into your agile project when it is not pragmatic to come to the team room. I would not recommend using a tool other than the big visible charts in the team room in place of the big visible charts. When a person has to go to a tool to pull the information as opposed to see the information continuously visible in the team room, it looses its effectiveness. Of the tools we have used my comments are as follows Mingle - Programmable and the most customizable, largest learning curve but you won't be boxed into a corner and the learning curve is quickly picked up by a developer Rally - Does what you need it to out of the box. Enforces agile practices and has a small learning curve. Reports are good. Version One - Swiss army knife of agile tools. Easy, full of features, great query tool to extract project data, need to ensure hosted service provides the performance you need XPlanner - free, basic but non-evolving, easy for the team to use, less capable in the reporting department Excel - works great, most people start with it and the file can be posted to a WIKI that can be downloaded and viewed by anyone Consider the licensing. A number of the tools can post results in HTLM which can be read from a WIKI as a dashboard report. If you need to control access to the data then providing a license to the tools or providing a login to the WIKI should meet your needs.
