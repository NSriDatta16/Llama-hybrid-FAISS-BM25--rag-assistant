You can use timestampdiff to find the difference between two times. I'm not sure what you mean by "average," though. Average across the table? Average across a row? If it's the table or a subset of rows: select avg(timestampdiff(SECOND, startTimestamp, endTimestamp)) as avgdiff from table The avg function works like any other aggregate function, and will respond to group by . For example: select col1, avg(timestampdiff(SECOND, startTimestamp, endTimestamp)) as avgdiff from table group by col1 That will give you the average differences for each distinct value of col1 . Hopefully this gets you pointed in the right direction!
