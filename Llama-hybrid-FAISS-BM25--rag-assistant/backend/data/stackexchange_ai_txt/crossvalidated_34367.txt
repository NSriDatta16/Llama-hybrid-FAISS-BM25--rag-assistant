So y is school grade and x is poverty index. If you have repeated x values or several x values close together you could compute the average squared distance from the observed y to the fitted y is each group. These could serve as variance estimates for the residuals that you can plot vs x (picking a central x for each group) to see how the variance is changing with x.
