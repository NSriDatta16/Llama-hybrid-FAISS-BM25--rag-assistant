EF Mapping and metadata information could not be found for EntityType Error

I have encountered an exception when I use Entity Framework 4.0 RC. My Entity Framework model is encapsulated in a private assembly who's name is Procurement.EFDataProvider and my POCO classes are inside of another assembly Procurement.Core The relation between Core(Business Logic)and EFDataProvider(Data Access) is with a factory named DataProvider so when I try to create an objectset objectSet = ObjectContext.CreateObjectSet (); I get an error: Mapping and metadata information could not be found for EntityType 'Procurement.Core.Entities.OrganizationChart'.
