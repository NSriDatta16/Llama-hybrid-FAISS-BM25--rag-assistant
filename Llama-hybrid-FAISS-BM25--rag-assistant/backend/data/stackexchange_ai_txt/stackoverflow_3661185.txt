How many MB of memory can I get for my app? Is there some guaranteed minimum or theoretical (but still reachable :) ) maximum? You can have 500 megs of free memory, but it may be unavailable due to fragmentation (program XYZ may have taken a space between 255 and 284 MB, for example). Since that, there is a question of memory, that is available for each malloc() called. Nowadays it's a rare situation (kernel and garbage collectors are smart enough), but still - "out of memory" is "cannot load shared library *.dylib: cant find free space segment longing for N mbs".
