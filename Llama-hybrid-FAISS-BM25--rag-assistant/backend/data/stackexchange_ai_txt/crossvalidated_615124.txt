Do contour plots over first two principal components reveal local convexity/concavity?

When I plot a contour plot of a variable over two principal components I can see what appears to be hills and valleys. But I also know I am only looking at the contours over a projection. Here is a quick self-contained example. import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from sklearn.datasets import load_diabetes from sklearn.decomposition import PCA X, y = load_diabetes(return_X_y=True) plt.tricontourf( *PCA(n_components=2).fit_transform(X).T, y, cmap='terrain', levels=100 ) plt.xlabel('PC1') plt.ylabel('PC2') plt.colorbar() plt.show() If I see hills and valleys on the contour plot, does that entail there exists locally convex/concave regions over the original space? If it helps, here is a quick 3D surface for the same contour plot: plt.tricontourf produces a colour-filled contour plot based on a triangular tesselation computed from the data. The boundaries between levels are interpolated level sets . A link to further documentation and references on the diabetes dataset can be found here . My question isn't special to this dataset, but rather is just an example of the plotting procedure. Many other data sets are suitable mutatis mutandis . The local minima shown in import numpy as np; from sklearn.decomposition import PCA; np.random.seed(100); X = np.random.normal(size=100*3).reshape(100,3); Q = PCA(n_components=2).fit_transform(X); plt.tricontourf(*Q.T, X[:,2]);plt.show() convinces me that the 2D projection can still be misleading about convexity. Sampling error is sufficient for demotivating my intuition.
