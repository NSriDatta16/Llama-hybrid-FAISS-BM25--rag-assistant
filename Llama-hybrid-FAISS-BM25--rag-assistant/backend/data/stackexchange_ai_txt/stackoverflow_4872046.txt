Mousedown on body and drag the page up or down, like on a pdf

How would I make it so I can mousedown on the body on my page, then drag the page up or down, like you can in a PDF? Basically I want to be able to drag the whole page up and down, any idea how to do this? I don't want to use jQuery UI for anything.
