best way to store data locally and update from web from time to time?

I have created an app which displays information in a organized manner about cultural places. The information is subject to changes, so I want it to be downloaded from the web. But not everytime. Only once in a while, because information doesn't change often. What I want to do is, the first time the user opens the application, it downloads all data from the web. For the moment, I parse it from an xml (which is about 100Ko), and I get a NSMutableArray of "CulturalPlace" objects. but it is very slow. And what I would like to do is, to store this data locally (in case the user has an iPod touch an is not on a wifi, or if he is on EDGE and does not want to redownload all). So the user updates data only by clicking an "update button" on the top right of the screen. Otherwise it reads it from disk. I really don't know what could be the best solution. I thought about Core Data, but I have several Tableview imbricated (Rootviewcontroller > ListofPlacesViewController > PlaceViewController) and I really cannot find good tutorial for a simple use like mine. (the iTunes "TopSongs" sample code seems too complex). I thought also about not parsing the xml, but instead try an NSURLConnection and get a plist file. But I never managed to read anything from the local file. So my main question is, should I keep the xml parsing method, or should I use another format to tranfert the data from the web? And what is the best way to store and read data like an NSMutableArray of custom Objects ? Thanks in advance for your help, sorry for my approximate english.
