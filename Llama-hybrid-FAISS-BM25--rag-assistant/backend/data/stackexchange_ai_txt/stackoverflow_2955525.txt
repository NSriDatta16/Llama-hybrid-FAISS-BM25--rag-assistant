I see no reason why you want exception handling to be efficient and elegant, I settle for effective. They're called Exceptions for a reason. This code will be a maintenance nightmare. Can't you redesign the call stack to throw the Exception you are interested in? If it is important the method signatures should show it and not hide it wrapped in 2 other exceptions. The first (e != null) is unnecessary. And you can change the 3rd better to e.getCause().getCause() instanceof MyException)
