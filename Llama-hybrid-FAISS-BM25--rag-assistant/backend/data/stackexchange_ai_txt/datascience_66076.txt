Solutions to over fitting: Simplify model by reducing the number of attributes in the training data or by constraining the model(regularization). Gather more training data Reduce the noise in the data (Fix data errors, remove outliers) Solutions to under fitting: Feature engineering Reducing the constraints in the model. To make good predictions your training data must contain enough relevant features, good quality data (free from outliers,noise and errors).
