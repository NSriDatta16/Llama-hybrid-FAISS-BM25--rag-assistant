You are subscribing to the OnLogin event in xmpp. This means that when xmpp fires this event, the code inside the anonymous delegate will fire. Its an elegant way to have callbacks. In Xmpp, something like this is going on: // Check to see if we should fire the login event // ALso check to see if anything is subscribed to OnLogin // (It will be null otherwise) if (loggedIn && OnLogin != null) { // Anyone subscribed will now receive the event. OnLogin(this); }
