There is a good and relatively straightforward paper that explains in detail p-values and related misunderstandings: Gigerenzer, G., Krauss, S., & Vitouch, O. (2004). The null ritual: what you always wanted to know about significance testing but were too afraid to ask. The Sage Handbook of Quantitative Methodology for the Social Sciences. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage, 391-408. In a simple sentence, it explains what a p-value actually is (p. 393): A p-value is the probability of the observed data (or of more extreme data points), given that the null hypothesis H0 is true, defined in symbols as p(D|H0). On the same page, the authors present 6 misconceptions of a p-value. Your case is the incorrect statement number 5: You know, if you decide to reject the null hypothesis, the probability that you are making the wrong decision. This is a wrong statement because of the same reason as two other wrong statements mentioned by the authors. I report their explanation: Recall that a p-value is a probability of data, not of a hypothesis. Despite wishful thinking, p(D|H0) is not the same as p(H0|D), and a significance test does not and cannot provide a probability for a hypothesis. One cannot conclude from a p-value that a hypothesis has a probability of 1 (Statements 1 and 3) or that it has any other probability (Statements 2 and 4). Therefore, Statements 2 and 4 are false. The statistical toolbox, of course, contains tools that allow estimating probabilities of hypotheses, such as Bayesian statistics (see below). However, null hypothesis testing does not. And more directly regarding your statement: The “probability that you are making the wrong decision” is again a probability of a hypothesis. This is because if one rejects the null hypothesis, the only possibility of making a wrong decision is if the null hypothesis is true. In other words, a closer look at Statement 5 reveals that it is about the probability that you will make the wrong decision, that is, that H0 is true. Thus, it makes essentially the same claim as Statement 2 does, and both are incorrect.
