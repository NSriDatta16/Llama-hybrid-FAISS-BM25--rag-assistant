Cross-platform alternative to a windows shell extension - WebDAV platform?

I want to build a cross-platform (windows, mac[, linux]) desktop application that allows directory browsing and drag-and-drop functionality for accessing a cloud-based enterprise CMS. This will replace an existing (and slightly buggy) windows shell extension that talks to a REST API hosted by IIS. I'm currently looking into leveraging WebDAV, but I'm having trouble finding a cross-platform library for building the client(s). I'm looking for advice and suggestions for what technologies and/or libraries to leverage to make this project go smoothly. My preferred languages are C# and Java, and an ideal solution would be able to map a drive. Also - I do have a budget and I don't mind supporting fellow programmers. Thanks a ton for any ideas or knowledge you can provide.
