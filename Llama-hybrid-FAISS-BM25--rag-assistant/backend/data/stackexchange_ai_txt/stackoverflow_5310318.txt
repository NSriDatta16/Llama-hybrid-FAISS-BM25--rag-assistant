How to let users define their own page layout?

I would like to let my users define their own layouts for their profiles within some reasonable guidelines. Imagine the controlled aesthetic of Facebook with some additional user flexibility. I'd like to offer these abilities: Define paragraphs of text with headings, bold, and bullet points (no user control over fonts, colors, sizes etc.) The ability to upload a couple of images per page. The ability to set those images anywhere in the page (left or right) in the page and have the text flow around. How might this work? If all this data is to be stored in the database, how should I think about setting up these features? Thank you very much.
