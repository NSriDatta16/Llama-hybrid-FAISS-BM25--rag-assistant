ACF and PACF functions for AR(2) model

I am trying to practice calculating the autocovariance function and the partial autocorrelation functions of a time series $X_t$ . I am familiar with how to calculate the autocovariance functions of an AR(2) model, but I am not sure how I to go about calculating the autocovariance and partial autocorrelation functions of an AR(2) model such as $X_t=aX_{t-2} +e_t$ where $|a| . Not that here we are missing the $X_{t-1}$ term. Can anybody please help?
