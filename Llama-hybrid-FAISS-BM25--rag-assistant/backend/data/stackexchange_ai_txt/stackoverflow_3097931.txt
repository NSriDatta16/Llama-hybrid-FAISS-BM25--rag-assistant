jQuery UI Dialog positioning - How to make it remain centered

Basically I would like the dialog to remain centered when resizing the window (or switching to full screen window). Also the dialog is draggable, and ideally I'd prefer if it remained in it's dragged position on the page when resizing the window. But if it resets back to the center then I would settle for that too. I tried setting "position: relative" on the ".ui-dialog" class, however this produces a big empty gap at the bottom of the page; I have been unable to figure out what is causing this using the DOM inspector tools.
