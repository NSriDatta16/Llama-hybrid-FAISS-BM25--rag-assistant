Ask Sun. How did the whole Java thing work out for the company? (yeah, I know, sample of 1 and all) In this case, I am looking at it from a vendor's standpoint. They made a language, which while popular, did nothing to leverage the (actual!) power of the OS they sold. It had to run on Windows, with all of the crippling nonsense that such entails. You want to fork off a child process and open a pipe or two between parent and child? Too bad. Have fun with your thread bugs. Have fun with your dog-slow file I/O. (when, if ever, did Java finally include an "nio" implementation ?) Microsoft of course made no such mistake with .NET. And they focused on better language features, instead of spending resources on multiple runtime implementations.
