For modern browsers, use the cross-window messaging interface provided by HTML 5 https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage For older browsers, emulate the above messaging interface by creating a third IFrame on the same domain as your application, below the second external IFrame. You can then have bidirectional messaging from the 2nd to the 3rd and from the 1st to the 2nd by modifying the fragment part of the URL. The 3rd and 1st IFrames can communicate bidirectionally in javascript, because you're hosting them on the same domain. You should be able to wrap both of the above methods into a single script, and maybe source one of these messaging layers to save you some time: http ://json-rpc.org/wiki/implementations
