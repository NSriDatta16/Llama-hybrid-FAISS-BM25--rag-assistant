List of in-browser UI techniques?

I'd like to know what can be done in a browser UI (using a browser+CSS+javascript, not using Flash or Silverlight). For example, I think it's possible to: Drag and drop Arrange list items horizontally, and make them behave like menu items Make things on page visible or invisible, depending on where the mouse is hovering I admit this is a broad question, but that's what I'm looking for: an overview of available UI techniques (preferably with, also, at least a little clue or hyperlink as to how to implement each one). Do you know of such a list or dictionary? I'm especially interested in any techniques for interaction and user input (i.e. not simply page layout and navigation where the end-user is only consuming information). Edit: people answered that I should look to see what functionality is implemented in various 'JavaScript UI toolkits'. FWIW, the following are my brief review/summary after looking at some of the suggestions. http://demos.mootools.net/ -- implements a small (not wide) variety of UI features http://ajaxian.com/by/topic/ui -- not an organized or coherent reference, more like a blog that reviews various things. http://jqueryui.com/demos/ -- concise, organized introduction to a dozen interactions and/or widgets http://plugins.jquery.com/ -- a library of a couple of thousand 'plug-ins' in 20 categories ... vaster and not so immediately understandable nor so consistently documented as the jqueryui demos http://www.dojotoolkit.org/ -- takes a bit of navigating ... the easiest introduction to all functionality might be http://dojocampus.org/explorer/ http://script.aculo.us/ -- not very big http://extjs.com/ -- quite a variety of powerful features, with a good set of demos at http://extjs.com/deploy/dev/examples/samples.html http://mochikit.com/ -- this is another small library http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/ -- includes about 20 widget classes, thorough documentation (each class description includes a link to demos), and special mention for having "Layout Manager" and "CSS Reset". http://www.midorijs.com/ -- quite small and simple, no demos To summarize, I think the best answers (i.e. the easiest-to-browse collections of the most functionality) are: http://extjs.com/deploy/dev/examples/samples.html http://dojocampus.org/explorer/ http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/examples/
