How would I interpret this TukeyHSD result in R?

I'm comparing two systems to see whether there is a significant difference in being able to locate anomalies using System A and System B. I've run a t-test on both and have rejected the null hypothesis. I then decided to run an ANOVA to confirm my findings and I was also able to reject the null hypothesis. I ran a further TukeyHSD test to see where the differences lay and got this: Tukey multiple comparisons of means 95% family-wise confidence level Fit: aov(formula = x_time_subtracted_from_y_time ~ system, data = data) $system diff lwr upr p adj SystemB-SystemA 0.03974616 0.02658632 0.052906 0 Am I reading this correctly as that System B averages 0.03974616 points higher than System A? If so does the below then mean that System A averages out 0.0004256548 higher than System B? Fit: aov(formula = y_time ~ system, data = data) diff lwr upr p adj SystemB-SystemA -0.0004256548 -0.0008034504 -0.00004785925 0.0272384 Thanks in advance.
