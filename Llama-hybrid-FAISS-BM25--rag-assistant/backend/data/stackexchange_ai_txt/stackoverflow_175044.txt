Django development IDE

I have done a little Django development, but it has all been in a text editor. I was curious what more advanced development tools others are using in their Django development. I am used to using Visual Studio for development and really like the IntelliSense , code completion, and file organization it provides and would like to find something (or a combination of tools) that would provide some of this in the Django/Python environment.
