LDAP authentication server why?

I have read about LDAP on wikipedia and I kind of understand what it is. However what I did not get what why so many organizations are using LDAP authentication server over having a simple table with userid and hashed password. LDAP server surely brings more complexity to the infrastructure. What gains justify this added complexity?
