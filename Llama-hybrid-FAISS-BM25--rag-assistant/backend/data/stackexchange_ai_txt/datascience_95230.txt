A quite useful site is this https://machinelearningmastery.com/learning-curves-for-diagnosing-machine-learning-model-performance/ . Some other things that you could do in order to avoid overfitting is: early stoping, plot the accuracy of validation and test data sets over the time and when the validation accuracy becomes much better stop training your model. try to use L2 regularization which gives a penalty of the complexity of the model. in case that you use trees, try to prune your tree. in case of neural networks try to use dropout, https://machinelearningmastery.com/dropout-regularization-deep-learning-models-keras/ .
