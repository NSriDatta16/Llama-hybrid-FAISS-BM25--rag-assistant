While checking whether hdparm could modify the number of retries (doesn't seem so), I thought that, depending on the type of error, lowering the CD-ROM speed could potentially reduce the number of read errors, which could actually increase the average read speed. However, if some sectors are completely unreadable, then even lowering the CD-ROM speed won't help.
