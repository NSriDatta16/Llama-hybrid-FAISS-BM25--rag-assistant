Chris, I started here: codeproject - NetPopMimeClient . Using this I wrote a program to check for a new inventory email based on subject text (inventory attached.) When I found a new one I would save the attachment and then upload it to my sql server and kick off a stored proc to process it. Then saved the email DateTime stamp for the next run and to display to the user on the front-end. I created a Console Application that is scheduled in SQL Server Agent. I did this so I can have a log of activity, it is close to the database, it is easy to kick off manually, and it emails out when there is a problem. Jim
