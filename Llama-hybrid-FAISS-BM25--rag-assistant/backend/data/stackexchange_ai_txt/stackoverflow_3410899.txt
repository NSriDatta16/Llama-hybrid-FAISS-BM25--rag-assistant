If you do a custom coat over WSS underneath, you are essentially writing code that already comes with the platform, especially with SharePoint. I assume that price is a factor in your decision making or you would not use WSS alone. In that case it can be tempting to leverage WSS as a code layer, but I would expect that it would be extremely difficult to make that work smoothly. Depending on your business model I would look at what hosted SharePoint solutions can do, especially if you can host a custom SharePoint site definition on their platform. It would take a very strong IP or financial requirement to make me consider wrapping asp.net over top of WSS. I have worked with a solution that does that and it does work for our externally facing site, but it is a maintenance 'mare.
