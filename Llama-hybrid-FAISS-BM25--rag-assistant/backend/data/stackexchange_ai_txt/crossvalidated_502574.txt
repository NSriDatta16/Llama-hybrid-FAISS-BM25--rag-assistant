Feature transformation for Exponential distribution

I am a beginner in machine learning, and working on a classification task. I am spending lots of time doing feature engineering, and I understand that for most models one would like to scale the features so that they are relatively Normal and have values close to 0 (or at least I believe that). This is fine for features which are approximately Normal, however I have some features which follow an exponential distribution. How should I proceed to engineer these features? Does the engineering change depending on what model I use?
