The purpose of Siamese and triplet networks is to produce a vector representation of the input. The vector representation can be used later for other tasks, such as classification, but you’ll need a model to do so. To make such a model, train a binary network where the features are the vectors obtained from the Siamese network and the labels are the class labels. This is like any other classifier where you have a feature extraction module, except here that module is also a neural network However, because the vectors are designed to encode class information, and have small dimension, these classifiers probably don’t need to be very ornate!
