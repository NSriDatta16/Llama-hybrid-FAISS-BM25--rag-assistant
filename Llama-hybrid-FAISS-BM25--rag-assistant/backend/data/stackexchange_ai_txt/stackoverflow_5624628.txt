The answer which has been provided by Robert Levy is perfect, I would add something that when you move from Windows Forms to WPF try to avoid using same patterns which you can use in Windows Forms. Try to learn how tasks could be accomplished using WPF before starting implementation. You can find here very good resource to learn MVVM pattern.
