I believe that decision tree classifiers can be used in both continuous and categorical data. If it's continuous the decision tree still splits the data into numerous bins. I have simply tried both to see which performs better. In case of logistic regression, data cleaning is necessary i.e. missing value imputation, normalization/ standardization. In case of decision trees, that is not needed.
