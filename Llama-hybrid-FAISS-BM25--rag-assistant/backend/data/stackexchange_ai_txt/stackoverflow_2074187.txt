Pattern: Elegant way to do something upon function exit?

I have a function with logic that looks like this: doStuff1() try: doStuff2() except type1: error1() return endstuff() except type2: error2() return endstuff() except: error3() return endstuff() if doStuff3(): error4() return endstuff() doStuff4() return endstuff() As you can see, endstuff() is done on every possible exit to the function. As it is now, endstuff() is actually 2 lines of code, and I recently had to add a third one to all possible exits. Is there any more elegant way to organize this code? I can't just use a finally , as it's not always the case that an exception is thrown.
