Fail to profile remote java app using TPTP

I am trying to profile CPU usage using TPTP. Application to profile run on Linux RH AS5. I installed and configured Agent Controller like described here I ran the java application using the command java '-agentlib:JPIBootLoader=JPIAgent:server=standalone,file=log.trcxml;CGProf' MyApp The monitoring station is All-In-one TPTP version 4.6.2. I followed the stepes described here on Eclipse - on the "Profile Configuration" I choose a new configuration for "Attach to Agent", set the host to my remote linux machine where MyApp is running, test connection succeed and when I get to the "Agents" tab , I see " Pending... ", a background process " Feching children for host " is running and can't find anything which makes it impossible to profile. Any idea?
