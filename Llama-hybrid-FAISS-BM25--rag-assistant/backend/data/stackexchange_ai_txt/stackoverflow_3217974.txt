LINQ has the .Average extension method, however, that only works on integers. So what you need to do is get an IEnumerable of the RatingField property on all your Rating objects in the database. This can be accomplished by using the .Select extension method of LINQ which Projects each element of a sequence into a new form . int average = _db.Ratings .Where(x => x.RatingID == rating.RatingID) .Select(x => x.RatingField) .Average();
