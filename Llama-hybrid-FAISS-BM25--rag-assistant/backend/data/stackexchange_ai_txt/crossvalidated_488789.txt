Multi-Class Text Classification with Negative Training Examples

I have a problem similar to the questions Here and Here . In short, for a multi-class text classification problem, how to incorporate samples where I only know the classes they do not belong to? In a typical text classification problem, the training data would look something like: |---------------------|------------------| | Sample 1 | Class A | |---------------------|------------------| | Sample 2 | Class B | |---------------------|------------------| | Sample 3 | Class C | |---------------------|------------------| | Sample 4 | Class B | |---------------------|------------------| | ... | ... | |---------------------|------------------| I want to tell the classifier that Sample X does not belong to Class B. I am using a BERT-based text classifier. Are there neural-based approaches that can handle this case? If not, are there recommended practices to make use of such negative samples? Any feedback is appreciated.
