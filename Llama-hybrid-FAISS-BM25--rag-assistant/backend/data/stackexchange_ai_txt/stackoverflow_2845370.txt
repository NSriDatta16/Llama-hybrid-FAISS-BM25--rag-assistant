MVC: Nested Views, and Controllers (for a website)

I'm about to do a PHP website using the MVC pattern. I am not using a framework as the site is fairly simple and I feel that this will give me a good opportunity to learn about the pattern directly. I have a couple questions. Question 1: How should I organize my views? I'm thinking of having a Page view which will have the header and footer, and which will allow for a Content view to be nested between them. Question 2: If I have 5 Content pages, should I make 5 different views that can be used as the content that is nested within the Page view? Or, should I make them all extend an abstract view called AbstractContent? Question 3: What about controllers? I think there should be one main controller at least. But then where does the request go from there? To another controller? Or should I just call the Page view and leave it at that? I thought that controllers were supposed to handle input, possibly modify a model, and select a view. But what if one of the views nested within the view that a controller calls requires additional input to be parsed? Question 4: Are controllers allowed to pass parameters into the view? Or should the controller simply modify the model, which will then affect the view? Or is the model only for DB access and other such things?
