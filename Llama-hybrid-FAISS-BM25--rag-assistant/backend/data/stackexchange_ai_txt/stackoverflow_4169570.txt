FullCalendar: Set event end in drop function

I have the ability to drag and drop external events to the calendar with the default behavior of start time being where the event was dropped. I would like to set the default behavior to also set the end time for the event to be 1 hour after the start time. This seems trivial but I can't seem to get it working. Below is my drop function (essentially the droppable items demo plus 1 line.) drop: function(date, allDay) { // this function is called when something is dropped // retrieve the dropped element's stored Event Object var originalEventObject = $(this).data('eventObject'); // we need to copy it, so that multiple events don't have a // reference to the same object var copiedEventObject = $.extend({}, originalEventObject); // assign it the date that was reported copiedEventObject.start = date; copiedEventObject.end = date.setHours(date.getHours()+1); // Any ideas? Thanks, Joe Chin
