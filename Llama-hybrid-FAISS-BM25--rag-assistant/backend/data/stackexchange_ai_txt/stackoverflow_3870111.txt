IE is notorious for caching stuff like ajax requests. A general big stick - on important requests that shouldnt be cached, make sure the pragma header is set to no-cache.... so in php call: header("Pragma: no-cache"); before content is rendered / returned to the browser. Alternatively add a timestamp as an additional param to an ajax url. Both approaches mean that any intermediate caching services would be busted through (i.e. redis, squid proxies etc.) which could affect your server load.
