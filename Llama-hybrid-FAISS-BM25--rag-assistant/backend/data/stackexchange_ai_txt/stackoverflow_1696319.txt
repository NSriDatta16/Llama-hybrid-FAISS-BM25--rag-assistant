As already mentioned, an ugly code can be cleaned up by a monkey with a proper IDE so I wouldn't go to your manager with that argument alone. Being pragmatic, I would go with: grab some tools (a profiler, code duplication tools) to find a couple of pain points for each point, come up with a battle plan how to solve it (with short specification, design, maybe code sample, test cases...). go to your manager and let him decide which one to tackle first The danger is to do too much and to try to clean everything. Depending on the size of the application, it may take years to clean it up (because you won't do this full time) so just be patient. And of course, when you revisit part of the code, just clean it up with your favorite IDE.
