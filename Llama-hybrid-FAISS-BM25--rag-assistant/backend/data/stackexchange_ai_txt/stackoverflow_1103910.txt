Has any body given Git any thought? There is a very usable solution for windows called GitExtensions here . It integrates with Visual Studio Professional trough an extra menu and optional toolbar. Unlike Subversion, Git is distributed, which means you can commit locally to your copy of the repository, and afterwards push the changes to the server. The bottom line? Git is FAST! It's storage is also more efficient than subversion, which means your repository takes up less space.
