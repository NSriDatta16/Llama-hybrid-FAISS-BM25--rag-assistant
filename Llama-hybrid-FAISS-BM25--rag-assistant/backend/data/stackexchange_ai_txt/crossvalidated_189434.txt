Both alternatives are (as mentioned prior) given here , one with $\frac{x}{\theta }$, where $\theta$ is indeed a scale parameter, and $\beta x$, where $\beta$ is a rate scale parameter, the reciprocal of $\theta$. $\theta$ is the scale factor. Similarly for exponential distributions, $\frac{x}{\theta }$, where $\theta$ is the scale factor. However, $\beta$ is often used for practical reasons. As mentioned, it is not a scale factor, it is a rate scaling factor. As mentioned, the gamma distribution (GD) becomes an exponential distribution (ED) when the GD shape parameter ${\alpha }$ is 1, i.e., $\frac{\beta ^{\alpha }}{\Gamma (\alpha )}x^{\alpha -1} e^{-\beta x}\to \beta e^{-\beta x}$. For time series, both the gamma and exponential distributions often use $\beta$ because it is more normally distributed than ${\theta }$, and using $\frac{x}{\theta }$ would introduce a discontinuity at $\beta = 0$. Thus, for time series ${\theta }$ is problematic for regression analysis, and $\beta$ is far more practical a measure, even if it is not "statistically" appealing from an abstract theoretical point of view.
