Regression on wavy angular data?

I'm a newbie at stats/machine learning so please bare with me. This plot is a result of an experiment that attempts to find the perceived angle of a stimulus. The stimulus is placed at a position (see the X axis of the plot) and participants reply with the perceived angle (see the Y axis)--in other words, the question is "what direction do you think it's coming from?" Perceived angles therefore range from 0 to 360. The plot shows this strange sinusoidal pattern about the best fit line (in blue). How would I go about capturing that wavy pattern in a regression? I would like to obtain an equation for perceived angle as a function of position. A linear regression is not a bad approximation, but I would like to see if there's anything better. I also tried to do a regression with a few added polynomial terms, but I couldn't get a reasonable fit (perhaps I just messed up). Thoughts/advice appreciated.
