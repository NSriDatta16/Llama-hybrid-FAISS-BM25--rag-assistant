Does it make sense to use Lasso regression for recommendation systems?

I'm really intrigued by Lasso Regression, and it seems like a potential candidate for estimating “objective” ratings for items based on the users who watched them. The user data is sparse, and the estimation of the overall rating can be a regression problem. To be clear: I would be using this for a Netflix-prize type algorithm where the average rating would be replaced by a “true” rating based on this method. Is there any problem with this? Are there other things that Lasso regression tends to be used for that could serve as examples?
