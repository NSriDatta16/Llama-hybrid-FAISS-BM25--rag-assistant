Create a div by click and drag

I want to be able to create a div in my application by clicking and dragging. Clicking would initiate the div creation, while dragging would resize the div. I have seen similar functionality in several jquery calendar plugins, I want to be able to do it in my application too. Can anyone please guide me into the right direction? Any jQuery plugin or something that I am missing? Thanking you for your help.
