How to handle time series missing values

I have a database of thermal consumption of 100 buildings. Each file has two columns, one is timestamp and the other is usage. My task is to build a prediction model for forecasting the usage for the next day. Having this in mind, now look at this chart: Can I put this data as-is into my models or should I drop these Na values and then try to train a model? I suppose I can impute the missing values for sites with less than 5% missing data, but is doing this for sites such as site 15 is logical? And what method do you suggest for imputation? Thank you in advance for your help.
