Add column from another table matching results from first MySQL query

This is my query for available rooms in choosen period: SELECT rooms.room_id FROM rooms WHERE rooms.room_id NOT IN ( SELECT reservations.room_id FROM reservations WHERE ( reservations.arrivaldate >= $arrival_datetime AND reservations.departuredate = $arrival_datetime ) OR ( reservations.arrivaldate = $departure_datetime ) ); How to add average room price column for selected period(from $arrival_datetime to $departure_datetime) from another table (room_prices_table), for every room_id returned from above query. So I need to look in columns whos name is same as room_id... room_prices_table: date room0001 room0002 room0003 ... Something like SELECT AVG(room0003) FROM room_prices_table WHERE datum IS BETWEEN $arrival_datetime AND $departure_datetime ??
