Scala is perfectly capable of parsing i++ and, with a small modification to the language, could be made to modify a variable. But there are a variety of reasons not to. First, it saves only one character, i++ vs. i+=1 , which is not very much savings for adding a new language feature. Second, the ++ operator is widely used in the collections library, where xs ++ ys takes collection xs and ys and produces a new collection that contains both. Third, Scala tries to encourage you, without forcing you, to write code in a functional way. i++ is a mutable operation, so it's inconsistent with the idea of Scala to make it especially easy. (Likewise with a language feature that would allow ++ to mutate a variable.)
