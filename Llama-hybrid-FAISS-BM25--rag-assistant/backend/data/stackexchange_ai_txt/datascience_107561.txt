Look ahead bias predicting a time series using features

I am making some ML methods (RF, RNN, MLP) to predict a time series value 'y' based on features 'X' and not the time series 'y' itself. My question is regarding the bias I might be including since I am doing a simple random train-test-split for the fit and evaluation process, so I am using data from different days (past and future) and not spliting by time. Is it valid for this prediction process, or even that I am not using the time series to predict future values, I am still introducing bias since I am using features which also are time series themselves since I go them daily. I tried both ways and got far better results using the simple random train-test-split, so I got suspicious.
