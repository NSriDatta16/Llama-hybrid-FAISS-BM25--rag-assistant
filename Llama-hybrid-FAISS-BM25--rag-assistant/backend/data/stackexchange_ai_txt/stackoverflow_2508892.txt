Why does ASP.Net rewrite relative paths for runat=server anchor controls?

I have my UserControls in a ~/Controls folder in my solution: /Controls/TheControl.ascx If specify the following: link text ASP.Net seems to want to rewrite the path to point to the absolute location. For example, If the control is on site.com/products/fish/cans.aspx the link href will be rewritten to read link text Why does Asp.Net rewrite these control paths, and is there an elegant way to fix it? I just want the anchor control to spit out exactly what I tell it to!!! Is that so hard? EDIT: I've basically done what Kelsey suggested. I knew I could do it this way, but I don't like adding markup in my code when I want something relatively simple. At least it solves the problem: Aspx page: Code-behind: var anchor = new HtmlGenericControl("a") { InnerText = "Previous" + " " + PageSize) }; anchor.Attributes["href"] = "?pg=" + (CurrentPage - 1); anchor.Attributes["class"] = "prev button"; ph.Controls.Clear(); ph.Controls.Add(anchor); As you can see by the amount of code needed for what is essentially supposed to be be a simple and light-weight anchor, it's not the most optimal solution. I know I could use a Literal but I figured this was cleaner as I'm adding more than one anchor. I would be interesting in knowing WHY ASP.Net takes over and tries to fix my URL, though.
