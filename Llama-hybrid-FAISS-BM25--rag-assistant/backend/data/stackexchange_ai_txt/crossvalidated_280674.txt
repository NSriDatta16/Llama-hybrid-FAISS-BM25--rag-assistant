Can I trust the R^2 from an OLS regression of two cointegrated series?

Suppose $x_t$ is a non-stationary time series and $v_t$ is white noise. $$x_t = \Sigma{v_t}$$ set.seed(123) x Also suppose $y_t$ is co-integrated with $x_t$. Where $x_t$ is integrated of order 1 and $\epsilon_t$ fulfills all the classic OLS assumptions. $$y_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_t + \epsilon_t$$ y Augmented Dickey-Fuller reveals that both $x_t$ and $y_t$ are non-stationary. tseries::adf.test(x) tseries::adf.test(y) However, I know that $x_t$ and $y_t$ are co-integrated, so I fit an OLS model. lm.mod.coint |t|) (Intercept) 24.65687 19.47269 1.266 0.208 x 5.02754 0.03189 157.636 A Phillipsâ€“Ouliaris Cointegration Test confirms that the model is indeed co-integrated. tseries::po.test(lm.mod.coint$model) I have several questions: Did I specify the functional form correctly for cointegration? $$y_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_t + \epsilon_t$$ Can I trust the $R^2$ value from the OLS output? The $R^2$ is very high. Can I trust the p-values from the OLS output? When I fit a model of first differences, the model fit looks horrible. Is this a result of overdifferencing ? df.coint
