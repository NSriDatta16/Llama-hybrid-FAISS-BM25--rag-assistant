Include intercept/error term in logistic regression model specification

Short question, When specifying a logistic regression model as below, does one also include B0? In other words, does the bottom part of the equation look like: A. 1 + exp(-(B1X1 + B2X2) B. 1 + exp(-(B0 + B1X1 + B2X2) And how about and error term?
