Should the output of regression models, like SVR, be normalized?

I have a regression problem which I solved using SVR . Accidentally, I normalized my output along with the inputs by removing the mean and dividing by standard deviation from each feature. Surprisingly, the Rsquare score increased by 10%. How can one explain the impact of output normalization for svm regression?
