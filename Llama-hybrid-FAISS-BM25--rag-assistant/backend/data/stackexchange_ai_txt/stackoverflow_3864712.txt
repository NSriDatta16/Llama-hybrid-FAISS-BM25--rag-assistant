Using reStructuredText to add some HTML with custom "id" and "class" attributes

Using rsStructuredText to generate HTML, I am trying to wrap a paragraph with an extra div element. The must contain an "id" attribute with a value I assign. Also, the must have a "class" attribute with "editable" value. This is what I have so far: .. raw:: html .. class:: editable paragraph content .. raw:: html This is the output: paragraph content I already have got the results I was looking for, although I don't like having raw HTML embedded . My question is whether is there any directive or other method in reStructuredText to achieve the same results unobtrusively ?
