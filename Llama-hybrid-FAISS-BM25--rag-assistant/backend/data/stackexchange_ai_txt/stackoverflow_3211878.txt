childWindow Full Screen Event tweak the Parent to also FullSCreen Mode

I have a ChildWindow which contains a ExpressionMediaPlayer inside it. When I click on the ChildWindow Media Player Full screen button it swiches the whole application to FullScreen Mode. Is there a way to avoid it. I am not quite sure if this scenario is going to fall under SL security restrictions. When I drag the ChildWindow(the position of ChildWindow changes) and click on the fullscreen now the ChildWindow also changes it's position. For example if I have dragged the ChildWindow 50px from Top and pressed the Full Screen button of of mediaPlayer (it contains) the Child Window also appears 50 pixels below the Screen Top. But I want My ChildWindow to be FullScreen without having any Gap from LEFT,TOP,RIGHT or below. Any help will be greatly appreciated. Thanks, Subhen
