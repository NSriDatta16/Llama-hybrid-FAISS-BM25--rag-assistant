randomForest in R - skip test

I am working with package randomForest in R for predicting a price in an hourly basis. For creating the model, after partitioning the dataframe, I use the following syntax: rf_regresor As the target variable to predict is a time series I would like for a specific purpose to train the model with all available data. Let's say I have the training data from "2017-01-01" to "2017-12-31" . I would like to use the whole period for predicting the first week of 2018, that is, from "2018-01-01" to "2018-01-07" before re-training the model with the latest inputs. Is it possible for the xtest , ytest part from the randomForest to be removed so I cna use the whole period? If not, would it be reassonable to use all the period but one day and use the last day to test (altough we would not care about the result for that specific day)? Thank you
