Poisson/Negative binomial can also be used with a binary outcome with offset equal to one. Of course it necessitates that the data be from a prospective design (cohort, rct, etc). Poisson or NB regression gives the more appropriate effect measure (IRR) versus odds ratio from logistic regression. NB regression is "safer" to run than Poisson regression because even if the overdispersion parameter (alpha in Stata) is not statistically significant, the results will be exactly the same as its Poisson regression form.
