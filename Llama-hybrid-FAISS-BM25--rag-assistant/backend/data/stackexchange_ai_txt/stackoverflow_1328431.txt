Do you mean directly into the BlackBerry address book? I'm almost positive that's impossible and would be a gigantic security risk if they did allow it (which only furthers my belief that it's impossible). Generate and link to a vcard instead. Then you just need a link like "Click Here to add to address book" and the BB Browser handles the rest.
