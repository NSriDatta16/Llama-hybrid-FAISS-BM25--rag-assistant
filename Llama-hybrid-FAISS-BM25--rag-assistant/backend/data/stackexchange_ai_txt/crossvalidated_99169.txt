Bayesian networks from a table

Could someone help me with question 5.b. I understand that the probability of any of these occuring independently is 0.5 but how do I combine those into a joint distribution function? Is $0.5 \cdot 0.5 \cdot 0.5 \cdot 0.5 = 0.0625$ correct? Edit: Is it more like this? $S =$ Spam, $D =$ Dear, $F =$ Free, $H =$ Hot $$ P(S, D, F, H) = P(S) \cdot P(D | S) \cdot P (F | S, D) \cdot P(H | S, D, F) $$ Therefore: or am I missing something?
