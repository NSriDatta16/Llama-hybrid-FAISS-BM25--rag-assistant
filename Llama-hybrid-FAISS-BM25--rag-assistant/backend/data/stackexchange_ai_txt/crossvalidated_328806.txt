Permutation of predictor in random forest

I have a simple question on how the permutation of a predictor is done in calculating importance of a predictor in Random Forest. As per my understanding, I have a OOB sample of size 100 and a predictor p1 which is allowed to take only 5 values (1,2,3,4,5). Then I have 100^5 possible permutations of p1? The process is repeated across all other predictors with the other predictors held constant and then averaged?
