How to properly parse XML with SAX?

I am receiving an XML document from a REST service which shall be parsed using SAX. Please see the following example which was generated out of the XSD. Setting up the parser is not a problem. My main problem is the actual processing in the startElement() , endElement() methods etc. I don't understand how to extract the items I need and store them as they are somewhat "nested". Example The ConnectionList can occur once or twice and may contain any number of Connection elements which -in turn- have details about a connection. Basically, I need a list of all connections with their Date , Transfers and Time . Do I have to create one class per element? As far as I got it I somehow need to do the following: If the parser comes across a... ConnectionList : Create new ConnectionList object and put it into a list of ConnectionList s Connection : Create a new Connection object and put it into a list of Connections Date , Transfers , Time (only if parent is Duration ): Store the node value in the current Connection object I'd really appreciate any help, hint, idea, snippet how I can achieve this. Thanks :-) Robert 0815 b3lcM_Yiyq7dqL9 dZbgZfDH8j1hb1i 00d00:18:00 W5a47DRkc7XDZjhwq_s5Un. GG56XN6zgiJF804mE_N4o t8mn634zjCZsRPyxj_e_-UYMH D0MiUwW9nuuM_uykvawg2C07pwHL
