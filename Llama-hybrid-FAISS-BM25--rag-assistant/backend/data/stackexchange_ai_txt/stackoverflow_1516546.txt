SELECT NAME, COUNT(ART) as num_exhibits, COUNT(DATE) as num_days FROM table GROUP BY NAME; This will give you a table of each name along with the total number of visits for that name and the total number of dates visited. To get an average exhibit per date you can do: SELECT NAME, COUNT(ART) as num_exhibits, COUNT(DATE) as num_days, (num_exhibits / num_days) as avg_exhibit_per_day FROM table GROUP BY NAME;
