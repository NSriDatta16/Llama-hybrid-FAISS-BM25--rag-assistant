GeoNomad, localStorage is more for variable data that will change over the course of an app's usage rather than initial load information. isn't domain level segregation enforced? Sure is, but there is a handy part of the manifest that lets you cross these borders when explicitly stated. NETWORK: # All URLs that start with the following lines # are whitelisted. http://example.com/examplepath/ http://www.example.org/otherexamplepath/ From Apple . As a direct answer to the question, to make information for multiple web apps available to each other just add the same info in each manifest (they won't reload unless it detects the data has changed.) "Multiple application caches in different application cache groups can contain the same resource, e.g. if the manifests all reference that resource." From WHATWG
