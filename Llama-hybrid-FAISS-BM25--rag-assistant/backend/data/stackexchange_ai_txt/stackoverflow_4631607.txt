If your flash otherwise runs fine in Firefox we can safely assume there is something wrong with either the HTML wrapper or the JavaScript code that attempts to call the function. Posting those pieces would help considerably. But, generally speaking, IE will use the tag and everyone else will use the tag. I think the best idea is to use jQuery to do the flash embedding and calling, here's simple HTML code I happen to use that works on IE, Firefox and Chrome: I have a utility function to access the flash object: function getGame() { if (window.document[gameName]) { return window.document[gameName]; } if (navigator.appName.indexOf('Microsoft Internet') == -1) { if (document.embeds && document.embeds[gameName]) { return document.embeds[gameName]; } else { return document.getElementById(gameName); } } } Yes, it requires the global variable gameName to be set to the name given to the flash object. In our case it would have to be "GAMENAME" to correspond to the HTML above. Did I mention this is not what I'd consider production code? Then the call the Flash object I use something like: getGame().test() The JavaScript here may not be entirely sensible or otherwise represent best practices, but it does point out the problem one has in finding the embedded flash object in the the presence of vs. and multiple browsers.
