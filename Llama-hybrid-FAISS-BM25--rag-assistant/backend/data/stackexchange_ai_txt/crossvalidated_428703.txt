Does hypothesis testing require each variant has a distribution with a fixed mean?

Attached is the graph of daily conversion rates from an actual online experimentation(A/B testing). Obviously we can see the conversion rates of both control and test variants are trending down . Can we still apply hypothesis testing(either Classic or Bayesian) on such case? Does hypothesis testing require each variant has a distribution with a fixed mean?
