svn: merge trunk with files that have no version control history

I am working on a version control-wise not terribly well-organized project. I have my own version of our program under version control (svn); my boss, however, does not use version control, thus there is no shared repository. He made several changes to his version of the program, and now he asked me to incorporate those changes into my version - doing it manually would be extremely cumbersome, so I thought perhaps I could save all his files as a branch of my work and let svn do the merging (I have never merged anything before, I don't actually know much about svn I'm afraid...). The trouble is that all svn seems to have done is copying the files my boss added to his version, but no changes seem to have been made to my copies of the source code files which he had changed in his version of the program. Well, here's what I did (following an online tutorial): I checked out a new working copy of my trunk and one of the newly created branch (that contains the files which I had just copied from my boss' directory). I thought perhaps this would be safer than just working with the working copy that I normally use, as I didn't really know what I was doing... I cd 'ed into my newly created trunk working copy; there I entered svn merge file:///home/user/svn/repository/branches/the_new_branch I got this output: --- Merging r8 through r27 into '.': C macro/forall.mcr A macro/upscale.mcr C macro/sbond.mcr ... Summary of conflicts: Tree conflicts: 429 Now I would like to know if/how I can get a summary of what exact changes have been performed (e.g. what lines of source code - if any - have been changed), and in case only files were added that had not been there before, how I can get svn to also examine the files' contents and perform merges on that level as well. In case anyone on here could help me out that would be great, so thanks a lot in advance! EDIT: I'm using Linux.
