I think you want to have: SET ANSI_WARNINGS ON; SET ARITHABORT ON; You can see more detail about this here: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/301292 When you move to SQL Server 2005+ you should use ALTER INDEX REBUILD/REORGANIZE as opposed to DBCC commands. Also, strongly suggest you check out SQLFool's and Ola's options, they can make your reindexing and rebuilding jobs much easier: http://sqlfool.com/2009/06/index-defrag-script-v30/ and http://ola.hallengren.com/ I don't remember if either of these will work on 2000 but worth checking out.
