Laying out graphics in RTF

I'm interested how to construct certain kinds of layout in RTF documents, ideally using techniques that do not depend only on the most recent RTF standards, and that are "native", i.e., they do not involve embedding other representations, like picture files. In particular: In Postscript and DVI, I can specify a coordinate at any time that the next text will be printed at: can this be done with RTF? Can RTF compose characters through overstriking? Can lines, outline boxes and filled boxes be drawn, with their geometry specified either absolutely, or relative to text?
