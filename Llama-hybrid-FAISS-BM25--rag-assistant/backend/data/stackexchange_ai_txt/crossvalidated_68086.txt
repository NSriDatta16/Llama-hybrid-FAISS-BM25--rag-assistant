How to conduct a multilevel (hierarchical) binary logistic regression (in SPSS, R, or other software)?

I have a model with occurrence of a disease represented by a binary dependent variable (DV) and 8 independent variables (IVs) at different levels. I need to create a multi-level model, in which the treatment is placed in the lower order and the demographics are in the higher order. However, I am not familiar with the multilevel model for logistic regression. Please give me some names of necessary multilevel analyses for doing a multilevel binary logistic regression (and any hints you think are useful). I wonder if GEE (generalized estimating equation) is the answer, because I have correlations between the IVs? What about "conditional (fixed-effects) binary logistic regression" again for the paired data among my IVs? Or else? ...
