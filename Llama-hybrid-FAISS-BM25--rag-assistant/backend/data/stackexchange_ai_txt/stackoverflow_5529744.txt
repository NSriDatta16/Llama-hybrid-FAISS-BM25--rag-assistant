User authenticated before enable dropping something

This is my first post here. I'm learning ASP.NET MVC3 and JQUERY together. For my learning, I created an interface like gmail where I have a treeview on the right of the page showing some labels to the user. On the rest of the page (right part), I have a table showing some tabular data. I manage drag'n drop of labels (tags if you prefer) from the treeview to a specific row in the table. Everything works but I need to be sure the user is authenticated before allowing him to perform a drag'n drop of a label on a row of the table. Below is my code: $(".droppable").droppable({ hoverClass: "hover-row", drop: function (event, ui) { if (' ' == "") { alert(Please connect!'); } ... ... I'm sure this is not the best way to proceed. Something with IsAuthenticated may be better? Can you help me? I would like to alert the user if he try to drop something on a row when he is not connected. Thank you for your help.
