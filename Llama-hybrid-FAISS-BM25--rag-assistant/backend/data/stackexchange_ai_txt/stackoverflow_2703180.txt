Here's how to do it: private Point _Offset = Point.Empty; protected override void MouseDown(object sender, MouseEventArgs e) { if (e.Button == MouseButtons.Left) { _Offset = new Point(e.X, e.Y); } } protected override void MouseMove(object sender, MouseEventArgs e) { if (_Offset != Point.Empty) { Point newlocation = this.Location; newlocation.X += e.X - _Offset.X; newlocation.Y += e.Y - _Offset.Y; this.Location = newlocation; } } protected override void MouseUp(object sender, MouseEventArgs e) { _Offset = Point.Empty; } _Offset is used here for two purposes: keeping track of where the mouse was on the control when you initially clicked it, and also keeping track of whether the mouse button is down or not (so that the control doesn't get dragged when the mouse cursor goes over it and the button isn't down). You definitely don't want to switch the if s in this code to while s, as it will make a difference.
