It does not say anything about the predictive ability of the model. It just says that the response varies differently as you advance in different direction in the predictor space. In means in some directions, the response seems to be non-continuous (thus the split), and in another direction it seems to have an S shaped smooth variation (the logistic function). The logistic and tree fits, might achieve the same goodness of fit. Going a step further- you might want to consider staying in the logistic regression framework but dealing with the non-continuous predictor by: - a semi parametric approach allowing a transformation of the split variable. - creating an indicator for the different regions of the split variable and allowing it to interact with the original variable.
