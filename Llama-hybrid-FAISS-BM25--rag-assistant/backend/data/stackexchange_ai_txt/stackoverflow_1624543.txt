You seem to have attached the attribute to the field; attributes always adhere to the next thing (in this case, the field). You should re-order so that they adhere to the property instead of the field. BTW; protected fields are rarely a good idea (they should be private); but especially if the property is public: what is the point? protected RegionEnum _Region; [Category("Custom Properties")] [DefaultValue(RegionEnum.None)] [WebPartStorage(Storage.Shared)] [FriendlyName("Region")] [Description("Select a value from the dropdown list.")] [Browsable(true)] public RegionEnum Region { get { return _Region; } set { _Region = value; } }
