How do I use LogParser to find out the LENGTH of a field in an IIS Log?

I'm trying to find LONG UserAgent strings with LogParser.exe in my IIS logs. This example searches for entries with the string 'poo' in them. LogParser.exe -i:IISW3C "SELECT COUNT(cs(User-Agent)) AS Client FROM *.log WHERE cs(User-Agent) LIKE '%poo%'" I'm trying to say "How many entries have a User-Agent that is longer than 'x'".
