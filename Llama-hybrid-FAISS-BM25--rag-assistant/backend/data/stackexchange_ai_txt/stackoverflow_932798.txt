You could of course output exactly 500 words per page, but the better way would be to put some kind of breaks into your article (end of sentence, end of paragraph). Put these at places where a break would be good. This way your pages won't have exactly X words in it each, but about or up to X and it won't tear sentences or paragraphs apart. Of course, when displaying the pages, don't display these break markers.
