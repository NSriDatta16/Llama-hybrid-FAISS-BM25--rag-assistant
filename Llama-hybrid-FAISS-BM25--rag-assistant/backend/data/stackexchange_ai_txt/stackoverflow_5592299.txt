Mixing SQL statements with SQLite .commands can be a bit tricky: $ sqlite3 test.db 'create table X(x integer); .dump' Error: near ".": syntax error The easiest and most universal way to deal with this is probably to provide all commands to the standard input of the SQLite3 command line shell, separated by newlines as you would type them: $ sqlite3 test.db CREATE TABLE TEST(X INTEGER); > .dump > EOF PRAGMA foreign_keys=OFF; BEGIN TRANSACTION; CREATE TABLE TEST(X INTEGER); COMMIT; Since here documents are not available in all shells, you could use an intermediate file to bypass this limitation: $ cat test.sql CREATE TABLE TEST(X INTEGER); .dump $ sqlite3 test.db
