How can I calculate Â± estimate based on sample set?

Say I have a completely random sample of 25M weights of a population of 100M. Say the average weight of the 25M random sample is 150lbs with a standard deviation of 45lbs. How can I be more precise in describing the average weight of the larger 100M population? In other words, help me make this sentence more precise: The average weight of this 100M population is 150lbs. This isn't entirely precise because I didn't measure all 100M. Please help me use more precise language to describe the results of this data.
