Have you searched for censored time series? Note that if the process is not observed for some reason, it is possible that the latent variable didn't cross a certain threshold to become observable. Hence, missing values indicate such a fact, and the likelihood estimation process can further benefit from such. Indeed, not taking into account truncated observations results in an estimation bias, Green's Econometric Analysis has a nice discussion on truncated distribution, however, not specifically on censored (truncated) time series. You may find it helpful. HTH
