Which ML Algorithms are affected by dummy variable trap?

My understanding is that regression models are affected by the dummy variable trap. What about other machine learning algorithms e.g. linear svm, logistic regression? Also, if an algorithm is not affected , is it bad practise to remove a dimension from the dummy variable encoding before training the model?
