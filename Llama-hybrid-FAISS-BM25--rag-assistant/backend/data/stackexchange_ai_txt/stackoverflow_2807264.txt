"Fail Early" means that the program should raise an exception and stop working if something goes wrong. (It is described in the Pragmatic Programmer's list of tips as Crash Early ) In my bioinformatics work, I tend to use a "Fail Early" approach because my highest concern is ensuring correctness. By contrast, Rails allows you to hide failures. For example, Rails' try allows you to call something on an object, and it won't raise an exception if that object is nil . I guess this is because with web sites, ensuring that the program keeps running is more important than correctness.
