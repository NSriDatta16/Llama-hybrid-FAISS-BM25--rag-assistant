John Valois' paper briefly describes an approach to implementing a binary search tree using auxilary nodes. I am using the auxilary node approach in my design of a concurrent LinkedHashMap. You can probably find many other papers on concurrent trees on CiteSeerX (an invaluable resource). I would stray away from using trees as a concurrent data collection unless truly necessary, as they tend to have poor concurrency characteristics due to rebalancing. Often more pragmatic approaches, like skip lists, work out better.
