create table Clothes( id int, primary key(id), name varchar(200), color varchar(200), brand varchar(200), price varchar(200), clothetypeid int, constraint `constr_Clothes_clothetypeid_fk` foreign key `clothetypeid_fk` (`clothetypeid`) references `ClotheType`(`id`) ) ENGINE=INNODB NB. id must be an indexed column in table ClotheType , and it must have the same type (i.e. int) ClotheType must also be ENGINE=INNODB . If you have already created it then you can change it using ALTER TABLE ClotheType ENGINE=INNODB To answer the question you posed in your comment on Ã“lafur's answer: MySQL handles foreign key constraints natively in as much as it parses the relevant data definition language statements, but some of its storage engines do not support them. The default storage engine in most MySQL installations is MyISAM, which does not support foreign keys. InnoDB does support them.
