How to create the XDocument instance for loading the XML file after deserializing the the object?

I am developing window phone 7 application. I am new to the window phone 7 application. I am referring to the following link for XML Serialization & Deserialization. http://www.codeproject.com/KB/windows-phone-7/wp7rssreader.aspx In the above link the LoadFromIso() function is used for XML Deserialization. I want to load the xml file after deserialization in the above link. In simple one case we can do this as in the following code. Similar to the following code I want "doc" in the above link. In the following code we can perform the various opeations on the XML file by using LINQ to XML with following statement doc = XDocument.Load(isfStream); The complete code is as follows IsolatedStorageFile isfData = IsolatedStorageFile.GetUserStoreForApplication(); XDocument doc = null; IsolatedStorageFileStream isfStream = null; if (isfData.FileExists(strXMLFile)) { isfStream = new IsolatedStorageFileStream(strXMLFile, FileMode.Open, isfData); doc = XDocument.Load(isfStream); isfStream.Close(); } In the similar way I want the instance of the XDocument after deserializing the object so that I can perform the various operations on the XML file by using LINQ to XML. Can you please provide me any code or link through which I can obtain the instance of the XDocument so that I can load the XML file & perform the various operation on the XML file by using the LINQ to XML ?
