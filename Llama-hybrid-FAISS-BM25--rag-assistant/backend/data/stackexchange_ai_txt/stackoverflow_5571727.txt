IDs and categories make a poor choice of actual inputs, because they are not continuous and there is little meaning in their relative magnitudes. What IDs may be good for is to create separate networks for different categories, but, given the large number of IDs and categories you've defined here, this means you have a very large number of separate networks, requiring a large pool of training data, since it will be heavily diluted. Binary categories (like gender) might work, but anything with more than one category will probably not yield good results. Be very careful with neural networks, as, given a big enough network, you can create something that appears to give predictions, but that is really meaningless outside the training set. Be sure you have a large validation set that does not take part in the training.
