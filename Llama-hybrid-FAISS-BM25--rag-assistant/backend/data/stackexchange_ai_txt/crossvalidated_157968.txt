Wilcoxon signed rank test for comparing classifiers

I am interested in comparing Classifier A with Classifier B. I have obtained Micro-Averaged F1 measures for Classifiers A and B that I intend to compare pairwise. I want to find out if Classifier A is better than B. I am a little unclear on how actually to conduct the Wilcoxon Signed Rank test. As far as my understanding goes, the null hypothesis is that there is no significant difference between the classifiers, and the alternate hypothesis is that there is. Is this correct? If this is indeed true, then how do I in fact show that A is better than B - because in this case even if I fail to reject the null hypothesis, all I have shown is that there's a significant difference in classifier performance, and not that A is better than B...
