Reserving space for variables with automatic storage duration means just decreasing the stack pointer, so as long as these aren't the only local variables, there's no overhead. What might hurt performance is that stack-allocated variables have to be addressed relative to stack or base pointer, so using static might slightly improve performance. As always, benchmark the code to make sure.
