The third point is on the perpendicular bisector of your base, and is altitude units away from the line. Calculate the midpoint of the base by averaging the x and y coordinates. Calculate the slope of your altitude: -dx/dy (perpendicular to dy/dx). You now have your line (point and slope). y - my = -dx/dy * (x - mx) Substitute your variables in the distance formula: d = sqrt(dx^2 + dy^2) d = sqrt((x - mx)^2 + (y - my)^2) d = sqrt((x - mx)^2 + (-dx/dy * (x - mx))^2) d^2 = (x - mx)^2 + (-dx/dy * (x - mx))^2 d^2 - (x - mx)^2 = (-dx/dy * (x - mx))^2 ±sqrt(d^2 - (x - mx)^2) = -dx/dy * (x - mx) ±sqrt(d^2 - (x - mx)^2) * dy/dx = x - mx ±sqrt(d^2 - (x - mx)^2) * dy/dx + mx = x x = ±sqrt(d^2 - (x - mx)^2) * dy/dx + mx Calculate the other variable (y here) using your line equation (from #2). You now have two points; pick whichever you want... In pseudocode: dx = x1 - x2 midpoint = ((x1 + x2) / 2, (y1 + y2) / 2) slope = -dx / (y1 - y2) x = sqrt(altitude*altitude - dx*dx) / slope + midpoint.x y = slope * (x - midpoint.x) + midpoint.y This is probably not the most optimal method. Not sure if it even works. xD
