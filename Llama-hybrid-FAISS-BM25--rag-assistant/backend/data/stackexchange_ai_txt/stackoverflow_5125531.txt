ApplicationContext and beans retrieval

I'm reading Spring documentation and I stumbled across a piece of text that made me ponder a bit. You use getBean() to retrieve instances of your beans. The ApplicationContext interface has a few other methods for retrieving beans, but ideally your application code should never use them. Indeed, your application code should have no calls to the getBean() method at all, and thus no dependency on Spring APIs at all. Well, I configured beans in my xml file. But I still need retrieve them when in need. How can I do that without getBean() method? The more detailed explanation, the better.
