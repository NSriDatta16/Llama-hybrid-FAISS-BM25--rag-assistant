C# - Deserialize a class with an internal constructor

I am working on a drag and drop system for my WPF App. The way it works is: I take the dragged Item Serialize it to xml When it gets dropped I deserialize it again. This worked fine in my test app. However, now that I am trying to do it in my real app, I have hit a snag. The class I am trying to deserialize (Microsoft.TeamFoundation.WorkItemTracking.Client.FieldDefinition) does not have a public constructor. When I try to deserialize it using this code: XmlReader reader = XmlReader.Create(new StringReader(xamlString)); object elt = XamlReader.Load(reader); I get this error: Cannot create object of type 'Microsoft.TeamFoundation.WorkItemTracking.Client.FieldDefinition'. CreateInstance failed, which can be caused by not having a public default constructor for 'Microsoft.TeamFoundation.WorkItemTracking.Client.FieldDefinition Am I toast? Is there any way to deserialize this class? Any other ideas on how to transfer this class via drag and drop? (I am using the FluidKit Drag and Drop Advisers.)
