How do you sample from a half-normal distribution in Python?

I would like to generate samples from a half normal distribution. numpy's random number generator allows you to sample from many distributions. Here's an example for the normal distribution. However, it does not appear to support half-normal. I could take the absolute value of the samples, but this seems inelegant. import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt samples = np.random.normal(0, 1, size=1000) plt.hist(samples) scipy contains a half-normal distribution (halfnorm), but I can't figure out if you are able to sample from this. from scipy.stats import halfnorm, norm
