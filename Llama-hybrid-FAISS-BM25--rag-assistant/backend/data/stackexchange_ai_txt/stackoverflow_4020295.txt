Any NULL in a parameter should match any value in the tables. Whenever you compare a parameter to a table field OR that comparison with a test for a null parameter: ( @f_name = f_name ) or ( @f_name is null ) then AND all those comparisons together to make up your retrieval. The comparison against the phone number when phone number is null will result in more that one row if they have more than one phone number so Select DISTINCT on p_id. What does Customer have to do with the query? You're not selecting on any field in that table and you don't appear to be returning any values from the procedure.
