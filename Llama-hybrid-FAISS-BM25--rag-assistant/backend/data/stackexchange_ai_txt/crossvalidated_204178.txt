First, consider the main effects and what significant two-way interactions mean. If drug and diet had a significant interaction it would mean that the average effect of diet differed by levels of drug... maybe at low drug levels the diet has a positive effect but at high drug levels, the diet has a negative effect. Thats a two-way interaction and thats why it doesn't make sense to interpret the main effects in the presence of an interaction (diet doesn't have an 'average' effect (main effect) at all, rather the effect depends on the the drug). Now consider the three-way interaction of diet x drug x biofeedback. You've just uncovered a two-way interaction between drug and diet; the presence of the 3-way interaction tells you that at different levels of biofeedback, the nature of the 2-way interaction is different. So maybe diet has a positive effect at low levels of drug but a negative effect at high levels (your 2-way interaction) but what if that's only true at low levels of biofeedback? Maybe this interaction effect is only true at low levels of biofeedback, while at high levels of biofeedback there's no difference between diet effects by drug. That would produce a 3-way interaction. So, since the 2-way interaction depends on the 3rd variable, it's not appropriate to talk about it as an interpret-able 2-way interaction.
