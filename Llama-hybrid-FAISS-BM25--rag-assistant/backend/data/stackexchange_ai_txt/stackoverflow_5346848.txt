This is happening even if I put a "#pragma GCC optimize 0" line in the source file, which is supposed to be the equivalent of a "g++ -O0" command line option. I don't believe this is true: it is supposed to be the equivalent of attaching __attribute__((optimize(0))) to subsequently defined functions, which causes those functions to be compiled with a different optimisation level. But this does not affect what goes on at the top level, whereas the command line option does. If you really must do horrible things that rely on top level ordering, try the -fno-toplevel-reorder option. And I suspect that it would be a good idea to add __attribute__((noinline)) to the functions in question as well.
