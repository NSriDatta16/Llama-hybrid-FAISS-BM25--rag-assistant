TortoiseSVN keeps stalling/hanging

I'm reorganising my repository by using TortoiseSVN to do move folders in my working copy, to avoid having to re-download the whole thing if I make the changes in the repo directly. However the "Moving..." popup seems to just stay around for ever in many cases, even when the dir being moved has few files. The files seem to be moved ok, except if I kill the process then I have to do SVN cleanup every time. I don't like killing processes working on my working copy, but I can't find what's wrong. My Tortoise is pretty recent; do I need to use Tortoise of exactly the same version as the SVN repo or anything weird like that? One of the main problems is even when it is doing something, the "Moving..." dialog doesn't indicate this. It's supposed to show current progress but is usually totally out of sync or never updates at all. EDIT: I don't think it can be a connection problem. The problems are all doing local SVN move operations... once I get those to work committing the changes to the remote server are just fine. Also, TortoiseSVN is killing my whole XP machine while it sits there. The hard-disk is thrashing and although Task-manager says my CPU usage is ~5%, other apps simply stop responding (such as Chrome)
