A cross-entropy loss explanation in simple words

Suppose I build a FNN model. The last layer is a classification layer with softmax activation. A cross-entropy loss is used to classify a problems, such as logistic regression. How would I calculate the cross entropy loss ? But I can not fully understand the cross-entropy loss Please any convenient explanation Thanks in advance
