Why does a finite, irreducible and aperiodic Markov chain with a doubly-stochastic matrix P have a uniform limiting distribution?

The theorem is "If a transition matrix for an irreducible Markov chain with a Ô¨Ånite state space S is doubly stochastic, its (unique) invariant measure is uniform over S." If a Markov Chain has a doubly-stochastic transition matrix, I read that its limiting probabilities make up the uniform distribution, but I do not quite understand why. I have been trying to come up with, and locate, an understandable proof for this. But the proofs I find all gloss over details I don't understand, like proposition 15.5 here (why does it work to just use the [1,...1] vectors?) Could someone point me to (or write) a more simple/detailed proof? (Though not part of anything I will hand in at school, it is part of a course I'm taking so I guess I'll tag it with homework in either case.)
