getElementsByTagName object required? Really stuck!

Trying to do a basic XML retrieval. The code works as expected in Firefox and Opera, meaning it alerts with the text value of the "title" node from the XML document. But in IE7, I am getting "object required" from this line. x=xhttp.responseXML.getElementsByTagName("title")[0].childNodes[0].nodeValue; alert(x); Btw, it was working fine with responseText (and a txt file). But I had to use ActiveX Object to get that working in IE...strange b/c I thought it supported the XMLHttprequest object. Maybe this has something to do with it? [edit] ok I replaced the line with this x=xhttp.responseXML.childNodes.length; alert(x); in FF there are 2 nodes, in IE there are 0. So obviously it can't read 0 childNodes. Has something to do with whitespace, I guess? What gives? [update] It is all related to my ignorance of how to use msxml.DOMDocument and Msxml.XMLHTTP ActiveXObjects. I am learning about these Objects at the following link: Program with DOM in JScript and will answer my question in a few days...
