You could use reflector to check out out, but, in all honesty, whatever performance penalty there might be for something like this would fall squarely under the heading of "Premature optimization" . From a syntactic perspective, the {Return "a value"} syntax tends to encourage multiple exit points from the method, which is often seen as a bad practice. But if the method is small, then I don't see that code readability would suffer from it. OTOH, the {var = value; Return Var} syntax tends to promote a single exit point at the end of the function.
