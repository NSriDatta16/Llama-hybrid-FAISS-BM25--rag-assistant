The RBF kernel doesn't necessarily perform better. That only applies after you've optimized all hyperparameters and even then the difference is often only marginal. That said, for low-dimensional problems like yours, the RBF kernel is likely to yield better models. A few points: You have to optimize hyperparameters when using SVM, which is $C$ (and $\gamma$ if you use the RBF kernel). How did you optimize them? I recommend having a look at Optunity for this task. You should standardize all features to a given interval, e.g. $[0,1]$, to make sure distances are not biased towards features on a large scale compared to others.
