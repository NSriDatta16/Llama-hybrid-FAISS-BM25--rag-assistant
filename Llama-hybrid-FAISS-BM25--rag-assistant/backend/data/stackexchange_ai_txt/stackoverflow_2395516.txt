What's happening is that your app is parsing RSS data and storing whatever is parsed into Core Data storage. However, your views aren't updated when Core Data is updated. It's similar to loading a web page and then having something else change the HTML for the page without having the browser reload; that's what's happening with your UITableView. It seems like what you need is to refresh the data source for the UITableView when the parser reaches the end of the RSS feed.
