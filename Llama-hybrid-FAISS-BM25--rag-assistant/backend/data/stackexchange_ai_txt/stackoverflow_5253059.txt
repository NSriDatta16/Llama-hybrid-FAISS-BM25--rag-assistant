Environment.getDataDirectory() does not return a path where you can place files. You should use one of these methods instead: Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory() gives you a path to external storage (SD card). getFilesDir() from an Activity or other Context. Gives a path to app's internal file storage You can also call openFileOutput() with a string file name (no path, just the file), which will open the FileOutputStream and create the file all in one shot for your use. Hope that Helps!
