If you're sure that the data you're getting as a string is actually an integer, you can cast it to an int. i.e. data = int(img.imageData) http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#int This probably isn't the right way to achieve your goals however. Have you looked at the built-in library function examples? http://opencv.willowgarage.com/documentation/python/operations_on_arrays.html
