Which test for autocorrelation in a time series

I need your help to test autocorrelation between residuals of a time series. But I don't know which test use: Breusch Godfrey test, ARCH test or Durbinâ€“Watson test.. I don't understand the difference between those tests. Anyone has a suggestion? And my other question is: I already know there are heteroscedasticity and if there are autocorrelation too, how can I estimate my coefficients? Which method can I use? Thank you in advance! Greg
