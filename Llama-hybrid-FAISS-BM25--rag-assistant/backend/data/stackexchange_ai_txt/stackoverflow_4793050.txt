Working with MySQL in C#

Here's my code to print the data to the terminal: public static void WriteData() { string connString = "SERVER=localhost;" + "DATABASE=db;" + "UID=user;" + "PASSWORD=pass;"; MySqlConnection connection = new MySqlConnection(connString); MySqlCommand command = connection.CreateCommand(); MySqlDataReader reader; command.CommandText = "SELECT * FROM table1"; connection.Open(); reader = command.ExecuteReader(); while (reader.Read()) { for (int i = 0; i Now I'd like to view the results in a DataGridView . All the tutorials I've found involve adding external data sources to the grid, which I have no idea how to do in MySQL. (Also please note that I have no experience in developing Windows Forms, but I guess that most GUI development is drag-and-drop anyway).
