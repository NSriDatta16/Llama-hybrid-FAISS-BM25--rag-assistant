If you don't mind training the model, you need to change the input layer of the model to be 28x28x1 and the first convolution layers num_input_channels to be 1 instead of 3. Also, you will need to remove the 3rd and 4th pooling layers if there are and the shape of the upper reshaping layer where you connect to a final fully connected neural network.
