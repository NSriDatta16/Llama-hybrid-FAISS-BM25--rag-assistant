How do I order or rank a set of experts?

I have a database containing a large number of experts in a field. For each of those experts i have a variety of attributes/data points like: number of years of experience. licenses num of reviews textual content of those reviews The 5 star rating on each of those reviews, for a number of factors like speed, quality etc. awards, assosciations, conferences etc. I want to provide a rating to these experts say out of 10 based on their importance. Some of the data points might be missing for some of the experts. Now my question is how do i come up with such an algorithm? Can anyone point me to some relevent literature? Also i am concerned that as with all rating/reviews the numbers might bunch up near some some values. For example most of them might end up getting an 8 or a 5. Is there a way to highlight litle differences into a larger difference in the score for only some of the attributes. Some other discussions that i figured might be relevant: Bayesian rating system with multiple categories for each rating How would YOU compute IMDB movie rating? Eliciting priors from experts What are some of the best ranking algorithms with inputs as up and down votes?
