A good place to start is Gelman and Hill's Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models. It addresses a wide range of regression models, including hierarchical models. Gelman et al cover hierarchical models from a Bayesian perspective in Bayesian Data Analysis (3rd ed.), but this might be best read second, since it assumes a high level of familiarity with frequentist methods.
