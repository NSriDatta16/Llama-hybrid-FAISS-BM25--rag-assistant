Is there a particular reason why you want to upsample? Upsampling won't give you better audio, any more than recording a cell phone conversation onto a CD will give you "CD-Quality" audio. If you really do want to upsample, then as Lasse mentioned, don't just insert zeros. You need to interpolate out what the samples would have been by, as Wikipedia points out, upsampling to 3528000 Hz and then downsampling back to 11025 Hz. For the upsampling, one way to do it is by using a line algorithm between each point. Let's say the first three samples in the 8 kHz recording are: [15, 25, 33]. To upsample those three samples to 3528000 Hz, you'll need to output (441 * 3 = 1323) samples. The 220th sample should be 15, the 661st should be 25, and the 1102nd sample should be 33. Draw a straight line between the points and you'll get a decent upsample. Once you do that, you need to sample your 1323 samples down to about 4 samples. The first one should be the average of samples 160-480, the second the average of 481-800, the third the average of 801-1160, and the fourth the average of 1161-1480. Of course, you're missing samples 1324-1480, which you could have generated with sample #4 in the original data. That should at least get you close. But before you do that, ask yourself if you really need to upsample. Unless you're using some weird software that only takes certain formats, you're better off just giving it the data you have.
