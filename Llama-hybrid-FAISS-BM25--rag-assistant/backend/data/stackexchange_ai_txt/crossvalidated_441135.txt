Number of events in a segment if waiting times are drawn from a mixture of two exponential distributions

What is the probability for $n$ events to occur over a period of time $t$ , if the duration of each event is a random variable distributed as a mixture of two exponential distributions, one with the average duration $\tau_1$ and the probability $p$ and the other with average duration $\tau_2$ and the probability of $(1-p)$ ? For example, we have a doctor who has both healthy patients and sick patients waiting in line, with the relative fractions of 80% and 20%. Healthy patients take on average 5 minutes per visit, sick ones take one hour, with the actual durations distributed exponentially. How many times would the doctor's door open during a period of half an hour?
