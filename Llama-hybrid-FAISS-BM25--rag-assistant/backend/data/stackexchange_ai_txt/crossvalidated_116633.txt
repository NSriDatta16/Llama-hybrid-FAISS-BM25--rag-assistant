You can do this, but you need to account for it when applying the survey weights. My understanding is that if you are only combining years in order to increase sample size (i.e. you are not looking at year effects), then you need to revise the weights, most simply by dividing them by the number of years you are combining. In your case, you would divide by 3. The population you are now generalizing to is the average population over those three years.
