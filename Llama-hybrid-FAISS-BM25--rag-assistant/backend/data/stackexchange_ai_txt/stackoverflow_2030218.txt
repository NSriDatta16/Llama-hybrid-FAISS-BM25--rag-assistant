Just looking over your program, I found 3 spots that could be improved or fixed. I apologize if my code doesn't format well. :-( In your function parse_block(...), there are 3 items that need attention. @attribs = $attribs =~ /\s*(\w+\s+=\s+\w+\s+|\w+\s+=\s+".*?"|\w+\s+=\s+ )\s*/g; To eliminate the white space after vid => '6 ', just don't include the \s+ at the end of your first sub-regex. Write it as: @attribs = $attribs =~ /\s*(\w+\s+=\s+\w+|\w+\s+=\s+".*?"|\w+\s+=\s+ )\s*/g; $value = [ parse_type_value_specifier( $start_tail ) ]; You want this instead: $value = [ parse_type_value_specifier( $value ) ]; (Note that the parameter to the function should be $value and not $start_tail.) You probably didn't notice this. In the loop for @attributes, the 'else' in the if/else condition excutes when the 'value' has a plain value, (no "" or items in 'value'). Update: Changed parameter in parse_type_value_specifier(...) to $value. It was (incorrectly) stated as $attrib.
