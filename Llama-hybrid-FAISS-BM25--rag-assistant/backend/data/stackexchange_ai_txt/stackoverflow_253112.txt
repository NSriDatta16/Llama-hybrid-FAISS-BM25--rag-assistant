I've just started on a Silverlight project that uses Isolated Storage to store a login token that formerly was stored in a cookie when the app was written in ASP.NET. The only thing I noticed with the end result was that each type of browser would remember the same user (as opposed to the cookie solution where every browser had it's own cookie store and it's own idea of who was logged in). Security is not going to be substantially different - if you feel inclined to - encrypt the token. Though really why would you bother? If any process has access to a person's private AppData they're going to have access to all sorts of confidential information. The app's url determines access, so no one can get at the data unless your domain name expires.
