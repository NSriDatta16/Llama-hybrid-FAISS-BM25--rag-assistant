This sounds to me like problem where a canonical correlation study might help. In canonical correlation, we are given a random vector W that is partitioned into two sub-random vectors X and Y; and the issue is to find linear combinations of the two subvectors that have maximal correlation and are orthogonal to one another. The end result is the discovery of correlates that will point to relationships that have some physical meaning. If you are comfortable with matrices, then Google Wolfgang Hardle and Leopold Simar's online book and read Chapter 14 on Canonical Correlation. If you use R, then read Chapter 10 of Paul Hewson's online book "Multivariate Statistics with R".
