I don't have a MySQL installation, and pas.plugins.sqlalchemy works fine on postgresql for me, but it would seem that the authors have made an assumption about varchars. Assuming it's not something that SQLAlchemy should be handling itself (it would be really nice if the MySQL dialect for SQLalchemy would select an appropriate maximum size for unbounded varchars), I'll see if I can commit a fix this evening. A quick glance at the code shows that all "String" (treated as varchar by the database) fields have maximum lengths except Login , name and password in the User table and name in the Group table, and there's no good reason why these should be different. Update : Check out https://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/PASPlugins/pas.plugins.sqlalchemy/branches/auspex from subversion. It's my version of pas.plugins.sqlalchemy with support for the IGroupCapability interface (lets users be added to and removed from groups that are also stored in the rdb), and I've also added lengths to all unbounded String fields. If you don't know how to use subversion checkouts in buildout, see: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/mr.developer/
