Linking error when calling a function that takes a vector of objects as it's argument

I have a function that takes a vector of objects as it's argument. the function header is: void Evolve(vector &population) the code compiles properly as long as I don't try to actually call the function. I call it like this: vector AgentPopulation; for(int q=0; q when I try to call it, I get the error: "Evolve(__gnu_debug_def::vector >)", referenced from: main in main.o ld: symbol(s) not found collect2: ld returned 1 exit status I can eliminate the error by changing the argument to an int instead of a vector of C_Agent. I have tried commenting out the function body but that doesn't help.
