Creating custom class for every Stored Procedure using linq to SQL?

I'm using stored procedure in LINQ, i know it will generate a class T(procedure name + "Result") for me automatically to store the data. If the name of stored procedure is spCampus, the generated class will be spCampusResult. My Question: when i'm using SP should i create custom class that replicate all the properties ( i'm refering to whatever the .dbml creates when you drag and drop the SP) in my situation i will be using SP... is that fair to say i will be treating as a class object and pass around from model to controller and to view ? or i will be better off creating a new custom business object contining all the props from .dbml ? i havent get any clear cut answer anybody?
