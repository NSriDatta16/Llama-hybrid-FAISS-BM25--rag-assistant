I am assuming you are trying to do classification task using LSTM and your validation accuracy is not increasing. Your model is learning your training data only & making adjustment in the model weights according to it. This is called overfitting in machine learning. So the question is why overfitting happens one of the reason is the limited amount of data is exposed to the model. I think this is the reason you model is not learning i.e. the limited amount of data.
