In Symfony, sharing data across subdomains

I have a site on which I am doing credit card transactions. The issue is this: if user goes to: http://mysite.com and then logic redirects user to https://www.mysite.com , I loose my session data. As the title suggests, I am using Symfony, version 1.2 Now looking in my apps/site/config/factories.yml file, I added the below, but it didn;t work. Any ideas? all: routing: class: sfPatternRouting param: generate_shortest_url: true extra_parameters_as_query_string: true storage: class: sfSessionStorage param: session_cookie_domain: .mysite.com
