How to access a secured Nexus with sbt?

I'm trying to access a Nexus repository manager which requires some basic authentication. Everything works fine from Maven2 but when I try to configure things in SBT it can't find the artifacts. It is using a custom repository pattern (see this related question ) but I don't think that should matter. In any case the relevant configuration is here. Project.scala: val snapshotsName = "Repository Snapshots" val snapshotsUrl = new java.net.URL("http://nexusHostIp:8081/nexus/content/repositories/snapshots") val snapshotsPattern = "[organisation]/[module]/[revision]-SNAPSHOT/[artifact]-[revision](-[timestamp]).[ext]" val snapshots = Resolver.url(snapshotsName, snapshotsUrl)(Patterns(snapshotsPattern)) Credentials(Path.userHome / ".ivy2" / ".credentials", log) val dep = "group" % "artifact" % "0.0.1" extra("timestamp" -> "20101202.195418-3") ~/.ivy2/.credentials: realm=Snapshots Nexus host=nexusHostIp:8081 user=nexususername password=nexuspassword According to a similar discussion in the SBT user group this should work fine but I am getting the following when I try to build. ==== Repository Snapshots: tried [warn] -- artifact group#artifact;0.0.1!artifact.jar: [warn] http://nexusHostIp:8081/nexus/content/repositories/snapshots/group/artifact/0.0.1-SNAPSHOT/artifact-0.0.1-20101202.195418-3.jar I'm fairly certain this is a credentials problem and not something else because I can hit the URL it says it is trying directly and download the jar (after authenticating). I have also tried declaring the credentials inline (even though it is less than ideal) like so: Credentials.add("Repository Snapshots", "nexusHostIp", "nexususername", "nexuspassword")
