Should I consider it white noise?

I have an hourly time series that I want to forecast. Prior to modelling it, I tested it for random walk. The ACF and PACF plots for the time series are as follows: Since the PACF has a high value at lag 1 and ACF is decreasing linearly, I wanted to check its 1st differentiation for white noise to figure out if its a random walk or not. The plots for the differentiated time series and its ACF, PACF are below. As the 1st differentiation plot has 0 mean, constant variance and the ACF values are barely above the confidence interval at lags above 0, can I conclude it the series to be a Random Walk?
