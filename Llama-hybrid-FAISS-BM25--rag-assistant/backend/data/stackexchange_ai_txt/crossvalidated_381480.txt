the better our model in detection of anomaly VAE is a generative model, not a discriminative one, so I'm not sure what you mean here. More generally, higher mean ELBO over the test dataset doesn't mean that you have a better model of the test dataset. If you train a VAE to model the standard gaussian, and then test it on a dataset with just 0's, the model is going to assign higher mean ELBO rather than if you'd tested with a standard gaussian dataset.
