Ok Guys after discovering this part of the code was the problem: using (BinaryReader r = new BinaryReader(ImageFile.InputStream)) { byte buffer = r.ReadByte(); fileclass = buffer.ToString(); buffer = r.ReadByte(); fileclass += buffer.ToString(); r.Close(); } I changed it to this: string fileclass = ImageFile.ContentType.ToString(); And altered my switch statement to: switch (fileclass) { case "image/jpg": case "image/jpeg": case "image/png": case "image/gif": try I also implemented the suggestions from Robert. However I am unsure being new to .NET whether this method of checking the file type is as accurate as the previous? My research seems to suggest the previous could discover the file type even if the up loader had changed the extension e.g. renaming example.exe to example.jpg. I am unsure as to whether using the provided .NET functionality the same is still achieved?
