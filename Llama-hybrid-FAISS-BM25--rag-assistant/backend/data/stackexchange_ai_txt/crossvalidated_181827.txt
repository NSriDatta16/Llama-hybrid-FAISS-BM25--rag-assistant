How to calculate logistic regression prediction based on Gaussian distribution

How can I write a prediction formula if I can't use the glm's predict function ? If I have a model that uses the family=binomial(link="logic") I would write the model like this: model_1 Then I would run the model summary, get the coefficients, including the intercept, and create the prediction formula:for example: intercept = 0.78, var1 coeff is 0.28 and var2 coeff is 0.5 train$glm_pred1 But how can I create a prediction function when my model is based on Gaussian like in this model: model_2 The summary of the model indicates that the intercept is 0.66, var1 coeff is 0.3 and var2 coeff is 0.8?
