Not necessary the most pythonic way to achieve the same thing as your code, but this version of your code is somewhat more concise due to the use of generator expressions: from itertools import izip for row in data: dict_a = dict((col_name, val) for col_name, val in izip(headers, row) \ if col_name in group_a) dict_b = dict((col_name, val) for col_name, val in izip(headers, row) \ if col_name in group_b) list_a.append(dict_a) list_b.append(dict_b) Also, use sets for group_a and group_b instead of lists - the in operator works faster on sets. But Jason Humber is right, DictReader is way more elegant, see the following version: from csv import DictReader for row in DictReader(your_file, headers): dict_a = dict((k, row[k]) for k in group_a) dict_b = dict((k, row[k]) for k in group_b) list_a.append(dict_a) list_b.append(dict_b)
