How can I partition (split up, divide) a list based on a condition?

I have some code like: good = [x for x in mylist if x in goodvals] bad = [x for x in mylist if x not in goodvals] The goal is to split up the contents of mylist into two other lists, based on whether or not they meet a condition. How can I do this more elegantly? Can I avoid doing two separate iterations over mylist ? Can I improve performance by doing so?
