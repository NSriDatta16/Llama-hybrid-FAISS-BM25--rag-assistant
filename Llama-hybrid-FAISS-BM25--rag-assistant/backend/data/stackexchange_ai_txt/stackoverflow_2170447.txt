CSS Alternative To This CSS-jQuery Code?

I have two columns side by side that are different colors. The background has a unique color as well. The right column contains text that will expand to an unknown height. The other column contains little to nothing. Only one small paragraph here Many large paragraphs inside here. I would like the left column to be the exact height as the right column. Here's the CSS... #leftColumn { display:inline-block; width: 200px; } #rightColumn { display:inline-block; width: 600px; vertical-align: top; } So when the page loads I use jQuery to set the height of the left column based on the height of the right column. $(document).ready(function() { $('#leftColumn').css('height', $('#rightColumn').innerHeight()); }); Is there a way to do this with only CSS?
