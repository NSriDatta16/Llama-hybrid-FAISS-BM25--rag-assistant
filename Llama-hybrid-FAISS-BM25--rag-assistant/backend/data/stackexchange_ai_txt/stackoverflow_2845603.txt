Import/Export HTML5 localStorage data

I'm working on a simple TODO list app based on localStorage HTML5 feature: http://hamen.github.com/webnotes/ I'm wondering if it's possible to import/export data in some way. How could I provide an "Export note/Import note" feature to make users being able to save their note on their HD and import them in another browser profile? Thanks
