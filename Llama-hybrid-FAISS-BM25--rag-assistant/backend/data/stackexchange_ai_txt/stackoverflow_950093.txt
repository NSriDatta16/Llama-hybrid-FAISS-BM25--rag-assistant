Routing problem

I'm trying to create a user managment system where users can be dragged and dropped along different groups (copy and move users). I use drop_receiving_element "move_drop_zone_1", :update => "users", :url => move_user_path(:target_node_id => node.id), :method => :put, :accept => "move_user", :hoverclass => "node-active" to define a dropzone. I have a problem with the path. Above code results in move_user_url failed to generate from {:action=>"move", :controller=>"users", :target_node_id=>2}, expected: {:action=>"move", :controller=>"users"}, diff: {:target_node_id=>2} In my routes i defined map.resources :users, :member => { :move => :put, :copy => :put } Apparently Rails is not expecting the target_node_id but how can I include this? thanks Stijn
