I would start with the square root of the mean of the squared errors (ie, RMS error), though the mean of the absolute values would not be too different. The average of the errors would tell you about bias , which is also interesting. If you care more about errors in one direction than the other, than you'd want some bias (toward the direction that is of less concern).
