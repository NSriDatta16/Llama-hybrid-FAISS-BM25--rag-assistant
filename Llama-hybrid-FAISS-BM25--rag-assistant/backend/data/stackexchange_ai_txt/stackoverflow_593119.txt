My wish list (for SQLServer) Ability to store/use multiple execution plans for a stored procedure concurrently and have the system automatically understand the best stored plan to use at each execution. Currently theres one plan - if it is no longer optimal its used anyway or a brand new one is computed in its place. Native UTF-8 storage Database mirroring with more than one standby server and the ability to use a recovery model approaching 'simple' provided of course all servers are up and the transaction commits everywhere. PCRE in replace functions Some clever way of reusing fragments of large sql queries, stored match conditions, select conditions...etc. Similiar to functions but actually implemented more like preprocessor macros.
