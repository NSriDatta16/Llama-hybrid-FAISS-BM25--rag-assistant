What does this code do?

Moaning about the lack of a dislike button is all the rage on Facebook at the moment and various groups have sprung up offering a dislike button, but only after you've invited x amount of your friends. One of the more (possibly devious?) groups requires you to run Javascript as part of the joining process. I haven't ever done web coding so I'm wondering if someone can tell me what the following code does? javascript:elms=document.getElementById('friends').getElementsByTagName('li'); for(var fid in elms){ if(typeof elms[fid] === 'object'){ fs.click(elms[fid]); } } The link to the group is here: |►OFFICIAL Dislike Button™ is Finally Here◄| Add it Now, it ACTUALLY WORKS! . The code is listed under the 3 steps in the recent news section.
