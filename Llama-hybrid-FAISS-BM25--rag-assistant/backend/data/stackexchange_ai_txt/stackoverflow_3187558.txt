I don't know whether this will help, but here's how I would go for it. Build your parameters, and store them into a paramter data table that would be used to get the parameters from, from your web browser's page; Launch your browser and pass some parameters values, either an Id or something that could be used to identify your full parameters to query for against the underlying database; From your webpage opened in your browser, collect the value to use to query against the parameter table, and query it; Retrieve the parameters and perform the desired work for your Session. EDIT #1 If this is an XML representation, just save this XML representation into an XML file and place it into a shared disk storage so that you may open the file and read it from your web application. Perhaps Serialization could be useful here. Hope this helps! =)
