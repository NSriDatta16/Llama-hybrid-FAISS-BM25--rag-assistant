Monitoring the app's memory use with PerfMon or Task Manager is not a valid way of checking for memory leaks. For example, your runtime may just be holding on to extra memory from the OS for pre-allocation purposes or due to fragmentation. The trick, in my experience, is the CRT debug heap. You can request information about all live objects, and the CRT provides functions to compare snapshots. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/wc28wkas.aspx
