I appreciate your reply. I’m interested to know if the following explanation helps. This paradox is an example of the problems that occur when infinity is subtly introduced into a problem. It also exemplifies the difficulties that may occur when defining an “event” for statistical purposes. Since both twice and half of any number exist, it is tempting to think that both twice and half of any amount drawn in any game also can, on average, exist in that game, or in some combination of games. But both twice and half of every possible amount drawn never exist for every amount in any game or any finite combination of games because in any finite number of games, a highest amount will exist, and twice that amount won’t exist. Only a game with an infinite number of paired envelopes, or an infinite number of games, can have both half and double of every amount in that (those) game(s) . Either not realizing that only an infinite set satisfies the logic or the difficulty conceptualizing infinite sets leads to the faulty logic that results in the paradox. In the 2-envelope problem, any particular game can be won, lost, or tied using the “trade every time” strategy. A successful strategy doesn’t assure a win every time a particular game is played, it assures a win on average. But, what is being averaged? A successful strategy must assure a win, on average, in any particular game that is played repeatedly. In the 2-envelope problem, every envelope with amount X can be paired with another envelope that contains either 2X or .5X. The paired envelope might contain 2X in one game, and the paired envelope might contain .5X in a different game, but both of the paired 2X and .5X envelopes typically won’t appear in the same game . If I choose an envelope containing X and I average the outcome of trading for 2X with the outcome of trading for .5X, I’m (typically) averaging the results from two different games. This does not help determine whether or not the strategy employed is effective in either game. Instead, what must be averaged is what happens when the same game is played multiple times -- that is, when the same n pairs of envelopes are presented multiple times. In that case, it’s easy to see that, in any particular game, each envelope will be selected the same number of times on average. (It’s also easy to see that, for the envelopes in that particular game, some envelope will contain the largest amount that cannot be doubled by being traded.) If each envelope is traded every time, the loss will equal the gain in each pair of envelopes on average. Therefore, trading every time will not increase the odds of winning in any game. Typical mathematical approaches that average the outcomes of 2X and .5X are attempting to determine the effect of the strategy on the outcome of an infinite number of games simultaneously. That’s because 2X and .5X define different games, and the 2X and .5X amounts needed for those different games will be in yet other games, and so on. Introducing infinity in this way into the statistics calculations leads to difficulties. For statistical purposes, a single, repeatable trial is defined by two filled envelopes being presented to a player and her picking one of them. A single, repeatable trial is not defined by filling the second envelope randomly. A trial with envelopes containing 20D and 10D is different from a trial with envelopes containing 20D and 40D. And yet the logic that leads to the paradox mistakenly considers both of these trials simultaneously. That leads to problems. When repeating a trial, only 2 amounts appear. What changes in each repetition is the amount that is chosen. By contrast, here’s a game for which the incorrect 2-envelope logic applies correctly. Suppose I start with an envelope that contains some random amount. I toss a coin and fill the other envelope with twice the starting amount when the coin reads heads and half the starting amount when the coin reads tails. In this game, the trial starts when I have the starting amount in hand, before the other envelope is filled. In this game, I will be able to choose twice the amount half the time and half the amount half the time. I can then correctly average the amount won or lost over multiple repetitions and determine that trading every time is better than never trading. In this game, when repeating a trial, 3 amounts appear. What changes in each repetition is the amount in the other envelope . When calculating odds for a card game, the player’s hand remains constant and the opposing hands change. When the 2-envelope game is played, the envelope amounts stay the same and the chosen envelope changes. The amount drawn is not what stays the same, so calculating the odds of winning that game based on choosing the same amount repeatedly won’t work. One way to counter the faulty logic of generalizing the possible results (double or half the amount traded) of trading any particular amount is to find language that ties those proposed results of trading to an actual game . The fact that those 2 results are (typically) in different games – and therefore cannot be used to determine the outcome of any particular game -- must become more apparent in order break the seemingly irrefutable logic that leads to the paradox. The following paragraph contains my attempt to use such language. I say, “I see 20D. I should always trade because half the time the other envelope will contain 10D and the other half of the time the other envelope will contain 40D.” She says, “While both of those amounts general can exist, they may not exist in this game . If 20D is the highest amount in the game you’re playing, you’ll always lose when trading it.” I say, “True, but in the next game, the 40D envelope might exist, so between the 2 games, I’ll still win on average when always trading 20D envelope. I’ll just average those 2 games together to calculate my odds.” She says, “That’s true for the 20D amount, but in that next game , that 40D envelope might be the highest amount. An 80D envelope might not exist in that next game. When you play that 2nd game, you’ll eventually draw the 40D envelope. When you do, you’ll always lose when you trade it. That means that you’ll lose in the second game more than you can win in the first game by trading the 20D envelope. So, if you average those 2 games together, you still won’t win overall by trading every time.” I say, “That’s true, too, but the 3rd game I play might have the 80D envelope, so I’ll still win money when trading the 40D envelope if I average the 3 games together.” She says, “That’s true for the 40D envelope, but the 80D envelope in the 3rd game might be the biggest amount in that game. You’ll eventually draw it, and when you do, you’ll always lose when you trade it. In fact, you can add as many games as you desire, but no matter how many games you add, another game will still be necessary for the logic to be true. You can’t play an infinite number of games, although you will need to for your logic to work. That’s why your logic doesn’t work.”
