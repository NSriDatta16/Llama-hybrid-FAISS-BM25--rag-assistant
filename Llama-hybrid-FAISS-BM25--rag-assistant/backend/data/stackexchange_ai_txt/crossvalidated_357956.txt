First of all, the vectors represent the variables (with direction and magnitude as any vector would) and the points represent your observations. It means that only 2 variables contribute to the second PC (POL and MOW) and that they are almost orthogonal (uncorrelated) to all the other variables. And all the the other variables are mostly associated with the first PC (i.e, they are correlated). It would also seem that you cannot dissociate the male and female categories in your that PC space. I don't know about the scale of the variables but it's a good idea to whiten your data and then perform PCA again.
