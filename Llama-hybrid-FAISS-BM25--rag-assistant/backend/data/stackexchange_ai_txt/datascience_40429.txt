How to save a Numpy array output of an autoencoder as an image

I have a 256*256*3 numpy array "SP" out of an autoencoder decoder layer which I want to save and open as an .jpg image. I used something like the following python code snippets: img = Image.fromarray(SP, 'RGB') img.save('my.jpg') img.show() However I have noticed the array "img" is 256*256 in dimension and the image is just a noise. What can be the right way to display the image? I have attached the array as a output.npy file: ---> https://ufile.io/410iu
