An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with an arbitrary number of inputs and outputs

I would like to use ANNs for my problem, but the issue is my inputs and outputs node numbers are not fixed. I did some google searches before asking my question and found that the RNN may help me with my problem. But, all examples which I've found somehow have a defined number of input and output nodes. So, I'm looking for a strategy, how to make it real or at least some examples, preferable in Keras or PyTorch. More details about my issue: I have two inputs lists, where the length of the first one is fixed and equals two, e.g.: in_1 = [2,2] but the length of the second list is flexible, the length can be from three to inf, e.g.: in_2 = [1,1,2,2] or in_2 = [1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,3] Also, input lists depend on each other. The first list shows the dimension of the output list. So if in_1 = [2,2], means the output must have a possibility to be reshaped to [2,2] form. Currently, I'm thinking to combine two input list into one: in = in_1 + in_2 = [2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2] Moreover, the output has the same length as the in_2 list, e.g.: if input lists are: in_1 = [2, 2] in_2 = [1, 1, 2, 2] Output should be: out = [1, 2, 1, 2] Any ideas are welcome!
