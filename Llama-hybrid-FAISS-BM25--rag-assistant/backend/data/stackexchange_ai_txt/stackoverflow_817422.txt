The Application is a singleton which maintains a reference to the app delegate. You can always access your app delegate using: [UIApplication sharedApplication].delegate You may need to cast the return to your own app delegate class to get rid of warnings. Even better, write an accessor that returns your upcast app delegate: #pragma mark access to app delegate etc. + (MyAppDelegateClass*) sharedAppDelegate; { return (MyAppDelegateClass*)[[UIApplication sharedApplication] delegate]; }
