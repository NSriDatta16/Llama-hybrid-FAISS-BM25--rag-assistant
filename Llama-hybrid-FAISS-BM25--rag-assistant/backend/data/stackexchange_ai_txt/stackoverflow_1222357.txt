You can drag the versioned folder to the destination folder using the right mouse button and when your mouse pointer is over the desired drop location let the button go and select the "SVN export all items here" option from the context menu that pops up. This should copy over both the versioned and unversioned files without the .svn directory. I hope its not some additional application that I installed that gives me this option but maybe you should try it.
