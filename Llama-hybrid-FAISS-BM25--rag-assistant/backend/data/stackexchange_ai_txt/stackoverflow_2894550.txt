blank space on google home page

2 questions, i was doing nothing productive, and tried selecting the google home page (a left click drag and select whole page) on google.com i see that beside the search box, on the left side, there is an empty space &nbsp; i looked up the source code and there indeed was a &nbsp; stupid as it may sound, but i was still curious to know why the blank space is out there..or is it just a simple typo?? :) also, any idea what window.lol&&lol() does? curious yet again, google search didnt get me any result and i thought i would turn to stackoverflow to enlighten me... thanks, ivar
