perform chow test on time series

I am currently writing on my master thesis, therefore i have to find out if a specific moment had an impact on a time series. By just looking at the plot I would say that after the prize reached his maximum at observation 831, there was a shift in the trend... in other words i would say there is a structual break. I wanted to confirm my assumption by performing a chow test on the first look i was very happy with the result. p-value which means that there is a structual break at observation 832 But then i replaced 832 with several different observation numbers and i noticed that the p-value declines if I run the chow test with lower observation numbers. when i run the test on observation 1 there was a p-value of 0,23 pvalue at observation 200 = 0,19 pvalue at overvation 300 was 0,01 I can perform sctest on every single observation after 300 and it will always show a p-value what am i doing wrong? is my formula Prize~Trend correct? (I am not that used to R or time series analysis in general) I am very glad and grateful for your help Regards
