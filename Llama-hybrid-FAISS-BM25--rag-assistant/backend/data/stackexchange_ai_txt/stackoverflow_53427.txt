I am not sure I really understand your question?! There already is a managed OleDBProvider?! using System.Data.OleDb; I would certainly discourage writing a provider that exists and works absolutely fine! :) But in answer to your first question, you can of course create your own. The Data Provider Roadmap may be a good place to start for an overview and links to samples etc.
