SVMs and separating margins

A couple of points that I need cleared up, thanks ahead for any help. In a D dimensional SVM what is the dimension of the maximal separating plane? Intuitively (and following VC logic) it will be D-1, is that correct.... In the derivation of the SVM, what roles do the Lagrangian multiplier play? What do their values indicate?
