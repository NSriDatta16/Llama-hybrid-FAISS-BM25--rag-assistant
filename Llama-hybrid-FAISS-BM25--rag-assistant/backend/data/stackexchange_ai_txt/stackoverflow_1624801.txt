This error means it can't validate the certificate chain. Possible causes are, The root CA is not trusted by your JRE. The certificate is signed by an intermediate cert but server is not sending it along with the cert. Here is how get a list of root cert, keytool -list -keystore $JAVA_HOME/lib/security/cacerts -v I don't know any Java way to check if intermediate cert is sent. I use openssl for that, openssl s_client -host example.com -port 443 Will show you all the certificate sent by server. Pay attention to "Certificate chain".
