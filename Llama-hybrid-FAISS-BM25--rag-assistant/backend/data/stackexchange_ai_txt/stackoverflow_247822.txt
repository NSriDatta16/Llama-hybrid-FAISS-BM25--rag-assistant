With output parameters that have variable length data types (nvarchar, varchar, etc), I've found that being more explicit leads to better results. In the case you've posted, a type is not specified on the C# side. I would probably change things to look something like the following: SqlParameter theOrganizationNameParam = new SqlParameter( "@OrganisationName", SqlDbType.NVarChar, 256 ); theOrganizationNameParam.Direction = ParameterDirection.Output; cm.Parameters.Add( theOrganizationNameParam ); cm.ExecuteNonQuery(); name = theOrganizationNameParam.Value; With this you can guarantee the output paratmer has the correct data type, and therefore can access the Value property without and exception being thrown. Hope this sheds some light.
