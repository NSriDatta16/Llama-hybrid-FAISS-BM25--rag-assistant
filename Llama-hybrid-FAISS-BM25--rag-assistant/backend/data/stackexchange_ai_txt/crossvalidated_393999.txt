They're going to be different because in cross_val_score , you obtain an accuracy for each of your folds and average them. For each CV fold, your training and tests set are different; so, you obtain different accuracy values for each of them, and it enables you to calculate standard deviation of your accuracies, which is enclosed in parentheses in your image. accuracy_score of sklearn.metrics library calculates the accuracy based on the inputs y_pred and y_true . For example, if you input your entire training set, you'll get accuracy of your entire training set, which is of course slightly different than your CV score.
