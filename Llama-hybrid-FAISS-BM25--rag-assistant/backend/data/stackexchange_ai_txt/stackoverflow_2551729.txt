I use the organisation, followed by the product eg Acme.Crm. When grouping classes together in a subnamespace always use a plural or action so that it cant clash with a class. eg Acme.Crm.Letters Acme.Crm.Invoicing I follow Microsoft's convention by not capitalising acronyms eg Crm instead of CRM, Sql instead of SQL - but that's more a personal preference.
