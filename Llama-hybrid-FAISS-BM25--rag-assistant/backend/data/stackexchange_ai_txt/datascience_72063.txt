How do I change the location of Google BigQuery

So, I'm trying to use Google BigQuery for the first time for a project of mine, and I'm a bit confused. The documentation isn't helping much, and it looks like all the Google employees are gone thanks to the current epidemic, judging by the blogpost by Google. I've got several .csv files containing tables of unlabeled numerical data uploaded to Google Cloud storage, in their Australian servers. What I want to do is to use BigQuery to perform k-means clustering and analysis of correlations between variables on them. However, I'm having issues trying to get the data transferred into BigQuery. I tried using the "Data Labeling" tab to create a data set like their documentation suggests, but it only reads one CSV at a time (I want to combine all the CSVs into one dataset), and none of the data types seem to fit at first glance, with the only one that sort of matches being "text". However, once it finishes its process, it looks like the resulting dataset is empty, when the original CSVs have hundreds of rows and dozens of columns. I've also tried using the "Tables" tab to create a data set, but it is giving me an error message about needing to put my models in the same region as my data, and I can't see how to fix this; the only options it seems to be giving me seem to be "Global" and "European Union", so I'm not certain how to set it to "Australia". Does anyone have any ideas about how to fix this? An anonymized version of the data sort of looks like this (but the actual CSV is much larger, with many more rows and columns): Item_ID,From_Position,To_Position,Data_One,Data_Two,Data_Three AA22DDA002,103,104.0,182.35643356,8.12345678,-2.32453256,0.03234213 AA22DDA002,104.0,105.0,483.23424678,3.34627319,-4.37600000
