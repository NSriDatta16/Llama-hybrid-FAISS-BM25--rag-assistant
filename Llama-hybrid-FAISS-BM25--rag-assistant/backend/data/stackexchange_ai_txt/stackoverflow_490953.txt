I expect that in this case you'd have to construct your own proxy, constructing your own http requests etc (perhaps via WebClient ). Thankfully, creating a REST request is a lot easier than raw SOAP, as is parsing the result. However, I wonder if consuming an asmx service (i.e. .NET 2.0 web-service) wouldn't be more pragmatic. If the ADO.NET Data Services service is out of your control, perhaps host a .NET 3.5 wrapper on another server that shims between asmx and Astoria? (i.e. exposes the data from the REST service via a 2.0 web-service).
