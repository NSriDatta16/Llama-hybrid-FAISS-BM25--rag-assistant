How to embed a PDF file in a web site?

I simply want to embed a PDF file in a web site. The best solution I've found is Google Docs Viewer ( http://docs.google.com/viewer ), but it does not work for IE and obviously that is not going to work for me. Anyone have a clean, easy solution to this? Update: I should add that one of the benefits of embedding the PDF file the Google viewer way is that as the PDF file I link to gets updated (and it could without notice to me), my site would automatically be holding the same PDF file (provided the full pathname doesn't change, which it does not). For this reason converting the file to an image is not preferred while.
