How to quantify a parent's influence of a node in a Bayesian Network?

Consider a toy bayesian network that models purchase of items at a store. The nodes include: {Brand, Price, Purchased} . It is possible that when you marginalize over price, P(purchase|brand) may indicate some brands are purchased more often than others. However, it's also possible that some brands are cheaper than others, and that P(purchase) is more strongly influenced by price than by brand. Questions: Is there an established method to assess the influence of the parents in this diagram? In other words, is there a way to assess whether or not it is price that influences purchases more than brand? Is this method robust to adding additional nodes? My understanding is some approaches (i.e. logistic regression) run into is as additional nodes are added, the coefficients for each covariate can change significantly
