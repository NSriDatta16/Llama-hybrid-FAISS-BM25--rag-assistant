Do I need a datalake in my use case?

My web application stores usage data, for example: tickets opened an closed tasks executed user scores etc. I need to show dashboards and reports for usage and performance trends, like: How many tickets where opened/closed in a period? what is the average tasks execution time? who is the most active user? which user gets the best score? etc. the set of questions is open, we can invent more. Does this scenario fall under a datawarehouse classic approach? Data are coming from a relational database with a specific data model. Somebody is asking me to create a datalake, just giving him all my raw data. I don't understand how does a datalake fit in this picture. With no model and relationship my data are usueless. Also, I don't have a stream of events: I have tables in a relational database. For example a row in a "task" table will have an "open time" column and a "close time" column. I'm confused about the need or advantages of creating a datalake vs a traditional datawarehouse approach
