does random forest require more trees to be built if # rows increase in train data

I am building a randoForest model on some data. To be able to tune the model faster, I was working with 10% sample. I have tuned it now and now I want to build the model on the whole (100% data). I am wondering, if I will have to increase the number of trees now that I am building the model on more training data points? Please let me know.
