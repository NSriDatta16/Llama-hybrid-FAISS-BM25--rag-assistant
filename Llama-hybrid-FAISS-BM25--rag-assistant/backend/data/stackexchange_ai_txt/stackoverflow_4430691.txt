I'm still digging into he web to try different way to solve my issue. Hopefully I've found this unanswered thread talking about my problem but without any response : Get Drag & Drop MS Word image + DataFormats.EnhancedMetafile & MetafilePict : http://www.codeguru.com/forum/showthread.php?t=456722 I work around with another io be able to copy floating Image (Image stored in Shape and not InlineShape) with Word 2003 and pasting into my winform. I can't paste the link of the second source (because of my low reputation on this website) but I'll do if someone request. So apparently there are a common issue with the fact that you cannot access to your Metafile stored in the Clipboard and by Drag&Drop. I still need to understand how to get my Metafile by Drag&Drop.
