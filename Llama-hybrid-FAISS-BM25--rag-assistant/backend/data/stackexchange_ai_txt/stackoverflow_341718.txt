I think you really need to re-organize your hierarchy and method names... This has nothing to do with your question, but in general it seems hard to fathom why Set inherits from Match. (doesn't a match have sets?) games are composed of points, sets are composed of games and a match is composed of sets... a point is won by a player. you should probably structure it more closely to the real world. just my $.02 EDIT I'd probably have a Match object that contains a map of sets (map i.e. set one, two three, etc) and the Method Player(int) rather than Player1() and player2(). Also it does not seem necessary to have a method for player in the Set class. A Set would point to a match in which it is being played.
