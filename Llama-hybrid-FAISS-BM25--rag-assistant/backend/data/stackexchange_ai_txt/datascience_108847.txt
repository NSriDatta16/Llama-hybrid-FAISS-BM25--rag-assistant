Selecting a subset of the population such that the distribution of a certain variable in the subset matches a reference distribution?

I have a large population ( $P$ ) of entries and I am given the distribution of a certain variable ( $x_0$ ) for a specific subset ( $S$ ) of the population. The subset $S$ is not a random sample and hence the distribution of $x_0$ for $S$ is not necessarily the same as that of $x_0$ for $P$ . I want to use all other available variables ( $x_1...x_n$ ) to select another subset $S'$ from the set ( $P-S$ ), such that the distribution of $x_0$ for $S'$ is the same as (or reasonably close to) that for $S$ . That is, $S'$ mimics $S$ as far as the variable $x_0$ is concerned. I am new to formal data science and I am not sure if machine learning is the best way to solve this problem. So far, my planned solution is to train a binary classifier on ( $P-S$ ) that minimizes a loss that quantifies the difference in the target and obtained distributions' JS-divergences, the "obtained" being defined as entries with a predicted score $y_0 > 0.5$ , or some other number, for instance. Then testing this model on separate test entries in ( $P-S$ ) and applying a cut $y_0 > 0.5$ should give me $S'$ . Will this strategy work? Is there a more standard and elegant way to do this?
