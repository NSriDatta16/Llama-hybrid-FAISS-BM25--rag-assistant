Thanks astander Thanks for responding but i figured out how to avoid problem . A solution is to avoid having to close TextBox indefinately. Doing this by using modal parameter of Show method as shown below UserForm1.Show (vbModeless) Not most elegant solution maybe but it works for now. Anyway I am still at Tinkering stage of working with VBA. Trying to teach myself using book and online resources.Thanks again Paul L
