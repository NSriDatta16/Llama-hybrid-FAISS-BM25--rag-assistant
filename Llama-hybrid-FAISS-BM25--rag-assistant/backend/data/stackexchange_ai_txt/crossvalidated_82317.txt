Even better method for forecast ensemble would be to combine forecasts from multiple classes of methods. That could guard against some form of model misspecification and overfitting. Last fall I did that in the context of churn analysis from our CRM-system. I combined probabilistic classifications from three models and did probability ensemble as a average of three output vectors. Of course it might mean that various explanatory variables get very different weighting as compared to original models since ensemblement changes output. One option could also be to use weighted ensemblement where weight W_i could be some other than 1/N, where N is number of models. Weights should of course sum to unity.
