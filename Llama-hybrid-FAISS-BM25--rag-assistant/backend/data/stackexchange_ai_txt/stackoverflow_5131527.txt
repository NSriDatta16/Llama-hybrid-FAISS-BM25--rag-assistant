How to handle ENTER button press on JQuery Dialog Box

I am using JQuery Dialog Box. I have got below code where I am opening my Dialog Box. $('#MyLogin').dialog({ autoOpen: true, width: 450, modal: true, draggable: false, title: $('.LoginpopupHeaderText').text(), close: function(event, ui) {showSelect();} }); When Dialog box is open, there is login button in it, which validate the username and password field in it using click event. Please see below code sample. //Login Button Clicked $('#loginButton').click(function() { //Code goes here }); My Login Button is an Image not a button. Now I want to catch " Enter " button press only when my Login Dialog is open as well as after catching the "Enter" button it should call my " loginButton " click event, so that it will behave like we have clicked the loginbutton on open dialog box. Please suggest! Thanks. Best Regards,
