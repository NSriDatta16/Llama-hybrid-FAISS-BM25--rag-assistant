The last 8 months I've been using Linq and it works great for all the little jobs. The strong typing and drag-and-drop development makes it fantasticlly easy and super quick. Previous to that, and still when Linq doesn't seem right I use SQLHelper. It cuts out all the donkey work of ADO.NET. I don't see any problem using it.
