I didn't find the grabble map feature useful. It's very snazzy, but it arrests my attention and the home listings produced by it never got my attention. I would have preferred a more conventional search feature, maybe expanding from the input search feature. And, skimming through the source file looks like the map and home listing javascript is 2/3 of the source. There's gotta be faster loads without it.
