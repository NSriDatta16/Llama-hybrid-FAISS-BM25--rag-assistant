Some information that might help. There is no official standards body or RFC for the robots.txt protocol. It was created by consensus in June 1994 by members of the robots mailing list (robots-request@nexor.co.uk). The information specifying the parts that should not be accessed is specified in a file called robots.txt in the top-level directory of the website. The robots.txt patterns are matched by simple substring comparisons, so care should be taken to make sure that patterns matching directories have the final '/' character appended, otherwise all files with names starting with that substring will match, rather than just those in the directory intended. Thereâ€™s no 100% sure way to exclude your pages from being found, other than not to publish them at all, of course. See: http://www.robotstxt.org/robotstxt.html There is no Allow in the Consensus. Plus the Regex option is not in the Consensus either. From the Robots Consensus: This is currently a bit awkward, as there is no "Allow" field. The easy way is to put all files to be disallowed into a separate directory, say "stuff", and leave the one file in the level above this directory: User-agent: * Disallow: /~joe/stuff/ Alternatively you can explicitly disallow all disallowed pages: User-agent: * Disallow: /~joe/junk.html Disallow: /~joe/foo.html Disallow: /~joe/bar.html A Possible Solution : Use .htaccess to set to disallow search robots from a specific folder while blocking bad robots.
