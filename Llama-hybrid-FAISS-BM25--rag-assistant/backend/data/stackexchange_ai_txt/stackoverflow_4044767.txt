Pass XSL template output to XSL function

I am using XSLTJSON to convert my XML to JSON. My raw XML is not in the format that I want, so I first pass it through an XSL stylesheet to clean it up and then pass the output of that stylesheet into XSLTJSON. Right now I'm doing this by calling transformers serially. I'd like to streamline it and have only one call to the transformer necessary. Is there a way to write an XSL stylesheet that includes json.xsl, matches on "/", does it's thing and then passes its output to json:generate()?
