This questions is too broad, but I thought I would respond to a few points where your statements aren't accurate. Bayesians (typically) believe there is a fixed value for the parameters, but use a probability distribution to represent their uncertainty about what the true value is. A Bayesian is typically interested in the full posterior rather than a point or interval estimate of a particular parameter (although for simplicity in reporting results point or interval estimates are typically provided). A frequentist would not use a normal approximation for hypothesis testing with a point null in a binomial experiment. Even if a frequentist "rejects a null hypothesis" that does not mean they choose the alternative. Bayesians will choose between hypotheses if forced to, but typically we would prefer model averaging. In a regression problem many frequentists use penalized likelihood methods, e.g. lasso, ridge regression, elastic net, etc. and therefore would not be using the MLE or OLS estimators.
