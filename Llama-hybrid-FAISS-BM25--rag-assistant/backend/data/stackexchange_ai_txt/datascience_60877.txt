I suggest you to implement a "simple" GAN with convolutional layers. It's not necessary, in my opinion, to add LSTM layers. That's an additional layer of complexity, while you can achieve state-of-the-art results with conv layers alone (and save also training time). You can train your model(s) on the EMNIST Dataset of handwritten letters.
