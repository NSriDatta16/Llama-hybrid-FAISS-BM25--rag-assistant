You could do it a couple ways : GET/POST, SESSION variable, or COOKIEs. to use GET variables you would simply have to put a variable at the end of all your links, and handle those variables in all of your destination pages. Your destination pages would then have to modify all of its links to carry that pagination variable. Naturally, this is not the most elegant solution. You could also do it in a session variable. The code for this would look like: php: //This is in #selectAllWhaterver.php session_start(); $_SESSION['paginationMin'] = $_POST['min']; $_SESSION['paginationMax'] = $_POST['max']; *********************************************** //Then in your php when you reload the page that has pagination on it session_start(); if(isset($_SESSION['paginationMin']) $min = $_SESSION['paginationMin']; else $min = 0; if(isset($_SESSION['paginationMax']) $max = $_SESSION['paginationMax']; else $max = 10; //Now use these variables to generate wtv content you are loading This is probably the most elegant solution, because it will save the pagination data for their session - meaning once they close their browser it resets. If you would like to use cookies, which will stay alive even after the session dies, you would do it like this. (Note: I'm no pro on cookies. sorry if this is imperfect) javascript: document.cookie = "paginationMin="+minLimit; document.cookie = "paginationMax=10"; //And to grab them again var cookies = ""+document.cookie; var pos = cookies.indexOf("paginationMax"); var pos2 = cookies.indexOf(';', pos); var max = unescape(cookies.substring(pos+cookieName.length+1,pos2)); var pos = cookies.indexOf("paginationMin"); var pos2 = cookies.indexOf(';', pos); var min = unescape(cookies.substring(pos+cookieName.length+1,pos2));
