What is the nugget effect?

I don't understand exactly what is meant by the term "nugget effect" in geostatistics. When looking at empirical variograms plotting the variogram $\gamma(h)$ vs. the lag $h$, the nugget is defined as the discontinuity from the origin when the lag $h=0$. When $h=0$ you should also get $\gamma=0$ because you should be getting the same point, but this doesn't always occur in practice. If you want to do kriging (best linear unbiased interpolation), you need replace the empirical variogram with an appropriate model for the covariance. In this context people also talk about the nugget licit model for the variogram which appears to be defined as follows: $$ g(h) = \begin{cases} 0, & \text{if $h=0$ } \\ c, & \text{otherwise} \end{cases} $$ where $c$ is the sill or asymptotic value of $\gamma$. Sometimes people talk about the nugget effect. nugget effect = sum of geological microstructure and measurement error (source) or Typically, only a small portion of the variability is explained by random behavior. For historical reasons, this type of variogram behavior is called the nugget effect. In early mining geostatistics, the presence of gold nuggets in drillhole samples would lead to apparently random variationsâ€”hence, nugget effect. (Source) In an comment in the answer to this question What effect does data averaging have on the variogram? it seems to suggest that true nugget effect is different from measurement error. What is the nugget effect? How/why is it different from measurement error? EDIT After reading AdamO's response, I found the following helpful passage: In practice, when the sampling design specifies a single measurement at each of $n$ distinct locations, the nugget effect has a dual interpretation as either measurement error or spatial variation on a scale smaller than the smallest distance between any two points in the sample design, or any combination of these two effects. These two components of the nugget effect can only be separately identified if the measurement error variance is either known, or can be estimated directly using repeated measurements taken at coincident locations.
