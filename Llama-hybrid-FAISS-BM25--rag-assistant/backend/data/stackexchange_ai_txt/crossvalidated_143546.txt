Every subsequent eigenvector from a PCA is constrained to be orthogonal to all previous eigenvectors. If your variables tend to be mainly positively correlated, this will lead to an all-positive first eigenvector. In order to be orthogonal to that the second eigenvector will have to have a mixture of signs.
