It is to my understanding, that one of the whole points of picking a particular encryption, and decryption, method, is that both ends of the communication stream will know which algorithm the data is encrypted with. If you "have to" encrypt your data using the Blowfish algorithm, then the requirement alone should tell you that the recipient is expecting a message encrypted using the Blowfish scheme. Like Thilo said, "the whole point of standardized encryption algorithms...is that even though everyone knows all the details of it, one cannot decrypt it unless one has the key." The best way to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks, and other attacks involving the malicious party intercepting your messages, is to keep your key safe - do not hard-code it into any programs (even compiled programs can be analyzed) and build trusts with your recipient by ensuring that their security practices minimize the chance of a malicious agent procuring the pertinent key. Alternately, if your recipient supports it, you could use "one-time pads" - unique passwords/keys for encrypting your data.
