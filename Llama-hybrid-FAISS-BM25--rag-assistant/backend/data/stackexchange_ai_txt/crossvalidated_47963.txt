The transition matrix is obtained by using Markov chains. The emission matrix depends upon the hidden states that are unobservable. Each of the observed states may have more than one unobservable For example a person may be healthy or feverish depends upon observable states like cold, dizzy and headache. The matrix giving the transition probability of unobservable state to observable state is emission matrix.
