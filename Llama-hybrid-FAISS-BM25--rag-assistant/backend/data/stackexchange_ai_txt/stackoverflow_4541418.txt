Bring window to front

How can I bring a non-active (means another window is in front of that page) to the front? I've tried self.focus and window.focus, but it doesn't work... I can't control the window in the front, because it's from a third-party plugin... many thanks to every hint :) Greetz, Camillo EDIT: Here the code I'm using on my site (that i'm trying to bring to front): Gallery var timeFrame; $(function() { timeFrame=setInterval("lpcAuto();", 100);}); function lpcAuto(){ if ( $(document.activeElement).attr('id')=="lpcframe" ){ // HERE THE SNIPPET I'M SEARCHING :) } }
