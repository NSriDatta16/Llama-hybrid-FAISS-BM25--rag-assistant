Hints: (a) Sometimes the population distribution is of interest in itself - the data-generating mechanism gives insight into the phenomenon behind the data. The gamma distribution is a nice example - read up on it, paying attention to its relation with the exponential distribution. (b) When you're modelling, carrying out hypothesis tests, or whatever, there are often distributional assumptions which while not of primary interest are necessary for the validity of parameter estimates or p-values. The gamma distribution is often used in survival/reliability analysis - check that out.
