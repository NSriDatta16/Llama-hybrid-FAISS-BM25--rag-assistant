Dimensionality reduction (PCA) after splitting a matrix

Lets say I have 4 variables: A1, A2, B1, B2 and I want to simplify my model. I have reason to suspect that A1 and A2 are measuring a similar thing, likewise with B1 and B2 One way to simplify my model (reduce my dimension count) is to run PCA to condense A1 and A2 down into a single variable/component, and B1 and B2 into a second variable/component. This would leave me with Y = A + B If my matrix contains all 4 variables, and run PCA to extract only 2 components, theres no guarantee that component 1 corresponds to A, and component 2 corresponds to B If, however, I create 2 matrices where M1 contains A1 and A2, and M2 contains B1 and B2 and then run PCA on the 2 matrices separately extracting only 1 component each then the components would correspond to A and B respectively My question: is this a valid approach to reduce the dimensions in my dataset? I'm leaning towards no because by splitting the matrix into 2 and running PCA separately we have no way of modelling any relationship that might exist between A and B. Is that logic correct?
