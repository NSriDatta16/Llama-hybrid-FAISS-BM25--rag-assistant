How do I trap display driver drawing commands on Mac OS X?

I am trying to find a clean and elegant way to trap all display driver drawing commands on Mac OS X so I have visibility to anything that gets drawn on the screen, before it goes to the physical display driver. Simple bitmaps won't do it -- I need the actual drawing commands and not just notifications on which areas have changed. This could be Quartz drawing commands or just pure OpenGL, I can live with any API as long as it's detailed enough. Is there any way to get into Quartz Extreme to catch its OpenGL commands or something? Thanks in advance!
