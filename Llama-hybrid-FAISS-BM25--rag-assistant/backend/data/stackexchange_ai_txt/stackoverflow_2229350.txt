I'm not familiar with Python, but if you are able to block on a condition variable (without a timeout), you could implement the timeout yourself. Let the blocking thread store the time it began blocking and set a timer to signal it. When it wakes, check the time elapsed for a timeout. This isn't a very good way to do it unless you can aggregate the timers to a single thread, otherwise, your thread count would double without reason.
