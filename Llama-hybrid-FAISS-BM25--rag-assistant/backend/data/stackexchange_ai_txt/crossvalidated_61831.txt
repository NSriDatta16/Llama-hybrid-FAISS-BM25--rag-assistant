This answer cannot be correct. An estimator cannot depend on the values of the parameters: since they are unknown it would mean that you cannot compute the estimate. An unbiased estimator of the variance for every distribution (with finite second moment) is $$ S^2 = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \bar{y})^2.$$ By expanding the square and using the definition of the average $\bar{y}$, you can see that $$ S^2 = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n y_i^2 - \frac{2}{n(n-1)}\sum_{i\neq j}y_iy_j,$$ so if the variables are IID, $$E(S^2) = \frac{1}{n} nE(y_j^2) - \frac{2}{n(n-1)} \frac{n(n-1)}{2} E(y_j)^2. $$ As you see we do not need the hypothesis that the variables have a binomial distribution (except implicitly in the fact that the variance exists) in order to derive this estimator.
