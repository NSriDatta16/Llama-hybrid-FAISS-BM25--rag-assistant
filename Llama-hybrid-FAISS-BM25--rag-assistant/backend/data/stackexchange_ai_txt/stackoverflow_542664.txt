Cannot get file data from the clipboard using Flex

Given: A Flex TileList with the following event: I am trying to create a list of thumbnails from jpegs that I drag into this TileList. Image.source can use the url to show the image, but I need to scale the image down first (hi rez photos) I already have the scaling part done except that I need BitmapData from the file and it has null for file.data. ALSO, I have tried this: var x:URLRequest = new URLRequest(value.file.url); // this is a local file (e.g. file:///C:/somefile.jpg) var b:Bitmap = new Bitmap(x.data as BitmapData); data is ALSO null! So frustrating. Any help would be appreciated.
