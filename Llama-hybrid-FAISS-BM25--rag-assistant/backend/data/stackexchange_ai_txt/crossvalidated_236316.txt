Extract features from cluster importance

I am given a dataset with multiple features associated with each data point. I would like to select a subset of data points and find out what features best separate the selected subset from the remaining data points. I'm especially interested in interpretable, less black-boxy methods since I would want to know the features and, ideally, some specific information about what values fall into which subgroup. What method would be most suitable for such a task? One thing I had in mind was to take those two groups, assign labels to them, run logistic regression and subsequently extract feature importances from them, but maybe there is a smarter solution. Also, the selected subgroup could be significantly smaller than the remaining group, what should I keep in mind when the groups are unbalanced, what could I do to mitigate this? Please ask in the comments if some clarification is needed, and no, this is not a course assignment but a real challenge I face :).
