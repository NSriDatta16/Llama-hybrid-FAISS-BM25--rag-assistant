Take a look at Zend_Auth : Zend_Auth is concerned only with authentication and not with authorization. Authentication is loosely defined as determining whether an entity actually is what it purports to be (i.e., identification), based on some set of credentials. Authorization, the process of deciding whether to allow an entity access to, or to perform operations upon, other entities is outside the scope of Zend_Auth . For a multiple-user-role (authorization) implementation take a look at Zend_Acl : Zend_Acl provides a lightweight and flexible access control list (ACL) implementation for privileges management. In general, an application may utilize such ACL's to control access to certain protected objects by other requesting objects. Please keep in mind that it's possible to make use of those without having to commit to using the entire Zend_Framework , as it's not a full-stack framework, and I'm in no way trying to encourage you to use the above, or any framework for that matter. Just thought I would mention those as they haven't been already.
