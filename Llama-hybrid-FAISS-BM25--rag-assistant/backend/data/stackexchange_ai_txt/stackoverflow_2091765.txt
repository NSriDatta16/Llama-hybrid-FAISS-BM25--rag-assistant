I have done performance tests. They were published in PostSharp Blog Some aspects can have the same performance as hand written code if they don't use features such as: reflection, access to method parameters, access to method instance. Since PostSharp emits MSIL instructions, the generated code can be inlined by the JIT compiler. As reminded in other answers, be sure that (1) PostSharp is indeed invoked (use Reflector on the resulting assembly) and (2) you're using the Stopwatch properly. If you're comparing the average time of a single test, it's normal that the difference between PostSharp and hand-written code is just a few nanoseconds (in the hypothesis that you don't use expensive features).
