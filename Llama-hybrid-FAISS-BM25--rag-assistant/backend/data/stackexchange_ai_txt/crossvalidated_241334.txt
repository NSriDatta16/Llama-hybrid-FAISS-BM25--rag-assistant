Inverse of exponential smoothing

Suppose that a time series $s_t$ it is known to be obtained via exponential smoothing of an underlying signal $x_t$ , that is $$ s_{0}= x_0 $$ and $$ s_{t} = (1-\alpha)\,x_t+\alpha\,s_{t-1}. $$ I am wondering whether there exist procedures/filters to re-construct or approximate the sequence of the $x_t$ having observed the sequence of the $s_t$ and having an estimate of the smoothing parameter $\alpha$ .
