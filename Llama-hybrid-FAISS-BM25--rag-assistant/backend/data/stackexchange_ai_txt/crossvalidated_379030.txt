Log transformation to generate random number producing NA's

I am trying to generate a random values using log distribution. The reason for using log-distribution is keep the values positive. #generating 50,000 K values with a mean and CV of 20% cv=0.2 # 20% cv for the values of Ke, rro and used in the simulation calc_sd $KE))) exp(sd(log(kdist$ KE))) Warning message: In rnorm(nsample, mean = log(mu), sd = log(sd)) : NAs produced This is the warning message I keep getting My question is how do I adderss this issue. I ave tried using one of the previous suggestions which was mentioned here and it does not work. https://msalganik.wordpress.com/2017/01/21/making-sense-of-the-rlnorm-function-in-r/ http://r.789695.n4.nabble.com/Is-my-understanding-of-rlnorm-correct-td853068.html My second question is : is there a way to directly use CV instead of sd for the generating this ? Thanks in advance. Update: Got the solution after reprametrization as suggested by this link https://msalganik.wordpress.com/2017/01/21/making-sense-of-the-rlnorm-function-in-r/
