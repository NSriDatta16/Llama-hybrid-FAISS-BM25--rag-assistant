1) with case-control data (selection on $Y$), how can you use logistic regression? Is it valid? How is parameter estimates (and their interpretations) affected? 2) tell us about over-dispersion in binomial data. Why is it a problem? What is it? What can you do with it? How is logistic regression affected? Is there some alternatives to logistic regression in that case? 3) tell us about modeling of interactions in linear and logistic regression. How does it differ? How does interpretations differ in those two cases?
