Can censored data act as the dependent variable for a logistic regression?

I need to do the research about the risk factors that contribute to heart failure. The data I have just the censored data with some risk factors of heart failure. And I need to use logistic regression and exponential regression to find out the risk factors that contribute to heart failure. The censored data define as 0=censored, 1=died, can I use this as my dependent variable for logistic regression? If not, if someone got data that related the risk factors that contribute to heart failure which can use exponential and logistic regression to find out the risk factors of heart failure, is possible to share with me?
