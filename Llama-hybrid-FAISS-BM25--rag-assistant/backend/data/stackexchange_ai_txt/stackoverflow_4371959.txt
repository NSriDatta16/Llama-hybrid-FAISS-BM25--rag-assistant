You ask why it is looking for .First.Lib when the script deleted it earlier. lazyLoad loads a database of R objects, which in the code above is loaded into the environment myEnv . It is not inconceivable that the set of objects loaded into that environment contains a .First.Lib and it is this that the code is looking for. Indeed, I guess the intention was to only run the .First.Lib that was stored in the object database loaded. Another common idiom in packages without a NAMESPACE, is this (from the vegan package): .First.lib This loads the compiled code ready for use and prints a simple start-up message with the package name and version number. This is similar in spirit to the .onLoad of @Romain's answer, but without the NAMESPACE.
