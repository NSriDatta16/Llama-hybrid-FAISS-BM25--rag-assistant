What you would normally want to do in this kind of situation is a meta-analysis of some form. The closest equivalent to Fischer's exact test would be to use exact logistic regression stratified by trial. But is this really a binomial outcome? I would assume the individual trials might have been more appropriately analyzed using time-to-event methods and it is likely better to combine the results of such analyses rather than artficially turning it into a binomial data problem, which it isn't.
