How to prevent dojo.dnd.moveable to make input fields disable

I use dojo.dnd.Moveable for making DIVs drag-able & drop-able in the page (Something like iGoogle). But the problem is after making them moveable, all of input fields (like text-boxes and list-boxes) will be disable and I can not write any thing in text fields or select any item from list-boxes! What should I do with that? Tnx /Goli
