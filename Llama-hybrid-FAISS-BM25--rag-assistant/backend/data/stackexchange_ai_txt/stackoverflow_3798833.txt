numbers is a non-constant, automatic, array variable of the function main . Because it is automatic and non-constant it can not have static storage. because it is an array variable (and not you'll notice a pointer) it can not be incremented. Note that you can do int main() { int numbers[3] = {1,2,3}; int *n = numbers+1; n++; return 0; }
