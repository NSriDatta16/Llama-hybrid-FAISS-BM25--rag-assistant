How do you implement drag and drop from a small WPF Element host in a Winforms application?

In our app we host a small WPF Listbox inside of an Element host, we implement drag and drop using the PreviewMouseDown event... private void Border_PreviewMouseMove(object sender, MouseEventArgs e) { // Get the current mouse position Point mousePos = e.GetPosition(null); Vector diff = startPoint - mousePos; if (e.LeftButton == MouseButtonState.Pressed && Math.Abs(diff.X) > SystemParameters.MinimumHorizontalDragDistance && Math.Abs(diff.Y) > SystemParameters.MinimumVerticalDragDistance) { OnDragStarted(e); } } The problem we are seeing is that when I click and drag an item fairly quickly, the WPF control only fires one PreviewMouseMove event before the mouse leaves the Elementhost, therefore the drag operation is not started until the mouse is returned to the Elementhost and another PreviewMouseMove event is raised. Is there a robust way of handling this case?
