Method C appears to be basically a weighted average. Your question is close to MySQL syntax. Given that these are decimal format. If you have weights: SELECT SUM( longitude * weight ) / SUM( weight ) AS Avg_Long, SUM( latitude * weight ) / SUM( weight ) AS Avg_Lat FROM points Or unweighted: SELECT AVG( longitude ) AS Avg_Long, AVG( latitude ) AS Avg_Lat FROM points Your reference alludes to baseline adjustments, but I'm not sure that's needed.
