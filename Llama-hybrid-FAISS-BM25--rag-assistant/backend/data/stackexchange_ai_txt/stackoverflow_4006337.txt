I believe your question is hinged on a common misunderstanding for new comers to the MVC design pattern. In the MVC design pattern how you organize your model, view, and controllers is a matter of preference. That said, web frameworks like ASP.NET MVC suggest certain organizations because of their tendency to expose pattern implementation via a site's URLs. To illustrate out of the box ASP.NET MVC would create this route http://example.com/calculation/add for the Calculation controller's add action. As a developer you can override this behavior by creating custom routes , which means you should organize your models, views, and controllers in a way that makes logical sense to you. Since by definition your site is just doing simple calculations I would recommend creating a single controller with a variety of actions: add, subtract, divide etc. Lorenzo provides the basis of how to get started in his answer .
