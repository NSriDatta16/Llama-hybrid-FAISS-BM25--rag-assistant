You can create a file called robots.txt in the root of your site. The format is this: User-agent: (user agent string to match) Disallow: (URL here) Disallow: (other URL here) ... Example: User-agent: * Disallow: / Will make (the nice) robots not index anything on your site. Of course, some robots will completely ignore robots.txt, but for the ones that honor it, it's your best bet. If you'd like more information on the robots.txt file, please see http://www.robotstxt.org/
