As of Visual Studio 2005, the DragAllow property was renamed to AllowDrop . See the relevant documentation on MSDN. The article you read must either be an old one, or written with an older version of Visual Studio in mind. However, you should also note that the AllowDrop property is hidden for the PictureBox control. The function signature has the BrowsableAttribute set to False. According to the documentation : This API supports the .NET Framework infrastructure and is not intended to be used directly from your code. Why this choice was made is anyone's guess , but you can still set it manually in your source code (albeit without the benefit of IntelliSense).
