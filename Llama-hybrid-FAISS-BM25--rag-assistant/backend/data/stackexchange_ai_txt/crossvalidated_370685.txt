Estimate Convolution Filter Formula from Noisy Input and Output

When I learned signal processing, I learned how to calculate the output with given input and given convolution filter. However, if now I have the noisy input and output, assuming the system is linear time invariant hence the input and output is connected by a convolutional filter, how should I calculate the exact formula of filter from data? This sounds more like a machine learning problem instead of a signal processing problem. I do not even know how to start with this problem, like what is the criterion (e.g. maximum likelihood) for evaluating how good a candidate filter is. Is there such a field that studies this kind of problems? EDIT: Right now I consider only the simplest case. The input and output are both 1D signal that varies in time, and the noise is assumed to be Gaussian noise with zero mean and unknown variance. The prior knowledge of the filter is it should be monotonically decreasing with time lag, possibly exponentially decay.
