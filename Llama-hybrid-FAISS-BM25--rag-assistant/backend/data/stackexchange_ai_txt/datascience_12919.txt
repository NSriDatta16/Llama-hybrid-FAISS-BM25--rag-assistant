Is TensorFlow a complete Machine Learning Library?

I am new to TensorFlow and I need to understand the capabilities and shortcomings of TensorFlow before I can use it. I know that it is a deep learning framework, but apart from that which other machine learning algorithms can we use with tensor flow. For example can we use SVMs or random forests using TensorFlow? (I know this sounds crazy) In short, I want to know which Machine Learning Algorithms are supported by TensorFlow. Is it just deep learning or something more?
