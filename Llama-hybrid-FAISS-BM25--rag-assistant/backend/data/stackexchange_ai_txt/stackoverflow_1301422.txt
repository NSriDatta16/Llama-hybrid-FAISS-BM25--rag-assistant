Here is another solution just for the fun of it: In Perl substr() can be an lvalue which can help in your case. substr ($num , -3 , 0) = '.'; will add a dot before the last three digits. You can also use the four arguments version of substr (as pointed in the comments) to get the same effect: substr( $num, -3, 0, '.' ); I would hope it is more elegant / readable than the regexp solution, but I am sure it will throw off anyone not used to substr() being used as an lvalue.
