Well have not been able to manipulate the actual uitextview. First tried making a button overlay that could be moved and could be pressed to start editing, but it wasn't centered properly. Then tried the above method to move the UITextView itself. But it would only work on touches or drags. (Note this was a modified form of touchesBegan & touchesMoved) Ended up with a UIScrollView with the UITextView as a subview. Now it can move smoothly just that it can be moved from any place on the screen. Not optimal but is the best result to thus keep everything else intact.
