This will work in most cases, at least if the Bernoulli variables involved are independent and identically distributed, or at least exchangeable and identically distributed (Peres 1992), and an unlimited sequence of them is available. This answer will include discussion on algorithms to approximate a distribution using Bernoulli random variables. The rest of this answer assumes the Bernoulli random variables have a mean (bias) of 1/2 (they represent unbiased random bits). If the random variables (bits) have an unknown bias , a randomness extraction method such as the von Neumann or Peres extractor can be used to generate unbiased random bits from them (see my note on randomness extraction ). There are many ways to approximate a distribution to an arbitrary accuracy, and they are discussed in Devroye and Gravel 2015/2020: For discrete distributions , there are many possibilities. One is to take the binary expansions of the distribution's probabilities and perform a random walk on them, driven by unbiased random bits. This is the essence of the DDG tree algorithm by Knuth and Yao. In fact any practical algorithm for discrete distributions can be recast to a DDG tree algorithm. See also Gryszka 2020. The binary entropy of a discrete distribution is a lower bound on the average number of random bits needed to produce a variate of that distribution. Unfortunately, some discrete distributions have unbounded entropy; Devroye and Gravel give as an example the zeta Dirichlet distribution (in certain parameterizations). For continuous distributions , Devroye and Gravel discuss inversion, discretization, convolution, and rejection sampling to produce a variate from a given distribution using random bits, and give lower bounds on the number of random bits needed to generate a variate with the desired accuracy. Different approaches work well for different distributions. One notable example of generating a continuous variate using unbiased bits is the exponential distribution, such as C.F.F. Karney's improvement in " Sampling exactly from a normal distribution " of von Neumann's time-honored exponential generator. Also, I specify algorithms to do arithmetic on random variates represented by sequences of bits or digits. On the inversion side, if a distribution's inverse CDF is known, enough bits of a uniform(0,1) random variate can be generated so that the inverse CDF can be calculated from that variate with a low enough variance.
