DFS is probably the easiest solution to setup, although depending on the reliability of your network this can become un-synchronized at times, which requires you to break the link, and re-sync, which is quite painful to be honest. Given the above, I would be inclined to use a SQL Server storage solution, as this reduces the complexity of your system, rather then increases it. Do some tests to see if performance will be an issue first.
