This question is kind of old but I would suggest that you use MSDeploy for this. If you want you can also use WDP to do the ASP.NET compilation and merge for you. The great thing about MSDeploy is that you can install the MSDeploy Remote Agent Service on the target machine. Then when you perform the sync it will determine which files are out of date and only send those files. Therefore saving you time and bandwidth. Also you can perform transformations as your are deploying the site. It is easy to deploy to many different servers as well. I have a video online about MSDeploy, more info on that at http://sedodream.com/2009/10/27/MSDeployPresentationMaterials.aspx .
