No there is no way, Apparantly Tim and Marc have another nice solution But you can always just name them, and do the -= on the named eventhandler on this method ;) Guessing your event: _client.AddMemberToTeamCompleted += OnAddMemberToTeamCompleted; and public void OnAddMemberToTeamCompleted(object sender, EventArgs args) { _client.AddMemberToTeamCompleted -= OnAddMemberToTeamCompleted; callback(e.Result) } Next problem is getting this callback in your listener. Perhaps putting it on a Property in the EventArgs (but that feels kinda dirty, I agree)
