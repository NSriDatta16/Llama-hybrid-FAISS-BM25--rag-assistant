With a classification problem one can compute multiple $F_1$ scores for the classes seperately. The micro and macro $F_1$ scores compute a single score for all classes together. If a few categories have little representation in the validation sample then their individual $F_1$ scores will be noisy and this influences the grouped macro and micro $F_1$ scores. The differences in the weight these two give to different classes makes that the one can be more noisy than the other. The macro- $F_1$ score computes a non-weighted average of $F_1$ scores for multiple categories. The noise in the $F_1$ score of one or more small categories influences the macro-f1 score as well. The micro- $F_1$ score sums all the false/true negative/positive cases before computing a single $F_1$ score. The number of false/true negative/positive cases in the categories that are small will be small and so these have relatively less influence on the sum. The micro- $F_1$ score will be relatively less noisy in comparison to the macro- $F_1$ score which gives more weight to the smaller categories.
