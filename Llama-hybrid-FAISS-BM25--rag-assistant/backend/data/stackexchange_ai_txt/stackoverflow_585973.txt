Jquery: Trigger multiple actions from single events - or -

I'm trying to make a single event update two parts of the page. If you look at http://eddowding.com/clients/stack/OverviewLite.php you can zoom on the top graph by clicking and dragging an area. On release this updates one of the graphs on the page. I'd like it to update all of them. I think this is a jquery issue, not a flot issue, and suspect that Fling ( http://www.command-tab.com/2008/12/04/jquery-fling/ ) might hold an answer. But I can't quite work out how to apply it. (I'm not a js guy by any means..!) Thanks in advance!
