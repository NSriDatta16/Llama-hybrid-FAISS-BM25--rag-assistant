I would take a look at the FILLFACTOR for the table. By default it's set to 100, you could lower it to 70 (to start with). After this, you have to do a VACUUM FULL to rebuild the table. ALTER TABLE tablename SET (FILLFACTOR = 70); VACUUM FULL tablename; REINDEX TABLE tablename; This gives UPDATE a chance to place the updated copy of a row on the same page as the original, which is more efficient than placing it on a different page. Or if your database is already somewhat fragmented from lots of previous updated, it might already be sparese enough. Now your database also has the option to do HOT updates , assuming the column you are updating is not one involved in any index.
