Clustering groups of data with Machine Learning

I want to cluster objects. There are two attributes (one categorial and one numerical). They should be clustered after the numerical attribut. But observations with the same categorical value should be grouped in the same cluster, no matter of the numerical attribut. I tried with k-prototypes in python and a change in the gamma value, but ist doesn't worked like I wanted to. I think the problem is that some of the objects with the same categorical value are too different in the numerical values, so k-prototype change them to another cluster which better fits to the numerical value of the object. Is there another possibility? Better algorithm? Maybe to change the pyhon algorithm code and add a restriction that all objects with the same categorical value must belong to the same cluster? Or is there any other Machine-Learning algorithm which can cluster groups of objects? Thank you for your help.
