Terminology for smoothing methods: kernel density estimation, kernel smoothing, etc

I'm using what I have been referring to as 'kernel density estimation' to estimate the rates of a series of variables a, b, c from noisy observations distributed in 1-, 2- and 3-dimensional space. The variables being estimated are relative proportions - a+b+c=1 at every point. The approach boils down to taking a weighted average of all the values where the weights are a function of distance from the point of interest to each observation. That function is usually a static Gaussian function, but I've also used a square kernel (all points within distance k are weighted 1, all others are weighted 0), k-nearest neighbours (the nearest k points are weighted 1, all other points are weighted 0), or a dynamic Gaussian kernel (weights are determined with a Gaussian function but Ïƒ is set for each estimate such that the sum of weights is always k ). My question is about terminology - Can I reasonably refer to all of these as kernel density estimation, regardless of the kernel function? Is it okay to refer to these as kde when I'm working with relative proportions? I see a range of other terms around - kernel smoother, kernel smoothing, kernel density smoothing, weighted moving averages, nearest neighbour smoothing, etc. - are there really differences here, or are some of these different names for the same methods?
