Maybe you're having trouble making sense of this problem because the answer is extreme. "Failure" is that such a phone lasts less than a year. From R, we get $P(F) = 0.1975,$ pretty much as you say. So $p = P(S) = 0.8025.$ (A falure rate - $\lambda = 0.22$ implies that cell phones last on average for $1/\lambda = 4.5454$ years. pexp(1, .22) [1] 0.1974812 Now if you have $n = 500$ such phones working or failing independently, let $Y$ be the number that survive for at least a year. Then $Y \sim \mathsf{Binom}(n=500, p),$ which has $\mu=E(Y) = 401.2594$ and $\sigma=SD(Y) = 8.9018.$ As I read the problem, you seek $P(Y > 80) = 1 -P(Y \le 80).$ If you wish, you can use the normal approximation to a binomial distribution (a special case of the CLT) to approximate this probability. But you could also use R (where 'pbinom' is a binomial CDF) to see that the exact probability is essentially $1:$ 1 - pbinom(80, 500, 0.8025) [1] 1 This is no surprise because the mean (about 400) is so many standard deviations above 80. A normal approximation would be as follows: $$P(Y > 80) = P\left(\frac{Y-\mu}{\sigma} > \frac{80-401.2594}{8.9018} = -39.17\right) \approx P(Z > =39.17) \approx 1,$$ where $Z$ is a standard normal random variable. Note: What may be causing a surprise is that not many textbook problems have 'essentially 1' as an answer. Perhaps 380 was intended instead of 80. 1 - pbinom(380, 500, 0.8025) [1] 0.9888621
