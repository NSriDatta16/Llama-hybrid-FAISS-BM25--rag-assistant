I think you nailed it when you mention storage, with floats being half the size. Using floats may show improved performance over doubles for applications processing large arrays of floating point numbers such that memory bandwith is the limiting factor. By switching to float[] from double[] and halving the data size, you effectively double the throughput, because twice as many values can be fetched in a given time. Although the cpu has a little more work to do converting the float to a double, this happens in parallel with the memory fetch, with the fetch taking longer. For some applications the loss of precision might be worth trading for the gain in performance. Then again... :-)
