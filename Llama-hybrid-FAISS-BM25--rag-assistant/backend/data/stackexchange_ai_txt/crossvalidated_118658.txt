mean of population with repeated samples of varying size - how to apply CLT?

I have a population with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$. I draw a sample with $n_i$ number of i.i.d random observations from population. I compute the mean for this sample as $mean_i$. I then repeat this experiment k times drawing samples of different sizes, $n_i$, every time. Questions: 1) will the $mean_i$ form a normal distribution? (edit: distribution of means across i ) 2) What would be the std deviation of such a distribution? It cannot be $\sigma/\sqrt n$ as the n is changing for every sample. 3) If i now take average of all these means, can i construct confidence interval around that measurement for original population mean?
