Force Rails 3 dynamic finder to throw RecordNotFound exception?

Is is possible to force a Rails dynamic finder to throw an ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound exception rather than return nil when it cannot find a result? For example, where a beverage of the name 'Nuka–Cola' does not exist: @not_found = Beverage.find_by_name('Nuka–Cola') Rather than having @not_found == nil Could the .find_by_name('Nuka–Cola') method call throw an ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound exception? Or am I going to have to check for nil and throw the exception manually?
