Forecast combination approaches or: How to beat the simple average?

Say, i have a set of two forecasters (or 'experts'), who provide a forecast for wind power time series and i have to pick the best expert (or a somehow-weighted combination of both experts) to have an overall better forecast. Here, i can do a simple uniformly weighted average, which often beats many other forecast combination methods. (Diebold 2017, p.405ff) Other elaborated approaches were suggested in the literature, most prominently variance-covariance based methods originally developed by Bates & Cranger,1969 . Especially in the field of ensemble learning, there are algorithms to robustly combine experts ( Littestone & Warmuth, 1994 ). Further developments of picking the best expert advise based on its prior performance via exponentially weighted aggregation ( see Cesa-Bianchi & Lugosi 2006, p.7ff ) also exist. Especially the last method is often used in online machine learning literature, where it is opposed to batch learning alghorithms to overcome computational limitations. (if you are interested: Opera Package which implements the online learning in R) Now to my problem : Recently, i have gained the opportunity (for my master thesis) to access an additional set of 7 weather experts who provide meterological forecast data like wind speed, direction, temperature and air pressure. My previous mentioned set of 2 experts who provide wind power forecasts also rely on meteorological experts and probably they use the same weather data as an input for their predictions, but i am not sure and i don't have insight to their models. They are black boxes to me. In my understanding i have a univariate regression problem, because i want to predict a future value based on a different set of experts; in the next step I would like to create a model which uses the wind power predictions of my 2 wind power experts and additionaly considers the meteorological data of 7 weather experts. I have read a lot of literature (mostly journal articles) on that combination topic but cannot yet decide how to combine my initial 2 forecasts with additional meteorological data. Obviously as a first step because of different units, i need to standardize, which is a topic on its own - still straightforward. But the next steps are a bit confusing, because i have so many approaches to build my regression model, especially considered in the broad field of statistics. In the field of computer science, Recurrent Neural networks - especially Long Short Term Memory for time series forecasting - seems to be a promising research avenue nowadays. I have to deep dive further in that topic to assess whether they fit to my problem or not. Any recommendation for suitable methods is highly appreciated!
