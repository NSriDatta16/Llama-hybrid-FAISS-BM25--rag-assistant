Regardless if this is "Possible", what algorithm would be the best approach? Sorry, but that's a nonsensical question. If something is impossible, then you can't search for the best approach to the problem. In this case, this definitely should be impossible because hashing is a one-way function: several inputs (infinite, in fact) can produce the same output. If the first bit of input on its own would somehow influence the probability of a specific hash value, this would mean that the hash algorithm is completely flawed. You certainly can train a neural network, linear classifier, SVM and whatnot to attempt prediction. And if you will be able to reliably predict the input from output for a certain hashing algorithm, this would prove that this algorithm is worthless. I'd say that for a widely used algorithm like SHA256 such a possibility is vanishingly low. However, it's a reasonable approach to quickly rule out new, unproven and untested hashing algorithms.
