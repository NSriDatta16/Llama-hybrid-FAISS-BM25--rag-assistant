How do I limit panning in Google maps API V3?

In V2 there was a way to limit panning/dragging so the map stays within certain bounds. How is that done in V3? Let's say I want the users to only look at Europe. I've already limited the zoom, but if I allow dragging (which I have to in this case, for other reasons) then the user can pan beyond the area I want to show. Please give working example or code snippet - I'm not an expert coder...
