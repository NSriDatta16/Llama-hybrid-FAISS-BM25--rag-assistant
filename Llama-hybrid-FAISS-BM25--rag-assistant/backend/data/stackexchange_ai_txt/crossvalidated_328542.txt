Neural Network for Multiple Float Output

I have a dataset containing 40 input columns and 12 output columns (float values). I suppose it is a regression problem and I am wondering, how to choose the ideal architecture of the neural network? I didn't find examples of neural network regression with multiple outputs. What is the right way to do it?
