First, only 24 observation (as given in a comment, not in the post itself) is woefully little for logistic regression, so you should not be surprised for the wide confidence intervals. More information about sample size requirements for logistic regression: Sample size for logistic regression? The reason for the shorter confidence intervals from the quasibinomial model is simple: (Dispersion parameter for quasibinomial family taken to be 0.11154) which indicates underdispersion , which is quite unusual. You should compare the lengths of the confidence intervals, and compare the ratio of the lengths to the estimated dispersion parameter. But first of all, ask yourself what could have caused the underdispersion. This can be caused by competition, which makes for dependence, like in counts of territorial birds where I have seen underdispersion. Since you have a time series, maybe there is negative autocorrelation. But it might also be an artifact of small sample size. You didn't tell us enough contextual information to help there ...
