Comment in answer format to show simulation: @periwinkle's Comment that the average takes non-interger values should be enough. However, the mean and variance of a Poisson random variable are numerically equal, and this is not true for the mean of independent Poisson random variables. Easy to verify by standard formulas for means of variances of linear combinations. Also illustrated by a simple simulation in R as below: set.seed(827) x1 = rpois(10^4, 5); x2 = rpois(10^4, 10); x3 = rpois(10^4, 20) t = x1+x2+x3; mean(t); var(t) [1] 35.0542 # mean & var both aprx 35 w/in margin of sim err [1] 35.14318 a = t/3; mean(a); var(a) [1] 11.68473 # obviously unequal for average of three [1] 3.904797 $E((X_1+X_2+X_3)/ 3) = 1/3(4 + 10 + 20) = 35/3,$ $Var((X_1+X_2+X_3)/3) = 1/9(5 + 10 + 20) = 35/9\ne 35/3.$
