I'm guessing it looks fake because every time you load the page it starts at the same number and counts upwards? Take a look at the javascript that tells you how many megabytes of email storage you get with a Gmail account. I think it bases the starting number on the date/time, so that if you load a page, watch it count up, and then load it again, it won't reload with a smaller number. Be honest though... it is fake right? You aren't showing precisely how many users there are and updating it live as new users create accounts. The goal then is to make sure it is somewhat close to reality. Hopefully the rate at which the number increases in your script is based on past new-user subscription rates.
