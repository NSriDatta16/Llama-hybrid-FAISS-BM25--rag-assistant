What makes logistic regression "different" from nonlinear least squares (NLS) is not the form of the fitted expectation but the model for the conditional distribution of the response. I see no benefit in trying to connect a straightforward nonlinear least squares problem (which would still be NLS after adding a $L_2$ penalty in the coefficients) to logistic regression (or another binomial GLM, like probit regression), which it's not especially closely related to nonlinear least squares except in the superficial sense that they have a rough similarity of appearance. If your response were of a kind that it might reasonably modelled by binomial counts, I could see a reason to start from logistic regression (a GLM) and move from there to a generalized non -linear model (GNM) in order to fit the functional form. We don't have that here.
