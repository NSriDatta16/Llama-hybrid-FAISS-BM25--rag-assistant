CSS to prevent child element from inheriting parent styles

Possible Duplicate: How do I prevent CSS inheritance? Is there a way to declare the CSS property of an element such that it will not affect any of its children or is there a way to declare CSS of an element to implement just the style specified and not inherit any of the style declared for its parents? A quick example HTML: Content of the paragraph Content of the span CSS: form div {font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;} div.content { /* Can anything go here? */ } Under normal circumstances one would expect the text block "Content of the paragraph" and "Content of the span" will both be 12px and bold. Is there a property to include in the CSS above in the "div.content" block that will prevent it from inheriting the declaration in the "#container form div" block to limit the style to just "content of the paragraph" and spare "Content of the span" including any other children div? If you are wondering why, well, I created a particular CSS file that gives all the forms on my project a particular feel and the div elements under the form all inherit the feel. No problem. But inside the form I want to use Flexigrid but flexigrid inherits the style and it just looks useless. If I use flexigrid outside the form and such it won't inherit the forms css, then it looks great. Otherwise it just looks terrible.
