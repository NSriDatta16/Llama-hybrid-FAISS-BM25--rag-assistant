In Econometrics a linear panel data model with the name fixed effects usually refers to estimating the within transformed model by OLS. What are the requirements for this model? Well, let us see. Model We assume a population model of the form: $$ y_t = x_t \beta +c+u_t, $$ where $y_t$ is $1\times 1$, $x_t$ is $1\times K$, $\beta$ is $K\times 1$, $c$ is $1\times 1$ and $u_t$ is $1\times 1$. The within transformation subtracts the individual average from all periods: $$ y_t-\bar y=(x_t-\bar x)\beta +(u_t-\bar u)\\ \tilde y_t = \tilde x_t \beta + \tilde u_t, $$ where $\sim$ indicates within transformed variables and $c$ disappears because it is time constant. Identification and consistency In order to achieve identification and estimate our parameters consistently we need two conditions fulfilled. The first is akin to the population orthogonality assumed in our pooled OLS. Basically we often assume: $$ E(u_{it}|x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_T,c_i)=0, ~ \forall t \in\{ 1,...T\}. $$ This assumption is often called strict exogeneity . This implies $E(\tilde u_t|\tilde x_t)=0$. The second assumption is a rank condition saying: $$ rank(E(\tilde x_t ' \tilde x_t^{\,}))=K $$ In most cases this just tells us to remember to remove time constant observables. Efficiency Under the following condition, the estimator is also efficient: $$ E(uu'|x,c)=\sigma_u^2 I_T $$ This basically rules out serial correlation in the (non-transformed) errors. This is usually not the case in empirical work, so that is why a robust variance-covariance matrix is often computed: $$ \hat{Avar}(\hat\beta)=(\tilde X' \tilde X)^{-1}\left(\sum^N_{i=1}\tilde x_i'\hat{\tilde u}_i\hat{\tilde u}'_i x_i\right)(\tilde X' \tilde X)^{-1}, $$ where big X is $x_i$'s stacked. Notice, we do not need normality of the $u$'s or the $\tilde u$'s.
