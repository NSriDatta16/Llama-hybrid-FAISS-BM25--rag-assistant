Private methods are not supposed to get a unit test. You are only supposed to unit test public methods. How a public method is organized internally does not matter to unit testing. A unit is not equal to a method. It is equal to a behavior that is possibly using more than one method to do its job. Mocking is also a useless thing to do. If you have to mock something, your method is really integrating functions. Your code is needing refactoring to make it only do one thing and then a wrapper method calls it and the to be mocked object to integrate it. Unit testing is something that sounds like you should do but in reality is a waste of effort that you are better to use in coding your application. Unit testing is no guarantee of better code quality and maybe it is making it worse because you are not spending enough time on your real code.
