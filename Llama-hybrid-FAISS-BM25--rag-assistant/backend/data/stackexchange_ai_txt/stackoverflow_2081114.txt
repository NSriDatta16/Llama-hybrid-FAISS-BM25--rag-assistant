Essentially it means that you have to manually update the fetched result every time to receive the latest changes of your source object. I just consulted your quoted documentation. The next paragraph after your quote should make it clear: The effect of a fetched property is similar to executing a fetch request yourself and placing the results in a transient attribute, although with the framework managing the details. In particular, a fetched property is not fetched until it is requested, and the results are then cached until the object is turned into a fault. You use refreshObject:mergeChanges: (NSManagedObjectContext) to manually refresh the propertiesâ€”this causes the fetch request associated with this property to be executed again when the object fault is next fired.
