Windows has used UTF-16 as its native representation since Windows 2000; prior to that it used UCS-2. UTF-16 supports any Unicode character; UCS-2 only supports the BMP. i.e. it will do the right thing. In general, though, it doesn't matter much, anyway. For most applications strings are pretty opaque, and just passed to some I/O mechanism (for storage in a file or database, or display on-screen, etc.) that will do the Right Thing. You just need to ensure you don't damage the strings at all.
