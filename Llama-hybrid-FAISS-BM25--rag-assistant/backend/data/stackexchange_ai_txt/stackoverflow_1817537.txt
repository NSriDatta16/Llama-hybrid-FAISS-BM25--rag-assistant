Implementing a dynamic sidebar in zend without calling an extra action

Currently trying to come up with a "best practice" for a ZF site that is both elegant and efficient. What I am trying to do is just generate data for a sidebar. In a couple of related questions and on other sources, the approach taken was to call another action from the sidebar part of your layout, or to add the sidebar action to an actionstack helper. These seemed very elegant, but add an extra request to the dispatch loop, which is very poor performance. I've seen people suggest view helpers that do a lot more than just formatting... Which seems semantically pretty poor. Is there a way to automate the sidebar data generation before the layout gets to it?
