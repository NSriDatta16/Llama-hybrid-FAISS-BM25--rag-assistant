Honestly, I am not sure why you want to do this in Excel. Nonetheless, ... A linear SVM requires solving a quadratic program with several linear constraints. You can check this answer [1] to find out how the quadratic program is setup. Once you setup the quadratic program and find a solver that can help you solve it in Excel, then you are good to go. On the other hand, the corresponding quadratic program has a dual that gives rise to the notion of kernels. The objective function for the dual can be found here [2]. If you can find a quadratic program solver in Excel, you might as well solve the dual, which will allow you to solve problems beyond linear kernels. If you don't have a QP solver at hand, then you can write the SMO algorithm [3] which solves the SVM dual. The provided link gives you a pseudocode. SMO is one of the simplest algorithms to solve the SVM dual, but also the slowest. For a small number of training data, it should be pretty fast, however. [1] Given a set of points in two dimensional space, how can one design decision function for SVM? [2] Non-linear SVM classification with RBF kernel [3] http://cs229.stanford.edu/materials/smo.pdf
