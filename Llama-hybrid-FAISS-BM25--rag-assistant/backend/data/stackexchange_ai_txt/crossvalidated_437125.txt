Causality between two binary time series

I have the following sample of a big data frame: Time (ms) Signal_1 Signal_2 0 0 0 1 0 0 2 0 1 3 0 0 4 1 0 5 0 0 6 0 0 . . . . . . . . . 996 1 1 997 0 0 998 0 0 Signal_1 represents if a heart beat occurred in person X in Time i . Signal_2 represents if a heart beat occurred in person Y in Time i . Time (ms) is the Time i and the index of the data frame. Time = 0 represents the begin of the experiment. Time = 1000 represents the first second passed after the begin of the experiment. Since the signals are nominal (boolean), how can I use VAR and Granger Causality to say if Signal_1 causes Signal_2 ? Is there any way to calculate correlation between these binary time series data?
