Repeated measures mixed model multinomial logistic regression

I have 1 continuous IV (cognitive ability) and 1 ordinal IV (task difficulty), that predict a categorical DV with 3 levels (type1, type2, type3), hence the multinomial logistic regression. Each subject did 3 tasks, hence the repeated measure. Is there a way to do this in SPSS (preferable) are R? Could anyone point me to a similar example?
