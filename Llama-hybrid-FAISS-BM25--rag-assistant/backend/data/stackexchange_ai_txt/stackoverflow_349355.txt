I'm not sure it's a good idea to establish too strong a connection between the resource files and the code files that use them, since it could lead to unnecessary duplication of texts that could be reused. This is especially problematic when the texts are translated by a third party, since the same expression, when occurring multiple times in different files, might be translated differently, which can greatly confuse the user. I'd structure the resource files separately, and try to find an organization that makes sense inherently, e.g. UiLabels.properties, ErrorMessages.properties.
