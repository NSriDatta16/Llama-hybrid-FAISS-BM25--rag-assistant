Many time series models assume Gaussian error terms, meaning that all real numbers are possibilities. In that sense, negative values are fine. Those negative values might indicate undesirable outcomes (e.g., losses instead of profits), but you might be modeling something that sometimes has such events (e.g., stock returns). If youâ€™re in a framework that assumes positive values (modeling counts or distances, for instance), then you have a problem.
