Using jQuery drag and drop to vote

I'm using jQuery's drag and drop plugin, and here's what I'd like to do. I have 3 containers. [Droppable 1] [Draggable] [Droppable 2] Number: 3 ----------------- Number: 5 Under [Droppable 1] and [Droppable 2], there will be a current number, stored in one of my tables. I'd like to be able to take the [Draggable] and drop it to either [Droppable 1] or [Draggable 2] and from there, it will update (increment) the number with some ajax and maybe the jQuery fade function. The problem is, I'm not sure what I need to do to bind the specific vote to the specific Droppable container. I'd also like to restrict the user from voting more than once, but I suppose I can dig around to figure that out. I've been asking around in #jquery on freenode, but I've been getting ignored. Maybe this is too basic, but I'm such a jQuery noob.
