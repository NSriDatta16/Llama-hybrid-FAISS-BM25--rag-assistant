Imputed values are showing individual frequency distribution

I used SPSS to impute missing values in my dataset. After imputation I ran a frequency distribution. In the table, I see that the missing values which have been imputed are shown as separate frequency. For example, I have a variable, CAT which has 2 levels of n (1=20 and 2=20) and missing values which have been categorised as -9 (assigned as missing). Suppose if the number of missing values are 5. After imputation, In the frequency distribution, I get level 1=20, 2=20, but the imputed values are shows individual frequency like 1=1, 2=1 and so on for all 5 imputed values. I tried recoding the imputed values into same variables as 1 and 2 but they still lie as separate entities in frequency distribution and logistic regression. Can anyone help with this issue.
