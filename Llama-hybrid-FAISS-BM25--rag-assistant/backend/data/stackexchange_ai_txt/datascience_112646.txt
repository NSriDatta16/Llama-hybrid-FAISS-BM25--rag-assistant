The difference between high-quality sensors and low-quality ones could be regarded as noise. That's why you can either use a noise suppression algorithm or autoencoders based on high-quality sensors that could calibrate low-quality signals. Autoencoders are used in many fields including images , and it works also for signals . In addition to that, you should have low and high-quality sensors that record signals in the same environment, in order to train them correctly by having low-quality data as input and high-quality data as output. If trained with many samples, you should have eventually good results that convert low-quality data into high ones.
