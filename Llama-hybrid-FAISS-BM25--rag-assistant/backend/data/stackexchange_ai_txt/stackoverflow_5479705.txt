dimension reduction of matrix TFIDF

I calculate the TFIdf(term frequency,inverse document frequency) and i have seen that after this step it is necessary to reduce the dimension of My Matrix with using methods like LSI ,chi -square test..., I haven't any idea how i can implement chi square test in java for dimensionality reduction of matrix TFIDF,if there is some library to do this or tutorial in which they explain how i can do this, tell me please
