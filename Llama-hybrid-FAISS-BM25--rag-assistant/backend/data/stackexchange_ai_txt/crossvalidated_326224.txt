It looks like an RNN would be a good model for your problem. They can deal with time-series sequences of different lengths. Basically they implements in their internal state a memory mechanism which allow to "remember" what happened in order to consider the past for taking decision about the future. However they are quite generic models and can be used in lots of domains. In general you can find different types of RNNs, probably the common ones are the LSTM and the GRU . In my opinion on Colah's blog there is a great explanation of LSTM If, instead, you are looking for something more practical I would suggest the PyTorch tutorial .
