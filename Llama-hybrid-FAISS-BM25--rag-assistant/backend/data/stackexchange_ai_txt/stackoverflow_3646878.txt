I'm surprised no one has mentioned the MoreLINQ project yet. It was started by Jon Skeet and has gained some developers along the way. From the project's page: LINQ to Objects is missing a few desirable features. This project will enhance LINQ to Objects with extra methods, in a manner which keeps to the spirit of LINQ. Take a look at the Operators Overview wiki page for a list of implemented operators. It is certainly a good way to learn from some clean and elegant source code.
