I had the same warning for the following code: class Interface { public: virtual void A() = 0; }; class Implementation : public virtual Interface { public: virtual void A() {}; }; class ExtendedInterface : public virtual Interface { virtual void B() = 0; }; class ExtendedImplementation : public ExtendedInterface , public Implementation { public: virtual void B() {}; }; This bug report for Visual C++ 2005 in msdn suggests that this is a known bug that was considered not important enough to fix... They suggest to disable the warning in this case by using a pragma. I think it is safe also in your case, but you should use virtual inheritance as shown in the answer by Gal Goldman.
