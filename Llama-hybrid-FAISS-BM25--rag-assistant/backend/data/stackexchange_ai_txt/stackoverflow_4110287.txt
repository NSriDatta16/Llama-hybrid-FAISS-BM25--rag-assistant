I would put an initialization check in the getInstance() method: public static MySingleton getInstance() { if (! isInitialized) initialize(); return instance; } ... and make the initialize() method private. EDIT : Apparently I misunderstood the question. The main issue is whether the initObject() should be inside or outside the constructor. The correct answer may depend on the actual problem, but I think it should generally be inside the constructor, because if the sole purpose of putting the initObject() method outside the constructor is to tell everyone where initialization happens, you might as well write a comment: // Attention everyone!! Object is initialized here!!1!11! MySingleton instance = MySingleton.getInstance(); // Object is NOT initialized here!!11!1!! MySingleton instance2 = MySingleton.getInstance();
