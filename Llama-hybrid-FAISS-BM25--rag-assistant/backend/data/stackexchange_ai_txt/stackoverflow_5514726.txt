Latin inflection:

I have a database of words (including nouns and verbs). Now I would like to generate all the different (inflected) forms of those nouns and verbs. What would be the best strategy to do this? As Latin is a highly inflected language, there is: a) the declension of nouns b) the conjugation of verbs See this translated page for an example of a verb's conjugation ("mandare"): conjugation I don't want to type in all those forms for all the words manually. How can I generate them automatically? What is the best approach? a list of complex rules how to inflect all the words Bayesian methods ... There's a program called "William Whitaker's Words". It creates inflections for Latin words as well, so it's exactly doing what I want to do. Wikipedia says that the program works like this: Words uses a set of rules based on natural pre-, in-, and suffixation, declension, and conjugation to determine the possibility of an entry. As a consequence of this approach of analysing the structure of words, there is no guarantee that these words were ever used in Latin literature or speech, even if the program finds a possible meaning to a given word. The program's source is also available here . But I don't really understand how this is to work. Can you help me? Maybe this would be the solution to my question ...
