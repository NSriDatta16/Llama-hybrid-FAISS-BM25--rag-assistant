Entity Framework 4 missing features?

I'm well aware that similair topics have been brought up before e.g. Entity Framework 4 vs NHibernate But instead of arguments like: NHibernate have been around longer and is more mature EF4 is drag n drop and not enterprisy EF4 and LinqToSql are ... I would like to see a more detailed list of features that you consider missing from EF4. Personally, I think the lack of enum support is the biggest drawback of EF4.
