No, I don't think you'd use cURL for TDD. Using cURL would imply communicating with a remote service, which would be an integration test. Are you talking about this? http://www.viget.com/extend/curl-and-your-rails-2-app/ In that post, cURL isn't being used in the rails app at all. It's being used on the terminal to test/demo the app's REST service, not in a TDD fashion. cURL is good for this purpose because its many options allow you to simulate different headers from user agents, such as language acceptance, characterset acceptance, cache usage, etc...
