The way you deploy your package and store your package in your local project solution can be different. You can save sensitive data with a password when saving your packages locally and "rely on server storage and roles for access control" when deploying the package. Although the data will not be stored in an encrypted format in the msdb database, you can restrict access to the password information by managing pre-existing database roles.
