I presume you mean you want to snap to a grid after the user has finished dragging. In this case, you can make use of the draggable's stop event and calculate the element's offset. Assume you have a draggable contained within a parent element, starting at offset (0, 0), which is the top-left hand corner. You then apply a regular draggable effect to the element, and on stop you calculate its position and snap it to the nearest "cell". The code for this would look something like: $(el).draggable({ stop: function(e, ui) { var elem = ui.helper, left = elem.position().left, top = elem.position().top; elem.css({ left: left - (left%10), top: top - (top%10) }); } }); This code will always snap based on the element's top-left pixel co-ordinate, and relies on the element being absolutely positioned and the parent being non-statically positioned (relative, absolute, etc.) ** Edit ** I have created a quick demo - http://jsfiddle.net/LQwMe/1/
