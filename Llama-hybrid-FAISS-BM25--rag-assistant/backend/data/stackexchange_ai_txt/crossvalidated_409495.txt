It can be illuminating to look at a logistic regression for, say, disease ( $D$ ) with two dichotomous explanatory variables, say $E$ [1=exposed, 0=unexposed] and $G$ [1=female, 0=male]. If one considers : $p=pr(D) : logit(p) = \beta_0 +\beta_1 E + \beta_2 G + \beta_3 GE$ , then $\beta_0$ is the log odds of disease for unexposed men and $\beta_1$ is the log odds ratio specific to men. If however, one considers $logit(p) = \beta_0 +\beta_1 E + \beta_2 G$ then $\beta_0$ does not have a simple or useful interpretation. Here $\beta_1$ is the log odds ratio assumed common to men and woman. Additive models [i.e. models without products of the explanatory variables] can have many caveats in the interpretations of the regression coefficients. As well, the fit of your model with 8 explanatory variables may be facing issues of multicollinearity. Sometimes, it can be best to try a much simpler non-additive model to understand the issues at play.
