TOAD "Credential retrieval failed" error

Semi-regularly when using TOAD, I will try to connect to a DB and get the error "ORA-12638 Credential retrieval failed". I have to restart my TOAD to get past this. It's a pain if I have other connections active. Does anyone know how to avoid or get around this error? Thanks
