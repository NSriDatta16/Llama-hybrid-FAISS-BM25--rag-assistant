@whuber is right that there isn't an orientation that's intrinsic to the data, but you could still enforce that your eigenvectors have positive correlation with some reference vector. For instance, you could make the loadings for USD positive on all your eigenvectors (i.e., if USD's loading is negative, flip the signs of the entire vector). The overall direction of your vector is still arbitrary (since you could have used EUR or ZAR as your reference instead), but the first few axes of your PCA probably won't jump around nearly as much--especially because your rolling windows are so long.
