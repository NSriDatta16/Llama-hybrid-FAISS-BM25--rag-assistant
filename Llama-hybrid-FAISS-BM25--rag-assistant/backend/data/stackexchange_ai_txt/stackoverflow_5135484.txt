Arnaud, from my own experience, from reading, and from talking to experienced developers: When it comes to supporting multiple screen sizes and with localization, there are no magic bullets. For localization put all your strings in resource files, or even in data files. As far as the screen sizes, I would not try to be too clever. Yes, make sure that none of your business / non-GUI logic gets duplicated, but duplicating resource files, forms, etc - I would not worry about it. Some GUI frameworks like Qt and GTK auto-resize and auto-position GUI-widgets (e.g. Qt has 'spacer' widgets). It works OK most of the time, however I still prefer explicit control. With GUI programming, there are often unexpected glitches, having three independent sets of GUI components will allow you to address them, should they arise. Some example sources of problems: 1) Font sizing. 2) Windows accessibility settings. 3) Some national languages have longer average words than others, the long words have trouble fitting in the real estate available. If I were in your shoes, I would look for example how browsers handle this (e.g. mobile vs. desktop version) and I would try to find some practical advice on the Web (like here at SO). I doubt that books on design patterns will help much with this. Disclaimer: I am a design-pattern skeptic.
