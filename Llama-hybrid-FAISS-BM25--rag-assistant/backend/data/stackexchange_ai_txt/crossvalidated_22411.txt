I have been wondering this myself , and here are my tentative conclusions. I would be happy if anyone could supplement/correct this with their knowledge and any references on this topic. If you want to test hypotheses about logistic regression coefficients by checking statistical significance, you need to model the correlation across observations (or otherwise correct for non-independence) because otherwise your standard errors will be too small, at least when you are considering within-cluster effects. But regression coefficients are unbiased even with correlated observations, so it should be fine to use such a model for prediction. In predictive modeling, you should not need to explicitly account for the correlation when training your model, whether you are using logistic regression or some other approach. However, if you want to use a holdout set for validation or computation of out-of-sample error, you would want to ensure that observations for each individual appeared only in one set, either training or validation but not both. Otherwise your model will be predicting for individuals it already has some information about and you're not getting a true read on the out-of-sample classification ability.
