VGG16 is Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model developed by researchers at the University of Oxford and (at present) attains cutting edge results when applied to the ImageNet dataset. The architecture relies on a series of convolutions + RELU, max pooling, fully connected layers + RELU, and a soft max layer at the end.
