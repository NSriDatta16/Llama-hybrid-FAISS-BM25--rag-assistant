Formulate a dataset as follows: time_takes priority task_1 1.0 7.4 task_2 1.5 4.6 ... ... ... task_n 1.2 9.3 You can "organize" the events by sorting the columns. Typically, saying "priority" assumes a highest-priority-first-completed structure... I assume that was not really what you were looking for, though the wording of the question was vague. If you want to optimize, this generally means solving some set of equations with constraints, often using a min() or max() function and some constraints on your parameters. One way to do this is to say "utility" instead of "priority." Each task generates you some utility, but takes some time, and you have limited time and want to get the most utility. This means you do the following... $$ \max_u \{\sum_i task_i(u_i,\tau_i)\} \\ s.t. \sum_i \tau_i \leq T \\ \text{where:} \\ \tau_i = \text{time to complete task } i \\ u_i = \text{utility from task } i \\ T = \text{total time (= B - A)} \\ $$
