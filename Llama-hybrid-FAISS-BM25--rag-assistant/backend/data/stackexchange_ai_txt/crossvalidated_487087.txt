reference source for multivariate gaussian processes

I'm studying Gaussian processes and currently reading the standard reference Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning . However, so far I didn't see any example of a multivariate Gaussian process nor did I find a reference in the Index. So I'm looking for a good source for the (theoretical) treatment with application of multivariate Gaussian Processes.
