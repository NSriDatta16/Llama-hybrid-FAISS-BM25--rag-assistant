+1 this is confusing. If your time series has length $N$ and frequency $p$, then the so-called "coefficients" (which can be accessed as HW$coeff if HW is the object returned by HoltWinters ) are exactly the values $a[N]$, $b[N]$ and $s[N-p+1]$, $s[N-p+2], \cdots s[N]$ where these are defined by the formulas in the Holt Winters help page, which can be accessed from within R with ?HoltWinters . For the additive model, which is the default, suppose my.ts is a time series object with positive frequency $p$. The values of $a[N-1]$, $b[N-1]$ and all the earlier $s[t]$ up to $s[N-p]$ are given in the table HoltWinters(my.ts)$fitted . The values in HoltWinters(my.ts)$coeff are calculated from these using the formulas $$a[t] = α (Y[t] - s[t-p]) + (1-α) (a[t-1] + b[t-1])$$ $$b[t] = β (a[t] - a[t-1]) + (1-β) b[t-1]$$ with $t=N$ and $\alpha = $ HoltWinters(my.ts)$alpha , $\beta = $ HoltWinters(my.ts)$beta , and $$s[t] = γ (Y[t] - a[t]) + (1-γ) s[t-p]$$ with $t=N-p+1, \ldots, N$ and $\alpha = $ HoltWinters(my.ts)$alpha , $\beta = $ HoltWinters(my.ts)$beta , and $\gamma = $ HoltWinters(my.ts)$gamma . This works for $a$ and $b$ (the level and trend) but when I do the calculation for the seasonals, I get slightly different values (within 5% or so) than are given in the output. I hope somebody can edit this answer to explain what is going on with the seasonals. Here is a link to the C code for the hw function which is called by the HoltWinters function: https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/src/library/stats/src/HoltWinters.c
