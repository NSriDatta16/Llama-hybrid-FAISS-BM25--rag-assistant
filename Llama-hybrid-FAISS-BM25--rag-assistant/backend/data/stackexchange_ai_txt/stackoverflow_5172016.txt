This is normal behavior - the "spaces" you are referring to are considered whitespace. You can read about how whitespace behaves in HTML here . You have four basic options: Replace the line breaks with HTML line breaks at run-time using PHP's nl2br function (easy... if you do this, also wrap the whole description in a tag) Wrap the description in tags (easy but not recommended as it is not semantically correct and will probably cause unintended styling headaches) Parse your description at run-time into actual paragraphs, wrapped in HTML tags Compose your textual content with HTML markup in the first place so that it gets stored in the database that way (this is how most content management systems work)
