Why thread specific data is required in pthread?

all the threads share memory location. For example a global variable changes in one thread will reflect in another thread. Since each thread has its own stack, the local variables that are created inside the thread is unique. In this case, why do we need to go for thread specific data mechanism?. Can't it be achieved by auto storage varibles inside the thread function ? Kindly clarify!!!. BR Rj
