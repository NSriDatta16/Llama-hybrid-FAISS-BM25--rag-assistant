While I'm no expert in choice modeling, I believe I know enough about GLM's and have read a thing or two about choice modeling and I think I can help you. If your response is binary, it doesn't make sense to use a multinomial logit. A multinomial logit is, under the hood, a bunch of logistic regressions of one vs all other categories. I don't know how your data is organized, nor what is the standard in choice modeling, but if the respondent was confronted with 2 products, and each of them has a few characteristics each with a different factor, your data should be organized in the following manner: choice respondent_id publicgoodtype1 publicgoodtype2 price1 price2 1 1 Library Park 5 10 0 1 Museum Park 10 25 1 2 Museum Library 10 5 Where choice may be standardized as 'chose the first option or not'. This way, we have the covariates of both products determining the choice. If the product has a name, such as product A which is a library, product B which is a museum, and product C which is a park, each with its own characteristics, we can set up the table for a multinomial logit as: choice respondent_id publicgoodtype1 publicgoodtype2 price1 price2 A 1 Library Park 5 10 C 1 Museum Park 10 25 B 2 Museum Library 10 5 With this setup, I believe you are able to calculate willingness-to-pay.
