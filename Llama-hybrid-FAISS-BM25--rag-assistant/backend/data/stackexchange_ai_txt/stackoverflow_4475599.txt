Defining Strings in res/values/string.xml?

What's the point of defining strings in xml at the res/values/string.xml directory? Is it more efficient than just defining the strings as constants within your classes? (e.g. Database table creation scripts, etc..) Is it a matter of organization or is there some benefit in how Android handles these objects in memory?
