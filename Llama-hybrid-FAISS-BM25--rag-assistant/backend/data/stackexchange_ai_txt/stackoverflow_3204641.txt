I migrated from Infragistics to DevExpress. Will never go back to Infragistics as their objects are much heavier and performance is not too great. Documentation is terrible and their examples are very juevenile. Infragistics data grid inline editing (Excel like) is a nice feature which is not available in DevExpress. Other than that, data grid, master, detail setup, data grid dropdown list declaration and other feature are much more streamlined in DevExpress.
