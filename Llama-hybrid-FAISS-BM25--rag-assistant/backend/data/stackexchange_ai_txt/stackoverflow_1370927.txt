In another project (developed using 2.2.1) I did this by setting my UITableView' s background opacity to 0%, and then simply layering a UIImageView behind it using Interface Builder. This allowed me to have a fixed background regardless of the table state. You can also set the background of the UITableView to be an image instead, but then the background scrolls with the table. (I don't have the code handy at the moment, but I got the tip a while back on the Apple developer forums). Note that this can cause some performance issues. Apple discourages using transparency whenever possible because the GPUs on the pre-3GS models aren't particularly beefy.
