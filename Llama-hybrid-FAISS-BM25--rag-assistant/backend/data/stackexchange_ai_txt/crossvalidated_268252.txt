If I have a lot of right censored case, would it be easier to use logistic regression instead of survival analysis?

Background I am still learning survival analysis, and try to understand why we cannot use linear or logistic regression on it. This question helped me a lot. Question When I am reading some tutorials another question pops in my mind: suppose we have a poor experiment design and the observation window is very short, and we have a lot of right censored cases, let's say it is 70% right censored vs 30% died in the observation window. In such a case, would survival analysis still applicable and "preferred approach" comparing to logistic regression? The reason I think logistic regression will do well is that, it is a nice binary classification problem. But in survival analysis, the response variable would have "low resolution" because of the right censored cases. And should predicting a contentious number is "harder" than predicting a binary label?
