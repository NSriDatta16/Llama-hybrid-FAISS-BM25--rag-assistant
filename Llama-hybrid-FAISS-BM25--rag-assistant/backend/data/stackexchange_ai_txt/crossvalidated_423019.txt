Using ML algorithms like decision trees, support vector machines, neural networks for panel data

Someone has already asked here and here on this but no one has answered yet in terms of predictive modelling. If I have a panel dataset of customers, their demographics and their order amount in dollars in a day over a period of time, how would I implement ML models(Neural network or standard ML like decision tree, logistic regression), say to forecast their next order amount or which specific item they are likely to order or whether they are going to order anything in the next week? Goal is to create customized engagement campaigns to improve conversion/revenue.
