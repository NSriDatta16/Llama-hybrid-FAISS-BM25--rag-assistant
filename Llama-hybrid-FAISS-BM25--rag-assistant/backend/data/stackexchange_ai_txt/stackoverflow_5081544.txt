I would say that the task is impossible to do with a high degree of confidence unless the data is in a fixed format, or you have a gigantic address database to make matches against. You could possibly get away with having a list of countries, and then a rule set per country that you use. The American rule set could include a list of states, cities and postal codes and a pattern to find street addresses. You would then drop anything that isn't either a state, city postal code or looks like a street address. You'd still drop things that should be a part of an address though, at least with Swedish addresses, that can include just the name of a farm instead of a street and number. If US country side addresses are the same there is just no way to know what is a part of an address and what isn't unless you have access to a database with all US addresses. :-)
