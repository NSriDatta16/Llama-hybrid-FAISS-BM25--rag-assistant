The D: drive has to exist as a local drive, not a mapped drive. (Unless there's some way to force that to be mapped for other users who aren't logged on of which I am unaware) Also, as far as permissions, it could be just about anything related to the account that the agent is running under. You might need to put some logging into your C# process assuming it's starting your process at all. If it's not starting your process, it could be some permissions on that account related to the directory or even the .NET framework settings. Also, you can use Windows to audit the failures to see which file it's attempting to open. If you add the agent account temporarily to the administrators group and it works, then this points to permissions being the source of the not terribly helpful “The system cannot find the file specified” error.
