To add what all the others said: All these equations work kinda well in practice, but if you need to be very precise you have to first convert the color to linear color space (apply inverse image-gamma), do the weight average of the primary colors and - if you want to display the color - take the luminance back into the monitor gamma. The luminance difference between ingnoring gamma and doing proper gamma is up to 20% in the dark grays.
