The decision whether to include the .NET redistributables depends on whether you expect your users to have Internet access on installation or not. If they are online, you can include a Bootstrapper that will download all requirements (there's one on codeproject.com, I think). If they are more likely to be offline, just include the redistributables. You may want to include the Client Profile, though there's no supported Offline version - but you can easily extract the installers from the full package (it's about 22MB then). Go with Windows Forms if you don't actually need WPF. This way, you can stick with .NET 2.0 (and can support Windows 2000). If Windows Forms is not enough or you really, really need LINQ, go with the 3.5 Client Profile. On the other hand, utilities for many games are written in Windows Forms with .NET 2.0 and simply require the framework, which seems to go well enough with average users. Remember that Vista has 3.0 pre-installed, and Seven has 3.5 SP1 pre-installed. XP installations may have 2.0 from some application or Windows Update.
