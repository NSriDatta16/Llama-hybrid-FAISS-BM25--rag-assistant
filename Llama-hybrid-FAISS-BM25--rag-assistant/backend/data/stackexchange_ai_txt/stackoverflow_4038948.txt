The past five years have seen an increase of web application developers eschewing the common wisdom of of the late 20th and early 21st century by creating applications and require javascript as a baseline technology. Magento is following this trend because they want to provide a moden, AJAX enabled experience, and providing both a Javascript and non-Javascript experience increases both development and testing time. Most decisions in the e-commerce industry come down to the ROI of increased sales. Magento has calculated/bet/decided that sales lost due to people having Javascript off are less than the cost of developing both a javascript and non-javascript experience. As for their use of the HTML button attribute, Magento isn't a web page, it's a web application. Their architecture takes a Java like approach, including a UI that's abstracted away from the browser. This means PHP is used to tame the browser rather than using PHP to work with the browser. In this context button elements (driven by Javascript) make more sense. Take a look at Google Web Tools for another example of this. The way to "get around" this is to not use Magento, or to customize Magento such that it fits your model of what web development should be. If your first response to this is "woah, that would take way too much time", then congratulations, you're thinking exactly the same way that Magento is. Magento, the company, isn't Microsoft, or Oracle, or SAP. They're a 200 person company, and expecting them to solve all your problems (for free) isn't realistic. Welcome to 2010.
