Are rewards in reinforcement learning scale and shift invariant?

Say I have a reinforcement learning environment with a reward function $f$ , and hypothesizing that there is a single best policy, can we state that the final policy is the same for all the functions in the class: $$ r = c \cdot f,\,\,\,\, c \in \mathbb{R+}\\ or\\ r = c + f,\,\,\,\, c \in \mathbb{R} $$ Example: given a game, having a reward function that gives +1 if you win and -1 if you lose, if it's the same of having 0 for loss and 2 for win and so on
