I think the only way that .NET gets fragmented is if we see version of the .NET framework not being supported on servers. In my experience, this has not been the case in any of my work environments. Android is fragmented because the 'devices' themselves are not supporting updated versions of the Android OS. I don't consider multiple tools to do the job 'fragmentation'.
