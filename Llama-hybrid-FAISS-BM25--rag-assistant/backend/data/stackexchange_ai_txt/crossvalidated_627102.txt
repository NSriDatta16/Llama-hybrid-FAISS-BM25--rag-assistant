I think there are two answers to this: If $X$ is has more dimensions then it's not straight forward to sample even if you can easily calculate $p_X(x)$ You don't actually need $p_X(\tilde X_j)$ . What you need is $c\cdot p_X(\tilde X_j)$ , which means something that is proportional to $p_X$ is sufficient and Bayesian statistics produces those (almost) every time you multiply prior and likelihood, which is kind of the core idea of Bayesian statistics. Here's an explanation: https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/444845/341520
