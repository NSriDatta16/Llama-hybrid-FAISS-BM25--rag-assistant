How can I drag and drop canvases within a Vbox to re-order?

I'm getting up to speed with Flex and I am looking for any example of implementing a drag and drop re-sort within a vbox container. Basically I have a Vbox that contains a number of canvas's that are full width and 35px high. I want to be able to drag and drop them to re-order within the vbox. Any help is greatly appreciated - thanks, b
