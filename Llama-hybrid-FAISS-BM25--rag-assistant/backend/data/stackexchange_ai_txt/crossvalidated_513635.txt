Complete separation shouldn't be a problem for random forest. Complete separation causes the likelihood function in logistic regression not to have a maximum (and switching labels is not the recommended approach for solving this). Random forest does not have a likelihood function and hence can not suffer from the same problem. in fact, if the hyperplane which separates the cases lies in the direction of one of the standard basis vectors, then a random forest might perform very very well.
