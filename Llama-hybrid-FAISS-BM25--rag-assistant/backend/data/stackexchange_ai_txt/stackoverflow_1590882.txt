Alternatives are: ranges of ids , which are difficult to implement and to enforce. They are very hard to manage, is difficult to provision an new site/range and is even more difficult to cope with retired sites/ranges. composite keys , (siteId, EntityId) are better than ranges but require upfront design and may cause problems on queries that aggregate multiple/all sites (central DWs) because the leftmost key in all indexes (siteId) is not specified. GUIDs . In theory they are perfect as they guarantee uniqueness (they may conflict in theory, I'm yet to see a true guid conflict). In practice they are very poor clustered key choices because of the size (16 bytes) and because of the fragmentation. Still, they are much easier to get right than the composite key approach.
