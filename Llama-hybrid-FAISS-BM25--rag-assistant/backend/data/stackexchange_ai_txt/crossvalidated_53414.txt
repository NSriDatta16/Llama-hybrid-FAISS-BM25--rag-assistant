principal components analysis is creating correlated axes with nested data

I'm trying to do a principal components analysis with the aim of turning my set of correlated variables into a set of uncorrelated ones (rather than dimension reduction). However, the data are nested, and when I account for this nesting some of my components are highly correlated. Specifically, my original variables are measured at multiple sites within a number of forest patches. When I run a standard PCA none of the principal components are correlated across the dataset as a whole, but when I model one component as a function of another in a mixed effects model which includes patch as a random factor, the relationship between some pairs of components is highly significant. Can someone please tell me if there is a way to do a PCA while accounting for nested data structure, or if not, if there is another approach I could use to convert a set of correlated variables into a set of uncorrelated ones while accounting for nesting? Thank you for your help, Jay
