reference symbols on the main timeline

this is one of those upsurdly basic questions for which google does not work. I have usually dispatched events from my classes and dealt with the user interface in the document class. But now i want to separate all the UI in a separate class, accessible by other classes. I have added it as a child to the main/document class, but how do i reference the main class without going through parent.parent shananigans? edit. one more thing i remembered. Some of my UI elements are not programatically added. here is the code i have. i get possibly undefined property error. package rpflash.ui { import flash.display.Sprite; import flash.display.MovieClip; import flash.display.Stage; import nowplaying; public class RPUserInterface{ public function RPUserInterface(){ var np:nowplaying = new nowplaying(); MovieClip(this.root).addChild(np); } } }
