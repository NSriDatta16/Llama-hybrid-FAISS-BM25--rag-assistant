Sure it's safe. A lot of people stub out and have 2-3 layers for data access to in the end just make sure your code is clean. How you get your objects is up to you and I think being pragmatic is the bets way to go about it. I think having a single Repository/Service class for a given type to help abstract out particular queries that are re-used is great but there's nothing long with exposing the context directly in the controller.
