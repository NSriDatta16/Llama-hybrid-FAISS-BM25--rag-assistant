Machine Learning Procedure for Fractional/Proportional Data?

I am looking for some suggestions of machine learning procedures that work to predict fraction outcomes where the outcome variables $\in [0,1]$. Can you provide me with any suggestions? I thought about using gradient boosting, but I believe this only works on binary data 0 or 1. I believe there are non-linearities in my data, so I'd like to use something similar to GBM that will take into account non-linear relationships. I've been looking and still can't seems to find a machine learning procedure for this. Any help would be appreciated.
