How can I obtain the distribution of the number of customers in a non-starionary MM1 queue given an interval partition of stationary transitions?

I am considering this transient solution for the probability mass function over the number of "customers" in an MM1 queue: $$ p(k; t, i, \lambda, \mu) =\\ \exp \left( - (\lambda + \mu) t \right) \left[ \rho^{\frac{k-i}{2}} I_{k-i}(at) + \rho^{\frac{k-i-1}{2}} I_{k+i+1}(at) + (1 - \rho) \rho \sum_{j=k+i+2}^{\infty} \rho^{\frac{-j}{2}} I_{j}(at) \right] \tag{1}$$ where $\lambda$ is the arrival rate $\mu$ is the service rate $t$ is time $\rho := \frac{\lambda}{\mu}$ $a := 2 \sqrt{\lambda \mu}$ $I_{\bullet}(\bullet)$ is the modified Bessel function of the first kind Since a MM1 queue is a continuous time Markov chain I figure that I could rely on the Markov property to generalize somewhat. The purpose of this generalization is to predict probabilities without performing multiple runs of discrete-event simulation . A possible application is distribution forecasts where the day-of-year or day-of-week effects are forecasted and the only sources of non-stationarity. Suppose $t \in T = [0, \tau]$ is assigned an interval partition such that for every element of the partition designated by a time $\tau_h$ we assign $\lambda_{\tau_h}$ and $\mu_{\tau_h}$ . For a given interval $T_{\tau_{h}} := [\tau_{h-1}, \tau_{h}]$ of the partition equation (1) holds in for inputs $p(k_t; t, k_{\tau_{h-1}}, \lambda_{\tau_h}, \mu_{\tau_h})$ provided that $t \in T_{\tau_{h}}$ . My intuition is that this new process is also a Markov process conditioned on $k_0$ . My hope is some functional using (1) would do the trick. How can I obtain the distribution of the number of customers in a non-starionary MM1 queue given an interval partition of stationary transitions??
