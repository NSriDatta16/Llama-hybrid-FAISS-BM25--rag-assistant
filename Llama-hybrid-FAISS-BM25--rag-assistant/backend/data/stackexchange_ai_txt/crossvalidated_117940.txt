To answer your specific question, the reason the two approaches are giving different results is that you are parsing the variance differently in the two approaches. (To see this, look at the numerator and denominator of the 2 F ratios, and the associated mean squares and df.) In general, there can be more than one logical way to parse the variance in a research study, such as with or without blocks. Beyond this specific answer, under some circumstances you might expect more (or fewer) differences between the two approaches. For example, it may be that your 8 examples are not fungible. It may be that one approach has more variance and is driving the single accuracy score. Have you looked at the average difficulty of each of the 8 examples? More importantly, if the 8 examples are unique to each of the 63 levels of the IV, then there is no basis for parsing out the variance due to examples. If you have 8*63 examples, the overall accuracy approach seems most appropriate. Parenthetically, did you set up your original analysis as a repeated measures approach (because your are collecting data on 63 types of stimuli from each participant)?
