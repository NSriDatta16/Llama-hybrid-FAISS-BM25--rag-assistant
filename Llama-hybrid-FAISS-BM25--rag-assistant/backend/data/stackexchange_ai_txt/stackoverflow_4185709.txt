The paragraph you cite from the C++ Standard reads (C++03 7.1.1/6): Objects declared const and not explicitly declared extern have internal linkage. You have not declared an object. You have declared a reference. A reference is not an object. That said, 3.5/3 says: A name having namespace scope has internal linkage if it is the name of an object or reference that is explicitly declared const and neither explicitly declared extern nor previously declared to have external linkage However, 8.3.2/1 says: Cv-qualified references are ill-formed So, while a const-qualified reference would have internal linkage, it's not possible to const-qualify a reference. The reference in your sample program is not const-qualified, it's a reference to a const-qualified int .
