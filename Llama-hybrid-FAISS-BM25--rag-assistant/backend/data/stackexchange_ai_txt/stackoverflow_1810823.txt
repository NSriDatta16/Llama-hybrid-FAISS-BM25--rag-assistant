Try setting the value of the property to a variable before passing it to the function. string myClassName = x.ClassName DoSomething(ref myClassName); Its not the most elegant solution, but it should point you in the right direction. As Yuriy said in his comment above, its probably something to do with the fact that you aren't explicitly declaring a get and set for the property.
