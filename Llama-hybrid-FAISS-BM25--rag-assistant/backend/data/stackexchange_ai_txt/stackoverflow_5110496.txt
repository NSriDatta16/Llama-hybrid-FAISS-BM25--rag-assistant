Linq to XML Not iterating?

I have an XML file, with a rather large structure. I'm pulling several entities out of it throughout several systems, and its dynamically updated once a day. I'm using a Linq Query that is exhibiting odd behavior, its only returning if the first entry in the site tag matches the search-pattern. If its number 2 or 3, it fails to return anything. Why would this behave that way? The following function written in VB handles pulling the data Public Function xmlSchoolListBySite() As IEnumerable Dim doc As XDocument = loadXML() Dim loadedPrograms As IEnumerable(Of XElement) = From c In doc.Descendants("Organization") _ Where c.Descendants("site").Value = MySite.Site.s_Url _ 'contains Result.RawURL.tostring() formatted Select c.Element("Title") Return loadedPrograms End Function The following would be a snippet of the XML structure MegaCorpUSA SomeCode program1 site1.com site2.com localhost
