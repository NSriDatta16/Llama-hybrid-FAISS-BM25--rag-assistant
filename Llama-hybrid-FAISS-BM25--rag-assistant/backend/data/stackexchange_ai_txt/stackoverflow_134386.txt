My understanding of the Infragistics WinForms suite is that the UltraCombo is designed for multi-column (or embedded UltraGrid) use. What I did to get around this was to replace those UltraCombos with UltraComboEditor controls. These are IG's "enhanced" versions of the standard .NET combobox. That may or may not be appropriate in your case, depending on your usage scenario. However, it looks like you have a resolution using the original UltraCombo, which will definitely be lower-impact on your existing code. (And thanks to you and Craig both: I actually overlooked that property when I went through this pain the first time; I'm making a mental note of where it is for the future!)
