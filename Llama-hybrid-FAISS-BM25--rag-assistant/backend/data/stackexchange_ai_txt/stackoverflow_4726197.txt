Ruby String class multiple methods and efficiency

I was looking through the Ruby source code and I can't seem to find a answer to my question: If I call multiple methods on a string ( str.upcase.reverse ), does Ruby optimize this query? The code for upcase basically loops over the string and coverts each letter to its uppercase value and the reverse reverses the string. Does Ruby combine these (or any other combinable combinations) so that it will reverse AND capitalize at the same time O(n) instead of looping over each character in the string twice?
