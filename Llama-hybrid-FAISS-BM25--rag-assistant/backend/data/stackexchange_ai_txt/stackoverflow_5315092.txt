That is how you do it; you just need to specify the Path . If you are wanting the DataContext of the TextBox ; then your Path would change accordingly. If you are needing to use the Tag property within a WPF application you might want to re-evaluate your approach as I have yet to use the Tag property since moving from WinForms as that need has been replaced by leveraging the data binding functionality within WPF. UPDATE: If your goal is to bind to a given control versus a property on the control; then don't specify the property name within the Path . Based on your goal; attached behaviors would be a better approach and allow you to wrap the functionality within the extended DataGrid .
