Here's how I understand them: Activity Designer Library - This project type lets you control the look of an Activity Designer used for creating workflows. It provides full XAML control for re-skinning the WF Designer, in essense. Activity Library - Similar to the Class Library project type, this is for defining activities that will be leveraged in other Workflows. WCF Workflow Service Application - Specifically for Workflows fronted by WCF Services. In these Workflows, one or more entry or exit points of the workflow is managed by WCF endpoints. Workflow Console Application - Creates a simple workflow definition and a default Program.cs implementation that allows you to run and test the Workflow. Great for demos or getting started with a Workflow. Beyond these four, the WF Page on Codeplex has some other great resources and the team adds extensions and guidance pretty often, from what I've seen. Check out: http://wf.codeplex.com/ . At this moment, they have a few activity packs up (State Machine, ADO.NET) as well as a 3.0 migration pack and a security library. It's a good resource to keep an eye on.
