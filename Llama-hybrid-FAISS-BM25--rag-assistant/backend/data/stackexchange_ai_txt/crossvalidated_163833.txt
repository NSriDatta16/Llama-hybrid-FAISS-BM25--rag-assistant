What is the purpose of specifying a "control" in an A/B/N split test?

I define control as the currently accepted, best known variation. The test to be performed would introduce n new variations. Each variation will be served randomly for the duration of the test. I am interested in answering this question in terms of the following goals: determining if/when there is a statistically significant winner/loser effectively communicating the results of the split test I am currently comparing the performance of each variation to the total average performance instead of to the performance of the control variation. Should I consider a different definition of control ?
