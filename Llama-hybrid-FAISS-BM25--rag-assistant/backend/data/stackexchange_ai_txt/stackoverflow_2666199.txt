Windows Mobile 6 / 6.5 performance monitoring

I'm writing an app for a Pocket PC device which appears to be slowly leaking resources - after 24hrs the device slowly becomes unresponsive and eventually locks up altogether. On XP/Vista I would at this point fire up trusty PerfMon and plot graphs of handles, threads, memory, mutexes etc - anything that could be leaking. Can someone recommend an approach for this on Windows Mobile? What would be ideal would be a mobile agent that collects performance counters and reports them back to a PC-based instance of PerfMon. I have seen this article , but it appears to be specific to .NET compact framework - I still work in C++/win32.
