The DC= prefix in the LDAP string stands for domain component (dc). These are the parts that make up the domain of your LDAP server. Those are fixed and need to be used for any object on that server. In "DNS style", this would read: (something).amrs.win.ml.com (e.g. a server name, machine name etc.) Richard Mueller has a great post explaining the most commonly found prefixes in LDAP bind strings - stuff like dc= , ou= (organizational unit) or cn= (common name).
