I'm currently writing a library for embedding Perl in C++, but it's not finished yet. In any case I would recommend against using the EP library. Not only has it not been maintained for years, but is also has some severe architectural deficiencies and is rather limited in its scope. If you are interested in alpha software you can contact me about it, otherwise I'd advice you to use the raw API .
