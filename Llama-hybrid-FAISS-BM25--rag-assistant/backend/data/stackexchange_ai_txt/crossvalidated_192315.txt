You can think of any type of regression as comparing groups. In case of your logistic regression you compare the odds of success for group 1 with the reference category and group 2 with the reference category. So you need to be able to estimate the odds of success in each of the three groups in order to compare them. If some of these groups contain few observations, then those estimates will be uncertain. As a consequence the comparisons (odds ratios) will also be uncertain. You will see that by the large standard errors and wide confidence intervals.
