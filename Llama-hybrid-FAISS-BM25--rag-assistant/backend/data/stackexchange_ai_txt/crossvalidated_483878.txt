Quality measure for predictive Highest Density Regions

An alternative to point, interval and density forecasts/predictions would be "predictive highest density regions (pHDRs)", i.e., HDRs for the conditional density of a yet-unknown future observable. A natural question would be that of evaluating a pHDR once we have observed the corresponding observable. This is analogous to point forecast error measures or prediction interval scores . (Note that the interval score cannot be applied to one-dimensional pHDR, which may be the union of multiple intervals.) Is there such a quality measure for pHDRs? The best I could think of is to test the coverage achieved against the nominal value , but this disregards the volume of the pHDR, which we want to be as small as possible.
