Why does the predicted trend line from a gamm not match the fitted values generated by the same model?

I am using a GAMM to ask whether the first date of flowering for several plant species is occurring earlier or later over the past ~40 years (potentially due to climate change). I have separate models for each species. I use identical code in each case (save the autocorrelation structure, which is specific to each time series). I am only encountering the following issue for one species. In the following figure, you'll see my raw data, the fitted values from my model, and the predicted trend line. You can see that the shape of the predicted trend line is a good fit, but the intercept seems off - the entire trend line is approximately 13 days too high. I'm not sure what's going on? As I said before, I don't encounter this same discrepancy for any of the other species that I've analyzed data for using the same code. Thank you in advance for any advice you can provide! My data: first_Ef2 My model: library(mcgv) Ef_mod2 *Please note that this model was the one that yielded the lowest AIC value despite not completely resolving autocorrelation issues.
