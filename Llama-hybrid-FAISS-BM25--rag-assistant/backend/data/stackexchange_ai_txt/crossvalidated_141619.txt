Won't highly-correlated variables in random forest distort accuracy and feature-selection?

In my understanding, highly correlated variables won't cause multi-collinearity issues in random forest model (Please correct me if I'm wrong). However, on the other way, if I have too many variables containing similar information, will the model weight too much on this set rather than the others? For example, there are two sets of information (A,B) with the same predictive power. Variable $X_1$,$X_2$,...$X_{1000}$ all contain information A, and only Y contains information B. When random sampling variables, will most of the trees grow on information A, and as a result information B is not fully captured?
