I've received an answer on a channel different from Stack Overflow. Since the author gave me permission to post here his answer, I thought it could be useful to someone else in the community. Hey Robert, Yeah, this has come up on the Apache lists before. There is no elegant way to do what you're asking for with Thrift. It's fundamentally not designed for bidirectional messaging. There are hacks around this, such as: - client-side polling - invoking send_method(), waiting on the client side, then recv_method(), instead of just method() - making the client also implement a Thrift server But obviously none of these are true bi-directional messaging. We've tried to keep the Thrift interfaces as simple as possible and focused on the core RPC use case, which has meant leaving some stuff like this out. Probably not the answer you were hoping for. Cheers, mcslee
