scikit-learn hides most of the details of libsvm when handling custom kernels. You can either just pass an arbitrary function as your kernel and it will compute the gram matrix for you or pass the precomputed Gram matrix of the kernel. For the first one, the syntax is: >>> from scikits.learn import svm >>> clf = svm.SVC(kernel=my_kernel) where my_kernel is your kernel function, and then you can call clf.fit(X, y) and it will compute the kernel matrix for you. In the second case the syntax is: >>> from scikits.learn import svm >>> clf = svm.SVC(kernel="precomputed") And when you call clf.fit(X, y), X must be the matrix k(X, X), where k is your kernel. See also this example for more details: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/svm/plot_custom_kernel.html
