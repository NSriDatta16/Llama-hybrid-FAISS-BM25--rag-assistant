This would be immensely slower reading than a database (file writes all happen at about the same speed--you can't store a write in memory). Databases are optimized and meant to handle such large amounts of structured data. File systems are not. It would be a mistake to try to replicate a database with a file system. After all, you can index your database columns, but it's tough to index the file system without another tool. Databases are built for rapid data access and retrieval. File systems are built for data storage. Use the right tool for the job. In this case, it's absolutely a database. That being said, if you want to create HTML files for the posts and then store those locales in a DB so that you can easily get to them, then that's definitely a good solution (a la Movable Type). But if you store these things on a file system, how can you find out your latest post? Most prolific author? Most controversial author? All of those things are trivial with a database, and very hard with a file system. Stick with the database, you'll be glad you did.
