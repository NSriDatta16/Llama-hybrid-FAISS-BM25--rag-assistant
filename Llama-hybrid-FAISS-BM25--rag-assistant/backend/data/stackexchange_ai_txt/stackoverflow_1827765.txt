First of all, I think it's not very cooperative for another developer to just replace your code like that, with no discussion. You will definitely have to make a good case for your position if you want to prevail in this one. I agree that the standard ASP.Net controls are easier for less-experienced developers to deal with, if that is a concern in your situation. I'm not sure I agree with you about StringBuilder, which has often been the source of raging debates here and elsewhere. If your list is not lengthy, there may not be sufficient justification for a StringBuilder here. One aspect that a seasoned developer might appreciate about this particular approach is that it is easy to step through and see exactly how each item is being populated. That isn't as easy with a ListView -- you'd have to add an event to catch the items being added, and then put a breakpoint in it. And finally, I would encourage you to choose your battles carefully. This particular example is not a major design issue. If you foresee other, larger differences of opinion in the future, you might decide to start here with a smaller issue, to establish a way of resolving these kinds of conflicts with your fellow developer. Alternately, you could consider that this is not a big enough deal to fight about, and wait for something of major importance (and I doubt that you will have to wait long). Which way you choose to proceed depends upon the personalities involved.
