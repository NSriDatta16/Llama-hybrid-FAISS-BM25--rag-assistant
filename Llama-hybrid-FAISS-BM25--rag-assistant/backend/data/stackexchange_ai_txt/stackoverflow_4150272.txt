it's not going to work unless you have SQL Express installed on the hosting machine. Not necessarily. If you still want to use default membership/role providers you can either have the DB server on the hosting machine or have one instance of the DB as a separate server (just change the connection string for providers). Worse yet, I figured that there's essentially no way this would work under a load balanced environment considering the DB itself will only be isolated to one of the N nodes. This statement is not really correct in this particular situation. With load-balancing you will not have isolated database, but rather a separate database server. I'd love to maintain the existing model yet have the database become a local, or flat-file DB baked right into the application. For the time being I'm even fine with deploying the flat file with each user or role change to counteract the load balanced sites in PROD If you say that application with proper SQL DB will not scale, I do not understand how flat-file storage can. You still can keep local SQL Server database and it will work as long as you take responsibility of maintaining the database consistency across different nodes. In your situation, I would personally use default membership/roles provider as you do now. But when deploying, just change the connection string to the proper database server. You will need a database for other stuff anyway, so why not use the same database for all data withing the application (including membership/roles). Regards.
