I have imported an X509Certificate2 from a file and have both the private key and public key available using this code: X509Certificate2 cert = new X509Certificate2(); // Key Location: the physical file location (C:\cert.pfx) // Key Password: the password for the certificate cert.Import(keyLocation, keyPassword, X509KeyStorageFlags.Exportable); My experience was that the key to having it work was the X509KeyStorageFlags.Exportable. Without that, I could not access the private key.
