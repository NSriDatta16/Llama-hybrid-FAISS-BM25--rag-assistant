What's the correct procedure for replacing an expired developer's certificate on an iPhone xCode project?

My iPhone developer certificate expired. I got a new one (developer_idendity.cer) but I'm not sure how to make my xcode project and my iPhone use it. I keep getting the Code Sign error: a valid provisioning profile matching the applications Identifier 'com.example.foo' could not be found. What's the procedure to follow when your developer certificate expires? I created a new "developer_identity.cer" and put it on my keychain. Then I got a new "mycompany.mobileprovision". When I try to add this to xcode via the Organizer, I see the message: A Valid signing identity matching this profile could not be found in your keychain. Any idea of what "signing identity" Xcode is looking for when I try to put in my update provisioning profile?
