A seek in a B-Tree index is several times as expensive as a table scan (per record). Additionally, another seek in the clustered index should be made to retrieve the values of other columns. If a large portion of records is expected to match, then it is cheaper to scan the clustered index. To make sure that the optimizer had chosen the best method, you may run this: SET STATISTICS IO ON SET STATSTICS TIME ON SELECT a.BuildingID, a.ApplicantID, a.ACH, a.Address, a.Age, a.AgentID, a.AmenityFee, a.ApartmentID, a.Applied, a.AptStatus, a.BikeLocation, a.BikeRent, a.Children, a.CurrentResidence, a.Email, a.Employer, a.FamilyStatus, a.HCMembers, a.HCPayment, a.Income, a.Industry, a.Name, a.OccupancyTimeframe, a.OnSiteID, a.Other, a.ParkingFee, a.Pets, a.PetFee, a.Phone, a.Source, a.StorageLocation, a.StorageRent, a.TenantSigned, a.WasherDryer, a.WasherRent, a.WorkLocation, a.WorkPhone, a.CreationDate, a.CreatedBy, a.LastUpdated, a.UpdatedBy FROM dbo.NPapplicants AS a INNER JOIN dbo.NPapartments AS apt ON a.BuildingID = apt.BuildingID AND a.ApartmentID = apt.ApartmentID WHERE (apt.Offline = 0) AND (apt.MA = 'M') SELECT a.BuildingID, a.ApplicantID, a.ACH, a.Address, a.Age, a.AgentID, a.AmenityFee, a.ApartmentID, a.Applied, a.AptStatus, a.BikeLocation, a.BikeRent, a.Children, a.CurrentResidence, a.Email, a.Employer, a.FamilyStatus, a.HCMembers, a.HCPayment, a.Income, a.Industry, a.Name, a.OccupancyTimeframe, a.OnSiteID, a.Other, a.ParkingFee, a.Pets, a.PetFee, a.Phone, a.Source, a.StorageLocation, a.StorageRent, a.TenantSigned, a.WasherDryer, a.WasherRent, a.WorkLocation, a.WorkPhone, a.CreationDate, a.CreatedBy, a.LastUpdated, a.UpdatedBy FROM dbo.NPapplicants WITH (INDEX (index_name)) AS a INNER JOIN dbo.NPapartments AS apt ON a.BuildingID = apt.BuildingID AND a.ApartmentID = apt.ApartmentID WHERE (apt.Offline = 0) AND (apt.MA = 'M') Replace index_name with the actual name of your index and compare the execution times and the numbers of I/O operations (as seen in the messages tab)
