magento customize onepage checkout process

I want to customize the onepage checkout process in magento in such a way that step 1 consists of shopping cart if user logged in otherwise login form and after login cart should be there. now in 2nd step; there should be input form of billing information, shipping information, payment methods options and shipping options. now in 3rd step, order review and 4th would be payment and last one would be Receipt and place order.
