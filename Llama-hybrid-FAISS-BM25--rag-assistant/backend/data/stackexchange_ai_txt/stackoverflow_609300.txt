I don't know if I have a knock down argument but initial thoughts are Option 2 works until your trying to catch an Exception that doesn't implement getCode() Option 2 encourages the developer to catch general exceptions, this is a problem because if you don't implement a case statement for a given subclass of AppException the compiler will not warn you. Ofcourse you could run into the same problem with option 1 but atleast option 1 does not activly encourage this.
