bool doTheseItemsExist(List criteria) { .. } Can you not simply pass in a List of objects? Technically, it's similar to passing an array, but it's easy to work with, and you don't have to load up the call stack with what could be a potentially large parameter list if you use params. (That last part, of course, depends entirely on how many criteria you intend to search on.) (EDIT: Actually, that List would need to be a mapping of object type and expected number.) But the gentlemen who suggested that your collection should expose these queries in your collection is probably the winner here. One possibility: bool MyCollection.HasBalloons(int numBalloons); bool MyCollection.HasCupcakes(int numCupcakes); bool MyCollection.HasPartyHats(int numHats); But then the bool result is ambiguous to the caller... has exactly this many? has at least this many? So perhaps a better direction is: int MyCollection.NumBalloons(); int MyCollection.NumCupcakes(); int MyCollection.NumPartyHats(); You then don't need some extra function with an arbitrary set of parameters. You can simply inspect the collection as needed.
