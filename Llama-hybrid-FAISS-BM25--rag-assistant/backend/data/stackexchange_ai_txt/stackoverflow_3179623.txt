Lotus Domino Designer import 3rd party jar file

I'm developing custom Agent for LotusNotes 8.5. I'd like to use iCal4j jar to convert Calendar issue to ICS format. Question is: how to import coresponding jar in Lotus Agent ?? Now is written when compile: package 'net.fortuna.ical4j.model' does not exist.
