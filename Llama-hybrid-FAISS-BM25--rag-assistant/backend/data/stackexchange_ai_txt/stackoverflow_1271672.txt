C#, insert multiple records at once to a database

I'm writing a converter for my database from MSSQL Express Edition to Oracle. The amount of rows in the table is around 5 millions. On MSSQL side I use LINQ to SQL to select data. I'd use the same approach for Oracle, but unfortunately there's no LINQ to Oracle in .NET. I know there is open source LINQ to Oracle implementation, but I think I'll use simple System.Data.OracleClient namespace. My question is how to insert row to Oracle db at once? I'm afraid that if I'll call ExecuteQuery() per row it would take a huge amount of time. So is there any elegant solution for my problem? Thanks.
