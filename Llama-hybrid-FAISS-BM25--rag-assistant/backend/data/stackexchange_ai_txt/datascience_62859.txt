To store and share the data amongst colleagues, cloud storage is the option we use (s3, google storage) where you can just have a folder structure to store all your datasets. While there is no specific way to share models, it totally depends on the model type, one thing that's used is making a binary of model (pickle in python) and share that file which you can also encrypt in case you are floating around sensitive data. In case it is an unsupervised learning model you can directly share the codebase.
