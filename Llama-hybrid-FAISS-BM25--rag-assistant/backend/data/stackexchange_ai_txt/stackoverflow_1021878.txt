iPhone OS 3.0 + OpenGL ES 2.0. Is anyone seeing better anti-aliasing?

I have been unable to find a way to anti-alias my rendering on iPhone OS 3.0 + OpenGL ES 2.0. I had assumed there would be multisampling but that appears to not be the case. I've been told that fragment shaders can be made aware of the projected pixel via a partial derivatives extention but I have no idea where that functionality lives or whether Apple actually supports it. My background is RenderMan where I have significant control of how I attenuate high frequency artifacts. Without proper anti-aliasing - at the shader level and at the rasterization level. Vertex and fragment shaders will suffer from noticable jaggies and all manner of visual schmutz. Could someone please clarify the status of anti-aliasing. Thanks. -Doug
