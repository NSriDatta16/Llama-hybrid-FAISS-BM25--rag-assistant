How to use multiple encoders(one-hot and numerical) together for PCA

I want to implement PCA on a dataset(retail) but the data is categorical. One-hot encoding on some columns like Gender, Fabric, Brand makes sense but on other features like price range, size, I would like the encoded values to have some numeric significance, i.e. higher value actually means something. Any suggestions on implementing both these encodings together for PCA?
