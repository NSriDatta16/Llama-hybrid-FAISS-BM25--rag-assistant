naive bayesian spam filter question

I am planning to implement spam filter using Naive Bayesian classification model. Online I see a lot of info on Naive Bayesian classification, but the problem is its a lot of mathematical stuff, than clearly stating how its done. And the problem is I am more of a programmer than a mathematician (yes I had learnt Probability and Bayesian theorem back in school, but out of touch for a long long time, and I don't have luxury of learning it now (Have nearly 3 weeks to come-up with a working prototype)). So if someone can explain or point me to location where its explained for programmers than a mathematician, it would be a great help. PS: By the way I have to implement it in C, if you want to know. :( Regards, Microkernel
