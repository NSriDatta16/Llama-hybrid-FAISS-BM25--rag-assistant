Seems kind of ghetto. Infragistics support also indicated that the RefreshSortPosition() method is the only choice. // Add to binding list which will trigger a row to be added to the bound ultragrid. this.bindingList.Add(new Person("Smith", "John")); // Get length since we know this will always be added to the end int length = this.ultraGrid.Rows.All.Length; // Get it to sort this.ultraGrid.Rows[length - 1].RefreshSortPosition(); To be a bit more efficient, you can always be clever by disable redrawing, etc and then call refresh on a bunch of rows after a batch of orders, etc... Hope that helps. I had very little luck Googling this problem.
