One or two tailed probability?

A rare bird recently turned up in the UK. The length of the bird's beak was measured (41.9mm). I want to check that the bird is likely to derive from the North American population of the species. To do this, I calculated the mean and standard deviation beak length of 30 North American individuals of the species. To check the likelihood that the UK bird was derived from the North America population of the species, I calculated the number of standard deviations the UK bird was away from the North American mean, which is 1.33 standard deviations below the mean. The figure below visualises the beak length of the UK bird (red line) in relation to North American individuals. I would like to express the probability the UK bird was derived from the North American population. Should I use a left-tailed probability, therefore the probability of a value 1.33 or lower than the mean (given bird was 1.33 standard deviations below mean) or a two-tailed probability, therefore a beak length 1.33 or more standard deviations shorter or longer than the mean (given I had no prior expectation the beak would be shorter than average)?
