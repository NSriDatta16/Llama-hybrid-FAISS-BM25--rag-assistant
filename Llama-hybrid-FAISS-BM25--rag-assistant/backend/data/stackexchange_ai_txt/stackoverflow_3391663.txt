For what it's worth, right now StackOverflow shows 9,000 WinForms tags and 15,000 WPF tags -- hardly light traffic. That could just mean people have more difficulty with it, but IMO the momentum has been shifting. I don't personally know anyone starting new greenfield projects in WinForms anymore. Are the engineers to whom you are talking already working in the .NET stack? If they don't know about WPF it probably just means they work somewhere that is not creating new desktop applications. They could be maintaining existing applications or working in the web space, in which case they'd have little incentive outside of pure curiosity for exploring the current state of Windows Client technologies. Also IMO, it is good from a career perspective, because it is so highly (and ever-increasingly) overlapped with Silverlight. Silverlight jobs are in demand and will only become moreso as companies target Windows Phone 7 and cross-platform applications that leverage existing .NET assets.
