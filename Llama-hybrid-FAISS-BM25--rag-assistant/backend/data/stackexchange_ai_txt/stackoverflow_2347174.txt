Can I retrieve an SVN Log from a local copy?

My organisation ran an SVN repository server for 2 years. This server died in November; we didn't loose any files thanks to the local copies, but we lost the history, which is obviously a shame. I still have my local repository copies and I'd like to know whether I can regain the SVN Log from this local copy. Usually for running SVN log a server connection is required, so the question is, is it possible to get the log without server?
