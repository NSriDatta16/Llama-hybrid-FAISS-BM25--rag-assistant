Does external drag&drop or copy/paste work in IntelliJ IC Linux?

Information on IntelliJ's Blog says that drag&drop in Linux is supported as it uses the same JAVA API as Windows version. However, although I've enabled this feature in the app's properties, I cannon drag a file on Linux desktop (or from any Explorer window) and drop it in some /res folder. I cannon copy a file on desktop and paste it in any /res folder as well. Anyone knows the way to enable this feature or make it work? PS. The same version is installed on Windows 7 x64 and drag&drop (c/p as well) works flawlessly. I use Ubuntu 10.04 x64, but I think it's the same in all distros. PPS. I've tested both IC and IU versions and neither supports drag&drop or c/p.
