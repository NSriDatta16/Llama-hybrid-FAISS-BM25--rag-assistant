Is there an algorithm for solving a many-to-one assignment problem?

I'm looking for an algorithm to solve assignment problem, but it is not one to one problem. I know the Hungarian algorithm it can simply assign one task to one agent. Let's say I have 4 tasks and 20 agents and I want to assign 5 agents to each task (based on the cost matrix). Is there any efficient algorithm to do this? It will be great if there is a Python library with algorithm like that.
