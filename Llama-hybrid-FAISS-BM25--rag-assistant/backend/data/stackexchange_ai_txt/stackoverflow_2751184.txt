Here are some ideas: I assume you have rebooted your machine; if not, do this and try again. See this page about verifying your .NET 4.0 installation. Using IE, go to http://whatsmyuseragent.com/ and ensure that .NET 4.0 is shown. In VS 2010, write a small console app that outputs Environment.Version.ToString() . This is the .NET CLR version. Run this app from outside VS 2010, and ensure it works as expected. At this point the problem is most likely with the installer used to create the service. Please add more information about it.
