difference between ckeditor entermode div and entermode p

I noticed that CkEditor has problems with using entermode br (mainly slowness after typing text for a long time). So I'm looking into the other entermodes (p and div). I see that entermode p is adviced by CkEditor. However, this introduces margins below the content, which is not desired (as the users are not used to typing paragraphs). So, I was thinking of using entermode div , which seems more correct in this case. However, I want to avoid introducing problems by using entermode div. Are there known differences in behaviour between entermode p and entermode div?
