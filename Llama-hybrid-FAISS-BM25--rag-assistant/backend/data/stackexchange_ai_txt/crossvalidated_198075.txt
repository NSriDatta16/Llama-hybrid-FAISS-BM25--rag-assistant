Realistic Test Data Generation

I am searching for some literature or references , or also only some tips for the topic of test data generation that is realistic and what it means to the data to be realistic. Example Questions that are arise is how to generate data for time series, generate trends, realistic distributions, correlations and correspondence between data instead of always using random values. An additional question for me is that although almost everything is normal distributed, sometimes a normal distribution looks very unrealistic, so what is a good way to bring some noise to it?
