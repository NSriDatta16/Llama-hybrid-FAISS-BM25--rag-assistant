Pulsing Animation

I want to build a pulsing animation on a simple UIImageView. The ImageView will grow a little bit bigger, then go back to its original size. I used the following code: - (void) doCoolAnimation { [UIView beginAnimations:@"glowingAnimation" context:nil]; [UIView setAnimationRepeatAutoreverses:YES]; [UIView setAnimationRepeatCount:INT_MAX]; [UIView setAnimationDuration:0.25]; [UIView setAnimationBeginsFromCurrentState:YES]; imageView.transform = CGAffineTransformMakeScale(1.15, 1.15); [UIView commitAnimations]; } This works fine on iOS3 but works only partially on iOS4. I have a UITabBarController with 2 views in it. In the first one is the imageView with the animation, and the animation starts as soon as the view is loaded. But after I switch to the second view (using TabBar) and back, the animation is not running anymore on iOS4. (But on iOS3 I can switch between these 2 views and the animation still works fine.) I also tried with a timer that calls doCoolAnimation every second, but that does not help to start the animation again. Can someone explain why after view switching the animation is gone? Is there a workaround that can make it work on iOS4?
