This is from the description of AIC : The Akaike information criterion (AIC) is a measure of the relative quality of a statistical model for a given set of data. As such, AIC provides a means for model selection. I don't pay attention to the absolute value of AIC. I only use it to compare in-sample fit of the candidate models. Note, that if you're building the forecasting models, it is important to also consider out-of-sample fit.
