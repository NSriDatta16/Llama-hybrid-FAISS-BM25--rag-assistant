Although I agree that it is not easy (or even possible) to create passion about programming, I think it is possible to keep passionate developers enthusiastic about their work. Even the most passionate programmer developer can become disillusioned if placed in a stagnant work environment. So what can be done? Provide plenty of opportunity for personal development, give lots of freedom to learn new things. Let the developers have some choice in the courses they take, and the conferences they wish to attend. Toys - Not in the traditional sense, but being able to use the latest technologies Provide a nice place to work. It doesn't have to be Google, but it does have to be somewhere you would want to spend time. Of course money helps. Not in the sense that a company can pay for enthusiastic staff, but people need to feel suitable rewarded for their efforts. I have found working in an organisation that has embraced agile development has many of the correct qualities for building enthusiastic teams.
