Scala Immutable MultiMap

In Scala I would like to be able to write val petMap = ImmutableMultiMap(Alice->Cat, Bob->Dog, Alice->Hamster) The underlying Map[Owner,Set[Pet]] should have both Map and Set immutable. Here's a first draft for ImmutibleMultiMap with companion object: import collection.{mutable,immutable} class ImmutableMultiMap[K,V] extends immutable.HashMap[K,immutable.Set[V]] object ImmutableMultiMap { def apply[K,V](pairs: Tuple2[K,V]*): ImmutableMultiMap[K,V] = { var m = new mutable.HashMap[K,mutable.Set[V]] with mutable.MultiMap[K,V] for ((k,v) Can you resolve the comment line elegantly? Both the map and the sets should become immutable. Thanks!
