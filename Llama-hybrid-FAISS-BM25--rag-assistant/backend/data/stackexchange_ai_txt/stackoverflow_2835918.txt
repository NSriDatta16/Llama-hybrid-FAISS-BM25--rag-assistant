If you needed to stick with a binary tree for the problem, there's nothing saying that you can't duplicate a branch or a node. Place the feline answer node at the end of more than one set of decisions. Or ask the predator question twice - once if the user said "yes" to mammal, and once if the user said "no". Certainly there are optimization and efficiency concerns if you take this tack, but there are ways of addressing specific concerns as well. (For example, if you're worried about storage space for the decision tree, then make the branches or the nodes or both pointers to immutable objects/declarations).
