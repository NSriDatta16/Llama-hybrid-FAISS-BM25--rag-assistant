No need to remove the clear:both on the #footer as suggested before. As said Mathias Bynens you must write "p.left" instead of "p .left" You will need a clear both after the two paragraphs and end up with something like : #footer { clear: both; background-color: #330066; padding: .5em; font-size: 0.8em; color: #fff; } #footer p.left { text-align:left; float:left; } #footer p.right { float:right; text-align:right; } Copyright Â© 2009 Designed by xxxxxx
