Comparing results for computer and pen and paper writing

I am conducting a study to examine the differences between writing paragraphs in English among junior high school students in Japan. We collected writing samples from four classes, approximately 38 students per class, and looked at the number of words written, the number of grammar errors, and the number of spelling errors. The students wrote five paragraphs over the semester, with two classes writing three computer paragraphs and two paper and pen paragraphs while the other two classes wrote two computer paragraphs and three paper and pen paragraphs. We assumed that students would write more and make fewer errors using a computer because of the spell and grammar checker. We will calculate descriptive statistics, but I am wondering how we can show if there is a difference between the computer and paper paragraphs. I am thinking that we will use a t-test for independent samples comparing the means of all computer writings with all paper writings. Is this correct? I have only used a t-test with two distinct groups (male and female) but in this case it is the the difference between two activities. Any help would be appreciated. I am a real novice to statistics. Thanks
