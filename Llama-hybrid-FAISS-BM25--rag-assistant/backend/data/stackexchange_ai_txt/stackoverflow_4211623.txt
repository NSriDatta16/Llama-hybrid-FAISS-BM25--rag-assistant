It's a bug in IE. It's possible to work around it by changing the URL's fragment identifier ("hash"), which may or may not be feasible for your purpose: javascript:document.title='foobar';location.replace('#'+new Date().getTime()) new Date().getTime() is used to get a unique number that is unlikely to be used as a name or ID anywhere in the page (so that the page does not actually scroll).
