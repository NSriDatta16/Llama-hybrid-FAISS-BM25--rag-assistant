What is the character encoding of String in Java?

I am actually confused regarding the encoding of strings in Java. I have a couple of questions. Please help me if you know the answer to them: 1) What is the native encoding of Java strings in memory? When I write String a = "Hello" in which format will it be stored? Since Java is machine independent I don't think the system will do the encoding. 2) I read on the net that "UTF-16" is the default encoding but I got confused because say when I write that int a = 'c' I get the number of the character in the ASCII table. So are ASCII and UTF-16 the same? 3) Also I wasn't sure on what the storage of a string in the memory depends: OS, language?
