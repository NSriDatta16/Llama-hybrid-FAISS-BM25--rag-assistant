To look at correlation among categorical variables, you can use Phi and Cramer's V . You can eliminate variables that have high Cramer's V. Likewise PCA or factor analysis are good ways to reduce the dimensionality of your data. As for good machine learning models to start with, that is a very subjective question. I would start with simpler models like OLS regression, and then see potential improvement in performance from increasing complex models like random forest. Model tuning and selecting the right sample to build on will also affect performance, often more than the algorithm itself.
