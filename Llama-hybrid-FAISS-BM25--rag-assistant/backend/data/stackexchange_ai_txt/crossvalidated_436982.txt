Transforming data for normality with negative values using python

I am working with a data set in a machine learning project, which has lots to negative values. I want to transform the distribution of my data to normal. I tried using numpy.log, but since log is only for positive values, it is producing null values. So how should I approach this issue. Below is the distribution of my variable. Also, I am confused, whether I should normalize this distribution in the first place.
