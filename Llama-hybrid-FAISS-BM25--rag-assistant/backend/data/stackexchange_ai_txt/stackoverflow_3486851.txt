I like ikiwiki for its design. It's a "wiki compiler" which can use popular distributed version control systems as the backend. So, it's nice for maintaining documentation, and for sites that don't really need to serve dynamic content intensively, which is often the case for intranet community sites. Running it is simple. A webserver serving an ikiwiki site is a quite simple thing since ikiwiki compiles into static content: so, little effort in administrating it, easy mirroring, or easy moving of the site to another server (+ easy offline editing of the content due to the use of a VCS backend). It's used on the sites of a few well-known software projects, for example, GNU Hurd, DragonFly BSD, xcb.freedesktop.org and more (see http://ikiwiki.info/ikiwikiusers/ ).
