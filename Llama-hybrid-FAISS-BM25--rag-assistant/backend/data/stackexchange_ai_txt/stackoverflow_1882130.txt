There are a number of solutions: Add mouse listeners to the child components. Also container listeners, to add and remove listeners as components are added and removed. Unfortunately adding mouse listeners upset bubbling up of mouse events (hideous design). Add a glass pane over the top. This is mighty ugly, and forwarding of events always causes problems. Add an AWTEventListener to the default Toolkit and filter through for the events you are interested in. This unfortunately requires a security permission. Push a custom EventQueue and filter events. This requires a security permission, put applets and WebStart/JNLP applications get that permission anyway.
