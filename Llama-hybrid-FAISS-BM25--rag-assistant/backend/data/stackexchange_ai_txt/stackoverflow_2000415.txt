Java web start is the 0-install solution in the java world. An application built to use Java web start (JWS) will be available as a link in a web site. This site will have the .jnlp extension. When a user clicks this link (and clicks the "execute" button of his browser) , the javaws.exe runtime will be launched. This executable will download the application and dependencies (libraries, images, and so on) and launch the application using the provided main-class of the .jnlp file). An extensive reference of JNLP content can be found at http://lopica.sourceforge.net/ref.html Examples of Java web start applications can be found at Swing sightings . Notice that, depending upon the chosen configuration, these applciations can also be automatically installed in start menu.
