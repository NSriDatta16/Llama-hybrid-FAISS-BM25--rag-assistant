This is a problem in pooled cross-sectional time series analysis.Use time series methods to identify an appropriate ARIMA model never assume a structure. Identify an ARIMA model that roughly characterizes each of the 20 series. Estimate this model globally and locally therefore 21 individual models/sets of parameters . Form an F test based upon the respective error sum of squares to test the hypothesis of a common set of parameters. Upon rejecting the hypothesis of a common set of parameters one can then find which subset of the 20 is different from the others. Good advanced time series software should have this option routinely available.
