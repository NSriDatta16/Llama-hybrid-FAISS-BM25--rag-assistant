You say the response variable is an integer measuring the number of days for something to happen, but then measure the performance of your model using the accuracy . Consequently, you are only counting a success if your model gets the answer exactly right . Is this really what you want? Is your model's prediction really worthless if you predict 10 lag days, but the reality is 9? Using accuracy, you are not crediting your model at all for being close , only when it is exactly, completely, and totally correct. I would instead evaluate your model based on some measure of the difference between your prediction, and the true value. The average squared error, or average absolute error are two common choices.
