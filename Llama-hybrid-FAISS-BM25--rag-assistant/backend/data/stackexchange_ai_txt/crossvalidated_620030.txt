Uniform distribution in the target variable

I'm analysing a dataset that gave some very poor regression models in the past (not trained by me). Basically, I'm trying to get insights on why those models were so bad. The target variable is the log of raw measurements and its distribution looks like this. I noticed that if we look at specific ranges, for a good chunk of the data (4K out of 7K samples) the target variable is close to a uniform distribution: The QQ plot comparing to a uniform distribution also points in that direction: I could think of someways this distribution could affect the model but I'm not sure. For instance, since the distribution is uniform it might be harder to find patterns in the data to make good predictions. The latest random forest model trained on this data returned a residual plot like this: I also plotted a histogram of the residuals and they seem pretty much like a normal distribution, but with a slight left skew. My interpretation is that the residuals are ok, but that descending pattern in the residual plot looks strange to me and I can't understand why it happens. My problem is the following: Is it right to assume that a uniform distribution of the target variable can affect the performance of the model? What if I transform the task into a classification problem?
