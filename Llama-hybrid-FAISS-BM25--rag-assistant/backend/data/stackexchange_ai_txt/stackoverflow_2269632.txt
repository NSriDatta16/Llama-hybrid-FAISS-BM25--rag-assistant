If you want a general solution, then you're going to have to do recursive ps -ppid ... calls---or do a single big ps call that gets everything at once and parse it yourself to get all the descendants of your desired parent process. (You could prune the stuff you need to pay attention to by first getting the session leader or process group of your parent process, and then just doing a ps for processes with that session leader/process group. If you're lucky, no more pruning will be needed.) But if you're dealing with ./configure and make calls specifically, why don't you pipe their output to a temp file and just watch that to see it's getting longer, or when it was last touched, or so on?
