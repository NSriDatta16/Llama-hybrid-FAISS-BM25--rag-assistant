Can we predict when an event will occur in the future from time series data?

I would like to predict a few possible times when a particular event may occur. For instance, I have the daily activity data of a person that consists of what the person doing and when over a period of time. Currently, my data are like the following format: Date Time Activity 01-01-2017 08:23:30 Breakfast 01-01-2017 16:20:30 Reading 01-01-2017 19:00:00 Dinner 02-01-2017 08:00:10 Breakfast 02-01-2017 17:40:30 Reading 02-01-2017 19:30:00 Dinner 03-01-2017 08:15:30 Breakfast 03-01-2017 16:20:30 Reading 03-01-2017 20:30:00 Dinner Let's just say, in most of the cases, the person takes his dinner around 7-7:30 pm and sometimes at 8-8:30 pm, read books around 4 pm mostly and sometimes at 5,6 pm too. From this type of data, I would like to predict when he will take breakfast, dinner or read tomorrow. For instance, dinner at 8pm (confidence/probability 65%), or 8:30pm (20%), 9 pm (10%), 9:30pm (5%). The challenge I am facing is, I can't identify which technique to choose to achieve the goal. Can you please provide me a few hints?
