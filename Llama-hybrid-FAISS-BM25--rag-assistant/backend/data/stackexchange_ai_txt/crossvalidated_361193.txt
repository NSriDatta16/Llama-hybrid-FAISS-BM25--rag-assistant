Let's say you have $X = 73$ out of $n = 131$ favoring A over B. Then a 95% Agresti-Coull CI for the population proportion $p$ favoring A is of the form $$\check p \pm 1.96\sqrt{\frac{\check p(1-\check p)}{\check n}},$$ where $\check n = n+ 4$ and $\check p = \frac{X+2}{n+4}.$ This computes to $(.472, .639),$ which includes 50%. p.ac = 75/135; n.ac = 135; pm=c(-1,1) p.ac + pm*1.96*(sqrt(p.ac*(1-p.ac)/n.ac)) [1] 0.4717328 0.6393783 Testing the null hypothesis $H_0: p = 1/2$ against the one-sided alternative $H_a: p > 1/2,$ one obtains the P-value $P(X \ge 73) = 1 - P(X \le 72) \approx 0.11$ (under the assumption $H_0$ is true). Even though 65% > 50%, it appears the 56% is not significantly greater that 50% at the 5% level. This can be computed in R as follows: 1 - pbinom(72, 131, .5) [1] 0.110558 More formally, the exact binomial test binom.test in R, gives this P-value along with a one-sided 95% CI (that is a 95% lower bound). binom.test(73, 131, alte="g") Exact binomial test data: 73 and 131 number of successes = 73, number of trials = 131, p-value = 0.1106 alternative hypothesis: true probability of success is greater than 0.5 95 percent confidence interval: 0.4816258 1.0000000 sample estimates: probability of success 0.5572519 Addendum; Sometimes a 95% Bayesian posterior probability ('credible') interval based on a 'non-informative' or 'flat' prior distribution, such as $\mathsf{Unif}(0,1) \equiv \mathsf{Beta}(1,1),$ is used by frequentist statisticians as a 95% confidence interval. I mention this partly for completeness and partly because @MatthewDrury almost seems to suggest a Bayesian framework in his answer (+1). For $X = 73$ and $n - X = 58,$ this interval estimate can be computed by finding quantiles 0.025 and 0.975 of $\mathsf{Beta}(X+1, n-X+1).$ Specifically, $(0.472, 0.640),$ which is numerically very similar to the Agresti-Coull interval mentioned above. qbeta(c(.025,.975), 74, 59) [1] 0.4716082 0.6395668 Note: For more on binomial interval estimates see this Q & A and its References.
