The problem is, that VS2010 added move constructors and your implementation falls directly into this hole. Previously there was only one constructor, the const char* one, which was available to the std::string constructor. Now there is the move constructor, too. I really think a design relying on implicit conversions is dangerous. Thats why all one parameter constructors should be explicit ... I think you should discourage the use of implicit operators, because they lead to bad overloads being used. If you cannot do that, wrap the currently failing calls into an explicit conversion call std::string( CXStr( x ).toString() ) . There can be other errors which are hidden by using 'non-explicit' cast operators ... .
