Top 2% of scores of a binary classifier are 100% class 1

I have a binary classification model (Xgboost) that is supposed to be predicting whether a customer will be purchasing a service. Overall the metrics are satisfactory ~.67 AUC, ~30% precision and ~40% recall @ max F1, performance holds well out of sample and out of time. overall proportion of positive class is .13 (~13%) However, there is something that is making me uneasy, the top 2700 scores (out of 150K) are 100% class 1, which may suggest some sort of a target data leak back into the features. Is there a binomial test of some sort to check the likelihood of an abnormal situation?
