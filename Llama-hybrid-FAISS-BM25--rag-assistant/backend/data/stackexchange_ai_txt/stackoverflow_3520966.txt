Set Host-header when using Python and urllib2

I'm using my own resolver and would like to use urllib2 to just connect to the IP (no resolving in urllib2) and I would like set the HTTP Host-header myself. But urllib2 is just ignoring my Host-header: txheaders = { 'User-Agent': UA, "Host: ": nohttp_url } robots = urllib2.Request("http://" + ip + "/robots.txt", txdata, txheaders)
