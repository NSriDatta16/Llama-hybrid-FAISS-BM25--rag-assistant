Itzy's answer is correct. The US Census's lat/lng centroids are based on population. In constrast, the USGS GNIS data's lat/lng averages are based on administrative boundaries. The files referenced by Itzy are the 2000 US Census data. The Census bureau is in the processing of rolling our the 2010 data. The following link is a segway to all of this data. http://www.census.gov/geo/www/tiger/ I can answer a lot of geospatial questions. I am part of a public domain geospatial team at OpenGeoCode.Org
