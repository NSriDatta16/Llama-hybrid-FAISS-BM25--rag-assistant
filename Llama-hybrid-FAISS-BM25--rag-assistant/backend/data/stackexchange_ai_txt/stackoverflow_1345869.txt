Currently the documentation for import and export profiles is so thin for magento you are better off going direct to the DB. As you say you're capable i'm sure you've seen the tables you need are the eav_* tables for you chars and int etc etc. Also the API has weird quirks, i unintentionally sent 1k+ emails to imported customers, saying they had subscribed to the magento demo store, doh! who thought that was a good feature.
