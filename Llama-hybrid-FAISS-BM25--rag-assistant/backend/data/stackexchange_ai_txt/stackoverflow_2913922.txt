What approach to take for an ASP.NET web application w/ tabs

Hey I just began working on a new project that requires, tab navigation, and within each page, more tab navigation, and then within those pages dynamic ASP.NET content. The problem is I do not want all of my code on one page, that would just be a very large and bloated page. I was wondering what available methods of approach there are for this issue. I checked jQuery tabs, and I see I can link html files using AJAX but I need aspx files not just HTML. Thanks ahead of time.
