How to determine that there is no batch effect? Do these coins have the same P value?

I have some data that was gathered in several batches, and I want to determine if there is a statistically relevant difference in the results of each batch. Edit: Clarification: I want to test the null hypothesis that each batch has the same p value. To avoid having to go into the background of the experiment, here's a perfect analogy: We have three coins and flip them a bunch. Coin1: 75 heads, 25 tails. Coin2: 73 heads, 27 tails. Coin3: 80 heads, 20 tails. They aren't fair coins; we're not worried about that right now. What I want to know is: with what degree of certainty can I say the coins are equally fair to one another? I have been told that the way to go is to fit a binomial model to the data and the use that to determine if it is credible that there is no difference in the true underlying p-value. I have been recommended using either the R package brms or lme4 (though this is not strictly required). However, I am at a loss as to how to go about this. My experience with R is extremely limited, and I would use Python instead in a heartbeat. Thus far, I have tried setting up the model in a few ways: Note: I'm posting using miniturized data: Coin1: 5 heads, 0 tails Coin2: 4 heads, 1 tails. Coin3: 3 heads, 2 tails. Coin = c(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2) Result = c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0) d I've also tried glmer(Result ~ 1 + (1 | Coin), data = d, family = binomial, nAGQ = 10) , but I honestly do not understand the formula argument very well - I'm being tasked with this because I'm the programmer on the project, but my background with statistics... well, it's something that I want to work on. I've tried looking into brms as well, but it looks even more arcane. The models I tried with that library are: model I also wanted to try a model that allows the variances of the coins to be unequal (or, at least, that is a characteristic of this model according to this source: https://vuorre.netlify.com/post/2017/01/02/how-to-compare-two-groups-with-robust-bayesian-estimation-using-r-stan-and-brms/ ): uneq_var_frm However, this throws the error "Error: The parameter 'sigma' is not a valid distributional or non-linear parameter. Did you forget to set 'nl = TRUE'?" In any case, what comes out of all these models is over my head. Even if any of these models are correct (which is quite a leap of faith for me to think that I'm doing it right thus far) I do not know how to use them to give me the information I need. Can anyone share some guidance on this?
