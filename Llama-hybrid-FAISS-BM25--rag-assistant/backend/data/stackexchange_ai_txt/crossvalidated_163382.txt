There are more resources available. I have listed a few below (no affiliation with any of them). For a collection of information on Recurrent Neural Networks look here . For a collection of information on deep learning look here Check the deep learning part of the website of H2O You can also look at the journal of machine learning research if there are any articles available. Or look at arXiv . Even SSRN has some articles about this.
