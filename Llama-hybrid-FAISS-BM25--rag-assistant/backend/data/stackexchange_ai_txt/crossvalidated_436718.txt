Your equation is $$[y(t)-6.8840][1-.9916B]= +Ïµ(t)$$ or $$y(t)= .0084\times6.8840 + .9916\cdot y(t-1)$$ $$y(t)= .0578 + .9916\cdot y(t-1)$$ What has you confused is for your stationary model the constant that is estimated is a Left-Hand side constant not the right-hand side that you were (normally !) expecting. Your model in my opinion should be changed to a first difference model as your ar coefficient is not different from 1.0 . EDITED AFTER COMMENTS BY @whuber: I was intrigued by the interesting discussion and decided to roll out my trusty time series simulator and generated a realization of the following model . The nature of the model suggests that other realizations could be expected to have different patterns. The series has its up's and down's much like what might be expected from a process where the expected value is the last value more or less. The ACF and PACF are here The estimated model is here and here (with a non-significant BUT necessary constant ) Expressed as a pure right-hand side equation here The ACTUAL/FIT/FORECAST graph is here The history shows trends up and down for different segments . Treated objectively the model is simply a random walk
