Drag and drop from an email file attachment in GroupWise to a .NET application

I'm trying to allow an attachment from an email open in Novell GroupWise to be dropped into my C# WinForms application. The standard .NET functionality doesn't work. In the DragDrop event of a control, e.Data.GetFormats() returns the following. FileGroupDescriptorW FileGroupDescriptor FileContents attachment format I can get the filename with e.Data.GetData("FileGroupDescriptor") and going to position 76. Unfortunately, e.Data.GetData("FileContents") causes a first chance System.NotImplementedException in System.Windows.Forms.dll and returns null. Attachment format also returns null. My searches tell me that drag and drop is a lot more complex than I thought :) It seems like GroupWise might be using a format called CFSTR_FILECONTENTS but that's just a guess. The attachments can be successfully dragged and dropped onto the Windows desktop or other folders. Thanks for any suggestions.
