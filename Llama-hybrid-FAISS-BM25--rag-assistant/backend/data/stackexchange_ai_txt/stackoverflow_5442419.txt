Joe Stagner who made a lot of training videos about the Ajax Control Tookit has started an ambitioned project on his blog to replace the features of the Toolkit by JQuery alternatives for ASP.NET webforms projects: Iâ€™ll be doing jQuery alternatives for ALL my Microsoft Ajax and Ajax control toolkit videos. I think the first post he made about this project is this one: http://www.misfitgeek.com/asp-net-rounded-corners-jquery/ All other blogs he published in the meantime can probably easiest be found under his "act" tag or "jquery" category (they likely will overlap): http://www.misfitgeek.com/tag/act/ http://www.misfitgeek.com/category/jquery/ Edit (Links fixed to new domain.) Update: Joe Stagner is not working anymore at Microsoft. The project mentioned above is only a fragment and will probably never be finished. NOTE (18/02/2022): The above links appear to have either expired or been hacked. I've modified them to point to Joe Stagner's Microsoft blog, instead, despite his not working there any longer.
