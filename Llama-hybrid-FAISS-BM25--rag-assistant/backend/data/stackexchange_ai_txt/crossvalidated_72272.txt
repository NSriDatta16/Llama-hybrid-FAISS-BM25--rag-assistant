@Aaron, your timeseries data is discontinous. auto.arima as many other forecast methods in R requires equally spaced time series. The problem is your time series is not equally spaced, meaning there are gaps in the dates. The following code converts the time series into a vector, and now the auto.arima works fine. If you have seasonality in the data and you might want to clean the dataset and make it equally spaced time series. library(tseries) library(forecast) dwa following is the result: ARIMA(2,1,2) with drift : 4206.508 ARIMA(0,1,0) with drift : 4849.189 ARIMA(1,1,0) with drift : 4567.961 ARIMA(0,1,1) with drift : 1e+20 ARIMA(1,1,2) with drift : 1e+20 ARIMA(3,1,2) with drift : 4196.642 ARIMA(3,1,1) with drift : 4204.641 ARIMA(3,1,3) with drift : 1e+20 ARIMA(2,1,1) with drift : 4213.613 ARIMA(4,1,3) with drift : 1e+20 ARIMA(3,1,2) : 4194.541 ARIMA(2,1,2) : 4204.487 ARIMA(4,1,2) : 1e+20 ARIMA(3,1,1) : 4202.653 ARIMA(3,1,3) : 1e+20 ARIMA(2,1,1) : 4211.68 ARIMA(4,1,3) : 1e+20 Best model: ARIMA(3,1,2)
