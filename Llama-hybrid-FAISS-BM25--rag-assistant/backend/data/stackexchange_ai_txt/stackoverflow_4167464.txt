Custom Magento Order Field and the Magento Database

Alright, so I've successfully added a custom order field to my page layout in magento. I require a "dealer" from which the user has to select a "dealer state" and then I use ajaxt to pull in all the dealers from that specific state into another field called "dealerid". The value of this field is in fact the dealer id in my database. My question is kind of a full one. First, I need to add a field to the "order table" that saves the dealer id for the specific order and secondly I need to actually have magento take this field from the form and insert it. How do I go about doing these things? Mainly, what table would magento store this dealerid and what files do I modify to actually have magento access and insert this field value? Note: I am using the one page checkout method only.
