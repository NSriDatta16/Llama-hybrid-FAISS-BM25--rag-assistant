Is multivariate ordinal regression suitable for my reserach?

I want to test what leads to the support for two policies (Likert scale ÃŸ disagree to strongly agree). There are independent variables, some of which are demographic and two are of interest (continuous and binary variables). Can I use multivariate ordinal regression? Which statistical model would also be suitable? Some more context: dependent variables - support for two policies 1) subsidies for electric vehicles, 2) CO2 tax independent variables - 1) ownership of an electric vehicle, 2) environmental ideology (voting for the green party), 3-6) some demographic variables like gender, age, income, and education level. research question: Who supports the environmental policies encouraging the purchase of electric vehicles - the greens or the owners of electric vehicles?
