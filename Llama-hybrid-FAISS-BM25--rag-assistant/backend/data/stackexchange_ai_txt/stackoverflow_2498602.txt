None of the above worked for me. The documentation for jquery ui is spare, and the source code didn't leave many clues for somebody not well versed in jquery. I used the accordion in a sidebar, and the links in each content section were inside tables, so I had to keep track of my HTML-structure (a fragile thing), and do this right after creation of the accordion: $("#sidebar td").each(function () { var td = $(this); var a = td[0].firstChild; if (a.href == location.href) { $("#sidebar").accordion("activate", td.parent().parent().parent().parent().prev()); } }); Yes, horrific, backing up a tr, tbody, table, and div, but it worked, and in our case we haven't changed the HTML-structure in months.
