I found Steve Sanderson's post Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) with SpecFlow and ASP.Net MVC and it's accompanying example project (Guestbook) invaluable in making this step from theory to practice. I must admit I was able to re-use a lot of his code in my own application without too much modification from what was originally intended as a simplified example. He uses WatiN (a tool for automating browser tests) to to do full acceptance testing from a user perspective. His example also includes a typical CRUD feature (create/update forms etc.), which is something so many examples avoid, even though it must be one of the most common things all of us do. Sanderson's one of those people who can break complicated ideas down into clearly understandable descriptions, and has a very pragmatic view on development practices.
