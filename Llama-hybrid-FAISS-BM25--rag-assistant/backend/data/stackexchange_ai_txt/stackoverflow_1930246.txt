Using SELECT in this SQL statement isn't working

My table is organised like this: With key as the primary field. The records shown are in the renamed table. I need to get out the original_name by the key. The key coluimn is the primary key of the table. This is my SQL code: SELECT original_name FROM `renamed` WHERE key='fb166' However, it does not return any results. I have tried both through my PHP script and directly through phpMyAdmin and both return an empty result set. Any help? :/
