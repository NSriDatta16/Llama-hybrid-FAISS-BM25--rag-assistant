Translational variance in convolutional neural networks

Convolutional networks have been proven to work very well detecting a shape independently of where it is in the image, which is referred as translational invariance. In the case where the position of an object in an image contains information for a classification problem, are convolutional networks still a good method? For example, if we have images of this kind: The position of the cat in the images is related with the time of the day, and because of that, we can infer if the cat is having lunch or dinner. Is convolution still a good candidate to solve this problem or are there more appropriate methods? In case convolution fits this purpose, might a fully connected layer be a better approach to solve the spatial variability? Edit : This is an oversimplification of the problem where images contain entangled and complex patterns which cannot be easily isolated.
