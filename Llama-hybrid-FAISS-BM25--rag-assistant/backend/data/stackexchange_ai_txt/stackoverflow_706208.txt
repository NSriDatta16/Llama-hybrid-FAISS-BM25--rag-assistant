I recommend using JeremiahClark extension posted above. ( CheckBoxList ) My controller resulted into very simple instructions. For clarify I add a fragment of my code that's absent in the sample. var rolesList = new List (); foreach (var role in Roles.GetAllRoles()) { rolesList.Add(new CheckBoxListInfo(role, role, Roles.IsUserInRole(user.UserName, role))); } ViewData["roles"] = listaRoles; And in the view: That's all.
