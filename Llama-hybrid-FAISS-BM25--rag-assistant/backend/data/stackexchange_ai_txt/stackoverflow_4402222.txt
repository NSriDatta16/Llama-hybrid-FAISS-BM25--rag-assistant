Data binding with ListPicker issue

I am trying to bind the data from linq xml in isolated storage. The data templates (ItemTemplate and FullModeItemTemplate) work fine and only show the value saved in the element or attribute in the xml document. However, although on the listpicker when selected it appears to use this name, the actual value held by the list picker is: appname.pagename + namestringusedwhensetting The name of the string comes from where I set it I presume. I am using this method: public class BindingSetter { string sValue; public string SValueN { get { return sValue; } set { sValue = value; } } } So it is returning: appname.pagename + sValue I have used binding throughout my application and have not had this problem before so i am a bit stumped. Thanks in advance.
