Few random variables cannot influence $n$ independent others too much?

I have $n$ standard normal and independent random variables $X_i$ (In reality I have a large known number of them, but let's just say I have $n$). In my experiment I want to on average get exactly 3 random variables $X_i$ under a threshold $c$. To get that, I can compute $c$ having that property easily, because the average number of $X_i$ that are under a threshold $c$ is $n \Phi(c)$ where $\Phi$ is the cdf of the standard normal distribution. So I choose $c = \Phi^{-1}(3/n)$ in this case. (Which is a negative number for large $n$.) But unfortunately I already know the value of two other standard normal random variables $Y$ and $Z$ which may depend on each other and on any number of the other $X_i$. So my question is: if I know that $Y$ and $Z$ are under the threshold $c=\Phi^{-1}(3/n)$, is it then still true that on average at most a constant number of the other random variables $X_i$ are under the threshold $c$? So by knowing that $Y$ and $Z$ are under the threshold, they can't suddenly make many of the other random variables go under it too. I am almost certain that they can't, but I don't know how to prove it. Any hints are welcome. Or books where you think this might be in.
