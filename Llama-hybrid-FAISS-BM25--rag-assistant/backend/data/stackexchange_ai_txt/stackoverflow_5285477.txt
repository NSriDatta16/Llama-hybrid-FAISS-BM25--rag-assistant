The difference between the two seems to be that scaleImage does a raw, pixel based resize, while resizeImage can use an interpolation filter : imagick::INTERPOLATE_AVERAGE imagick::INTERPOLATE_BICUBIC imagick::INTERPOLATE_BILINEAR ... that is likely to produce better results. More on the various interpolation methods on Wikipedia .
