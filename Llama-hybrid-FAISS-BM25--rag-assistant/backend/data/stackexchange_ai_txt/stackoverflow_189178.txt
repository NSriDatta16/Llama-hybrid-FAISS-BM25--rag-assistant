management by metrics does not work for people or for code; no metrics or absolute values will always work. Please don't let a fascination with metrics distract from truly evaluating the quality of the code. Metrics may appear to tell you important things about the code, but the best they can do is hint at areas to investigate. That is not to say that metrics are not useful. Metrics are most useful when they are changing , to look for areas that may be changing in unexpected ways. For example, if you suddenly go from 3 levels of inheritance to 15, or 4 parms per method to 12, dig in and figure out why. example: a stored procedure to update a database table may have as many parameters as the table has columns; an object interface to this procedure may have the same, or it may have one if there is an object to represent the data entity. But the constructor for the data entity may have all of those parameters. So what would the metrics for this tell you? Not much! And if you have enough situations like this in the code base, the target averages will be blown out of the water. So don't rely on metrics as absolute indicators of anything ; there is no substitute for reading/reviewing the code.
