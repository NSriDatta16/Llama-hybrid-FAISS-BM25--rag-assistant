Good suggestions, but rest assured, we have tried all of the usual troubleshooting. What I'm hoping is that this is a .NET issue that someone might know about, that we can work on solving. My feeling is that no matter how bizarre the underlying cause, the usual troubleshooting steps are your best bet for locating the issue. Since this is a performance issue, good measurements are invaluable. The overall process CPU usage is far too broad a measurement. Where is your service spending its time? You could use a profiler to measure this, or just log various section start and stops. If you aren't able to do even that, then use Andrea Bertani's suggestion -- isolate sections by removing others. Once you've located the general area, then you can make even finer-grained measurements, until you sort out the source of the CPU usage. If it's not obvious how to fix it at that point, you at least have ammunition for a much more specific question. If you have in fact already done all this usual troubleshooting, please do let us in on the secret.
