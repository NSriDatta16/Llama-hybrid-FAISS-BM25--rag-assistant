My preferred approach to using git with some remote storage (e.g. Jungle disk and the approach I use with Dropbox) is as follows: Create a local working repo Create a bare repo on the remotelysupplied storage (e.g. in a sync folder) Set up the remote using file:// protocol Push to the remote as needed This means that you are not dependent on the remote connection for VC activity and traffic over the a possibly slow network is as efficient as possible. If wanted you can add a post commit hook to push to the remote automatically. (Sorry but I can't remember who to credit with this, it's not my idea)
