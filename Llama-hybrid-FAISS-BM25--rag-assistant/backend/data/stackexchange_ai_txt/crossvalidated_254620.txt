Why aren't cox regression models validated against independent test sets in medical literature

It has been the standard in many machine learning journals for very many years that models should be evaluated against a test set that's identically distributed but has independently samples from training data, and authors report averages of many iterations of random train/test partitions of a full dataset. When looking at epidemiology research papers (e.g. risk of future stoke given lab results), I see that a huge proportion of papers build Cox proportional hazard models, from which they report hazard ratios, coefficients, and confidence intervals directly from a single training of a model, and do not evaluate the accuracy of the model on an independent test set. Is this, in general, reasonable?
