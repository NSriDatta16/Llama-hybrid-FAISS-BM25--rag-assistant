At the moment, this is more an answer sketch. I can fill out more details later if needed. I recommend starting by looking at the differences $w_t - w_{t-1}$. This also eliminates the dependence on the initial value $w_1$. Note that $\Delta_t w_t - w_{t-1} = 1$ iff $z_t \geq p_{t-1}$. You can use this to construct a likelihood function and use maximum likelihood estimation or bayesian methods. To do so, first note that unlike the $w_t$ the differences $\Delta_t = w_t - w_{t-1}$ are independent, so that you can multiply the individual likelihoods. Finally $$ P(\Delta_t = -1|\sigma^2)=p_{0.5, \sigma^2}(p_t{-1}) $$ with $p$ being the cumulative distribution function for the normal distribution. This suffices, since $$ P(\Delta_t = 1|\sigma^2) = 1- P(\Delta_t = -1|\sigma^2). $$ The CDF is complicated, but implemented in any statistical software package. For example, in WinBUGS you can use the following modelling code, where I rewrote the indices for $p$ to use $i$ instead of $i-1$: model { for (i in 1:N) { diffw[i] ~ dbern(prob[i]) prob[i] Some additional remarks: If you use the bayesian approach, you need to make certain that your initial values for $z$ are consistent with the observed data. This means the initial value $z_t$ must be larger than $p_t$ if the corresponding difference is 1. Finally, depending on your observed values you might learn very little about $\sigma^2$. Consider the case that all the $p_t = 0.5$. Then $z_t > p_t$ with probability 0.5 regardless of $\sigma^2$.
