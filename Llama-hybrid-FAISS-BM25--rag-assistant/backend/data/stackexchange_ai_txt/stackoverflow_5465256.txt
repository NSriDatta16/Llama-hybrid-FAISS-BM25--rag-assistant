Answer above probably works in WPF RTB but not in Silverlight 4.0. Most likely SL doesn't allow access to the Document protion of the RTB. So you have to do it via Reflection.... Something like this: Set up a TextSelectionChanged Event Handler Grab the TextSelection Pointer and find the Start TextPointer Grab the TextSelection.Start.Parent item Find out if it is of type paragraph Parse the Paragraph.Inlines Look for type of InlineUIContainer you need a cast it accordingly.
