I've not used db40, or any ORM/OODB product recently, however it would strike me that this kind of memory management & graph management feature should be part of the framework itself rather than something you build on top of it. If Versant's db40 doesn't offer this it might be worth you looking into another product instead that does offer it. So, I realise not the answer your looking for, but leveraging the framework would be my first port of call.
