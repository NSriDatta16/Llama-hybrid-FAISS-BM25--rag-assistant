TNS is a bit of a mess, imho. It seems to behave inconsistently between different platforms, in my (admittedly limited) experience. Far be it for me to defend Oracle, but I've had no problems with the JDBC thin driver. (If you read the oracle jdbc docs, they discourage you from using oci unless you have a very good reason. Pair it with JNDI (on a j2ee app server), and all your connection management problems are taken care of.
