What you heard about is "potential infringement of privacy", which is sharing the data on one thread's private stack with another thread. Although it is not encouraged, it is only a "potential" problem--with correct synchronization, it can be done safely. In your case, this synchronization is done by ::SendMessage(); it will not return until the message is processed in the other thread, so the data will not go out of scope on the main thread's stack. But beware that whatever you do with this pointer in the worker thread, it must be done before returning from the message handler (if you're storing it somewhere, be sure to make a copy).
