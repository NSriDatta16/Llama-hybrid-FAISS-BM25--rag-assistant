Writing an assembler , need help

I'm writing an 8086 assembler for a college project . I've gone through some material on compiler design on the internet and am reading the 'dragon book' of compilers . But the problem is I couldn't find much about the assembling (generating object code) part here . Are there any good books or links for assembler design . Where do I start ?, I've gone through lexical analysis,parsing and intermediate code generation .
