Datastructure for random word retrieval

I am trying to build a word-based-game application in Java. I browsed through some existing questions and got some idea how to get wordlist. Some of the questions I have referred to: How to pick a random english word from a list Random word selection My motive is to generate a random word. After getting the wordlist downloaded as a text file, I am trying to generate a Map m = new HashMap (); which could give me a word since I could query it using a random integer generated. Is this a recommended approach or is there a better way to generate a random word from the wordlist? Thanks.
