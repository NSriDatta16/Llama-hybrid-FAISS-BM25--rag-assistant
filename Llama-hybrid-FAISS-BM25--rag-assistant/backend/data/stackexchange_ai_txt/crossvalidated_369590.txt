How do I estimate $P[|v-\mu| > \epsilon]$ as a function of $\epsilon$?

Problem from: Learning from Data Say I flip $1000$ coins $10$ times each and choose three coins: $c1$ = the first coin, $c_{\text min}$ = the coin with the minimum frequency of heads, and $c_{\text{rand}}$ = a random coin. Then let $v_1, v_{\text {min}}, v_{\text {rand}}$ be the fraction of heads flipped for each respective coin. Assume this experiment is repeated $100000$ times so the resulting experiment results can be neatly organized in an array of shape $(100000,3)$ where each row is $[v_1, v_{\text {min}}, v_{\text {rand}}]_{i^{\text{th}} \text{ result }}$ . Assume each coin is fair so that $\mu = P[\text{ heads }] = P[\text{ tails }] = \frac{1}{2}$ Using the experiment results, how would I estimate $P[|v-\mu| > \epsilon]$ as a function of $\epsilon$ ? My thoughts are: $P[|v-\mu| > \epsilon] = 1 - P[|v - \mu| . But from here I don't really understand what I would do or how I would evaluate $P[v = k]$ . Anyone have any ideas?
