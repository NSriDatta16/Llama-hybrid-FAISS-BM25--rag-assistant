Are stationarity and low autocorrelation the prerequisite of regression model?

As said in the title, are stationarity and low autocorrelation the prerequisite of general / linear regression model ? That is, if a time series is non-stationary or has large autocorrelation, would it be easier or harder to be predicted using regression model such as linear model and deep learning ?
