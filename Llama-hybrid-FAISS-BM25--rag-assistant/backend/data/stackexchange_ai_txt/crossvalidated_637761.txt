There are several good graduate-level textbooks that are available. For a broad and advanced overview of ML topics, check out Kevin Murphy's new Probabilisitic Machine Learning book . Another resource is Christopher Bishops new Deep Learning book . I am also the author of The Variational Book , a focus on variational inference and generative algorithm theory, both of which are central to learning machine learning. I provide step by step derivations of many important concepts, ideas and theorems.
