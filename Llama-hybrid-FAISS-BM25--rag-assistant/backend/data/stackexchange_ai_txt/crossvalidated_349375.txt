Is there a Fisher Information equivalent in MAP Empirical Bayes estimation?

Background The Fisher information for a linear Gaussian model is $\mathcal{I}_{\theta} = \frac{X X^T}{\sigma^2} $. This is used in optimal experiment design techniques, for example, maximisation of $| \mathcal{I}_{\theta} |$ is called D-optimal design, which maximises the confidence in our estimation. Even for non-uniform priors, I assume that this would be still a target for optimisation in experiment design because the prior is not influenced by the data. However in Empirical Bayes techniques (type II MAP), the priors are influenced by the data. I assume then it would make sense to use another metric which takes into account what excitations of the model would bring about more posterior evidence. Question For a linear Gaussian model with $ y = \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{\theta} \mathbf{X} ,\mathbf{\Sigma}^2) $, and $ \theta = ~ \mathcal{N}(0, \mathbf{\Gamma}) $ so that the prior distribution is assumed to be normal, how would one derive a formula for an alternative Fisher information $| \mathcal{I}_{\theta,II} |$ which could be maximised to find the most informative excitations of a Bayesian probability model?
