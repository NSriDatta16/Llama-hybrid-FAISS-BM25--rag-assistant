Can Xtext be used for parsing general purpose programming languages?

I'm currently developing a general-purpose agent-based programming language (its syntaxt will be somewhat inspired by Java, and we are also using object in this language). Since the beginning of the project we were doubtful about the fact of using ANTLR or Xtext . At that time we found out that Xtext was implementing a subset of the feature of ANTLR. So we decided to use ANLTR for our language losing the possibility to have a full-fledged Eclipse editor for free for our language (such a nice features provided by Xtext). However, as the best of my knowledge, this summer the Xtext project has done a big step forward . Quoting from the link: What are the limitations of Xtext? Sven: You can implement almost any kind of programming language or DSL with Xtext. There is one exception, that is if you need to use so called 'Semantic Predicates' which is a rather complicated thing I don't think is worth being explained here. Very few languages really need this concept. However the prominent example is C/C++. We want to look into that topic for the next release. And that is also reinforced in the Xtext documentation : What is Xtext? No matter if you want to create a small textual domain-specific language (DSL) or you want to implement a full-blown general purpose programming language. With Xtext you can create your very own languages in a snap. Also if you already have an existing language but it lacks decent tool support, you can use Xtext to create a sophisticated Eclipse-based development environment providing editing experience known from modern Java IDEs in a surprisingly short amount of time. We call Xtext a language development framework. If Xtext has got rid of its past limitations why is it still not possible to find a complex Xtext grammar for the best known programming languages (Java, C#, etc.)? On the ANTLR website you can find tons of such grammar examples, for what concerns Xtext instead the only sample I was able to find is the one reported in the documentation. So maybe Xtext is still not mature to be used for implementing a general purpose programming language? I'm a bit worried about this... I would not start to re-write the grammar in Xtext for then to recognize that it was not suited for that.
