I take a pragmatic approach to these things. I avoid using tables for layout and use CSS if I can get away with it. I fall back to tables though, under some circumstances: I have to have the form layout correct on a lot of different browsers. CSS is easy to learn. But learning all of the idiosyncrasies of all CSS implementations and how to work around them, and how to have them work together, that can be a nightmare. There are some logical form layouts that simply cannot be expressed in CSS as it currently stands, but that CAN be expressed in tables. If you have to implement one of these layouts, you don't have much choice but to go with tables.
