^\D*(\d{5})(\s(\D)*$|()$) This should (it's untested) match: line starting with five digits (or some non-digits and then five digits), then a space, and ending with some non-numbers line starting and ending with five digits (or some non-digits and then five digits) \1 would be the five digits \2 would be the whole second half, if any \3 would be the word after the digits, if any edited to fit the asker's edited question edit again: I came up with a much more elegant solution: ^\D*(\d{5})\D*$
