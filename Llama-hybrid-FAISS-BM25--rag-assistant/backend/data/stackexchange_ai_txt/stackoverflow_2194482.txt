As you stated, no signals exist for this functionality. You have two basic options. Option 1 - Subclass: class FocusEmittingButton(QPushButton): #... def focusInEvent(self, event): # emit your signal You can then connect to that signal in your client code. Also, if necessary, you can use designer's Promote To feature to promote each button to the FocusEmittingButton type. You'll only need to subclass once, and then make sure the different buttons are all of the same type. Option 2 - Use QApplication.focusChanged You can also leverage QApplication.focusChanged(oldQWidget, newQWidget) . By doing so, you won't need to subclass and override the focus events. Instead, you connect to the QApplication.focusChanged signal and then respond in a handler.
