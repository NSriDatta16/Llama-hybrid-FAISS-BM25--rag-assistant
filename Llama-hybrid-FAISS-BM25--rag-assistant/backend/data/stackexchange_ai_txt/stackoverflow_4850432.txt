You would probably be best off solving this problem with javascript (or even better a javascript library like jquery). You could measure the height of the div containing the text you want to paginate and dynamically break it apart and add links in the browser. There would be several ways of solving this problem but I would probably do it by sequentially chopping off paragraphs from the end and remeasuring and repeating until it was short enough. Obviously the chopped off paragraphs would have to be collected somewhere to be used for the next page (and recursively measured again in case the second page was also too long).
