I'm not at all sure about this, but I think that if you take the mean of beta variables that are independent but not necessarily identically distributed, the resulting mean approaches a random variable normally distributed as the number of averaged variables increases (because of Lyapunov central limit theorem ). Is that right? An empirical test seems to confirm this. Here's the distribution of 10000 means, each coming from 100 betas with shape1 = 1 and varying shape2. set.seed(1234) means
