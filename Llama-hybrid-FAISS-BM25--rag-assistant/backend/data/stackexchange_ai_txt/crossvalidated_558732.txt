Time complexity of training SVM and C

I always though that a big (high) C will lead to a lower svm training complexity due to lower number of support vectors. I was very surprised to read a paper that states the opposite - aka, big Cs actually cause higher training time. I then checked out in other few places, they all state the same (big C - high training time). Can anyone explain why is this true? Thank you!
