This answer actually lies on the dataset and the use case. It's hard to tell definitively which is better. GRU exposes the complete memory unlike LSTM, so applications which that acts as advantage might be helpful. Also, adding onto why to use GRU - it is computationally easier than LSTM since it has only 2 gates and if it's performance is on par with LSTM, then why not? This paper demonstrates excellently with graphs the superiority of gated networks over a simple RNN but clearly mentions that it cannot conclude which of the either are better. So, if you are confused as to which to use as your model, I'd suggest you to train both and then get the better of them.
