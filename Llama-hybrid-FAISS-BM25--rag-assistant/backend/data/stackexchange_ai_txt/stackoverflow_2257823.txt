If you can't make the top page appear to be a cfm to the outside have you thought about using the URL Rewrite Module for IIS ? That way you could just make certain files cfms with some explicit htm to cfm rewrite rules but leave all others unprocessed. Beyond that I think there may not be an elegant answer since you are mixing static and dynamic content. On your comment about ajax - personally I don't find anything tedious about using ajax but then again jquery spoils you... $.get('navmenu.cfm', function(data) {$('.menuhere').html(data); }); Accomplishes the same thing as the SSI plus (assuming jQuery is cached) you get faster main content page loads to boot.
