delims with nothing between them give empty strings when split. Empty strings evaluate as false in boolean context. If you know that your "details" input will never contain "0" (or other scalar that evaluates to false), this should work: my @matrixDetail = split(',', $matrixLine[1]); die if @matrixDetail > @oldDetail; my $newDetailString = ""; for my $i (0..$#oldDetail) { $newDetailString .= $matrixDetail[$i] || $oldDetail[$i]; # thanks canSpice } say $newDetailString; (there are probably other scalars besides empty string and zero that evaluate to false but I couldn't name them off the top of my head.) TMTOWTDI: $matrixDetail[$_] ||= $oldDetail[$_] for 0..$#oldDetail; my $newDetailString = join("", @matrixDetail); edit: for loops now go from 0 to $#oldDetail instead of $#matrixDetail since trailing ",,," are not returned by split. edit2: if you can't be sure that real input won't evaluate as false, you could always just test the length of your split elements. This is safer, definitely, though perhaps less elegant ^_^
