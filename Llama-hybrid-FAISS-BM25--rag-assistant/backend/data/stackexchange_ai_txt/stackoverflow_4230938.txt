HttpWebRequest.CachePolicy: questions about caching

If I set my HttpWebRequest.CachePolicy as follows: var webRequest = (HttpWebRequest) WebRequest.Create(url); var policy = new HttpRequestCachePolicy( HttpCacheAgeControl.MaxAge, TimeSpan.FromMinutes(1) ); webRequest.CachePolicy = policy; and make two async requests for the same URL at exactly the same moment, what happens to the second request? Does the second complete only when the first has cached, or will 2 requests be issued because nothing is in cache at the time of issue? Also, in this context, what is the cache? Where does it live? Do we get more control over it?
