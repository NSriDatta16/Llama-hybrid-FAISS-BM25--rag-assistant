Automating Windows GUI Testing - FindWindowEx and Control Classes

I've inherited a C# window's application that I'm not real crazy about. I've got a looming deadline and I'm scared to death that some of my changes might be having adverse effects on existing functionality. I've got a hobbyist background to RoR and I'm fairly comfortable with testing in that framework (using both RSpec and Cucumber). I love having test scripts that can be ran on a regular basis and I'm willing to spend my personal time developing those for this particular project. I purchased a book from PragProg.com on scripted GUI testing with Ruby ( http://pragprog.com/titles/idgtr/scripted-gui-testing-with-ruby ). So far, I'm digging what I'm seeing and I think that this should work well. Unfortunately, I've got a fundamental lack of understanding concerning Windows app development. I'm making calles to FindWindowEx (via Win32API) to "attempt" to retrieve sub-controls in my application. A big part of my confusion is how I should retrieve the Class Name of the control that I'm trying to capture. The example provided in the text is as follows: edit = find_window_ex.call @main_window, 0, 'ATL:00434310', nil Where @main_window is my application's main window handle, and 'ATL:...' is the class of a text box area. There is no explanation given as to how the author arrived at 'ATL:...'. I've read some very old posts concerning MS's SPY++, but those seem to be obsolete (or for some reason it wasn't installed when I installed vs2010). So, what's the best way for me to find control classes to be used with the findWindowEx call? I do have the source code - should I be pulling from there? What if I don't have the source code and I want to automate an application? Is there a utility that allows you to somehow "browse" controls on a running application? Sorry for the length - thanks in advance for the help! Bob
