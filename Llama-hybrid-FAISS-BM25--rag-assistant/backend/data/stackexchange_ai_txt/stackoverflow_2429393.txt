linking naturally saves bandwidth which if your service legitimately sends many emails is certainly an important consideration. I agree though embedding images does create a better user experience. I would embed images if you know your demographic aren't going to filter the images which IMHO looks worse than linked images. Another consideration is the use of the images. Are you going to include them as incidental to the content ie. could they not be included as links at the end? In your case I suspect not, so we're back to bandwidth and filtration considerations. Hope this helps.
