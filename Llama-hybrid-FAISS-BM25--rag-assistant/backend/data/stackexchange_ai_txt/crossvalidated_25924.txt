The reason why 1-component PLS looses to 1-component PLS based on first 10-20 PCA components is that, in the former case, the correlation structure between the original variables is partially lost (since the 1-component PLS direction is chosen only based on the correlations between the original input variables and the outcome variable). In the latter case though all PCA variables are not correlated to each other which makes 1-component PLS equivalent to least squares regression (OLS) based on the PCA variables (i.e. no information is lost apart from loosing the rest of the PCA directions which are not very informative anyway) In any case, from predictive power perspective, it does not really make sense to limit the number of components in PLS (or PCR) to one - instead the number of components in PLS/PCR should be treated as a "meta" parameter which should be tuned using resampling (e.g. using package caret which provides a really nice harness for that)
