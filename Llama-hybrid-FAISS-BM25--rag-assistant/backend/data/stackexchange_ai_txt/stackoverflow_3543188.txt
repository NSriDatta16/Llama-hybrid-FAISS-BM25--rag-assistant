Rene's answer only gives you the "world coordinates" (that is, coords independent of zoom level and viewport). MBO's answer seems right, though, so that's the one you should accept and vote up (I can't as I just registered) as the solution might easily be overlooked otherwise. As for an "easier" version, you can use the methods in MapCanvasProjection instead, but that means you'll have to make your own overlay. See here for an example. :P
