First, get a reference to the Paragraphs of the TextRange2 , as each bulleted item is a paragraph (really a TextRange2 ). Dim pres As Presentation Set pres = Application.ActivePresentation Dim slide As slide Set slide = pres.Slides(2) Dim shapes As shapes Set shapes = slide.shapes Dim textShape As Shape Set textShape = shapes(2) Dim textFrame As TextFrame2 Set textFrame = textShape.TextFrame2 Dim textRng As TextRange2 Set textRng = textFrame.textRange Dim p As TextRange2 Set p = textRng.Paragraphs SetIndent 1, p.Item(1) SetIndent 2, p.Item(2) SetIndent 2, p.Item(3) SetIndent 1, p.Item(4) The last four lines call a function that encapsulates the logic of setting the indent "level," which affects the style of bullets and text, and the actual indent of the bullets and text: Private Function SetIndent(ByVal level As Integer, ByRef p As TextRange2) p.ParagraphFormat.IndentLevel = level p.ParagraphFormat.FirstLineIndent = 40 p.ParagraphFormat.LeftIndent = level * 40 End Function You could certainly refactor this to meet your needs -- like passing the indent factor (I hardcoded it as 40, but your mileage may vary).
