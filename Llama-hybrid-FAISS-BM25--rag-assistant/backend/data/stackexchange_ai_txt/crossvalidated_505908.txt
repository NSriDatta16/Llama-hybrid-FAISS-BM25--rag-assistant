How to calculate Random Forest manually?

I have several questions about the Random Forest algorithm. Is it possible to calculate manually using Random Forest? If we can calculate manually, can you please teach me how can I get this data sample? Assume I want to get a price for: -Demand: normal,-Duration: 30min, Distance: 2km Does the result we get from calculating manually will match the one we run with the program? The reason why I ask those questions is that I'm trying to make a pricing system app with Random Forest regression from Sklearn. The app will use that algorithm to calculate prices based on several variables. I also want to know about the mathematical theory about the random forest and how it exactly works, so I can calculate manually and compare the result I get with the result from running the app. I will appreciate any help.
