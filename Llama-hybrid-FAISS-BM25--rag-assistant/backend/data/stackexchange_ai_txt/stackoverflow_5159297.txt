This is painful but the only good solution is to use an HTML parser and parse all the hrefs. I recommend using a library that allows you to easily select all hrefs. I have heard of this one http://code.google.com/p/phpquery/ but never used it. What you would do is load each page and then select all hrefs. There is really no easier way. If you changed your technology to something like java or python, then you can leverage multi-thread power and speed up the process. Of course once you analyze, save the data in some database so you can later reference it. Hope this helps.
