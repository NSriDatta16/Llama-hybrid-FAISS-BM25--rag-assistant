Quaternions are a type of hypercomplex numbers that can be used to represent rotations in 3D space, and quaternion neural networks (QNNs) have been proposed as a way to better model the non-linearities of 3D data. However, in the context of chest X-rays, which are 2D images, it's not clear that QNNs would provide any benefit over traditional CNN architectures. Regarding your question about RGB versus grayscale images, the decision depends on the specific details of your problem. Grayscale images have only one channel (i.e., intensity) per pixel, while RGB images have three channels (red, green, and blue) per pixel. Converting RGB to grayscale will result in a loss of information about color, but it may simplify the model and make it easier to train. In general, if color information is relevant to the problem at hand, then using RGB images may be better. For example, if the presence of certain colors is indicative of the presence or absence of pneumonia, then RGB images could help the model learn these relationships. However, if color is not relevant or the model is struggling to learn from the RGB images, then grayscale images may be a better choice. It's important to note that in some cases, converting RGB to grayscale can introduce its own biases and distortions, so it's always a good idea to experiment with both approaches and evaluate the performance of the model on a held-out test set.
