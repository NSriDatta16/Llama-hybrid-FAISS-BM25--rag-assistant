The compiler can analyze the entire function before actually emitting any code. Typically, the compiler will work out, for each braced segment, how much storage is required, and add a single assembly instruction in the function prologue to adjust the stack pointer by that many bytes. Actually initializing the variables, however, occurs at the appropriate point in the code.
