Note that from a mixed model the fixed effects coefficients and the probabilities you calculate from them have an interpretation conditional on the random effects. This will be different than the observed probabilities, especially as the variance of the random effects increases. In particular, in the case of the mixed-effects logistic regression with only one random intercept, the relation between the marginal and conditional log odds ratios is: $$\beta^M = \frac{\beta^C}{\sqrt{1 + 0.346 \times \sigma_b^2}},$$ where $\sigma_b^2$ is the variance of the random intercepts.
