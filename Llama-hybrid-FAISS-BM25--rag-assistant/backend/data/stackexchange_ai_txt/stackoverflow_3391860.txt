Read only mode for Ruby on Rails application

I have an interactive Ruby on Rails application which I would like to put into a "read only mode" during certain times. This will allow users to read the data they need but block them from actions that write to the database. One way to do this would be to have a true/false variable located in the database that was checked before any write was made. My question. Is there a more elegant solution for this problem out there?
