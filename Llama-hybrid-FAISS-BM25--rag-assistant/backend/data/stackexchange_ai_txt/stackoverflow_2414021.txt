You can do it by embedding them inside the string in this way: sql.call("{call myfunction(${(int) (Calendar.instance.timeInMillis/1000)}, ..., ${input.isManager ? 1 : 0}, ...}") then since SQL should ignore line breaks if not in the middle of a word (I absolutely don't remember this well) you can use triple-double-escaped-strings (what a powerful name): """call myfunction${(int) (Calendar.instance.timeInMillis/1000)} ..., ${input.isManager ? 1 : 0}, ...}""" without annoying yourself with a long string.
