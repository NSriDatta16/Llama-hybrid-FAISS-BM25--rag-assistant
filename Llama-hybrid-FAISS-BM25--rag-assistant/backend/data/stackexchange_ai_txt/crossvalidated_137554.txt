What you are looking for is the $\chi^2$ statistic produced at the end of the test. The null hypothesis of the Hausman test is that the fixed and random effects model do not differ significantly from each other. A significant test statistic means that we reject the null. In your case Test: Ho: difference in coefficients not systematic chi2(5) = (b-B)'[(V_b-V_B)^(-1)](b-B) = 341.23 Prob>chi2 = 0.0000 the value of the test statistic is 341.23 and the p-value shows that this value is significant at the 1% level and even below ( Prob>chi2 = 0.0000 ). The same holds for your second test but be sure that you pay attention to the note displayed at the top of the test where it warns you that the coefficients between the two models you test are not the same. Stata issues such warnings for good reason normally and choosing to ignore such warnings should be based on a deep understanding of what is going on and that it is a sound decision to ignore the warning (typically it is not).
