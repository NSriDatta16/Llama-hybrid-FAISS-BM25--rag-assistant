How to generate code-coverage info from VS2010 solution with Intel Fortran projects

The clue is in the title really but I'm struggling to get code coverage for a mixed solution (C#,C++,Fortran). The C# drops out easily and I believe native C++ is supported to a degree but I can't work out how to get figures for the Fortran? any ideas? apparently Intel's given me a "code coverage tool" but I can't find it.
