Delayed messages in JMS queue

I have a question about a delay that happens intermittently in one queue. I'm using JMS over Weblogic 10.0. So, the client sends a message to the server through the queue called RequestQueue. The server responses to the client through the queue called ResponseQueue. The response message is a 12-character Java String, a simple answer. The average response time is 3 seconds. But, sometimes the response message is delayed and it arrives in... 2 minutes! The message seems to remain in the queue. There is no error in logs, the response message always arrives, but about 10%, this delay happens, and I don't know why. I can't identify any pattern that explain this situation. Could you tell me any suggestion about this? Thanks in advance
