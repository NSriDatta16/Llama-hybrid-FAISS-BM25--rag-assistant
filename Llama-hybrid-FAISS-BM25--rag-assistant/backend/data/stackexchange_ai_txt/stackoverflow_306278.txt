Actually, you can. Browsers don't care about doctypes. HTML 4 strict or HTML 5 won't make a difference, just make sure your page is in Standards Mode, not Quirks Mode . Personally, I don't see a reason not to use the HTML5 doctype, as you would be using HTML5, and, unlike any of the others, you can remember it! Of course, session storage as defined in HTML5 won't work in IE6â€”but it is up to you to decide what kind of fallback you'll provide.
