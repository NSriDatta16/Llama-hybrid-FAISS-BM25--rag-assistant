The SAFE_DEL macro is unnecessary and makes the code less readable. Simply do: [someObject release], someObject = nil; It won't matter if someObject is already nil and it makes the code more directly readable. As soon as the are scrolling and I hit the Back button in the navigation controller I experience the bug. Any time you have non-memory management logic, you have fragility. Namely, when dealloc is being executed, it is quite likely because there is an entire sub-graph of objects in your application that are being deallocated. Since deallocation order is largely non-deterministic, you can't safely trigger any complex behavior in dealloc without risk that you are going to message an already dealloc ated object. The best solution would be to get that cancellation mechanism out of dealloc !
