If this is for a forecasting purpose, I advice that you do a forecasting segmentation as Intermittent time series can be categories into 4 segments(i.e Intermittent, Lumpy, Smooth, Erratic). Using ADI(Average Demand Interval) AND CV^2(Co-efficient of Variation). After doing this, you can then apply different forecasting methods for each segmentation. An intermittent time series refers to a set of data points that are observed irregularly or sporadically over time. Unlike a regular time series, where data is collected at a fixed interval, intermittent time series may have gaps or missing values between observations. For example, if you are tracking the number of customers who visit a store, and you only record the data when someone makes a purchase, you would have an intermittent time series. This is because you are not collecting data at regular intervals but only when there is an event (i.e., a customer makes a purchase). Intermittent time series can be challenging to analyze and forecast because of the irregularity in the data. However, there are statistical methods and techniques that can be used to analyze intermittent time series and make predictions based on the available data.
