PageSetup only affects printing. You need to use the Window Zoom. In C# it's something like: Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.Application xlApp = new Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.Application(); xlApp.ActiveWindow.Zoom = 150; This only affects the sheet in the active window, not every sheet. You can also set the zoom through the workbook ( wbk.Windows[0].Zoom ) rather than xlApp.ActiveWindow . The way to implement this for all sheets in a Workbook object MyWorkbook is to select all of the sheets and then hit the ActiveWindow : MyWorkbook.Sheets.Select(Type.Missing); MyWorkbook.Windows[1].Zoom = 150; I tested this and Windows[1] seems to give you document-level customization. I had a problem embedding this code in the workbook's Startup event, but it seems to be fine further down the line.
