when to use PCA in this scenario

I have a feature matrix n by p, where n is small. I want to do leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) .Should I apply some dimension reduction technique (like PCA) for once at the very beginning, and perform LOOCV based on the new feature matrix, or apply PCA during each loop of LOOCV (so I get different features matrices in different loop)?
