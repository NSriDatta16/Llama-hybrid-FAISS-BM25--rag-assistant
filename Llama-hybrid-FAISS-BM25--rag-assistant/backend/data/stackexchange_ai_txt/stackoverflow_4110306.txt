XSLT vs. XQuery

I am new to those two technologies, I sketched their roles in generating an HTML out of raw XML file as I understood in these steps(Please correct me if I was wrong): XML data source (database, RSS, ...) XQuery (Data manipulation FLWR) XSLT (Data representation through templating) The resulting XHTML document to be delivered I am wondering about the technical details of using them, to be specific, here are the questions: How to implement XQuery in a PHP web server (I am using WAMP suite). How can I request .xq page (can I do that directly, or should I use a CGI to do that?) How can I pass the resulting XML page from XQuery call to XSLT for templating? Could you give me some pointers the development environment to create a website using these technologies, thanks. -- Update: I understand now that difference between XQuery and XSLT is a difference in point of view since two different working groups are maintaining them, both will do the job though in different approaches. I am using XSLT only for both data operations and representation, I am implementing structured templating approach which is found here XSLT Abstractions in order to organize the work a little bit.
