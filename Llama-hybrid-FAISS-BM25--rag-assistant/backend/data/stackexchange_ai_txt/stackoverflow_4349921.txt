I just asked a similar question and then I read the 2010-11-15 release of the View Programming Guide for iOS. Page 64 caught my attention. In the animation block, one can still use the [UIView setAnimationRepeatCount:] . I thought that I could/should not. So my ability to read Apple doc needs to improve. So perhaps this would solve your (and my need). I'm trying it later today
