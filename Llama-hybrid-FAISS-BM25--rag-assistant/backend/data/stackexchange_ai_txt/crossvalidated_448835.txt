Conducting Statistical Analysis on Evolving Populations

I am writing a paper on the evolution of altruism. To do so, I have written a computer program that simulates the environment and allows a population to evolve. Organisms are either altruists or are not altruists. Altruists will try to save organisms that starve on any generation, but their probability of reproduction is decreased by a parameter p . My test was to conduct the simulation in ten trials with different values of p . For each trial, 5 simulations were run, each lasting 30 generations. Throughout, I tracked the proportion of altruists in the population. The data tables are massive, but I constructed a summary by averaging the altruist frequency across each of the five exposures, which is shown here: I've been told that I should conduct an ANOVA to compare each of the series. I want to test the null hypothesis of the altruistic parameter having no effect on the evolution of the population. How do I do that? It was suggested that I take the slopes of each value of p and then do the ANOVA, but I'm entirely unsure how to do so or what the requirements are?
