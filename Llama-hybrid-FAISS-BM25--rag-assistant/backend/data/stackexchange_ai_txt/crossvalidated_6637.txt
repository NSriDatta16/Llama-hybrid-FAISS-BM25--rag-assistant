Constrained versus unconstrained formulation of SVM optimisation

Let us take two formulations of the $\ell_{2}$ SVM optimization problem, one constrained: $\min_{\alpha,b} ||w||_2^2 + C \sum_{i=1}^n {\xi_{i}^2}$ s.t $ y_i(w^T x_i +b) \geq 1 - \xi_i$ and $\xi_i \geq 0 \forall i$ and one unconstrained: $\min_{\alpha,b} ||w||_2^2 + C \sum_{i=1}^n \max(0,1 - y_i (w^T x_i + b))^2$ What is the difference between those two formulations of the optimization problem? Is one better than the other? Hope I didn't make any mistake in the equations. Thanks. Update : I took the unconstrained formulation from Olivier Chapelle's work . It seems that people use the unconstrained optimization problem when they want to work on the primal and the other way around when they want to work on the dual, I was wondering why?
