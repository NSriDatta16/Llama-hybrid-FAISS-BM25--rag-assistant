So you want to be able to distinguish between two kinds of pages using specific elements - basically, the presence of barcodes. There are two steps: feature extraction (computer vision): find interest points or lines which would be specific features of barcodes and not text. binary classification (statistical learning): determine whether there is a barcode or not, based on the extracted features. Dealing with the first step, you should definitely have a look at the Hough transform . It is ideal to identify lines in an image, and could be useful for barcode detection. Read these two pages for instance. Here are examples with OpenCV. About the second step, the most useful classifications would be based on: k nearest neighbours logistic regression random forest (really well implemented in R, but I do not know about Python)
