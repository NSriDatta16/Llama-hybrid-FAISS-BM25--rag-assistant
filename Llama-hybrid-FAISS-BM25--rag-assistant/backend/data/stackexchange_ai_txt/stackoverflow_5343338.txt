This sounds like a filesystem issue to me. What is your fstype? Oh, and what versions / distros / archs are your OSs? Things to check: Does the script work on linux when the file is on local storage? Are your versions of Perl, BDB and DB_File the same across both systems? [yet another edit] I would also run a strace on your script in linux to see if there's anything strange happening around record 12,000
