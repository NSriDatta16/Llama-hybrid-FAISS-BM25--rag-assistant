It makes most sense in my opinion to indeed treat store closure days as missing data. After all, if the store had been open that day, we would probably have seen some sales. (Alternatively, one could treat these data points as censored at zero - but on the one hand, I have rarely seen a forecast that does it this way, and on the other hand, this happens rarely enough that the two approaches probably don't make much of a difference.) Now, your problem is that "classical" forecasting methods can't deal with missing values very well (see here, though: Fitting ARIMA to time series with missing values ). One simple approach would be to impute before you fit: fill the missing observation with an average of the sales from the same day of week a few weeks before and after. This at least makes the models work. Then forecast, and of course, set the forecasts for such future closure dates to zero.
