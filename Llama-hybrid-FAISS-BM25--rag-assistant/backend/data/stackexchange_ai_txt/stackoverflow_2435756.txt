To be honest I really like YUI . Most of the links are from YUI2, but they are also working hard on YUI3. Pros: A lot of documentation . The quality of the documentation is also pretty good. It is sometimes a lot of documentation you have to read(not really necessary if one of the examples does what you need). A lot of code examples . Which you can play with immediately. Good javascript API . Has a CDN which hosts there library for you. This can significantly improve performance because. I also would like to notice that YAHOO's CDN combo's files which is another big boost for performance. This used to be a big pro for me, but now google also hosted the most influatential libraries for you so this isn't such a big pro as it was to me anymore(I still like that they combo javascript files). active open source development (If you like you can contribute yourself via github) by a lot of really good javascript programmers. For example: Douglas Crockford, Eric Miraglia, and a lot more . Cons: Sometimes a little verbose(YUI2) but in YUI3 they have improved this in my opinion not really a con. Also a lot of users liked the verbose syntax (I liked it most of the times). Verdict: Overall YUI is really a good javascript library if you ask me.
