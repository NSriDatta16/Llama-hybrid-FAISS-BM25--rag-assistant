SSD MobileNet v1 loss not converging bounding boxes all over the place

I've trained SSD MobileNet v2 model using Tensorflow API on my own dataset of ~4k dog pictures and it displays bounding boxes all over the place. I've trained with batch size 1. The same dataset trained on faster rcnn works really well, and detects dogs properly. I've run 50k iterations, and total loss was spiking from 1.5 to 3 all the time in the end, with random bigger spikes, but overall it went down from 20 There wasn't a smooth and gradual decline, but a really spiky and uneven one with both models Learning graph I know it's a fast model with low precision, but it should at least more or less detect the object. How can I increase accuracy so it at least partially detects objects without showing completely false bounding boxes ?
