The paragraph you mentioned explains a the parametric procedure of creating training data and testing data from a given data set. Let us take an example let us consider that the distribution of a certain dataset follows Normal distribution (Gaussian) This means that 68% of the data lies near the mean of the dataset. Also since the dataset has been identified as gaussian we also know the expected probability function (pdf) of the data set assuming we know the mean and variance of the given dataset. $P(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma ^2}} e^{\frac{-(x-\mu)^2}{2 \sigma ^2}}$ Now that we have the formula we can use random variate generation techniques on this formula to create training and test data separately which can be used for the model to learn and test its efficiency. To learn more about random variate generation I'd direct you to this resource here . It has a great chapter which can help you with understanding the statistical technique behind it.
