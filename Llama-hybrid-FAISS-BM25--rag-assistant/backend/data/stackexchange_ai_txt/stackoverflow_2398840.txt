Leverage Google account credentials to send email in Android

Is it possible in Android to programmatically send an email using the phone's associated GMail credentials? I can send an email when I explicitly provide the username and password, but I was hoping to leverage the Google account already associated with the phone. Note that I don't need to actually access the username or password; I just want to leverage this information indirectly to send email.
