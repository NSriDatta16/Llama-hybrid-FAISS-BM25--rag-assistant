Publicly available petabyte-scale data set?

Does anybody know of any data sets that are publicly available and huge (i.e., in the petabyte ballpark). Ideally, the data set would be relevant to machine learning analyses. Maybe something from the physics, chemistry, natural-language-processing domains? I guess you could say the Web itself is such a data set, but I'm looking for something a little more structured than that. Thanks in advance.
