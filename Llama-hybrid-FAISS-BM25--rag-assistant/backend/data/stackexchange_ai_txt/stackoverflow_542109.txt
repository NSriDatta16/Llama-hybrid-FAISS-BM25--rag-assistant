Okay, that was just a bit tough to follow, but I think I'm getting the gist. The XKCD cartoon is showing you how easy it is to make a real-life problem NP-complete. (Of course, since most menus have a small number of items and a uniform set of prices, it's also easy to show that there is a trivial answer.) The idea of "embedding" an NP-complete problem I think you're referring to is finding a poly-time reduction; I've written that up pretty completely elsewhere on SO.
