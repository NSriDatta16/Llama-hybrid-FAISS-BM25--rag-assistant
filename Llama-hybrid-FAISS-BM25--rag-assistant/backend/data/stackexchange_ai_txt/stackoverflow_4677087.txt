There's a difference between certificates and provisioning profiles. You have to generate a provisioning profile first, which I think you can now do right in the Organizer as you can see in WrightsCS's screenshot. Just press the Refresh button. You MAY have to do something on the website too, I'm not sure because I started before the Organizer had that functionality. But it seems like the key problem is you're expecting the certificate to be a provisioning profile, which it isn't.
