Eclipse Ganymede javascript editor uses huge memory

I am new to here, but I wish someone can help me resolve the problem: version: 3.5 OS: Win 7 64bit JVM 1.6 I am using the javascript editor to write some code using YUI package, and seems it uses extremely huge amount of memory. Even when I put the mouse cursor on a variable, it will put up about 100M, so it runs to 1G very soon... I tried to disable the javascript syntax validator, but seems I might only change the config file tag to really disable it... I use eclipse 3.2/3.3 on another machine (Win XP), which runs well... Please advice what happens and what should I do. Thanks a lot
