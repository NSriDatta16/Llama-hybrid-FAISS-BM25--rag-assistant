Javascript objects are transformers (TM), they can turn from one form to another. In practise this only happens to enrich objects, never to cause harm. It allows one to for example upgrade an existing 'class' rather then subclassing or to decorate instances again removing the need to create even more 'classes'. Take the following example: var Vehicle = function(){} var factory = { create: function(name, props){ var v = new Vehicle(); v.type = name; for(var prop in props) { v[prop] = props[prop]; } } } var bike = factory.create('Bike', { wheels: 2 }); var car = factory.create('Car', { wheels: 4, doors: 5, gear: 'automatic' }); var plane = factory.create('Airplane', { wings: 2, engines: 4 }); Imagine what the code above would take without dynamic objects and you couldn't do this: // lets paint our car car.color = 'candy red'; // bling! car.racingStripes = true; car.mirrorDice = true; car.furryChairs = true; You get to enrich/personalize objects in a much easier way.
