Calculating standard error of the mean for dose response assays when the data in the points is processed?

I am trying to report honest statistics about an experiment. I do not have a statistics background and am unsure how to approach this question. My experiment measures a signal (S) minus background control (C) for each data point, this is the 'response'. The points are plotted against concentration, the 'dose'. I measure both the signal and the background control in indepedent experiments and I duplicate the experiment according to good scientific practice. In the field, this is called 'N=2'. I assume then for some dose, I have: S N=1 , S N=2 , C N=1 , N=2 A point for a given dose is the average, like this: ((S N=1 -C N=1 )+(S N=2 -C N=2 ))/2 From this average, I can get a standard deviation, and then I could say N=2 for the two measurements, and calculate the SEM for each data point. But I don't know if this is correct? N is also written as samples sometimes, so that could be 4. Also I could instead average the two signals and the two controls seperately, and then subtract them to get the data points. Then I guess I would add the standard deviation for both S N and C N and divide by N=4? Other lab mates have brought up propagation of error and that also changes based on how I do the math, further confusing me. I don't know which method is correct or how to rigorously figure it out.
