Multinomial regression after PCA

I have extracted 7 factors from 25 variables using principal component analysis with varimax rotation. Now I want to use these factors as independent variables and study their relation with an ordinal dependent variable. For this I applied multinomial logistic regression in SPSS. But it gives me a warning that a number of cells have zero frequencies. What should be done?
