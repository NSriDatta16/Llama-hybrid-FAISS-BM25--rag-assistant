If your player movement is bounded by Core Animation , you can setup the setAnimationDidStopSelector to a custom STOP function and starts your AI there. If you have a game loop with states , just add enough states (e.g. user_move_began , user_move_ended , ai_think_began , ai_think_ended , ai_move_began .. ) to sequence the flow.
