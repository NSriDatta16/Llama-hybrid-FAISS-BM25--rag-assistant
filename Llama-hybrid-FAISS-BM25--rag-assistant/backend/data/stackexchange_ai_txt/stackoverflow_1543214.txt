This behavior is also true for Hibernate ( 19.2. The Second Level Cache ): Be aware that caches are not aware of changes made to the persistent store by another application. They can, however, be configured to regularly expire cached data. This sounds reasonable. How should your cache know about any changes done by another application if this one doesn't use the cache? The only possibility left for the cache/JPA provider would be to monitor the database (all tables, all data) for changes and update accordingly. This isn't really feasible. I've also read that it's strongly discouraged to use the second-level cache when multiple applications change the same data in the database, for the above mentioned reasons.
