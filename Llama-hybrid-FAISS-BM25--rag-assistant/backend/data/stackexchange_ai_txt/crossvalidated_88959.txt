How to take into consideration gaps in time series?

I've been analysing what is the probability of that measurement going up or down during a week (e.g. 4 times out of 7, I have 60% chances of my measurement going up) everyday for the last 100 days, but I couldn't record 10 consecutive days, so I started again. Lets say: day 1: 10 day 2: 11 day 3: 10 day 4: 14 ... day 90: 13 day 91: -- day 92: -- ... (day 93 to 99: --) day 100: -- day 101: 16 day 102: 15 day 103: 15 where "--" is no data recorded for that day. Before it was easy to read, during any 7 consecutive days the probability of the measurement going up is x, but after the gap, it's not, because the last 7 days have missed readings. What is the best way to interpret the missed readings. Should I just get rid of the gap?
