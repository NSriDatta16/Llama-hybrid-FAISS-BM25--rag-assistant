I once had to store a complex hierarchical arbitrary-depth bill-of-material system in a SQL-like database manager that wasn't really up to the task, and it ended up forcing messy and tricky indicies, data definitions, queries, etc. After restarting from scratch, using the db manager to provide only an API for record reads and writes on simple indexed keys, and doing all of the actual input/manipulation/reporting in external code, the final result was quicker to implement, easier to understand, and simpler to maintain and enhance. The most complex query needed was essentially SELECT A FROM B. So, instead of embedding logic and operations inside the restrictions of MySQL, consider banging out code to do what you want, and relying on MySQL only for the lowest-level gets/puts.
