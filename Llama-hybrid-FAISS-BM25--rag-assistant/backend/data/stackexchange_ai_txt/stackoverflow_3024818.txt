When you use the clone option, the original item is hidden with style="display: none" when you start dragging. You could attach a handler to the sort event (or whatever event hides the original item) to re-show it. Everything should work for you then. P.S. I used Firebug to look at what was happening to the original element. If you're not using it you really ought to be!
