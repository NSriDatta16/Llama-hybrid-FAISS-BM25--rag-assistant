Seems pretty hokey to me. They appear to be claiming that their new diet plan will make people loose weight according to an exponential decay process . They are treating pounds above a "target weight" as analogous to radioactive atoms in a hunk of uranium. The average time that one of these pounds will last before being lost is $\tau$ (tau), which is equal to the reciprocal of the decay rate $\lambda$. It is just another way of parameterizing the exponential decay model.
