Did someone seriously ask if the dragon book could be out of date? It's the seminal work man. I can't tell you how much i learned just from the first two chapters(cause I've since forgotten it...ba-dum-bum). Every technology (save maybe the goto statement) has both detractors and supporters. Don't get hung up on "making the right tooling choice" and go whole hog into learning the concepts and implementing them in a way that makes sense. I mean come on man even if you chose the perfect best tools in the world do you think you'd build something as loved, adored and respected as much as FORTRAN is these days...I mean we love it...right? Of course not man...so much of learning comes from making the mistakes. That's where you learn the most. YOU CAN DO IT!
