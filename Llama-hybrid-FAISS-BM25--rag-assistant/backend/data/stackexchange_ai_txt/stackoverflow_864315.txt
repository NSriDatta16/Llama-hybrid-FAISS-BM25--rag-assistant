What is the most elegant way to map one list to another in Java?

I am new in Java so please be patient. It is common to map (convert) lists to lists. Some languages have a map method, some (C#) Select . How is this done with Java? Is a for loop the only option? I expect to be able to do something like this: List customers = new ArrayList (); ... List dtos = customers.convert(new Converter(){ public convert(c) { return new CustomerDto(); } }) I have missed something? Please give me a starting point.
