How to listen for dispatched events from container children?

I'm using an accordion container that has it's creation policy set to auto. One of the accordion's children is a spark border container that has a data grid within it. Currently, I'm using the data grid's creationComplete property to call a function; similarly, I'm using the dragComplete property to call another function. How can I add listeners for events (creationComplete & dragComplete) via actionscript ? The obvious problem is that the accordion does not create all its children on creation (nor do I want it to), so I can't simply use something like: datagrid.addEventListener(...)
