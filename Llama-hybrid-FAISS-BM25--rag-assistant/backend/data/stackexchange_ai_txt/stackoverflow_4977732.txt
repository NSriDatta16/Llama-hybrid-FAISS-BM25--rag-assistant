It is a bad habit to store user-created content in the web application. Typically web applications are deployed as wars, and extracting the war (if it happens) is up to the container. You don't want to write in a directory "owned" by the container. Typically you assign a place on the filesystem (or in the database) where you put user created content. You can configure such a place using the context (in Tomcat context.xml), you can retrieve that property in a servlet (getServletContext), and use that configuration in your application. That would also give the system administrator the possibility to put the data on a place which gets backed up frequently. Even if you don't have such an organization the habit to configure file system places is not bad.
