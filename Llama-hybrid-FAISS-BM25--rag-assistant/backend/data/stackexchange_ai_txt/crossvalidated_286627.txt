How do I compare 2 survival curves?

I am comparing the survival of 2 insect larvae under identical conditions. I have the cumulative survival rate (%) for each day. In my case, I have 100% survival on day 0 (the start of the test) and survival goes down from there. When I plot this for both insects, I get 2 curves with cumulated survival on the Y-axis and the number of days since the start of the test on the X-axis. What test should I use to see if these curves are significantly different from each other?
