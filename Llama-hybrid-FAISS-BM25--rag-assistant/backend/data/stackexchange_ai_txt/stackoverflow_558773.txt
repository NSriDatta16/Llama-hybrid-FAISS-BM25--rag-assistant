That's an interesting problem. You got yourself into it I think because it was disabled. I may have found a way to get you out of it without blocking everything else. First, know that this behavior is a bug in SQL Server 2005 pre SP1, make sure you have SP1. If you already do, try: ALTER FULLTEXT INDEX ON tablename SET CHANGE_TRACKING MANUAL ALTER FULLTEXT INDEX ON tablename START UPDATE POPULATION If that works then I think you've run into the same issue as this guy. He just set a job to run every hour or so. Granted, it's a temporary solution but it will give you time until you can actually rebuild the index. Something else that just came to mind, have you tried REORGANIZEing the index? I know it doesn't block but I'm not sure if it will cause the flush to happen in such a way to keep it from blocking too.
