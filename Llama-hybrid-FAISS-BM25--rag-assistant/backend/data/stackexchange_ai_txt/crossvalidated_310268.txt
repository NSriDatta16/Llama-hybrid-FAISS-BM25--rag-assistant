R ugarchfit: is there a convergence indicator?

Say I want to fit GARCH(1,1) models to several time series in a loop. I have tested some simple code like this: library(rugarch) spec where s is one of my time series. I have noticed that sometimes the GARCH algorithm doesn't converge. Following a good answer here , I have realised that often it's sufficient to remove a few points from the series to get convergence. As I have many time series, I was thinking of implementing a loop where, in case of no convergence, the algorithm tries to run GARCH on the series after it has removed a few points. However, in order to do that, I need an indicator in the output of ugarchfit that would let me automatically detect whether the GARCH algorithm converges or not. Is there anything like that?
