How do you install a certificate in a PFX file in to the personal container of the NT-AUTHORITY\NetworkService?

I have a .PXF file used to strongly name several of our .NET assemblies. VS2010/MSBUILD seems to expect this to be in the personal container for the user account running VS2010/MSBUILD. This is all just fine and dandy when working in an interactive user account, but when atempting an automated build via TFS 2010 on the build agent the account used by the build agent (by default) is NT-AUTHORITY/NetworkService. Since I cannot log in an interacive session as NetworkService I cant just install the PFX from an interactive sessions shell. So can anyone tell me how I install a PFX certificate in the personal cert store of the NetworkService account?
