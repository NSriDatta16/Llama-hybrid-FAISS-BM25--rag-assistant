Here's a simple awk solution: awk 'BEGIN {acnt=0; bcnt=0;} /a/ {acnt++;} /b/ {bcnt++} END { if (acnt > 0 && bcnt > 0) print "Matches"; }' $FILE A slightly simpler way is to just use grep , leveraging its return value as an indicator that the value was found: grep -l a $FILE && grep -l b $FILE && echo "Both a and b found in $FILE" You may want to redirect standard output, but the above should be simple and functional. You could wrap it in a loop if wanted: files="" for x in *; do grep -l a $x && grep -l b $x && files="$files $x" # assuming no spaces done # now you can iterate over $files
