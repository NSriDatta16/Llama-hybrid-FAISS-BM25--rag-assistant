If you're concerned about performance, it's better to trigger behavior off of elements with "id" values. In my experience, unless there are many hundreds of such checks that your code needs to make, there's no noticeable performance drag. You can possibly help even more by having more than one level of check. Give some pages with relatively unique needs a special class on the body tag, and then you can nest a bunch of tests within a test for that class. That way, pages that can be ruled out for some Javascript functionality will only require a single check.
