In scikit SVC and nuSVC are mathematically equivalent with both methods based on the library libsvm . The main difference is that SVC uses the parameter C while nuSVC uses the parameter nu . LinearSVC is based on the library liblinear . As the documentation says, LinearSVC is similar to SVC with parameter kernel='linear' , but liblinear offers more penalties and loss functions in order to scale better with large numbers of samples. Please check out this question and this question for more details.
