You could try (zero out distanceSinceStart and timeSinceStart in touchesBegan): distanceSinceStart = distanceSinceStart + distanceFromPrevious; timeSinceStart = timeSincestart + timeSincePrevious; speed = distanceSinceStart/timeSinceStart; which will give you the average speed since you started the touch (total distance/total time). Or you could do a moving average of the speed, perhaps an exponential moving average: const float lambda = 0.8f; // the closer to 1 the higher weight to the next touch newSpeed = (1.0 - lambda) * oldSpeed + lambda* (distanceFromPrevious/timeSincePrevious); oldSpeed = newSpeed; You can adjust lambda to values near 1 if you want to give more weight to recent values.
