The ACF plot is indeed meaningless for categorical time series (CTS) since Pearson's correlation coefficient is designed for continuous variables. When dealing with CTS, the concept of autocorrelation is replaced by serial dependence. Different measures can be used to calculate it: Cramer's V, as well as Goodman and Kruskal’s tau, are measures for unsigned serial dependence, while Cohen's kappa accounts for signed serial dependence.
