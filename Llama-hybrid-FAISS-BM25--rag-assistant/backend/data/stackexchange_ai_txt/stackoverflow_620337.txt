What would be ideal what be to use a .ASPX page as a template somehow, then just tell my code to serve that page, and use the HTML returned for the email. You could easily just construct a WebRequest to hit an ASPX page and get the resultant HTML. With a little more work, you can probably get it done without the WebRequest. A PageParser and a Response.Filter would allow you to run the page and capture the output...though there may be some more elegant ways.
