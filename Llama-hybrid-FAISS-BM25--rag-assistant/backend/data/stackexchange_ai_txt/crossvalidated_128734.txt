Well thanks for the nice comments, folks. Since I'm still kicking, I can let you know about several other paper of mine that deal with pseudoreplication, as well as ones that deal with other important statistical issues (multiple comparisons, pseudofactorialism, collapse of the Neyman-Pearson framework, terminological confusion promoted by statisticians, misuse of one-tailed tests) by referring you to my website at http://www.bio.sdsu.edu/pub/stuart/stuart.html On topic, Hurlbert & White (1993) clarified the definitions of the different types of pseudoreplication, and Hurlbert('Ancient black art,' 2009; 'Affirmation', 2013) review the topic and related terminological issues. Pdfs of all these papers are available on the website. Keep calm and carry on! s.h. I should add, in response to Emilie's Sept 25 comment, that pseudoreplication can never be "valid" as by definition it is a statistical analysis (and interpretation) that does not accord with the study design. It is not defined as conducting an experiment with only a single experimental unit per treatment or simply taking multiple samples from a single experimental unit.
