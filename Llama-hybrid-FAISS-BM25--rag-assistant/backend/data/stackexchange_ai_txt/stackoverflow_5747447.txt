Two things to do. First, fix the url to the php file. As @ctacke mentioned the one you have points to the local device... which isn't hosting the php file unless you have some really weird stuff going on. The second one is optional. Instead of doing an asynchronous request, make it synchronous. For example: String postLocation = "http://myserver.com/test.php"; HttpWebRequest httpRequest = (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create(postLocation); // Setting the useragent seems to resolve certain issues that *may* crop up with certain servers. httpRequest.UserAgent = "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727)"; using (HttpWebResponse httpResponse = (HttpWebResponse)httpRequest.GetResponse()) { StreamReader reader = new StreamReader(httpResponse.GetResponseStream()); string results = reader.ReadToEnd(); // at this point you have the entire response in the results variable. // Do with it as you please... } At the very least, if there is a real problem the synchronous method should give you immediate feedback on the issue.
