The way Ive been doing it is by creating a class that has a property of type List. I dhave a method called LoadReport(params......) in this class where I would call GetEmployess to populate my property. I would then add a new Dataset in the report designer, selecting to bind to Object, and selecting the class i created. Once finished the dataset will allow you to expand the List property where you can drag different fields onto the designer. Ive done this in VS2008, currently attempting in VS2010
