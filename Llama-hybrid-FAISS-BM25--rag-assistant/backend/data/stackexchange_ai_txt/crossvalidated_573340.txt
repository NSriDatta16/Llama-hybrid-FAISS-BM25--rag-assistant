Richard. I hope this helps. If it's indeed a time series data, it's a single loan or an aggregated loan, isn't it? Those characteristics have to be attributed to that single/aggregated loan as well. If it's not the case, you may have multiple loaners whose characteristics vary along the time, which suggest you have a (dynamic) panel data. Please clarify. As for the model, if it's time series with a binary dependent variable, the general solution is to use a Logit model (Logistic). Stationarity is recommended but if your variables aren't macro, they might not be non-stationary (sorry double negative). After the estimation, you can use similar residual diagnostics, but in addition sensitivity/specificity, ROC tests (among other) related to logistic models. (i'm assuming no lags on dependent variable). Ramsey's test could be of help, but remember it's for omitted variables only. If it's not an autoregressive model/dynamic (actually, the main advantage of using times series techniques) then modern cointegration could be off topic (However, it's not usual). A classical cointegration Engle-Granger test could be sufficient.
