Can I use NSURLCredentialStorage for HTTP Basic Authentication?

I have a cocoa class set up that I want to use to connect to a RESTful web service I'm building. I have decided to use HTTP Basic Authentication on my PHP backend like so… At this point I'm using a synchronous NSURLConnection, which I understand the Apple documentation states has less support for Authentication. But is it even possible at all? I can do cookie authentication very easily sans NSURLProtectionSpaces or NSURLCredentials or any of the authentication classes. Also, are there any resources where I can read more about the Cocoa Authentication classes? Thanks. UPDATE: mikeabdullahuk The code you supplied (the second example) is almost identical to what I had written. I have done some more investigating, and discovered that the NSURLConnection is returning an error… Error Domain=NSURLErrorDomain Code=-1012 UserInfo=0x1a5170 "Operation could not be completed. (NSURLErrorDomain error -1012.)" The code corresponds to NSURLErrorUserCancelledAuthentication. So apparently my code is not accessing the NSURLCredentialStorage and instead is canceling the authentication. Could this have anything to do with the PHP HTTP Authentication functions? I'm quite confused at this point.
