If an object (rather than a value) is defined as a class member variable, then its storage is always tied to the object instance of that class. Therefore, if the containing object is allocated on the stack, then that object and the field will die when the stack unrolls. If the containing object is allocated on the heap, then the field object will die when the entire containing object dies with delete. You will only be applying delete to a field if that is a pointer, since all that is stored with the containing object is the address of some other memory area, and you are deleting the materials in that area.
