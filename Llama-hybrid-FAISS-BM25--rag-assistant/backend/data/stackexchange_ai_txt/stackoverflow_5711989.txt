Try this. No idea if it will work or not :P { Glib::RefPtr *settings = new WebKit::WebSettings::create(); // do some stuff to the object (use -> instead of . since it's a pointer) web.set_settings(*settings); // dereference the pointer } // later Glib::RefPtr settings = web.get_settings(); Reason I think this will work is because making settings a pointer will allocate the storage on the heap, and the pointer will go out of scope, but the object itself will not. I could be wrong though, this is simply a C++ programmer's guess, I have no experience with any of the stuff you're working with (webkit, gtk, etc).
