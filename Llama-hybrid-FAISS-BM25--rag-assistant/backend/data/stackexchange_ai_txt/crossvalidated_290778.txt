How to use MCMC / gibbs sampling instead of an optimization algorithm ?

I've tried and implementend Factorization Machines with different loss functions and optimization algorithms (SGD , coordinate descent, adagrad, adadelta ...) and I've seen that it's possible to use MCMC too. I didn't know what it meant at first and no pseudo-code was given in Rendle's article. So I tried to discover what it is, Markov Chains aren't complete strangers to me since I've taken a Stochastic processes course but even if I understood the core idea of MCMC, I still don't understand how I can use it to learn a predictive model's parameters. Can anyone guide me and/or give some good references to me in that regard ? Thanks !
