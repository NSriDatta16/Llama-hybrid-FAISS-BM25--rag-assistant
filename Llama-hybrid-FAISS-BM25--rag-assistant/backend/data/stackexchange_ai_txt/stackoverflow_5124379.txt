When we use ADO.NET from scratch sooner or later we get frustrated and start looking for other solutions. I have tested many of them. Most of those ORM frameworks have lots of features and requires lots of knowledge. Some seem very easy at the beginning (eg: EF, Castle ActiveRecord) but there are many things you shall care about: Caching Many-to-many relationships Lazy loading Inheritance Composite keys How to encapsulate infratructure from callers How SQL statements are generated Performance How to make advanced database queries If you are an experienced developer and you are ready for all those pitfalls and stuffs then I ask you: Are your workmates also? There are easier ways to code ADO.NET and not loose control of what is happening. Take a look at PainlessDAL . "Elegant" coding is not always the best way.
