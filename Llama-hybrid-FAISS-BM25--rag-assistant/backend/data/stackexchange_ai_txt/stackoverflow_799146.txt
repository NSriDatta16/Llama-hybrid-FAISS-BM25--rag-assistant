Fragmentation and reassembly happens at the IP level, so you need not worry about that (Wikipedia) . (This means that you won't receive split or truncated packets). UDP packets have a checksum for the data and the header, so receiving bogus data is unlikely, but possible. Lost or duplicate packets are also possible. You should check your data in any case anyway. There's no congestion control, so you may wish to consider that, if you plan on clogging the tubes with a lot of UDP packets.
