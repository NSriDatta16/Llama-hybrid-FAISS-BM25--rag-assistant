No you can't define a path which is outside the plug-in. Though fragments are considered in addition to the bundle. In general, bundles aren't tied to a location on disk so you can't really define where a path like ../properties should resolve to. Consider for example a bundle installed using BundleContext#installBundle(String location, InputStream input) . The location parameter is the identity of the bundle and there are no semantics tied to it. The content of the bundle is read out of the input stream. What would a path outside of the bundle mean then?
