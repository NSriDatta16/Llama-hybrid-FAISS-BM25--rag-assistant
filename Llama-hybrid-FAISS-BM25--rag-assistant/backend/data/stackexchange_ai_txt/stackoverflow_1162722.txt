There is the hprof tool built into the JVM ( http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/Programming/HPROF.html ) which allows you to capture basic profiling information, its dog slow and produces massive files. VisualVM AFAIK does not yet have these abilities, but yourkit has the ability to do what you want though its agent, and programmatically. Yourkit via agent line (-agentlib:yjpagent=onexit=snapshot) http://www.yourkit.com/docs/80/help/additional_agent_options.jsp Programmatically http://www.yourkit.com/docs/80/api/index.html As an aside I would suggest that you are careful with measuring CPU along with performance testing as it will definatly skew your results, have you considered looking at something like https://japex.dev.java.net/ around your core code ?
