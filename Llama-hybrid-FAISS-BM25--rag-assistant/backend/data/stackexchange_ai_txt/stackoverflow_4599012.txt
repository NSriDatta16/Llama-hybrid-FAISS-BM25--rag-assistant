You could do it server side with cURL in post.php. So, you have your variables set and they've been validated and cleaned, then: $zoho = curl_init("https://crm.zoho.com/crm/WebToLeadForm"); curl_setopt($zoho, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, false); //Note, not very secure. Would have to get certificate otherwise. Look up how to. curl_setopt($zoho, CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION, 1); //Makes sure that it follows any redirects curl_setopt($zoho, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1); //Returns the result instead of outputting it to the browser curl_setopt($zoho, CURLOPT_USERAGENT, "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 5.01; Windows NT 5.0)"); //Will make the end server think it was submitted with Firefox, and not by a server using cURL. curl_setopt($zoho, CURLOPT_POST, 1); curl_setopt($zoho, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, $zohoprams); //If you want the rest of the $_POST data and not just what you set above in $zohoprams, //CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS takes either an array, which will automatically do the appropriate thing with it as a $key=$value, or a string like you have formatted for $zohoprams curl_exec($zoho); curl_close($zoho); $max = curl_init('http://www.max360group.com/'); curl_setopt($max, CURLOPT_POST, 1); curl_setopt($max, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, $maxprams); curl_setopt($max, CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION, 1); curl_setopt($max, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1); curl_setopt($max, CURLOPT_USERAGENT, "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 5.01; Windows NT 5.0)"); curl_exec($max); curl_close($max); Might need to be changed a bit to do exactly what you want, and probably would need to forge the headers like it's a browser doing it, but that is the basic functionality of it. Might also need to set CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER to true.
