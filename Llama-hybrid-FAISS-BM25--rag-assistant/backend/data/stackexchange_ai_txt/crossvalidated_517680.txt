Markov model for patients on a transplant waitlist?

I am developing a Markov model in Treeage based upon survival data for individuals on a transplant waitlist (running first order monte carlo). Over the time horizon, individuals may either become ineligible for a transplant, receive a transplant, remain on the waitlist, or die. Death should generally be at the end, but for simplicity for now, lets say it is structured as the following: Everyone begins on waitlist: 1st branch: remain eligible or become ineligible (terminal). 2nd branch: For those remaining eligible, did they die (terminal) or live. 3rd branch: For those who remain eligible and lived, did they get a transplant (terminal) or do they remain on the waitlist to begin the cycle again. Let's say in the actual data this is what would have occurred in the first cycle: 600 began 27 were ineligible 10 died 15 received a transplant and the remaining went back to the waitlist I have tried running conditional probabilities in SAS (lifetest method act, each outcome separate, time is time of waitlist, censoring for other end points) as well as a competing risk model (cif at each cycle) for each outcome to determine transition probabilities by cycle, but both methods have not seemed to work (either over estimating or under estimating by cycle when validating against the actual counts in the data). I am not well versed when it comes to more complex models (for me anyways) such as this so I was wondering if anyone could provide some insight as to the proper method to calculate transition probabilities? Or if I'm looking this the wrong way or might need to consider a different type of model to analyze the problem. Any resources or guidance is appreciated.
