I do something similar (starring a favorite) like this, but I think you're demanding a lot from the thumbs of iPhone users with the cell directing people to another view. First of all, I would check out the detail disclosure option on cells. One of the options is a pre-made arrow button that you can attach to. Your call. You might be able to get away with catching the didSelectRowAtIndexPath event and then doing some other logic instead of redirecting if the touch was on your checkbox, although I don't know how you would get the position. This means you might need to find a way to get ahold of the touch event before it calls didSelectRowAtIndex path, which I'm not quite sure how to do. Have you worked with handling touchesBegan and the like yet?
