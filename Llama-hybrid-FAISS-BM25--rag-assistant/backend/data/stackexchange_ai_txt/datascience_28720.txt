No. There is no similar mechanism for continuous variable. If it worries you, that overall prices fluctuate in relatively low range , you can 1) demean the price, that is subtract mean price from all price values. Then negative values will clearly show below-average and positive above-average prices. 2) after demeaning you can divide values by the standard deviation of the price. (1) and (2) together is called "standardization". Alternatively you can 3) rescale your price to the range of values you want. Usual choice is (0,1) range. If you do this for one feature (price in your case), then it makes sense to do the same for other features. Whether or not this will help to get better prediction results depends on the model. Some models, a typical example would be SVM, do require such transformation.
