I am not sure what your are testing. If its a product, why don't you use statistical process control? https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_process_control If you have high dimensional multivariate data, you could use PCA- T2 and PCA-SPE analysis. In this technique, you can set your confidence level.
