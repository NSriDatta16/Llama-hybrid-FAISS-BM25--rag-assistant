there are two options for you according to me. Use an alertview Use MBProgressHUD. For alertView You have to place a UIAlertView variable in .h file. Then place following code - when you are requesting/loading data. av=[[UIAlertView alloc] initWithTitle:@"Loading Data" message:@"" delegate:self cancelButtonTitle:nil otherButtonTitles:nil]; ActInd=[[UIActivityIndicatorView alloc] initWithActivityIndicatorStyle:UIActivityIndicatorViewStyleWhiteLarge]; [ActInd startAnimating]; [ActInd setFrame:CGRectMake(125, 60, 37, 37)]; [av addSubview:ActInd]; [av show]; Now, place following statement when you have finished your processing. [av dismissWithClickedButtonIndex:0 animated:YES]; [av release]; av=nil; Another way is using MBProgressHUD It's very useful & ready made for you - you just have to follow these steps. Download it from given link Import Both file to your project ( copy not link ) #import "MBProgressHUD.h" - import this where you want to use progress view. MBProgressHUD *mbProcess; - declare a variable in *.h file. Place following code when you are processing ( in *.m file ) mbProcess=[[MBProgressHUD alloc] initWithView:self.view]; mbProcess.labelText=@"Loading Data"; [self.view addSubview:mbProcess]; [mbProcess setDelegate:self]; [mbProcess show:YES]; When your processing is done place this line. [mbProcess hide:YES]; Don't forget to add delegate method of MBProgressHUD in you *.m file. like this #pragma mark - #pragma mark MBProgressHUDDelegate methods - (void)hudWasHidden { // Remove HUD from screen when the HUD was hidded [mbProcess removeFromSuperview]; [mbProcess release]; }
