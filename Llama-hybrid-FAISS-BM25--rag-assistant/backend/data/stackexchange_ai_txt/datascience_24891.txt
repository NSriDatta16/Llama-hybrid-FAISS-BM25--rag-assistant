When you run PCA on train data, you will get a vector space in lower dimension (After choosing the biggest components). As you know, this vector space contains the eigen vectors of the biggest eigen values. Now, using a proper function, project the test data into the vector space. So, you do not need to get PCA over test data anymore.
