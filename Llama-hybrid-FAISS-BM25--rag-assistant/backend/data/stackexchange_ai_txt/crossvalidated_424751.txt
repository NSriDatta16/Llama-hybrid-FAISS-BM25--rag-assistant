Adding to what was already said: A simple approach to represent categorical features in a model (whatever model you use) is one-hot-encoding. This translates the categories to indicators and the representation is again numeric. A rather novel idea is to apply feature embedding s. The idea is to go beyond simple indicator vectors of zeros and ones. Rather, the aim is to represent relations between the levels of the categorical feature. In this blog post Exploring Embeddings for Categorical Variables with Keras the 7 days of the week (+ a level for "missing") are embedded in a lower dimensional space with the result of improved generalization. The embedding uses the target (bike count data) and the position of e.g. Saturday is closer to Sunday (and close to Tuesday) than to Wednesday. It is debatable whether this is true but one-hot-encoding would not be able to achieve this.
