The sample ACVF (autocovariance function) at lag $ h $ is defined as $$ \hat{\gamma}(h) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{t=1}^{n-h} (x_t - \bar{x}_n)(x_{t+h} - \bar{x}_n) $$ where $ \bar{x}_n $ is the mean of the time series. Thus, given that your time series has a total of 7 datapoints, the ACVF at lag 6 is highly sensitive to the first and last values of your time series, and thus the reported autocorrelation should not be regarded as significant.
