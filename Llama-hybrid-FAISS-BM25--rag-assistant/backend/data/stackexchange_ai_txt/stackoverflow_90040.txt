Code Coverage is a misleading metric if 100% coverage is your goal (instead of 100% testing of all features). You could get a 100% by hitting all the lines once. However you could still miss out testing a particular sequence (logical path) in which those lines are hit. You could not get a 100% but still have tested all your 80%/freq used code-paths. Having tests that test every 'throw ExceptionTypeX' or similar defensive programming guard you've put in is a 'nice to have' not a 'must have' So trust yourself or your developers to be thorough and cover every path through their code. Be pragmatic and don't chase the magical 100% coverage. If you TDD your code you should get a 90%+ coverage as a bonus. Use code-coverage to highlight chunks of code you have missed (shouldn't happen if you TDD though.. since you write code only to make a test pass. No code can exist without its partner test. )
