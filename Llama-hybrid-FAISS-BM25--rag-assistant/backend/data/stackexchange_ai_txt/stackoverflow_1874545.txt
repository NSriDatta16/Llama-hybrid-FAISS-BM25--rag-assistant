MAPCAR takes a function as first argument. '(lambda (x) (aref x 0)) is the same as (quote (lambda (x) (aref x 0))) , and this is not a function. You want to make it a function with (function (lambda (x) (aref x 0))) , which can be written shorter as #'(lambda (x) (aref x 0)) , or even (because of a standard macro) (lambda (x) (aref x 0)) . '(p1 p2) is the same as (quote (p1 p2)) . QUOTE means that the arguments are not evaluated , so the names "P1" and "P2" stand for themselves, not for their values. The type error you get is that the symbol 'P1 is not an array, it just has an array as value. In order to get a list of the values, use LIST: (list p1 p2) . In conclusion: (mapcar #'(lambda (x) (aref x 0)) (list p1 p2)) EDIT: For subtracting vectors, you should look into the MAP function; note that you can provide multiple sequences.
