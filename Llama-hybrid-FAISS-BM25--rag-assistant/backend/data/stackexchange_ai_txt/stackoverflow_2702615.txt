I had some issues with adding images a while back, it turned out the flash image uploader was the culprit. I tracked down what swf file it was and replaced it with a newer version of Magento that I downloaded. If that doesn't help here's a module that will allow you to upload images without the flash uploader. You may at least be able to ensure it's not a flash issue.
