Sending an int from Java to C using sockets

I was just wondering how to send an int from a Java application to a C application using sockets. I have got different C programs communicating with each other and have got the Java application retrieving data from the C application, but I can't work out sending. The C application is acting as database, the Java application then sends a user id (a 4 digit number) to the C application, if it exists it returns that record's details. In Java I have tried using a printWriter and DataOutputStream to send the data, printWriter produces weird symbols and DataOutputStream produces "prof_agent.so". Any help would be appreciated as I don't have a good grasp of sockets at the moment.
