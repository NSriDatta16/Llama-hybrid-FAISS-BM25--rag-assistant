Marking Changes to database

I am developing application to be run in central server and distributed computers. I am supposed to write application to backup the data from distributed machines and merge it in central server. I thought of compressing whole local database and sending it to server for merging. But as the database size grows the size of compress file also began to grow. So is there any way to merge data in central server without sending whole database. I need to do it on daily basis. Daily take backup and send to server
