Random forest regression approach

I'd like to use random forest regression (in R, randomForest package) to say something about the importance of a set of genes (binary) for schizophrenia-related behavior (continuous measure). I am still reading up on this technique, but would already really appreciate any feedback on some questions. In general, is it a good approach to enter a few dozen binary predictors to assess their importance (as a set, and individually) for a continuous measure with a sample size of ~1000 people? More specific questions: What are important considerations for deciding the number of genes to look at a priori? I have an additional interest in interactions (though perhaps not the most appropriate word in this context), does it make any sense to say something about the influence one predictor has over others by looking at the change in estimated importance of the others when that predictor is removed from the model? I have a few siblings in the sample, i.e. non-independence of the data, is this a problem with this technique and if so, is there anything I can do about it? The few papers I have seen so far on using this technique in a similar situation do not include any pretty standard covariates such as age and gender, should I?
