This is in Knuth - googling the phrase "vybong bysanton" (which has stuck in my mind ever since reading it) produces this slashdot comment and response: In section 4.1 of The Art of Computer Programming, Donald Knuth describes: ...a prominent Swedish-American civil engineer named John W. Nystrom [who] decided to... [devise] a complete system of numeration, weights, and measures based on radix-16 arithmetic. He wrote, "I am not afraid, or do not hesitate, to advocate a binary system of arithmetic and metrology. I know I have nature on my side; if I do not succeed to impress upon you its utility and great importance to mankind, it will reflect that much less credit on our generation, upon our scientific men and philosophers." Nystrom devised special means for pronouncing hexadecimal numbers; for example, [0xC0160] was to be read "vybong, bysanton." His entire system was called the Tonal System, and it is described in J. Franklin Inst. 46 (1863), 263-275, 337,348, 402-407. Maybe you should get that issue of that journal and give it a try. (response:) quoted from http://www.monmouth.com/~colonel/tonal.html [monmouth.com] From Recreations in Mathematics, by H. E. Licks (Van Nostrand, 1917): John W. Nystrom of Philadelphia devised about fifty years ago the tonal system&quot of numeration in which 16 is the base instead of 10 as in the decimal system. The numerals 1, 2, 3, 4, etc., were called An, De, Ti, Go, etc., and new characters were devised for 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. This system embraced also a new division of the year into 16 months, these having the names Anuary, Debrian, Timander, Gostus, Suvenary, Bylian, Ratamber, Mesidius, Nictorary, Kolumbian, Husander, Victorius, Lamboary, Polian, Fylander, Tonborious, the first two letters of each month being the names of the sixteen numerals. This is slightly inaccurate. The figure 9 was used for 10, on the principle of making the digits for 8 or greater look like those of their 16's complements written upside down; and a new figure was devised for 9. The name of 12 was Vy, not Vi; and I believe that the meth, nith, vyth, and tonth months were named Mesudius, Nictoary, Vyctorius, and Tonborius. The year began at the winter solstice, that being the Anth of Anuary. Every month had tonra days except for Debrian, Gostus, and Lamboary, which had only tonby, but Debrian had an extra day in leap years. The powers of ton were: ton, san, mill, bong. These could be used as prefixes to indicate multiplication or as suffixes to indicate division. For instance, the day was divided into ton (sixteen) tims, a tim into ton timtons, and a timton into ton timsans.
