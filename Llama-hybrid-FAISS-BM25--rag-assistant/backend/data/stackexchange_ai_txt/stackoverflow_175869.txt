How do I hook up a referencing outlet in Interface Bulider for a UIImage?

I want to access a UIImage programmatically... i.e. myImage.hidden = TRUE; etc. I can do this fine for UILabel but when I repeat the process for UIImage it doesn't work. Specifically when I drag the blue line in Interface Builder over the icon I don't get a popup menu like I do when using UILabel. Perhaps using UIImageView instead of UIImage? Thanks!
