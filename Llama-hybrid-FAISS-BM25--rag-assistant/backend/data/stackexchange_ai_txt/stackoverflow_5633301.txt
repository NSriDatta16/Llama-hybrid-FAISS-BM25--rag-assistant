Cannot turn off short_open_tag with ini_set

I'm embedding a javascript syntax highlighter to a PHP script that reads source file and echos it back. The js highlighter has this string on one line: ... [z,/^[^ The short_open_tag is on on this server and the in the string confuses the script and causes errors. I cannot turn off in php.ini or elsewhere. I have used ini_set('short_open_tag', '0'); in the same script, but it does not take effect. What could be the problem? Edit In the end, I used what Col Shrapnel suggested in a comment: I changed [z,/^[^ to [z,/^[^ ]+/],
