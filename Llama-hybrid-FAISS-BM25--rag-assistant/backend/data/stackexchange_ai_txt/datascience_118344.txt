More generally, is there a good way to translate embeddings from one model vector space to another? I am not sure if my answer is correct, but, in my opinion, linear transformation of embedding can transfrom from one model vector space to another. Also, you can argument vector by using PCA (principal component analysis). Principal component analysis is a popular technique for analyzing large datasets containing a high number of dimensions/features per observation, increasing the interpretability of data while preserving the maximum amount of information, and enabling the visualization of multidimensional data. wikipedia's explanation is here
