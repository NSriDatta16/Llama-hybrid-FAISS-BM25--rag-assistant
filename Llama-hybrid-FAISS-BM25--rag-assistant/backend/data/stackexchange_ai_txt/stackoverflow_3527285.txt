EDIT : Now for different input sample (corrected for well-formed): This stylesheet: one two Output: EDIT 2 : Now, what is wrong within your stylesheet fragment? Well, it looks like you don't know how the processor resolves template rules applying, also XPath navegation. First, this object[item/@value = '1'] will match only this kind of input Second, consider this three rules 1 - 2 - 3 - With your last provided input, first object element (in document order) will match rules 1 and 2, and then the processor would resolve to apply rule 2. Why? From http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt#conflict Next, all matching template rules that have lower priority than the matching template rule or rules with the highest priority are eliminated from consideration. The priority of a template rule is specified by the priority attribute on the template rule. The value of this must be a real number (positive or negative), matching the production Number with an optional leading minus sign (-). The default priority is computed as follows: If the pattern contains multiple alternatives separated by |, then it is treated equivalently to a set of template rules, one for each alternative. If the pattern has the form of a QName preceded by a ChildOrAttributeAxisSpecifier or has the form processing-instruction(Literal) preceded by a ChildOrAttributeAxisSpecifier, then the priority is 0. If the pattern has the form NCName:* preceded by a ChildOrAttributeAxisSpecifier, then the priority is -0.25. Otherwise, if the pattern consists of just a NodeTest preceded by a ChildOrAttributeAxisSpecifier, then the priority is -0.5. Otherwise, the priority is 0.5.
