You should have everything you need in your ruby/bin directory. On my (WinXP, Ruby 1.8.6) system, I have ruby/bin/erb.bat erb.bat [switches] [inputfile] -x print ruby script -n print ruby script with line number -v enable verbose mode -d set $DEBUG to true -r [library] load a library -K [kcode] specify KANJI code-set -S [safe_level] set $SAFE (0..4) -T [trim_mode] specify trim_mode (0..2, -) -P ignore lines which start with "%" so erb your_erb_file.erb should write the result to STDOUT. (EDIT: windows has erb.bat and just plain "erb". The .bat file is just a wrapper for erb, which I guess should make the same command work pretty much the same on any OS) See the prag prog book discussion (starts about half-way down the page). Note also that Jack Herrington wrote a whole book about code generation that uses Ruby/ERB.
