The $_SESSION superglobal is actually a pretty good feature in PHP. Depending on what your software solution is going to end up to be, third-party users would be more accustomed to writing to and reading from this superglobal with your custom session handlers doing the magic in the background. There's also good security enhancements available through Suhosin which you need not "worry about" when developing a session storage for yourself.
