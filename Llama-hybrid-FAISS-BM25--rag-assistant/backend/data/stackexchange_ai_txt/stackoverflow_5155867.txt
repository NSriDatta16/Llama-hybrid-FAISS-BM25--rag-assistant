ASP.Net - How do I programatically edit external config files at runtime

By external config files, I mean .config files other than web.config. I've seen all the examples on how to edit web.config at runtime, but I want to edit a config file referenced by a configSource for appSettings. I want to modify only the external file and I will handle the app recycle. Ideally I would like to use a built-in class to deal with the edits, but if the only option is a manual File open/parse, etc, then sobeit. The general idea behind all this being a Settings page that is viewed at app startup, user sets their particulars and then saves the changes, then the real app starts up. quick and easy install app/configure page, so I'd like to leverage .config if at all possible. Thanks!
