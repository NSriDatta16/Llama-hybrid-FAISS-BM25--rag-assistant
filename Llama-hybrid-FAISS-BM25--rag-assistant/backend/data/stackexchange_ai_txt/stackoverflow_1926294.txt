If you're concerned with 20 minor forms taking much space (hint, they don't, most servers compress their output, so the extra forms are pretty much compressed away), just use simple links. For hiding just use if tests and you should check the identity of the user to do this. The overhead of this single if statement (even if ran 20 times) is pretty much zero. "Premature optimization is the root of all evil" - learn this, live this. The "elegant" way to do this would be (pseudocode): foreach($answers as $answer) { // Print answer here if($current_user == $question_asker) { echo "button form here"; } echo "comment form here"; }
