A low pass filter (LPF) blocks fast changing signals and allows only slow changes in the signals. This means any small sudden changes will be ignored. The standard way to implement this in software is to take a running average of the last N samples and report that value. Start with N as small as 3 and keep increasing N until you find sufficient smoothed out response in your app. Do keep in mind that the higher you make N, slower the response of the system.
