Combining metrics for score card

We are building a score card system to measure the performance of various groups in the organization. The scores are generated by true / false metrics on individual transactions that each group completes. Transactions are qualified for measurement by some metrics but not others. The number of transactions also varies between groups. Here is a sample of what the data looks like: Group Transaction Metric1Score Metric1Qualified Metric2Score Metric2Qualified ... G1 Tran1 1 1 0 1 G1 Tran2 1 1 1 1 G2 Tran3 0 0 0 1 ... We'd like to combine all of these transaction metrics into one score per group and be able to compare scores between groups. Does anyone know how to get started on this or have any places to refer to?
