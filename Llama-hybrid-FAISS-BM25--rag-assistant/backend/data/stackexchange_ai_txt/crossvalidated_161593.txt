Your data are positively skewed, meaning skewed to the right . "Right" or "left" is a matter of the longer, more stretched out, tail in the distribution. The terminology presupposes that you are (imagining) looking at a conventional histogram with a horizontal magnitude scale. But clearly you have integer values between 3 and 21, hence the appearance of an irregular staircase, except that there are values such as 4.5. You have a prominent spike of values at 3: that should not come as a surprise to you, but we can't tell you why. Similarly, if these are counts, then the absence of 0, 1 and 2 may (or may not) be worth comment. It's possible, however, that numeric measures of skewness may be negative as a side-effect of the spike. The values are reminiscent of grades on a test in which most students did poorly, but few were utterly abysmal, and some messy answers provoked compromise marks. Values in the data that are the same must be plotted at the same horizontal level at various levels on the $y$ axis. The average over samples of the same size from a true Gaussian distribution would all be distinct, so the values on the $x$ axis must be distinct. The spike alone means that you can't call this distribution "normal". If you thought this distribution would be normal, you need to review your thinking.
