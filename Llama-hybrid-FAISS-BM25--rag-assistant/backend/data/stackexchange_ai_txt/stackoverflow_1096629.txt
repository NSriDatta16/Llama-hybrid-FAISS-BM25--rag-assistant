Jquery - How to run a function onclick only if link is not dragged?

I am running thickbox and jquery ui draggable both on the same page, and they are conflicting. Jquery UI Draggable allows me to drag and drop things from one place to another with this code: $(".droppable").droppable({ drop: function(ev, ui) { do stuff } }); Thickbox starts on a click event, with essentially this code: $(".thickbox").click(function(){ thickbox functions... }); But because the thickbox link is inside the draggable div, it opens the thickbox when I drag the link!! Hence, the problem. How can I change this code so that: When I drag the link, it doesn't open thickbox. When I click the link(without dragging), it opens thickbox. Thanks!
