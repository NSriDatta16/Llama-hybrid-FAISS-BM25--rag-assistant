Should PERMANOVA be used to select factors for Canonical Correspondence Analysis?

I am interested in investigating the relationship between species composition and several environmental factors. My question is whether it is appropriate to use PERMANOVA to select a 'best' combination of explanatory variables to use in subsequent CCA analyses. I ask because a recent diet analysis paper Kemper 2017: Dietary variability in two common Alaskan skates used this approach. PERMAVOVA was used to test individual explanatory variables. The significant explanatory variables were subsequently used in a CCA to visualize the results. Something like: library(vegan) data(varespec) data(varechem) perm.1 = adonis(varespec ~ N + P + Al + S + Mn, data = varechem, permutations = 1000 ); perm.1 # N, P, and Al are significant # I now visualize the relationship of individual species along synthetic gradients composed of the three significant variables found in PERMANOVA cca.1 = cca(varespec ~ N + P +Al, data = varechem); cca.1 anova(cca.1, by = 'term') anova(cca.1, by = 'margin') plot(cca.1, display = c('sp','cn')) The paper claimed that "CCA results generally were consistent with those of PERMANOVA". This seems a bit circular, but I am wanting to know if this approach is an acceptable means of choosing several explanatory variables from a greater pool of possible variables. Perhaps a related followup question: "Is CCA an appropriate means to visualize the relationships described by PERMANOVA?"
