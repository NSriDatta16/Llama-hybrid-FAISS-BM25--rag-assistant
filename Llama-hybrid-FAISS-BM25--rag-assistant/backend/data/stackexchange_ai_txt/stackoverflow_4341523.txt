When assigning in C++, does the object we assigned over get destructed?

Does the following code fragment leak? If not, where do the two objects which are constructed in foobar() get destructed? class B { int* mpI; public: B() { mpI = new int; } ~B() { delete mpI; } }; void foobar() { B b; b = B(); // causes construction b = B(); // causes construction }
