iphone sdk: pausing NSURLConnection?

In my app I give the user the ability to download files from a server. For that I use NSURLConnection. I would like to give the user the ability to pause and resume the download by tapping a button. I couldn't find any way to do this besides calling the cancel method and then creating a new NSURLConnection. So is there an elegant way to pause NSURLConnection? Thanks
