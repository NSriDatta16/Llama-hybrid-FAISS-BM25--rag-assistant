Flex Databound List with ItemRender - Reorder resets CheckBox Values

I have a Flex List which is databound to a Array. My problem is that when I reorder the List using the built in dragMoveEnabled, the values are reset to the original values. I assume I need to somehow do a two-way databinding but I am not sure how. [Bindable] public var listArray : ArrayCollection = new ArrayCollection ();
