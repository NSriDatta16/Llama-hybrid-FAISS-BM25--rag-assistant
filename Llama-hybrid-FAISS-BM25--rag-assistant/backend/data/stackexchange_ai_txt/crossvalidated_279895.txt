Filtering disturbances from time series

Lets suppose that time series of the following building climate related measures are given for a small building: Solar radiation Outdoor air temperature Heat supply Indoor air temperature The measurements are collected during an occupied period, which means that the occupants possibly have opened and closed the windows, adjusted the set point temperature for the heat supply, closed the external solar shading etc. All actions or disturbances which has affected the measured indoor temperature. These interaction with the building is in this case treated as disturbances of the, otherwise, free running building. Which statistical methods could possible be used to filter out such disturbances, so the time series of the free running building can be estimated?
