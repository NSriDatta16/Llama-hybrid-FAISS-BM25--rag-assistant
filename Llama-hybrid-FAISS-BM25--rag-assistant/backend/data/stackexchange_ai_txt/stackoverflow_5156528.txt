Try to not use GUID as the entity primary key. It does not scale well (GUID is a non-sortable type) that can lead to high index fragmentation on your database. Failing that, see Issue With Fluent Nhibernate Automapping and Guids / UniqueIdentifiers as Primary Key Fields - this notes that the 1.0 version of FluentNH has a bug handling GUIDs as IDs, and suggests to use the SVN Trunk.
