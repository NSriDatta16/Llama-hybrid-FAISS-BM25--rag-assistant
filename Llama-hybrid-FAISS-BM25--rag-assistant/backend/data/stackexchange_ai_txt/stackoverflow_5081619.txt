Checking for XML declaration in VB6

Firstly apologies...I haven't used VB6 (or any strain of VB for that matter) for a very long time. I had the following code nodRoot.appendChild TempTableData.childNodes(0) That gives the error "This operation can not be performed with a Node of type XMLDECL." So I loop through the Child nodes as follows to not append the node if it is the XML declaration. Dim nod As IXMLDOMNode For Each nod In TempTableData.childNodes() If Not nod.baseName = "xml" Then nodRoot.appendChild nod End If Next nod Which works ok but seems an inelegant way of checking for an XML Node declaration. So what I'd like to achieve is to check against node type = XMLDECL but I can't find a way of doing this. Cheers.
