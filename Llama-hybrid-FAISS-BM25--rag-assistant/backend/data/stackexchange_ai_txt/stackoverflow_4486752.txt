From iTunes connect Developer guide 6.3 If you do not see the Manage In App Purchases module on your iTunes Connect Home page, it could be one of these reasons: You are not an Admin or Technical user for your iTunes Connect account. You do not have the latest Paid Applications contract in effect. Your Team Agent has not clicked through the latest iOS Developer Program License Agreement. If you have fulfilled all of these requirements yet still do not see the module, you can contact iTunes Connect Support for more details by using the Contact Us module on the Home page.
