The neural network is nonlinear if, and only if, you include a nonlinear activation function somewhere in the network. If you don’t, you wind up with multiples of parameters and biases that technically are nonlinear combinations of one another, but it can be sorted out to give a linear function. Verifying this might be a worthwhile exercise. Perhaps try to do so with a small network like I give here , and take the activation function $A$ to be the identity function. (If, from my equation, you can draw out the network architecture, that’s a good sign!)
