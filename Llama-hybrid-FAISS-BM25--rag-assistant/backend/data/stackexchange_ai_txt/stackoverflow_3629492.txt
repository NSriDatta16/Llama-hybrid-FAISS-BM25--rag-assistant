Hit Counter counting multiple times in one request (PHP)

I am trying to create a simple Hit Counter using Kohana3 and PHP. But when I load a page with it, it counts as 1-3 times (normally, the first hit 3, then 2, then 1). The code I'm using: $game = ORM::factory('game') ->find_by_slug($slug); if(!$game->loaded()) { $this->request->redirect('/',404); } $game->times_played++; $game->save(); An example page: http://www.plugb.com/game/qrossfire EDIT: Number of times played is below description. How can I solve this? Thank you. EDIT: I've found some requests like this: /game/qrossfire Agent: facebookexternalhit/1.1 (+http://www.facebook.com/externalhit_uatext.php) /game/stickmen-swat Agent: facebookexternalhit/1.1 (+http://www.facebook.com/externalhit_uatext.php) /game/qrossfire Agent: MetaURI API +metauri.com
