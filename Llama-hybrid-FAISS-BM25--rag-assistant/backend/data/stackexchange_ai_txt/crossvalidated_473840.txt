why is calibration not needed for a logistic regression with only categorical features?

Frank Harrell states in one of the answers, "...Note that if the model contains only categorical variables and interactions among the variables are not needed, the model must fit the data and no calibration assessment is needed" Can someone explain the rationale behind this?
