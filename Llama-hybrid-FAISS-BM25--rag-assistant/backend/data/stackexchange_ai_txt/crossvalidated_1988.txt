You can do it all on Excel. Plotting the six time series should give you a hint of the shapes of the curves. Let's say that, as you mentioned, five of the curves look like they're exponential and the sixth looks like it grows sub-linearly. Insert a trendline for each curve. If you are right, five of them will provide the best fit (as measured by r squared) with an exponential trendline, while the sixth will be best fitted to a logarithmic trendline. This may sound non-deterministic, but if all six values of r squared are close to 1 you can be pretty confident of your result.
