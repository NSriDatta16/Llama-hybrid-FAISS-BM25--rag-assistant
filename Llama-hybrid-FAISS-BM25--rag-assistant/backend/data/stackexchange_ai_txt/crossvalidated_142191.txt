time series based classification

I want to classify some data. Basically the data is time series in nature. The target variable is categorical. I know there are so many algorithms for predicting the time series model. However, I have very little information on classifying the time series model. Can anyone tell me how to classify the time series model based on categorical data ? What kind of approach will solve the problem ? I have used HMM for classification of part of speech tagging, entities. But it is not time dependent. I found that there are good algorithms available using kNN and Dynamic Time Warping. Is this the conventional model used for time-series classification ? Any other model available ? Your thoughts much appreciated.
