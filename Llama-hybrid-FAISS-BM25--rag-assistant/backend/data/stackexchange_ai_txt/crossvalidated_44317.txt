The way I would approach this would be to start with that histogram, and with an "average" renewal rate. This should be enough to give you the expected number of renewals that would occur on a particular day (by looking at how many would be expected from the 60 days in the histogram window) at an average renewal rate and average seasonality. Next, I would accommodate daily seasonality, because you seem to indicate renewals are more likely to occur on some days of the week than others. At the end of this would will have a baseline and can then look for patterns in the actual due to gradual declines/increases in the renewal rate, whether promotions increase the renewal rate overall or just accelerate the timing, and so forth. That will give you an idea of how you need to model promotion effects (and introduction of competitive products).
