wanting a good memory + disk caching solution

I'm currently storing generated HTML pages in a memcached in-memory cache. This works great, however I am wanting to increase the storage capacity of the cache beyond available memory. What I would really like is: memcached semantics (i.e. not reliable, just a cache) memcached api preferred (but not required) large in-memory first level cache (MRU) huge on-disk second level cache (main) evicted from on-disk cache at maximum storage using LRU or LFU proven implementation In searching for a solution I've found the following solutions but they all miss my marks in some way. Does anyone know of either: other options that I haven't considered a way to make memcachedb do evictions Already considered are: memcachedb best fit but doesn't do evictions: explicitly "not a cache" can't see any way to do evictions (either manual or automatic) tugela cache abandoned, no support don't want to recommend it to customers nmdb doesn't use memcache api new and unproven don't want to recommend it to customers
