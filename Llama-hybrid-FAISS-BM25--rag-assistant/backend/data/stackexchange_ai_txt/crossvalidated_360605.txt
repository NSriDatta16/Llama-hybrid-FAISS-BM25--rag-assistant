Can total least squares be used to account for uncertainty due to measurement timing?

Suppose we have a dataset in which we wish to perform regression analysis, and where the response/dependent variable is a measurement at time T . But due to pragmatic sampling we do not have measurements at precisely T for all observations. Let's say observations occur at T + δ 1 , T + δ 2 , ..., T + δ n (and such that δ i = 0 is a possibility). For example, suppose we want to model the drug levels measured in patient blood samples at six weeks (42 days) after starting treatment with a drug. But in practice patient follow-ups occur at a range of dates: 37 days, 41 days, 42 days, 39 days, 52 days, ... etc. Would Total Least Squares regression be an appropriate way to account for the uncertainty in the dependent variable? If so, how would one go about specifying an appropriate weighting scheme based on the δ values? If not, what would be a better approach? In case it makes a difference: we are particularly interested in testing for a relationship with some particular independent variable (e.g. dose), but will also need to account for covariates (e.g. BMI). Also, for some subjects we have multiple observations of the dependent variable over time, so could in theory derive a range for how quickly the dependent variable can change in general (e.g. we can get an average daily change in drug level over some time periods for some patients).
