The upscaling factor simply denotes how much the original will be upscaled. In the case of SRGAN, which uses 4x upscaling, this simply means that the output image will be four times as large as the input image. An input image of size 720 by 1080 pixels will be of size 2880 by 4320 pixels after being upscaled using SRGAN.
