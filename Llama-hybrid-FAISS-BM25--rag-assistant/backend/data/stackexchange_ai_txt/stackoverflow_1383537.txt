UPDATE: Then have 2 appcasts. One for the regular users. Another one for the testers. SECOND REPLY: Ok, so you already have testers and it's a cocoa program. Then you can use Sparkle to distribute updates of your app. FIRST REPLY: Send out a press release via prmac . Requesting beta testers, free licenses to anyone that contributes. This will give you some PR as well (which is difficult to get). Or ask on #macdev or #macsb on the freenode IRC server. However people may easily get offended if you mention its a product and its not free. I have tried seeking testers this way for my own program but it was a total failure. However even though you choose your words wisely, you may only get a few people to take a peek at your product that way. Or just ask this question on the macsb mailing list.
