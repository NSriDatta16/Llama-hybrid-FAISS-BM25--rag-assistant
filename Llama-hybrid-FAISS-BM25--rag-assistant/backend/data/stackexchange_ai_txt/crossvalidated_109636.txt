non-EM algorithm approach to mixture model?

I have a mixture model and the components are further parameterized by ~200 variables. Originally I use EM-algorithm to get a MLE estimation of the parameters. The algorithm works quite well and converges quickly. However, when I scale up the problem to ~400 variables, the problem become ill-conditioned. After some regularization, I have already overcome the numerical difficulty and I could get a meaningful answer, but the computation time of EM algorithm is too long for practical use. I am currently thinking whether I should switch to gradient-based method. But the gradient of the log-likelihood is very complicated (and may be numerical unstable too) if I do not employ EM-algorithm. May I have some advice on what I algorithm or method I should look for? P.S. I don't want to use MCMC / Fully Bayesian approach to the problem as I want a MLE estimation.
