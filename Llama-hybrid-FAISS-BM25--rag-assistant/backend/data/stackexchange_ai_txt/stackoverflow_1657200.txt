Smooth out lag spikes by filtering. Or to put this another way, instead of always comparing their new position to the previous position, compare it to the position of several updates ago. That way any short-term jitter is averaged out. In your example the server could look at the position before the lag spike and see that overall the player is moving at a reasonable speed. For each player, you could simply hold the last X positions, or you might hold a lot of recent positions plus some older positions (eg 2, 3, 5, 10 seconds ago). Generally you'd be performing interpolation/extrapolation on the server anyway within the normal movement speed bounds to hide the jitter from other players - all you're doing is extending this to your cheat checking mechanism as well. All legitimate speed-ups are going to come after an apparent slow-down, and interpolation helps cover that sort of error up.
