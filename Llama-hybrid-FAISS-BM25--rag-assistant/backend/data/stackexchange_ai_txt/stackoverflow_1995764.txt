It's possible the Outlook client agent is not set up properly to listen for these events. Can you send mail to it via another method? You need to isolate whether it is the listener or the sender that is having problems. If you can receive mail in Outlook, but just not from your code, then it's your code at fault. Please include more contextual code in your question -- e.g. how is the $smtp object being constructed? Are you making a $smtp->dataend(); call as per the documentation ? Edit (after you included some code): there is a typo in that code; are you using use strict; use warnings; at the top of your script or module? Can you receive mail to your client from other means? Edit2: if notification is all you're lacking, you should probably dive into the Outlook documentation to see what the criteria are for receiving such notification. e.g. you might need to provide a valid "Date:" header.
