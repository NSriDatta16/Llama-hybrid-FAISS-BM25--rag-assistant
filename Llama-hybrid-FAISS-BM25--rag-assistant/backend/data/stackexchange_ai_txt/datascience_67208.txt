Video segmentation vs image segmentation

I am new to data science & working on a segmentation model, Basically I need to deploy this segmentation model in android devices using TensorFlow-Lite for real time camera frame segmentation. I used unet model to do that but could not get the accuracy I wanted. After exploring so much I found something about video segmentation but I am bit confuse How video segmentation is different from normal image segmentation? Can somebody explain the differences between these two?
