Not with the standard Windows combo boxes (Here are the available styles for combo boxes ). As @ILMV said, Windows will drop the box up instead of down if there is not enough space below the box. You can test this with notepad - go to format -> font, and drag the box down so that the Script combo box is just above the start menu. Click the combo box - it drops up. If you want it to always drop up, you'll have to make your own.
