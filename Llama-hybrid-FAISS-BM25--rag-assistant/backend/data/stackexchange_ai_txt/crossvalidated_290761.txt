You can exponentiate them to give you odds ratios. If you form the confidence interval on the logit scale you can then exponentiate its limits to get the limits of the CI for the odds ratio. If odds ratio is not a familiar term you might want to look for material on logistic regression on this site. You do not do exactly the same as you do for the intercept where you also convert further from odds to proportion (as you say in your question but I thought it worth confirming it).
