If you make the animation as a function of time, you can be independent of the frame rate somewhat, meaning that if you make your animation for 24fps, you can easily adjust the animation to fit a 30 fps scenario if it's dynamic (as in defined by a function / opposed to frame by frame drawings where planning is everything ) This is short story, for the full explanation have a look at Robert Penner's good ol' chapter on Motion, Tweening and Easing .
