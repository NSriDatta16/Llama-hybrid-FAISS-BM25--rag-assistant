When you are dealing with continuous random variables, one way that you can tell the difference between probability and probability density is that the former applies to events involving random variables, whereas the latter applies to individual values of continuous random variables. Another way to tell is that we usually denote probabilties using an upper-case symbol like $\mathbb{P}$ , $\text{P}$ , $\text{Pr}$ or $P$ , whereas we usually denote densities using a lower-case symbol like $f$ or $p$ . Now, if you look at your $P$ statement, you will see firstly that it is an upper-case symbol. But more importantly, you will notice that the variable of interest is stipulated to fall within a particular range, rather than being at an individual value. This gives you the event $\{ 0 \leqslant b \leqslant 1 \}$ so you are looking at the conditional probability of that event. This conditional probability can be computed from the underlying densities as: $$\begin{aligned} \mathbb{P}(0 \leqslant b \leqslant 1 | 0 \leqslant a \leqslant 1, m=0) &= \frac{\mathbb{P}(0 \leqslant b \leqslant 1, 0 \leqslant a \leqslant 1| m=0)}{\mathbb{P}(0 \leqslant a \leqslant 1| m=0)} \\[6pt] &= \frac{\int_0^1 \int_0^1 p(a, b|m=0) \ da \ db}{\int_0^1 p(a|m=0) \ da}. \\[6pt] \end{aligned}$$ Since this is a probability, its value must be between zero and one. (And yes, a probability density value can exceed one.) Also, note that the distinction between probability and probability density is not specific to Bayesian statistics --- it occurs within probability theory, and arises in all statistical methodologies.
