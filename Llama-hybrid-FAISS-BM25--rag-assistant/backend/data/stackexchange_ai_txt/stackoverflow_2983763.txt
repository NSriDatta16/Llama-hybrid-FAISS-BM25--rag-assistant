Another way of computing (in R ) all the pairwise dissimilarities (distances) between observations in the data set. The original variables may be of mixed types. The handling of nominal, ordinal, and (a)symmetric binary data is achieved by using the general dissimilarity coefficient of Gower (Gower, J. C. (1971) A general coefficient of similarity and some of its properties, Biometrics 27, 857â€“874). For more check out this on page 47 . If x contains any columns of these data-types, Gower's coefficient will be used as the metric. For example x1 you'll get : Dissimilarities : 1 2 3 4 2 2.000000 3 3.316625 2.236068 4 2.236068 1.732051 1.414214 5 4.242641 3.741657 1.732051 2.645751 If you are interested on a method for dimensionality reduction for categorical data (also a way to arrange variables into homogeneous clusters) check this
