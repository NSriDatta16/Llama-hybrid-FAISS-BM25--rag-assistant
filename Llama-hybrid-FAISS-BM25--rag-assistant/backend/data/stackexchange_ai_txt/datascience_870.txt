This is not a problem about neural networks per se, but about representing textual data in machine learning. You can represent the movies, cast, and theme as categorical variables. The plot is more complicated; you'd probably want a topic model for that, but I'd leave that out until you get the hang of things. It does precisely that textual "downsampling" you mentioned. Take a look at this tutorial to learn how to encode categorical variables for neural networks. And good luck!
