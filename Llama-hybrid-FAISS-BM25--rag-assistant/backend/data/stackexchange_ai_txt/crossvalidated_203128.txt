This outcome would be expected. Adding inputs to a neural network that don't help predict the output should give the network a hard time. Think of it as drowning out the inputs that actually do help with the classification task. One of the reasons max pooling helps convolutional neural networks is because it gets rid of information that it thinks is less useful and concentrates more on important things. Another reason is because noisy data is much more prone to overfitting. Adding useless inputs is the exact same thing as just having noisier data.
