Load your request with - (void)loadHTMLString:(NSString *)string baseURL:(NSURL *)baseURL The important part is the base URL: It tells the webview where your docroot is. Relative to the baseURL you can link your files within the html. Assuming that your jQuery and CSS files are in your bundle as well. Put a real folder(drag a folder to your projects folder tree and select "Create Folder Reference for any added folders" it will turn blue) in your project root like htdocs. Put your html stuff in it and set the baseURL to that htdocs folder then.
