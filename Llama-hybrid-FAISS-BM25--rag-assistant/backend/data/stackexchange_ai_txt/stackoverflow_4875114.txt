Android - Save image from URL onto SD card

I want to save an image from a URL to the SD card (for future use) and then load that image from the SD card to use it as a drawable overlay for Google maps. Here is the save section of the function: //SAVE TO FILE String filepath = Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory().getAbsolutePath(); String extraPath = "/Map-"+RowNumber+"-"+ColNumber+".png"; filepath += extraPath; FileOutputStream fos = null; fos = new FileOutputStream(filepath); bmImg.compress(CompressFormat.PNG, 75, fos); //LOAD IMAGE FROM FILE Drawable d = Drawable.createFromPath(filepath); return d; The image is saved to the sd card succuessfully but fails when getting to the createFromPath() line. I don't understand why it would save ok to that destination but not load from it....
