Why can't I @synthesize accessors in a category?

Obj-C 2.0 lets me declare properties in a category, but the compiler refuses to synthesize accessors inside the category. Why? (Sometimes it makes organization sense to put a bunch of related stuff in a category - even if the backing iVars go in the class declaration. I know about class extensions and how to do private properties, but that isn't my use case.)
