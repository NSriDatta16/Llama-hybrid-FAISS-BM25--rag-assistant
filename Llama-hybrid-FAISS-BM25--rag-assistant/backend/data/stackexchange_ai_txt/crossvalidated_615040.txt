Parametric models for mixed discrete/continuous data

I'm curious if there are any common parametric distribution models for mixed discrete/continuous data. For illustration, suppose I have two random vectors, $X_c,X_d$ , where $X_c$ is continuous and $X_d$ is discrete. I have data consisting of samples of $(X_c,X_d)$ , and I'd like to do some density estimation. Ultimately the distribution of $X_c\vert X_d$ is what I would like, but I need to be able to vary $X_d$ . I have a fair amount of data but it may be sparse in some areas, so it seems like a parametric model is a good place to start. But are there any standard parametric models for joint continuous/discrete data? I could obviously go down the generative NN rabbit hole (GANs or VAEs w/ discrete-to-continuous encoding, for instance), but I'm curious about classical approaches as well.
