This is not a plugin solution but it might help you nonetheless. If you use { or } in normal mode in Vim it goes up or down one paragraph, i.e. it jumps to the next empty line. So basically if you open a file with a big license text, most of the time it is considered as a single paragraph, so just typing } once should be enough to move to the interesting part of the code. If you think } is too cumbersome to type, do not hesitate to remap it to a shortcut you are comfortable with. It might not be the best solution for this specific case but it is handy command to scroll quickly in files.
