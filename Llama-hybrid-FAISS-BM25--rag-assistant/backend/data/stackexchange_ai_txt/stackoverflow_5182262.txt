Using a date field in a ts?

I wonder how I can make use of an already existing date field when creating a ts in R. Sometimes you simply have a date before you have a ts object, e.g. x Now, is there a way to use the datefield of the df to as an index when creating a ts object? Because: ts(df$test,start=c(2008,1,2),frequency=12) (obviuously) completely ignores the date information I already have. Making use of ts methods like acf is the reason why IÂ´d like to make it a ts object. I typcically use monthly an quarterly time series...
