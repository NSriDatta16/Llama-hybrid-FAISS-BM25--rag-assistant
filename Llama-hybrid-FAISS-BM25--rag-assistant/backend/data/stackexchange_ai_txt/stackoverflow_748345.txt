I think a good understanding of how a compiler works is good to know. Aho has the classic book on concepts used in creating a compiler. The title is Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools. Its nickname is the Dragon Book. In order to really understand that book, you should have an understanding of formal languages. Hopcroft has a good book on that - Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation.
