Interpret GLM log link coefficients

I am currently doing a college assignment in which I have a GLM model in the gaussian family with a log link. I would like to know what the impact per variable is. I know how to calculate the predicted values per observation, but I would like to make claims like "with every unit increase in x, y increases by 3%". The output of my model is pasted below. Call: glm(formula = `Autodate %` ~ `Population density` + `Parking rate` + `Waiting time` + `Green party %` +`Dutch %` + `West %` + `Average income`, family = gaussian(link = "log"), start = c(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -0.46555 -0.06470 -0.00322 0.09149 0.48983 Coefficients: Estimate Std.
