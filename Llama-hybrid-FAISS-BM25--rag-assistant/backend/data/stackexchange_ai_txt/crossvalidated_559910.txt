Averages of the two closest pairs out of a set of four observations

Four random numbers are drawn at random from a standard normal distribution. They are grouped in two pairs of closest numbers, $\{x_1, x_2\}$ and $\{x_3, x_4\}$ so that $x_1\le x_2 \le x_3 \le x_4$ , and the average of each pair is computed. What are the expected averages of each pair? I found papers dealing with the averages of 2 out 3 observations (e.g., here ), but I wasn't able to find anything for this specific problem.
