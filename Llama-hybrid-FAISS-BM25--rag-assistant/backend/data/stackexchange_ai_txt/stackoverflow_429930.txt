Request.Form will still work, except that your checkboxes all have the same name. So one way would be to give the checkboxes distinct names, e.g. "AddApps-app.id", and use Request.Form. However, a more elegant and testable way is to use list binding. In this model, you give your form elements a certain structured name, and the default model binder will wrap each set of form elements into a list of typed records in the controller. This is fully explained in this blog post . The advantage here is that your controller deals only with instances of the application type, and hence has no implicit dependency on the way the view is structured. Therefore, it is very easy to unit test.
