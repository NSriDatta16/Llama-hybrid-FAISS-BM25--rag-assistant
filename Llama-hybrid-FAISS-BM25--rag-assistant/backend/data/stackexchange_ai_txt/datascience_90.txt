The terms "parallel computing" and "distributed computing" certainly have a large overlap, but can be differentiated further. Actually, you already did this in your question, by later asking about "parallel processing" and "distributed processing". One could consider "distributed computing" as the more general term that involves "distributed processing" as well as, for example, "distributed storage". The common term, "distributed", usually refers to some sort of Message Passing over a network, between machines that are physically separated. The term "parallel computing" is also in the process of being further defined, e.g. by explicitly differentiating between the terms "parallel" and "concurrent", where - roughly - the first one refers data parallelism and the latter to task parallelism , although there are hardly really strict and binding defintions. So one could say that "distributed processing" usually (although not necessarily) means that it also is "parallel processing" "distributed computing" is more general, and also covers aspects that are not related to parallelism and obviously, "parallel computing"/"parallel processing" does not imply that it is "distributed"
