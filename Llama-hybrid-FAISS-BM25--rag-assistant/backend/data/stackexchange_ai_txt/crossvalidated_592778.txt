What does the notation, that is commonly used in diffusion models mean $\mathcal{N}(x_{t};\mu_{\theta},\Sigma_{\theta})$?

Commonly used in diffusion models ( https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11239.pdf ), what does the notation, $\mathcal{N}(x_{t};\mu_{\theta},\Sigma_{\theta})$ mean? I get the parameterized by $\mu$ and $\sigma$ part, but I'm unclear exactly on the $x_t$ part.
