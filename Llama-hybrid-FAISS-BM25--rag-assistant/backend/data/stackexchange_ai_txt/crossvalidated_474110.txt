Mixed Effects Model: Writing out and interpreting coefficients on Level 1, 2, and 3 Models

Question: Have I written formulas that convey the correct mathematical representation for my three-level model? Is my written interpretation of the coefficients in the equations correct? I have a three-level model representing experimental time series data. I am testing if participants' ratings on three variables (A, B, and C) predict their time series values. Values are nested within stimulus number, which is nested within the participant. [time point] ( t ): each time series trial consists of 120 data points; i.e., there are 120 data points per stimulus_num stimulus_num ( k ): each experimental session consisted of 36 trials; i.e., there are 36 stimuli per participant ID ( i ): each unique participant; 77 participants total A, B, and C: three ratings made by the participant before s/he completed each trial value: the time series value provided by participant i at time point t for stimulus k To clarify, each participant completed 36 trials. In each of the 36 trials, there are 120 data points ( value ) collected. Therefore, each participant should have 4,320 data points. Here is the model: lmer(value ~ A + B + C + (1|ID/stimulus_num), data = data) For the equations at each level, I have: Level 1: $$ Y _{ikt} = \beta _{0ik} + \beta _{1ik} A_{ikt} + \beta _{2ik} B_{ikt} + \beta _{3ik} C_{ikt} + e _{ikt} $$ Level 2: $$ \beta _{0ik} = \gamma _{00i} + u _{0ik} $$ $$ \beta _{1ik} = \gamma _{10i} + u _{1ik} $$ $$ \beta _{2ik} = \gamma _{20i} + u _{2ik} $$ $$ \beta _{3ik} = \gamma _{30i} + u _{3ik} $$ Level 3: $$ \gamma _{00i} = \pi _{000} + r _{00i} $$ $$ \gamma _{10i} = \pi _{100} + r _{10i} $$ $$ \gamma _{20i} = \pi _{200} + r _{20i} $$ $$ \gamma _{30i} = \pi _{300} + r _{30i} $$ My interpretation of the terms in the model: At level 1, the outcome $Y _{ikt}$ represents person i 's time series value for stimulus k at time point t . This outcome was modeled as a function of a random intercept $\beta _{0ik}$ and the Level 1 fixed effects of A, B, and C ( $\beta _{1ik}$ , $\beta _{2ik}$ , and $\beta _{3ik}$ ). At Level 2, $\gamma _{00i}$ is the random intercept, while $\gamma _{10i}$ , $\gamma _{20i}$ , and $\gamma _{30i}$ represent the time series value for stimulus k at time point t as a function of A, B, and C respectively. The effects $u _{nik}$ represent the variation each individual stimulus has relative to the grand mean for that equation. At Level 3, $\pi _{000}$ is the random intercept, while $\pi _{100}$ , $\pi _{200}$ , and $\pi _{300}$ represent the time series value for stimulus k at time point t and for participant i as a function of A, B, and C respectively. Effects $r _{n0i}$ represent the variation each individual person has relative to the grand mean for that equation. I am not sure that I have a) written the Level 1-3 formulas correctly to reflect how I built the model, and b) explained the coefficients in the model correctly, especially for levels 2 and 3. Also, have I reflected the random intercepts on "stimulus number" and "participant" correctly?
