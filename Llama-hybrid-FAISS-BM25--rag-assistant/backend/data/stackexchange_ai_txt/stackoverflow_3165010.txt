Each UDP packet has a source port and a destination port. An SNMP manager sends out an SNMP request using any source port, and destination port 161. The agent will reply to the source port on the manager. For example: Manager Agent source port: dest port: 161 content: what is your sysUpTime source port: 161 destination port: content: sysUpTime is 42 seconds Replies arrive on random number port, not port 161. So a manager listening on port 161 is unlikely to receive many replies. Instead of listening on port 161, listen on the same socket you used to send out the request. That socket will remember the source port it chose for sending. P.S. When you use SNMP to query, SNMP's manager is UDP's client , and SNMP's agent is UDP's server .
