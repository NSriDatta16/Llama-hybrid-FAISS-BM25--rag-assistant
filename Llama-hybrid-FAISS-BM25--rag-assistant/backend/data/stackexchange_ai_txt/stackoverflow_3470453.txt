What exactly am I embedding when using WebKit in C#?

As I understand it, both Safari and Chrome use WebKit. There are many projects that allow you to embed WebKit, but want I actually want is to embed Chrome (for Windows) in a C# app so that my application renders identically to Chrome on Windows. So when I embed, say, AwesomiumDotNet , will the rendering, CSS support, Javascript engine, font-rendering etc be that of Chrome for Windows, or of the underlying WebKit engine? Presumably, WebKit doesn't handle things like font and control rendering or Chrome and Safari on Windows would look identical, and yet they don't (Safari has that fuzzy text thing going on, among other differences). So is WebKit responsible for the layout and computed styles, while the browser built on top of WebKit provides the actual rendering? Or is it more that the projects used by Apple and Google forked a while ago, and that's why they're different?
