While it's good practice to check for feature support rather then user agent, there's no simple way to check for something like support of a css property using JavaScript. I recommend you either follow the above posters suggestion of using conditional comments or use jQuery.browser. A simple implementation (not validated for performance or bugs) could look like this: if ($.browser.msie && $.browser.version.substr(0,1) In your markup, add the .jshover class to any element you want hover css effects on. In your css, add rules like this: ul li:hover, ul li.over { rules here }
