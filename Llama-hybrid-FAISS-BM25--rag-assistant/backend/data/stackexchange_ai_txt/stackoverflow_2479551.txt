View or ViewController... both are views?

In Interface Builder... when I drag a VIEW into the document window... and then double-click on it... it opens and displays the VIEW window. (As expected) ... but when I drag a VIEW CONTROLLER into the document window... and then double-click on it... it also opens and displays the VIEW window, too. (It says "view" right on it.) Is that right? (Or am I totally misunderstanding things?) I thought a VIEW was the actual object to draw/drag things into. No? I thought a VIEW CONTROLLER was just the CODE for your view. No?
