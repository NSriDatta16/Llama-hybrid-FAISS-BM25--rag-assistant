Have you had a look at the other mouse events jquery offers. You could do the dragging with a combination of mousedown and mousemove. If the mouse has moved a long way then you could cancel any click handler you have as it must have been a drag and not a single click. Have a look at: http://api.jquery.com/mousedown/ http://api.jquery.com/mousemove/ http://api.jquery.com/mouseup/
