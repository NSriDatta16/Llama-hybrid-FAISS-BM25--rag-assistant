Get Label Statistics of Image Dataset

I have a labeled image dataset, where the images are in subfolders and there is one Pascal XML per image with the labels. I would like to compute stats like: how many images have exactly two labels? Or - what is the average size of the labeling rectangle? Ideally also statistics on image resolution, file size etc, but mostly labels. This is probably an easy question (many papers include that info), but did not see that function in labelImg and Sloth. How can I do that?
