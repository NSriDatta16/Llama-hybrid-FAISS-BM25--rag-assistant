PCA eigenvectors with dimensionality reduction

I want to understand how I can compute the eigenvectors and the eigenvalues of a matrix using dimensional reduction.I have a Matrix $M$ of dimensions $n$ x $d$ using dimension reduction I can compute the eigenvectors and the eigenvalues of the Covariance matrix $MM^t$. After computing these eigenvectors and eigenvalues how can I compute the eigenvectors of the original matrix?
