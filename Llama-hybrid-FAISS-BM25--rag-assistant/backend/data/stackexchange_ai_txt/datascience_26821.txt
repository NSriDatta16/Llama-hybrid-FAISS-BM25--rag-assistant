High-level features of a neural network

I understand how to build and train a neural network like shown below, as well as those low-level features/filters. I wonder what are those high-level features : how exactly do you obtain them from a trained neural network? (Are those like the " eigenfaces "?) Note: the image is by NVIDIA, and I don't know the specifics of the classification problem here. If needed, suppose the network is trained to distinguish human from cat.
