Take a look at the Programming in Lua book, it has a section on the Lua C API . For calling Lua functions use lua_pcall , which is equivalent to lua_call (that has a short example) except it will catch Lua runtime errors. You must have already loaded and run the script once (using eg. luaL_dofile ) since the first step is for the script to define the functions for you to call. When it returns, you can access the script-defined functions with lua_getglobal .
