Hooookay, I feel like a gargantuan turd for answering every single one of my questions, but oh well. So, the answer is that the Framework I was including had no compiled source. BenT over on the Apple Dev Forums mentioned that the source needed to be compiled... so I looked into the Framework I was importing at it appears that it only copies the header files, and does not compile anything. This was done (I think, since I've gotten no reply from the dev's of that Framework) because the framework was intended to be used as part of a plug-in for the main software. Since the plug-in architecture loads all the compiled classes, having just the headers in the Framework prevented the objc[1378]: Class BLAH is implemented in both X and Y. One of the two will be used. Which one is undefined. "fun-time" errors. So, it looks like I'll have to either include the source or make a new framework from their source. Thanks to Marcus for helping me out. I was hoping this wasn't just a "RTFM" problem since I've only ben dev'ing for the Apple platform since Nov of 2009. I hadn't gotten around to learning CoreData yet... -Stephen
