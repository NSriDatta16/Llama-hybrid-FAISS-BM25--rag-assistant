How to find the covariance of a Bernoulli Mixture distribution?

I am reading the Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning book and on page 445, it states that the covariance of the Bernoulli mixture distribution is $$Cov(\mathbf{x}) = \sum^K_{k=1} \pi_k (\Sigma_k + \mathbf{\mu}_k \mathbf{\mu}^T_k) - E(\mathbf{x})E(\mathbf{x})^T$$ Can someone show me mathematically how is this derived ? I have attached the source of the context below.
