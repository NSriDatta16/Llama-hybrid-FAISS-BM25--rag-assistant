Replication problem (distribution with subscriber) in SQL SERVER 2008 R2

We have transactional replication between two MS SQL Server 2008 R2. Our servers were rebooted because of failure of a hard drive. Replication automatically continued working. But in an hour after we received such error: The subscription(s) have been marked inactive and must be reinitialized. NoSync subscriptions will need to be dropped and recreated. Log Reader agent works and sends transactions to distributor. But distributor stopped being able to synchronize with subscriber. Also Subscriber allowed to send changes to distributor. All conflicts resolved by distributor. We want to know if it is another way to make replication works except of reinitializing subscription? We discovered that this error probably was not in disk failure. We added new foreign keys: So it was: Publisher Table1 Table2 Table3 Subscriber Table1 Table2 Table3 Table1 and Table2 were in replication. Table3 - not. We added foreign key Table2_Table3 on each - Publisher and Subscriber. And after this we began to receive errors as we described in the our comment to @Remus Rusanu answer.
