In a perfect world you could hook the mutation events. I have doubts that they work reliably even on standards browsers. It sounds like you've already implemented a mutation event so you could possibly add this to use a native mutation event rather than timeout polling on browsers that support those. I've seen DOM-change implementations that monitor changes by comparing document.body.innerHTML to last saved .innerHTML , which isn't exactly elegant (but works). Since you're ultimately going to check if a specific node has been added yet, then you're better off just checking that each interrupt. Improvements I can think of are using .offsetParent rather than .parentNode as it will likely cut a few parents out of your loop (see comments). Or using compareDocumentIndex() on all but IE and testing .sourceIndex propery for IE (should be -1 if node isn't in the DOM). This might also help: X browser compareDocumentIndex implementaion by John Resig .
