If you want to know the details of how the database engine handles your queries, search the net for "Jet ShowPlan". It all gets quite complex "under the hood". And even the same query may not be executed the same way twice in a row. For example, with new updated index statistics, the query planner may identify a more efficient route to retrieve the requested data. More directly to the point of your question ... if you create a query which pulls data from two other queries, do not assume those two are executed separately before being combined or fed to the third. It could happen that way. But the optimizer will make judgments about what it considers to be the most efficient way to retrieve the data, and will re-organize the query plan as it sees fit.
