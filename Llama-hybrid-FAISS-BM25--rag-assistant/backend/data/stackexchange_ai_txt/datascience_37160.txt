The type of your problem is time series regression . The common way of dealing with such problems is using ARMA models and Kalman filters with input (control vector). Look at this links: https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~fdiebold/Teaching104/Ch14_slides.pdf https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter For time series regression using LSTM, check Multivariate LSTM Forecast Model part from this link: https://machinelearningmastery.com/multivariate-time-series-forecasting-lstms-keras
