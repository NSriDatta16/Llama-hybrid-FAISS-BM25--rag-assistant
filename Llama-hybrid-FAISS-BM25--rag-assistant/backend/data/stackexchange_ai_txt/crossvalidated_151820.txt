Analysis of Ordinal Value Time Series

I have to analyze a number of ordinal value time series with different lengths. Just to be clear: y_1 = +1, 0, 0, 0, -1, +1, 0, +1, +1, 0, 0, 0, -1, +1, 0, +1 y_2 = 0, 0, 0, +1, 0, 0, 0, -1, +1, 0, +1, -1, -1, 0 y_3 = 0, +1, -1, 0, 0, +1, -1 ... Response variables can take values $\{+1, 0, -1\}$. Times have been discretized, so that if a time series has $n$ observations, the vector of times will be $t = 1,\dots,n$. I have a bit of experience with classic time series models like AR, MA, ARIMA, but I never dealt with ordinal response variables in time series of different length. I think that this kind of analysis could be done also by means of pattern recognition techniques, but I have zero experience with that kind of stuff. However, any reference will be very appreciated. Thanks.
