I'll assume you mean for the first layer , because sharing weights across separate channels in subsequent layers would result in all your feature maps for any given layer be exactly the same thing (i.e. same as having one layer). If you share weights across the three input channels, assuming they're RGB channels, would mean that your model pays the same amount of attention to all channels . This would be equivalent of having a grayscale input , as $gray = \frac{r \, + \, b \, + \, g}{3}$ .
