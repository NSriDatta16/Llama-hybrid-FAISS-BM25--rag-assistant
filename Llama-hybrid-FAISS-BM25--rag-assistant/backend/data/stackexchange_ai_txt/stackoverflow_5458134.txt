How do I import rake tasks from a gem when using Sinatra?

I'm trying to add some basic rake tasks to the orientdb gem that will allow me to create the database, create database migrations, and migrate the database - similar to rails migrations. When I had the rake tasks locally, I got the db:settings, db:create, and db:create_migration to work, but after I put them in the gem I can't figure out how to access them from the Sinatra application when using "rake". I have a feeling I am either a) not organizing the files in the gem properly and/or b) not calling things properly from the Sinatra app. The current state of my forked repository is at https://github.com/ricaurte/orientdb-jruby I put the file for the tasks in lib/orientdb/tasks/database.rake => https://github.com/ricaurte/orientdb-jruby/blob/master/lib/orientdb/tasks/database.rake Sinatra App Rakefile APPLICATION_ROOT = File.expand_path('..', __FILE__) require 'rake' require 'orientdb' #import "orientdb/tasks/database.rake" task :environment do require File.expand_path(File.join(*%w[ config environment ]), File.dirname(__FILE__)) end config/environment require "rubygems" require "bundler" Bundler.setup require 'sinatra' require "orientdb" ruby: jruby 1.6.0 (ruby 1.9.2 patchlevel 136) (2011-03-24 5f5278c) (OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM 1.6.0_20) [linux-amd64-java]
