How to approach implementing a layout editor using Cocoa

I want to build an OS X application, in which one of the requirements is for the user to be able to generate PDF output according to a layout that they, the user, will create. Typical items on the page would be things like a corporate logo (a JPEG or PNG), an address (a block of text) and a narrative (another block of text). I'd like the user to be able to move and resize the items using the mouse to drag handles around on-screen. Is there an Interface Builder object that will let me do that, or some third-party library that exists for this purpose?
