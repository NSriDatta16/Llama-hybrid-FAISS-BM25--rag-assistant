Keras calculates the training MSE of an epoch as the average MSE over all batches in that epoch, while the test error is calculated right at the end of the epoch. This biases the training MSE numbers to be larger and the test MSE numbers to be smaller. See the Keras FAQ - Why is my training loss much higher than my testing loss?
