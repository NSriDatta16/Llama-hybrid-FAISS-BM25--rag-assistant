"Parametrized" database model & backend storage system as well as data mining manipulation

I have implicitly made this a community wiki seeing that the answers can be quite broad. I'm working with a start-up company to accomplish the following goal. In a medical research, a patient medical record can have infinite amount of data regarding a patient for a specific diagnosis, e.g. a smoker has a higher chance of catching lung cancer but that doesn't necessarily mean that a non-smoker can catch lung cancer. My goal is to create/use a database model that can deal with such parameters. Now, I also have to come up with ways to data mine these parametrized data to create statistical data e.g. see the trends on all 40 year old female who suffered from lung cancer. That report can be generic, (graph, tabular, etc.) where doctors can see trends or analyse possible solutions that can work.... My questions are: 1) Which Database systems allows for parametrized backend storage (e.g. Cassandra) that can easily be used in java, and is very efficient in data retrieval, linkage, etc. We are dealing with high amount of patient records per states. 2) What algorithms or AI techniques can I use for data mining? Is there any mining techniques out there that can help me do this? PS How does Google Analytics deal with parametrised data? PPS A parametrized data is data which has a key, and data where data can be value, another key-value pair, a list of value, a set of parametrized data (organized, unorganized) I'm looking forward for suggestive answers! :-D
