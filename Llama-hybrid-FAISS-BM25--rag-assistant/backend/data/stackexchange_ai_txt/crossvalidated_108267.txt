Catagorical variables with very uneven distributions? Removal/modify/leave?

In my current dataset I have quite a few categorical variables. Most have decent distributions between the categories. 30:40:30 splits etc. where these are percentage of dataset members per category dataset is ~2000 members But a fair few have either (I feel) useless or difficult distributions. Some have distributions like 97:2:1 - to me there are so few members in the low populated categories I would just leave this variable out. There may only be 10-20 members in the 1% category. Others have distributions where I am not sure what to do. 80:10:5:5 etc if it makes real world sense, with this option is combining the 10:5:5 portion into one group viable? Ie the new variable has 2 categories comprising 80:20 split in members. With decision trees I do not think this is too much of a problem as it will effectively do the combining itself. With other modelling methods where dummy variables are created is the combining (or even removal) of variables an encouraged method as it also helps reduce dimensionality?
