Yes, you are right in your understanding of the role of the decoder. However, your use of "query" here, while somewhat technically correct, seems a bit strange. You are referring as "query" to the partially decoded sentence. While the partially decoded sentence is actually used as query in the first multihead attention block, people normally do not refer to it as "query" when describing stuff from the conceptual level of the decoder. About needing the decoder in classification or regression tasks: the decoder is used when the output of the model is a sequence. If the output of the model is a single value, e.g. for a classification task or a single-value regression task, the encoder would suffice. If you want to predict multiple values of a time series, you should probably use a decoder that lets you condition not only on the input but also on the partially generated output values.
