Jquery add ellipse (...) and truncate text based on height not width

I have found many ways to measure width and to truncate text using jquery, but I can't find one based on height. I am limited to two lines of text or it will knock my design out of canter. So does anyone know a method of limiting a paragraph to two lines high, tuncating it and adding an elipse ?
