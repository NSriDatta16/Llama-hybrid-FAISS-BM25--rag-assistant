Hypothesis test on a series of wagers with different probabilities and returns

I have a model that predicts the probability of an event occurring, and then based on a given return if the event occurs, calculates the expected value. If the expected value is positive, a wager is placed. If the event occurs, the outcome is the return, and if it does not occur the wager is lost. I have tested the model on historical data, and the results are positive, but not so positive that I feel confident that my average outcome is statistically different from 0. How can I conduct a hypothesis test on my results from testing on the historical data? Below is the distribution of my results, with -1 being a lost wager, 0 being an event where no wager was placed due to a negative expected value, and anything greater than 0 being the return from a successful wager.
