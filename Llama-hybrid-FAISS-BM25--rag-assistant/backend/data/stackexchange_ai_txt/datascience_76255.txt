Predicting evolution of an unknown mathematical function with machine learning?

Is it possible to predict how a mathematical function evolves using ML? I am studying radioactive decay of polonium 210 and I have gathered data for its decay throughout a couple of weeks. I was wondering if I could use Machine Learning to train on the data available and predict how the Radioactive Activity would evolve after the timeframe where I gathered data. Can I predict (with ML) how the radioactive activity would evolve based on available experimental data?
