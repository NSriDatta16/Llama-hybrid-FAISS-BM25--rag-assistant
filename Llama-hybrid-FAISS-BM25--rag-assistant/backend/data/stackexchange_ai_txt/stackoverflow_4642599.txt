Small improvement on your solution. You have the table: TrackID SumOfVotes NumberOfVotes When someone votes, NumberOfVotes = NumberOfVotes + 1 SumOfVotes = SumOfVotes + ThisVote and to see the average you only then do a division: SELECT TrackID, (SumOfVotes/NumberOfVotes) AS Rating FROM `table` I would add that the original (obvious and expensive) solution is only expensive compared to the provied solution when calculating the average. It is cheaper when a vote is added, deleted or changed. I guess that the original table TrackID Vote VoterID would still need to be used in the provided solution to keep track of the vote (rating) of every voter. SO, two tables have to be updated for every change in this table (insert, delete or Vote update). In other words, the original solution may be the best way to go.
