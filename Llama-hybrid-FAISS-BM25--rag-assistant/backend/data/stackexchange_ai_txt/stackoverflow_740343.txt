So from the log we can see that MSSQLSERVER service is indeed installed (and SQLSERVERAGENT is not which is irrelevant). The installer tries to access newly installed server using shared memory protocol and fails. I wonder why this might happen. Network configuration isn't relevant here. Do you have something that prevents shared memory stuff? Could be an advanced firewall with anti-leak detection. Did you provide some fancy command line keys to not install some parts of the server or to not start the service once it's installed?
