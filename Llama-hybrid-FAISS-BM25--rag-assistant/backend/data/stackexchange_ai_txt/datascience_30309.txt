Right ML mode and metric to minimize FN and FP on imbalanced dataset

So I have a dataset in which I have to predict class binary label (1 or 0), the problem, out of 120k data points, only 200 have the label '1'. the aim is to minimize FN and FP. Which ML model should I use? Gradient boost or XGBoost or logistic regression. How do I calculate the class weights? Which accuracy metric captures the minimization of FP and FN?
