Application of bag-of-ngrams in feature engineering of texts

I've got few questions about the application of bag-of-ngrams in feature engineering of texts: How to (or can we?) perform word2vec on bag-of-ngrams? As the feature space of bag of n-gram increases exponentially with 'N', what (or are there?) are commonly used together with bag-of-ngrams to increase computational and storage efficiency? Or in general, does bag of n-gram used alongside with other feature engineering techniques when it's involved in transforming a text fields into a field of text feature?
