In C++, you can extend multiple classes, it's called multiple inheritance. Most probably this is what you're looking for. Please read a good book about multiple inheritance and C++ (a quick introduction: http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/comphelp/v8v101/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.xlcpp8a.doc%2Flanguage%2Fref%2Fcplr134.htm ), because there are many pitfalls and details to pay attention to. Example for multiple inheritance: class A { ... }; class B { ... }; class C: public A, public B {}; // C inherits from A and B.
