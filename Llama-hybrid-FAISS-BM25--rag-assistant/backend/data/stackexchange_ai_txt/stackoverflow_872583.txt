You could go either way in this case, because it's not very complicated. I prefer, as a general rule, to allow the data to be temporarily inconsistent, by having just enough redundancy, and have a periodic process resolve the inconsistencies. However, there is no harm in having a trigger mechanism to encourage early execution of the periodic process. I feel this way because relying on event-based notification-style code to keep things consistent can, in more complex cases, greatly complicate the code and make verification difficult.
