I am relatively new to mysql and was wondering the optimal structure for storing something. Define "optimal". What database structure may be "optimal" is heavily dependent on context. Optimal for what? Inserts, selects? With what selection criteria, joins, ordering, etc. this table would contain every single email belonging to every single user. This seems overly cumbersome, is there an elegant way round this? What exactly do you find cumbersome? This is about as plain as it gets. ?
