As mentioned in previous answers, you can't save a fragment of XML on its own without saving the whole file. If file size was a big issue, then you could split the data into separate files (perhaps alphabetically; depends on the data), so that you're only saving a smaller dataset if you make a change. As Matt mentioned, XML serialization does not provide the best performance on WP7 devices. Kevin Marshall has a great blog post detailing different serialization approaches and the performance of each. The fastest method is binary serialization, though there's nothing stopping you serializing the XML using the binary serialization approach.
