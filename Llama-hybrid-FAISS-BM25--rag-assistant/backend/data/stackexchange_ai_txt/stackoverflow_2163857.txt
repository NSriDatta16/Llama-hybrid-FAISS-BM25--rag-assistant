Unzipping zip archives with JavaScript in Firefox 3.6

I am toying with an application that will demo some Firefox 3.6 specific functionality, most of which are listed here: http://demos.hacks.mozilla.org/openweb/ I want to drag a zip file in the browser, unzip it, and work with the unzipped contents. Are there any existing libraries that can do this? Does FireFox 3.6 in particular have something I can use? Or would I have to roll my own unzipper library? For the record: http://github.com/augustl/js-unzip
