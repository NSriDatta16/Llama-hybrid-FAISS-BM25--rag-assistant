Understanding what a factor is in a model

I have a model which I built with a number of factors as fixed effect variables. Up to now they all had two values e.g. high tide/low tide and so when I ran the summary it would show one variance for the variable (but it had a 2 next to those coded as an as.factor). After suddenly running a fixed effect with four IDs (Tide level) I had a duh moment and realised that the value shown is the effect for the second ID and now of course the third and fourth. The issue is I wanted to interpret the results as shown in this results table: Table 3. Model-averaged parameter estimates and relative importance values for variables affecting adult piping plover foraging rates in New Jersey, 2007â€“2009. Parameter Estimate 95% CI Intercept 11.78 10.07 13.49 Habitat Intertidal 3.97 2.45 5.49 Wrack 1.37 0.46 3.20 Ephemeral pool 2.65 4.62 9.92 Tidal pond 5.52 3.84 7.20 Bay shore 2.32 0.03 4.61 Sand flat 2.30 4.34 0.26 Tidal stage Low 3.98 3.05 4.91 High 1.62 1.36 4.60 Wind speed 0.01 0.02 0.04 Note that it states that it shows the relative importance values too but I don't see them. Obviously they had run a model something like this Foraging Rate~Habitat+Tide Level+Wind Speed + (1|Site) The major issue is how do I get an effect value for the first category within a variable (i.e. 'Tide 1') (and Low tide or Intertidal in the above example) I can give you an example of my results here: > testm1 testm1 Linear mixed model fit by maximum likelihood Formula: Feeding ~ Age + Tide + mean.catch.rate + mean.for.rate + (1 | Brood) Data: ABMnoD AIC BIC logLik deviance REMLdev 350.3 366.1 -166.1 332.3 312.5 Random effects: Groups Name Variance Std.Dev.

I just cannot find any paperwork on how to do this. I appreciate of someone could spend a little time to explain this to me. Thank you. Rachel Ammendment in response to answer by jbowman: I ran all four options: With and without intercept then these with the y adjustment. The Relative Importance of each factor stayed the same in each: Regular model average with no removal of intercept Model-averaged coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 98.3228 4.5234 21.736 Without intercept: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) Tide1 96.742 3.601 26.866 With y removed but still with intercept: Estimate Std.

Not sure how to continue and which I should use. Could I calculate the Intercept and relative Estimates from these values? Thank you.
