Training a CNN in production on new data

How should I approach training a convolutional neural network in production on new data when I detect model performance degradation due to data or concept drift? Resources like this one and this one lead me to conclude that I need to fine tune the network (as opposed to using transfer learning). Is my conclusion correct? To combat catastrophic forgetting, should I be mixing old data with new data when fine tuning? If yes, any guidelines on how much of the old data I should use? Thanks.
