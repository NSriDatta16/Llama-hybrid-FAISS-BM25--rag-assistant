Auto-covariance in a stationary time series

I am trying to calculate the auto-covariance of time series $Z_t$. Given a weakly stationary process $Y_t$; $t \in \mathbb{Z}$: $$Z_t=a+Y_t$$ Now, my goal is to show that $Z_t$ is also a stationary process. I know that $\mathbb{E}[Y_t]$ should be constant, and it is, $\mathbb{E}[Y_t] = a + m$. Then, I need to prove that the auto-covariance $\newcommand{\cov}{\rm Cov} \cov(Z_t, Z_{t+h})$ depends only on $h$. I am trying to prove it by calculating the covariance as: $$\cov(Z_t, Z_{t+h}) =\mathbb{E}[Z_tZ_{t+h}] - (m+a)^2$$ but I am not getting anywhere. I am not sure what should I show. I hope I was clear. If you have any insight please let me know.
