EDIT - Based on your output above, I think you need to take a different approach. It looks like the original repository was created as /data/repository with a folder called DDL2 in the repository. This can be seen looking at the "Repository Root" value of your working copy. You won't be able to simply push the root of the repository down a level using svn switch . Instead, you'll need to use svn move to reorganize your repo around the new desired root. This means you will keep serving your repo from /data/repository , but move all the files under DDL2 to the top level. Of course, moving a bunch of files can be a pain if you have local edits. I would get all your changes committed, then do the move as a single commit. You'll need to change your svnserve args back before you can do this.
