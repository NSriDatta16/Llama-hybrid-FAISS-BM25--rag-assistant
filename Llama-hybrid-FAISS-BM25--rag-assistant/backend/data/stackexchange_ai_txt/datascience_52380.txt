It seems as if your RNN is far too complex for modeling a univariate time series: I would advise using a simpler model, using fewer LSTM layers. Now, time series forecasting always has this problem of converging to some mean value in the long term. Real time series are believed to be subjected to 'shocks' from the 'environment' that result in sudden increase or decrease. If you do not have these shocks in your data, and make no assumption about when they occur, the only sensible long-term forecast would be some constant value. Do you find this intuitive? Secondly, using an LSTM for recursive forecasting the way you do leads to an very significant accumulation of errors. For example, when predicting for time step t + 3, both the hidden states of the model and the data that you input (input in this case: your prediction for t + 2) are subjected to some error. During training, only the hidden states were subjected to error: the input were actual observations. Do you see how this could lead to this extreme forecast runaway?
