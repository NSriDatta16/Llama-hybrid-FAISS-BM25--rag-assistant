mydomainname.com not working with https

I have created a self signed SSL Certificate for testing purpose and I have configured the generated certificate at my virtual hosts file. But when I tried to access my domain with https://mydomainname.com it's not working. Mozilla gives the error page Firefox can't establish a connection to the server at mydomainname.com. I have a Windows Vista machine and my virtual hosts file is following: my vitual hosts file: #ServerName www.mydmainnamw.com:8080 #DocumentRoot "C:/.../My Company/My Sites/johnbokma.com/site/web" #CustomLog logs/lc.johnbokma.com.access.log combined #ErrorLog logs/lc.johnbokma.com.error.log SSLEngine on SSLCertificateFile C:/Program Files (x86)/ApacheSoftwareFoundation/conf/ssl.crt/server.crt SSLCertificateKeyFile C:/Program Files (x86)/ApacheSoftwareFoundation/conf/ssl.key/server.key SetEnvIf User-Agent ".*MSIE.*" nokeepalive ssl-unclean-shutdown CustomLog logs/ssl_request_log \ "%t %h %{SSL_PROTOCOL}x %{SSL_CIPHER}x \"%r\" %b"
