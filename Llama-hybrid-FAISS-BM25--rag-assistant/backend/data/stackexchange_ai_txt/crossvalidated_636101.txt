Calculating standardised regression coefficients from GLMER model

I have three separate glmer models investigating the individual and household-level risk factors of malaria infection in three different spatial locations: 1) outside the forest, 2) at the forest fringe, and 3) inside the forest. The explanatory variables are a mix of continuous, binary, and categorical variables. The outcome variable is "malaria infected" I would like a crude comparison of the relative importance of the coefficients across the different spatial locations, i.e. a ranking of the coefficients in each of the locations. I have been reading " Six Approaches to Calculating Standardised Logistic Regression Coefficients " by Menard (2004). The American Statistician , Vol. 58, No. 3, in which it is clearly stated that for a simple ranking (and comparison) of the coefficients, any of the approaches mentioned in the article is acceptable. (In their examples, the explanatory variables are, like mine, a mix of continuous, binary, and categorical variables). As such, the simplest approach is to multiply the unstandardised coefficient by the standard deviation of the predictor to which the coefficient refers. However, I do not know how to extract the standard deviation of the coefficients from the glmer output. I am especially confused by the idea of binary or categorical variables having a standard deviation. Can anyone advise? Secondly, I have read an un-referenced post on an alternative forum that says an acceptable, quick and dirty means of comparison is to sum the Wald chi-squares from the summary output and then take each variable's Wald chi-square and divide this by the sum. From this, one can formulate a crude ranking. Is this an acceptable measure? If so, is there any reference for this? I would prefer the former method but I need help extracting the standard deviations.
