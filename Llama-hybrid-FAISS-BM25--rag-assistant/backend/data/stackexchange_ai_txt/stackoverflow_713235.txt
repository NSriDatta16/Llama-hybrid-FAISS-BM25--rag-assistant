One benefit is the separation of concerns. You can build your application without worrying too much about UI stuff like layout, colours, fonts, etc. Then you can pass it to a designer who can make it look amazing (hopefully) without needing to understand code (using Blend or some other tool). From a purely pragmatic point of view, my choice of which framework to employ is often down to which third-party controls I need to use (although you can use a WPF control in a WinForms app, for example - using hosting controls).
