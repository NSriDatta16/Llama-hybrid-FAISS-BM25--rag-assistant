Scheduling software that solves time constraints

Is there good software or a good toolkit for coordinating schedules and organizing meetings? The concrete problem I have to solve: I have a people from group A , and b people from group B . Now schedule individual meetings between people in A and people in B . This is a real-life problem. There is an open day in a company, which has several interviewers. On that day, a group of prospective employees is visiting. For each prospective employee, we have to schedule different meetings with different interviewers, all of which have different time constraints. So, it's a constraint satisfaction problem. Is there easy-to-use software, etc? Any ideas? Update: If we just use a simple calendar it will be a lot of work to schedule all the meetings. It's almost like finding the shortest path in a graph by just inspecting it, instead of running a good algorithm to compute the answer.
