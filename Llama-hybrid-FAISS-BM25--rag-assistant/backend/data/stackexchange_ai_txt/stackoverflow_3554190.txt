Well you should start looking for a good index coverage. That means all WHERE, JOIN, GROUP BY, ORDER BY are using an index instead of a table scan. Table Scans are only acceptable in cases where you have a table with a max of like 10 rows. Otherwise it is going to kill performance. To improove the performance I would suggest that you use the "Database Engine Tuning Advisor" that comes with SQL Server.
