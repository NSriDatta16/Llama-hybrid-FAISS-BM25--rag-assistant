Solution that worked for me was to skip the execution of InvalidateRect/RedrawWindow functions after calling MoveWindow on WM_MOUSEMOVE (I'm not using glut). Because usually it makes sense to execute InvalidateRect(wnd,0,0) after all mouse/keyboard events, but apprently calling it after MoveWindow causes the window contents to "stay behind" dragging.
