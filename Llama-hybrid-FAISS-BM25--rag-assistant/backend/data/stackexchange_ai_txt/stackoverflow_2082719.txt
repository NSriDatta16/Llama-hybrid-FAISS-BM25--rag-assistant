centering a google map based on marker lat long values

I'm plotting about 20 markers on a map, locations in a city. When I use getLatLng to find the city center it's always a little removed from the locations I'm plotting, which means the markers are usually located in a corner of my map instead of in the center. is there a way to center the map on a location that is more central to my locations? I'm guessing I need some sort of "average" lat / long coordinate calculated from the 20 lat / long values I have available. Is this possible?
