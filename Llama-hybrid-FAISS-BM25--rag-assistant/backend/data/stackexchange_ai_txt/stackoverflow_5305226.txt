Cobertura on Tomcat

I'm trying to apply code coverage using Cobertura. The app is deployed in Tomcat 5, but when I instrument the .class files, the app stops working. This are my steps: Compile the app (This run in tomcat) Instrument the class files. D:\test\cobertura-1.9.4.1\cobertura-instrument.bat --destination D:\test\instrument D:\src\path_to_app\main\target\webapp Overwrite the class files of D:\src\path_to_app\main\target\webapp with the instrumented class files in D:\test\instrument . Deploy the app in Tomcat via Catalina conf or by a war file. (The app does not work) Does someone have the correct steps for correctly deploying an app in Tomcat with the classes instrumented by Cobertura? Reference: http://cobertura.sourceforge.net/faq.html I'm using cobertura-1.9.4.1
