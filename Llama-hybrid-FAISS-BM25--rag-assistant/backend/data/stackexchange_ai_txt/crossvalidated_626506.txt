As a frequentist, once the coin has been flipped but with the outcome still unknown, I could state "we are 50% confident that the outcome is heads" (the "we" here being the communal we). Post-sample confidence is based on the pre-sample probability. However, note that confidence levels are not the same as probabilities, and cannot be manipulated in the way probabilities can be (Cox and Hinkley (1974) p. 227). Regarding your explicit question, after the flip, the frequentist can say the probability of the outcome being heads is 0 or 1. I am not sure that all strict frequentists would say that, once the coin has been flipped, "There is no uncertainty to measure". Instead it is more that frequentists would say that there is no uncertainty worth modelling. Frequentists tend to be interested in modelling the data-generating process itself whereas the Bayesian approach is what you would need if you wish to model your own uncertainty.
