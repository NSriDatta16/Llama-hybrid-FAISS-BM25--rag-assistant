Assuming that you're using SPSS, you can compute a new variable using the syntax or the menu commands in the following way: COMPUTE white_hispanic = ( (race = 1) & (hispanic Race = 1 corresponds to the white category and that hispanic corresponds to the categories to be considered. The ampersand & corresponds to the and operator. So, the above expression reads as: The new variabe white_hispanic is 1 (i.e., truth for SPSS), when the race variable is equal to 0 and when the hispanic variable is equal to 1 . If one of those variables, or both, is not equal to their respective values, then the white_hispanic assumes the value 0 (i.e., false for SPSS). Edit: If you also want to compare "non-Hispanic whites" vs "Hispanics", then you can use: DO IF ( (race = 1) & (hispanic = 12) ) . COMPUTE nonHispanicWhite_vs_Hispanic = 0 . ELSE IF (hispanic If the individual is "non-hispanic & white", this code attributes the value 0 ; if the individual is "hispanic" the value will be 1 ; otherwise the value will be the system missing value. By the way, let me point out that I agree with the line of thought of Sal Mangiafico . In particular, when doing a logistic regression, you may have several independent variables (covariates). So, you may add both race and hispanic to the binary logistic regression model, both defined as categorical, and perhaps considering the first category of each as the reference category. This approach do not requires the creation of new variables, and you may even include the interaction term race*hispanic if you wish to consider the possibility of having different effects of race among distinct values of hispanic . If there are a small number of cases, at least for some of the categories, you may create two new variables, white and hisp , to be used in the logistic regression, and defined as follows: COMPUTE white = (race = 1) . COMPUTE hisp = (hispanic Of course you may use different subsets of the possible values for the new variables, that may have more than 2 categories. However, although reducing the number of categories of each variable may be appealing, caution should be taken, since we may be reducing the statistical power of the logistic regression.
