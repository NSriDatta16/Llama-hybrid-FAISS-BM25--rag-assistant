I believe a time-series does not make sense here if you don't have repeated measurements for all shops. You even wrote most shops have only one observation which would make time-series methods impossible. What you should do here is proper feature engineering that aggregates the temporal information to one unique shop_id. Thus, assume the last_sales is measured at different points in time for different shops. You could then include the time difference between today and the time of measurement as a feature. Or even simpler, include the time of last_sales as a dummy variable (eg. time=8 - yes/no). Another feature could be the difference in sales between the last_sales measurement and the previous sales figures. You can really get creative in the feature engineering process. With the resulting dataset you could then do KFold-cross-validation.
