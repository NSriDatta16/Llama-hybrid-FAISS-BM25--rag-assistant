You're probably better off creating something other than a file for this purpose. Since files are generally used as a more permanent storage solution, it's not what you want. What I would recommend is something like a mutex or some other kind of named, OS implemented, cross-process token or synchronisation primitive. Since then if your program ends (normally or abnormally) the OS will clean up the token for you, so you don't need to worry about manual cleanup. On Windows you can use something like a named mutex, not exactly sure what you would use on Linux or other Unixes but there will most definitly be something like this available.
