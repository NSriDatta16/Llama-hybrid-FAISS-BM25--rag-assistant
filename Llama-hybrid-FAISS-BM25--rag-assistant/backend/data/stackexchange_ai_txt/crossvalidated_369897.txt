Recursive feature elimination with cross validation and random forest classification: I cannot interpret the result

I ran an expirement with my dataset and using the recursive feature elimination with cross validation and random forest classification in a binary classification problem. I came up with this result: I cannot understand that this is a problematic situation but I really cannot interpret the result. What exactly those flunctuations mean about my dataset or the method?
