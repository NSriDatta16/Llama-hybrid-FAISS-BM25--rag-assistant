A standard deep neural network (DNN) is, technically speaking, parametric since it has a fixed number of parameters. However, most DNNs have so many parameters that they could be interpreted as nonparametric ; it has been proven that in the limit of infinite width, a deep neural network can be seen as a Gaussian process (GP), which is a nonparametric model [Lee et al., 2018]. Nevertheless, let's strictly interpret DNNs as parametric for the rest of this answer. Some examples of parametric deep learning models are: Deep autoregressive network (DARN) Sigmoid belief network (SBN) Recurrent neural network (RNN), Pixel CNN/RNN Variational autoencoder (VAE), other deep latent Gaussian models e.g. DRAW Some examples of nonparametric deep learning models are: Deep Gaussian process (GPs) Recurrent GP State space GP Hierarchical Dirichlet process Cascaded Indian Buffet process Image from Shakir Mohamed's tutorial on deep generative models .
