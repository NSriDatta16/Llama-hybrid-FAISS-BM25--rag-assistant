The author is right. Data Leakage is when you used additional information not available during training for training your ML model. In PCA if you use test data you are using some insights from test data as part of your training process hence data leakage. Machine learning mastery explains data leakage as below : Data leakage can cause you to create overly optimistic if not completely invalid predictive models. Data leakage is when information from outside the training dataset is used to create the model. This additional information can allow the model to learn or know something that it otherwise would not know and in turn invalidate the estimated performance of the mode being constructed. if any other feature whose value would not actually be available in practice at the time youâ€™d want to use the model to make a prediction, is a feature that can introduce leakage to your model
