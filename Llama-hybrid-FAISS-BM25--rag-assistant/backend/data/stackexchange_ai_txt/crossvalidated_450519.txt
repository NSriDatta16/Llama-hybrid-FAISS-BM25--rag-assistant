Semi-continuous values?

Sorry if this question was already asked - will be happy to remove this one, I have a numerical vector of clinical data to analyse and due to various reasons this vector contains 2 types of values: 10 (exact integer number) if the value in a current patient was normal and continuous values 11 if not (say, 8.7 or 11.9). How should I treat such vector in a regression approach (want to use it as a predictor)? I was thinking about adding random noise to make values more "uniform", but then it is not clear how to do so. Want to clarify: integer number of 10 totally makes sense, these is "number of events in the population of cells", if all the cells are normal, we will get exactly 10, but it may happen that say 62% of cells contain 8 events and 21% contain 9 events (the rest is normal and contain 10 events) - this continuous values are just average across 100% of the cells. Values are truncated at 9 and 11 because of the limitation of the measurement method - but the values are already truncated and it is not possible to recover the "noisy" measurement. UPD: following an advice from the comments, I add: I am interested in building a model of relationships between such "strange" predictor and some clinical outcome (it may be continuous or dichotomised variable - it is not me who sets the rules...). I am not interested in deep modelling of the phenomena - an empirical model with trustable results (such as p-values distributed uniformly under H0) would be totally fine.
