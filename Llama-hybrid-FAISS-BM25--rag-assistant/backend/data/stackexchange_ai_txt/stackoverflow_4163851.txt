Magento: Attribute with thousands of values/options

I'm creating a Book store in Magento and am having trouble figuring out the best way to handle the Authors of a Book (which would be the product). What I currently have is an Attribute called "authors" which is multi-select and a thousand [test] values. It's still manageable but does get a little slow when editing a product. Also, when adding an option/value to the authors attribute itself, a huge list is rendered in the HTML making this an inefficient solution. Is there another approach I should take? Is it possible to create an Author object (entity type?) which is associated to a product through a join table? If yes, can someone give me an explanation about how that is done or point me to some good documentation? If I'd take the Author object approach, could that still be used in the layered navigation? How would I show the list of all books for a single author? Thanks in advance! PS: I am aware of extensions like Improved Navigation but AFAIK it adds something like attributes to attributes themselves which is not what I'm looking for. For Googlers: The same would apply for Artists of a music site or manufacturers.
