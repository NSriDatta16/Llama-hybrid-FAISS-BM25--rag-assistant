How to set linestyle to solid/dashed/dotted/ragged/stippled in flash?

I am using Flash CS4, and it has a feature of drawing solid/dashed/dotted/ragged/stippled lines. But, I can't find API for drawing a line of these styles. Graphics.lineStyle() doesn't support it. How can I draw styled lines progammatically? EDIT: Included ragged/stipple style
