How to interpret categorical variable in logistic regression with contrast coding

I'm currently having the following regression that I found a bit tricky to explain: # glm(formula = mask_got_20 ~ Sex + Amount + mask_wearing, family = "binomial", # data = clean_data_third) # Coefficients: # Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) # (Intercept) 1.50966 0.27831 5.424 5.82e-08 *** # Sex1 0.13040 0.17904 0.728 0.466395 # Amount1 0.07623 0.17914 0.426 0.670433 # mask_wearing1 1.02371 0.27780 3.685 0.000229 *** # --- # Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 exp(coef(r5)) # (Intercept) Sex1 Amount1 mask_wearing1 # 4.525197 1.139287 1.079214 2.783507 In this regression, I would like to explain the last variable -- mask_wearing, which is a categorical variable recording whether my participants are still wearing a facemask. The DV in this regression is whether the masked confederate receives £20 (1 = yes, 0 = no). Since my main interest is the intercept, I used contrast coding where the intercept represents the mean of group means, and the parameter represents the difference from the intercept. How should I compare if I would like to interpret the last variable as: "participants who reported they still wear a facemask regularly are about X times more likely to offer £20 to the masked confederate than participants who no longer wear facemasks." Should I use the difference of intercept estimate +- the estimate of mask_wearing and then exponentiate it? Thank you for your help.
