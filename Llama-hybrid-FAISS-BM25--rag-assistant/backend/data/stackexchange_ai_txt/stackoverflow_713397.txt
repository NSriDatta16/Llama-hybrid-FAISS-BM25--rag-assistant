What is a minimal set of unicode characters for reasonable Japanese support?

I have a mobile application that needs to be ported for a Japanese audience. Part of the application is a custom font file that needs to be extended from only containing latin-1 characters to also containing Japanese characters. I realise that this will make it rather large, but that is not todays problem. Note that I have no control over the text to be displayed by this application, so it needs to be able to support enough to be able to display user-generated content. Here is what I believe to be a maximal set of unicode ranges that would cover anything required of it. Compatability U+3300 - U+33FF Compatability forms U+FE30 - U+FE4F Compatability ideographs U+F900 - U+FAFF Compatability ideographs supplement U+2F800 - U+2FA1F Radicals supplement U+2E80 - U+2EFF Strokes U+31C0 - U+31EF Symbols and punctuation U+3000 - U+303F Unified Ideographs U+4E00 - U+9FBB Unified Ideographs ext. A U+3400 - U+4DB5 Unified Ideographs ext. B U+20000 - U+2A6D6 Enclosed letters and months U+3200 - U+32FF Hiragana U+3040 - U+309F Kanbun U+3190 - U+319F Katakana U+30A0 - U+30FF Katakana phonetic U+31F0 - U+31FF What I need to know is: Is anything missing from this list? Is anything obviously not required? Is anything arguably non-essential, and why could it be argued as such?
