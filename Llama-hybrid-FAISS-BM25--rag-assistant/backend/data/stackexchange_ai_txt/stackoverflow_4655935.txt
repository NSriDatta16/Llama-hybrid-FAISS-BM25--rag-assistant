Reason One : If I write code in 2008 that knows about the Base class and does some things with it that only involve the functionality of that class, upcasting lets you create the Derived class in 2011 and pass an instance to my code without any changes. Arguably, this could also be done (and perhaps more powerful) if I had written my code using generics in the first place. Reason Two : If you need to store several instances of different classes in a single container, you need to upcast those instances to a shared base class. Consider, for instance, a list of "currently loading" data sources which may be local files, URLs, in-memory data and even sockets - all of these would be specific classes sharing a common data source class.
