Applying a model on a set with only positives or negatives does not allow you to make any statement about the differentiation power of the model. Hence I would ignore this folds. I suggest to improve the whole validation process in the following way: use a stratified sampling approach within cross-validation to ensure that the ratio of positives to negatives is the same in every fold and/or repeat the crossvalidation some times with different seeds (at maximum 6 times, as suggested by Kohavi) to gain more folds to average over.
