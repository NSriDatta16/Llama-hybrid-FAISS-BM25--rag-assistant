MA Model Estimation: Let us assume a series with 100 time points, and say this is characterized by MA(1) model with no intercept. Then the model is given by $$y_t=\varepsilon_t-\theta\varepsilon_{t-1},\quad t=1,2,\cdots,100\quad (1)$$ The error term here is not observed. So to obtain this, Box et al. Time Series Analysis: Forecasting and Control (3rd Edition) , page 228 , suggest that the error term is computed recursively by, $$\varepsilon_t=y_t+\theta\varepsilon_{t-1}$$ So the error term for $t=1$ is, $$\varepsilon_{1}=y_{1}+\theta\varepsilon_{0}$$ Now we cannot compute this without knowing the value of $\theta$. So to obtain this, we need to compute the Initial or Preliminary estimate of the model, refer to Box et al. of the said book, Section 6.3.2 page 202 state that, It has been shown that the first $q$ autocorrelations of MA($q$) process are nonzero and can be written in terms of the parameters of the model as $$\rho_k=\displaystyle\frac{-\theta_{k}+\theta_1\theta_{k+1}+\theta_2\theta_{k+2}+\cdots+\theta_{q-k}\theta_q}{1+\theta_1^2+\theta_2^2+\cdots+\theta_q^2}\quad k=1,2,\cdots, q$$ The expression above for$\rho_1,\rho_2\cdots,\rho_q$ in terms $\theta_1,\theta_2,\cdots,\theta_q$, supplies $q$ equations in $q$ unknowns. Preliminary estimates of the $\theta$s can be obtained by substituting estimates $r_k$ for $\rho_k$ in above equation Note that $r_k$ is the estimated autocorrelation. There are more discussion in Section 6.3 - Initial Estimates for the Parameters , please read on that. Now, assuming we obtain the initial estimate $\theta=0.5$. Then, $$\varepsilon_{1}=y_{1}+0.5\varepsilon_{0}$$ Now, another problem is we don't have value for $\varepsilon_0$ because $t$ starts at 1, and so we cannot compute $\varepsilon_1$. Luckily, there are two methods two obtain this, Conditional Likelihood Unconditional Likelihood According to Box et al. Section 7.1.3 page 227 , the values of $\varepsilon_0$ can be substituted to zero as an approximation if $n$ is moderate or large, this method is Conditional Likelihood. Otherwise, Unconditional Likelihood is used, wherein the value of $\varepsilon_0$ is obtain by back-forecasting, Box et al. recommend this method. Read more about back-forecasting at Section 7.1.4 page 231 . After obtaining the initial estimates and value of $\varepsilon_0$, then finally we can proceed with the recursive calculation of the error term. Then the final stage is to estimate the parameter of the model $(1)$, remember this is not the preliminary estimate anymore. In estimating the parameter $\theta$, I use Nonlinear Estimation procedure, particularly the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, since MA models are nonlinear on its parameter. Overall, I would highly recommend you to read Box et al. Time Series Analysis: Forecasting and Control (3rd Edition) .
