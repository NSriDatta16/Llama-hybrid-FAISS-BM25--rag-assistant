silverlight: reflection effect

I've seen examples in silverlight where the achieve a effect using 1 of 2 ways: Two image objects, both displaying the same image, but the bottom one rotating it 180 degrees and applying a gradient image opacity A MediaElement object and a VideoBrush element. I have a series of path objects, rectanges, etc which I would like to apply a reflection affect to. Is there a more elegant solution other than copying my objects manually and rotating them? Unfortunately the VideoBrush object only works on MediaElement objects, but is there something else I can use?
