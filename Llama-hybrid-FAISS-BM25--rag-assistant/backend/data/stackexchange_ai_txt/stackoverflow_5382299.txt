Retrieval of items from custom collection

I have a following class public class People { public int id; public string nameHash; public string name; } I need to create a custom collection, consisting of objects of class People , that lets me retrieve elements by its id and nameHash . The collection must have the ability to iterate through its elements using foreach: foreach (People person in PeopleCollection) { ... } How do I do that? If you can not give a detailed answer, at least give a brief plan of action. Thanks in advance!
