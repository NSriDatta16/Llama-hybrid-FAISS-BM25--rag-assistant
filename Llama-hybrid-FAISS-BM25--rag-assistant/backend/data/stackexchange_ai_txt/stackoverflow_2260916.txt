There's a paste event that works for all pastes (including via context or edit menus) in an editable document, in Firefox starting version 3.0, WebKit for a few years (not sure of version number) and IE since 5.5. Adding the paste event handler to the body element works in all these browsers. I'm afraid I don't have any insight on drag and drop events: on the editors I've worked on I've had good reason to explicitly disable drag and drop.
