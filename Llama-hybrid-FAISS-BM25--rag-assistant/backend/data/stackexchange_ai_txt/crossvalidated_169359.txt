In random forests, overfitting is generally caused by over growing the trees. Pruning the trees would also help. So, some parameters which you can optimize in the cForest argument are the ntree , mtry mtry is the number of variables the algorithm draws to build each tree. ntree is the total number of trees in the forest. Having said that, cross validation always helps. Consider carrying out k-fold cross validation. This forum on Kaggle would help understand carrying out cross validation in random forests.
