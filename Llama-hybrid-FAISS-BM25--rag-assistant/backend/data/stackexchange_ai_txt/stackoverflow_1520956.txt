PHP way to find the web server's temp path?

When you handle an HTTP upload the file is uploaded to $_FILES['field_name']['tmp_name'] I know I could extract the temp path from there. But I was expecting maybe a $_SERVER param that had the temp path (there's none) or other elegant way of knowing it. Is there any?
