Memory constraints will be a huge thing to pay attention to. You will only have a few megabytes of RAM at most, and often less the 1 MB. You will find things you have done before are now very much performance hogs. Also the limited scope of the micro framework will be quite a PITA at times. But it sure sounds fun. I'd much rather work with micros then web development (my current job).
