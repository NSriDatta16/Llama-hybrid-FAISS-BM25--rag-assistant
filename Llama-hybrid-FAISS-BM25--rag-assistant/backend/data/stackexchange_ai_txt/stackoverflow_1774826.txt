Which CSS organization method is fastest?

If I have the following HTML: Paragraph 1 Paragraph 2 Paragraph 3 Paragraph 4 how should I organize the CSS to achieve the fastest page load time? I could organize it by HTML element, like this: #p1 { font-size:12px; color:red; } #p2 { font-size:12px; color:blue; } #p3 { font-size:11px; color:red; } #p4 { font-size=11px; color:blue; } or by CSS style, like this: #p1, #p2 { font-size: 12px; } #p3, #p4 { font-size: 11px; } #p1, #p3 { color:red; } #p2, #p4 { color:blue; } Which, if either, would be read and processed faster? EDIT: I should have mentioned, I'm working with GreaseMonkey right now, which means two potentially important things: 1) I can't edit any HTML, only CSS 2) All of my CSS is read after the page finishes loading normally.
