What happened to PayPal? They are recognized globally, use them to your advantage. They have the SDK's to allow interaction with the Paypal processing server... @KSS: ok, fair enough, but you would be removing yourself the burden in terms of security which would be offsetted by the cost of the additional fees, on one hand, additional fees, on the other, security issues governing storage of credit card processing....that's what Paypal does, sure the fees may be expensive but that would long-term save you the cost of security headaches and grief (which can run into thousands of USD, getting certified, security certificates, uptime, server costs etc)
