What is the probability of an occurrence within an interval

I am having an issue getting my head around this question as well. Gale-force winds occur on the average of 0.7 times every 54 hours. For an interval of 110 hours whats the probability r = 2? I believe I should solve it with Poisson Distribution (as it is in this weeks lesson, and question references using two decimal places for lambda). I would like to know the methodology - not necessarily the answer, but if the answer was supplied it might help me work back and forth through the problem. Thank you in advance.
