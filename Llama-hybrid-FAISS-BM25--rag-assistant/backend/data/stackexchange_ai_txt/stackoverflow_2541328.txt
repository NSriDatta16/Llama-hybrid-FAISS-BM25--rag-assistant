Calling a function defined in a content page loaded by jQuery tabs

I want to call a callback method that may or may not be implemented in pages being loaded as Ajax content by jQuery tabs. In other words, I have a set of jQuery tabs that load content rendered in JSP files. Some of these files have additional Ajax content in them, some don't. What I could do is: $(document).ready(function() { $("#menu").tabs( { cache: false, ajaxOptions: {cache: false}, load: function(event, ui) { if (ui.index == index_of_tab_with_additional_content) { //call code defined in other places and embedded using tags } } }); }); But that has a few drawbacks - all the callbacks must be declared in scripts embedded in my main tabs page, along with anything they may depend on - not elegant! Also, I would like to be able to call the same callback, so as to avoid a page by page if/else statement. In short, I would like to have something like load: function(event, ui) { callback(); //Each tab would implement this differently, or not at all } } Sadly, I could not figure out how to call script functions declared in the content. As noted in other threads, Javascript is not loaded by jQuery. Apparently an option must be set for this, but I could not find out which. And if the option was set and JS loaded, how would I access the functions? Would it be ui.panel.funcname(); ? Thanks, ES
