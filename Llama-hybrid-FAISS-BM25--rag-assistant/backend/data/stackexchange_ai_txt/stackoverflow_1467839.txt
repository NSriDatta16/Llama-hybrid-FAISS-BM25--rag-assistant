In general (I don't have experience with the WinUltraGrid component), setting Cancel to true on an event args object does just what you're seeing - cancels the row update event. I suspect that the data is probably rebound after that, clearing the row. What you'd probably need to do is to set up some sort of post-processing after you set the cancel (though timing could be tricky, if the component is rebinding under the covers). What I assume might work would be to save the non-null values in a custom object or dictionary, then after the event is cancelled, go back, check the dictionary/custom object, and push the values into the new row again, setting focus as needed.
