Droid X not connecting to adb on OS X

I got a Droid X for development, and after setting it up just like all my other test devices, it showed nothing when I ran "adb devices". When I plugged it in each time, OS X complained that it could not connect to the mass storage device. How can I fix this, and connect my Droid X to OS X for development? Finally found the answer, so I wanted to share it here.
