As Jason said, unless it is explicitly specified by the ECMAScript standard (unlikely), it is implementation dependent. The article shown by Feet shows that IE's implementation was poor (until IE8?), which is confirmed by JavaScript loop performance . Other JS engines probably takes a more pragmatic approach. For example, they can do like in Lua, having a true array part and an associative array part: if the array is dense, it lives in the true array (which can still be extended at the cost of re-allocation), and you can still have sparse high indices living in the associative part. Thus you have the best of two worlds, speed of access to dense parts and low memory use for sparse parts.
