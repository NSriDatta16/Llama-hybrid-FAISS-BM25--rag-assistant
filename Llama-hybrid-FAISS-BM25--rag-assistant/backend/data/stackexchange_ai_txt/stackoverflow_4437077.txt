If you don't have a choice to use a third party library, I don't consider the following code so ugly (though some scripting languages do have elegant ways of doing it): //map must be a bijection in order for this to work properly public static HashMap reverse(Map map) { HashMap rev = new HashMap (); for(Map.Entry entry : map.entrySet()) rev.put(entry.getValue(), entry.getKey()); return rev; }
