It's not a server side thing, its a presentation layer thing. You need to look at using relative measurement sizes in CSS for applying the appropriate scaling. i.e, using percentages or ems, instead of pixels. One thing you can do on the server side is browser-sniffing. Find out what user agent your user is using, and then push that down with your page so you can apply the appropriate stylesheet where appropriate.
