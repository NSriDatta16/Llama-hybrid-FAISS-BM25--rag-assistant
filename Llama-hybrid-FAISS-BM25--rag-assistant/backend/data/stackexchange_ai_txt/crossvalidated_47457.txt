PCA on high-dimensional text data before random forest classification?

Does it make sense to do PCA before carrying out a Random Forest Classification? I'm dealing with high dimensional text data, and I want to do feature reduction to help avoid the curse of dimensionality, but don't Random Forests already to some sort of dimension reduction?
