There's a problem with aggregating data (Approach 2) in this context: the survival estimate for an "average" set of covariate values isn't necessarily the average of survival estimates among members of the group. The relationships tend to be too non-linear to rely on that. Something related to Approach 1 makes sense. With a discrete set of time points, discrete-time survival analysis is essentially binomial regression over time, with the probability of an event during each time period modeled as a function of covariate values in place during that period. For the baseline survival over time at reference covariate values, you can model separately for each time point or impose a semi-parametric or parametric form. There are other methods for continuous-time survival, if that's more appropriate for your data. That doesn't address your concern about extrapolation, which of course is a problem even with standard time-series methods. You probably want to specify a parametric baseline survival form or a smooth semi-parametric form. For example, modeling time with restricted cubic splines enforces linearity beyond the outermost "knots." You can model the trajectories of covariates over time and extrapolate them. There is a fair amount of work on joint modeling of covariates and events, which might help you. I don't know much about it. The last paragraph of this answer has links that might be useful.
