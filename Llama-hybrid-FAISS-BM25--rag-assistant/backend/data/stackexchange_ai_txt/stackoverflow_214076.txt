The difference can be illustrated by the following: std::cout is equivalent to std::cout So, Use std::endl If you want to force an immediate flush to the output. Use \n if you are worried about performance (which is probably not the case if you are using the operator). I use \n on most lines. Then use std::endl at the end of a paragraph (but that is just a habit and not usually necessary). Contrary to other claims, the \n character is mapped to the correct platform end of line sequence only if the stream is going to a file ( std::cin and std::cout being special but still files (or file-like)).
