If you're looking for more elegant as in smaller code, then you can just do this: buff = [x for x in testGroupList if x > 0] for i, val in enumerate([buff.count(x) for x in xrange(1,max(buff))]): if val == 1: print i+1, elif val > 1: print "(Test Group %d duplicated %d times)" % (i+1, val), elif val == 0: print "(Test Group %d missing)" % (i+1), which is pretty close to your original. I used i instead of id because id is a standard function in Python.
