In my opinion, the only architectural pattern to the problem you describe is: abstraction Make sure to stick to using resources that are offered across various vendors,like storage, queue, etc. Create abstraction layers for each of them. Hope this helps. I don't think its a super simple task to do, given the variability of the services across cloud providers
