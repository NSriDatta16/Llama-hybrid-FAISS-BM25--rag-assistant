One option is to fit a zero-inflated beta model. I.e. this model has two components, one that models whether the value is zero or non-zero + one part that models (given that the value is non-zero) what is the non-zero value. Beta-regression seems like a potentially decent fit, because it models data on (0, 1) (i.e. proportions without a denominator, if you had a denominator, then logistic regression would be preferable). One particularly useful way to get prediction intervals here might be a Bayesian approach, where you get MCMC samples for predictions and can then take quantiles of these values (and if lots of zeros get sampled as predictions, the interval will then include zero). In terms of specific software, in R there's brms that makes this pretty straightforward (see this vignette and the documentation on zero-inflated distributions ).
