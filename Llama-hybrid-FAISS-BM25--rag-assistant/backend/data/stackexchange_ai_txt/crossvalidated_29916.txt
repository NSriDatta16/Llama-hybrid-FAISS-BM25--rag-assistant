Method to find 'principal components' of EMG recordings of reflexes

I have a series of electromyographic (EMG) reflex recordings, of which I would like to find out the principal components. My thoughts are that there are multiple processes that added together result in the EMG recording. Here is a series of reflexes of a single recording and here a single reflex As you can see all reflex responses are stimulus time-locked and have clear a beginning and end (Note the vertical line is the detected latency in does not belong to the recording). I already tried to apply a principal components analysis (PCA) and got good results but there are negative factor loadings, which I can not easily explain physiologically. A non-negative matrix factorization (NNMF) does not allow negative input values so I offset the the signal to be strictly positive. I think both methods deliver, on first sight, good results, but how interpretable are they in the sense of multiple processes adding up to the compound EMG signal. My questions now are: Which method should I use? Are there better methods than PCA and NNMF for this task and can I just offset the values for NNMF. Thanks in advance and please let me know if I should explain something in more detail. -- Edit: Here is a sample result of the NNMF with two factors The upper figure shows the two components and the lower image the factor loadings for each response in the series. What can be seen is that at the start of the stimulation the green factor is more present and is 'replaced' between the 10th and 15th response with the blue one. Edit2: NNMF seems to only return correct results for rectified responses. Is there a method to restrict PCA for non-negative loadings?
