Having problems creating/embeding a JApplet

I'm having some trouble creating JApplet, and I've googled quite a bit, but I'm obviously missing something big. I've created an Eclipse project, with 6 packages, and one of them (named 'gui') has two important files. The first one is called ComplexApp.java, which does the initialization of the app (and has a "public static void main"), and a second one, ComplexApplet.java does the same thing, except that it contains init() and start() (and lacks main()). The applet and the app both start normally in eclipse. So now, I exported the whole project as a .jar file. The first thing I've noticed is that I never specified which .java class should be used to start the applet (I was at one point asked to select a class containing main(), but I've skipped that, since applets don't have main(), only init()/start()/... right? If I try to start the generated .jar file (using Jar launcher), I receive a message saying "Failed to load Main-Class manifest attribute", which I guess is normal. So I've created a .jnlp file, and when I start it manually (or embed it on a html), I receive an error: "The field href has an invalid value: Complex.jar". Here is the jnlp: Complex numbers ETF So, can anyone help me? Pretty please? :) Thanks.
