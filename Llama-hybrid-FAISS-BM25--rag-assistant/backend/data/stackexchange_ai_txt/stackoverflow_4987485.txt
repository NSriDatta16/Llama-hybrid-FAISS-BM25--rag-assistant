Knowing where the sections are applied is a little quirky. Rather than wrapping paragraphs within sections, which would make it easy for us to identify, sections instead apply to all the content found before them. Look for SectionProperties elements within the ParagraphProperties of a paragraph, these are what define Section breaks. When you find a SectionProperties definition, all content between the last SectionProperties definition and this new definition is grouped together as a section. For example consider the following: Paragraph1 // Section 1 Paragraph2 // Section 1 SectionProperties (Section 1) // Defines what section 1 is like Paragraph3 // Section 2 Paragraph4 // Section 2 SectionProperties (Section 2) // Defines what section 2 is like Paragraph5 // Section 3 Final SectionProperties // Defines what Section 3 is like. // This final definition exists within the Body tag itself. // Other SectionProperties exist under Paragraph Properties Also remember that the last SectionProperties doesn't live within a paragraph, it sits at the root level inside the Body tag. Unfortunately as far as I know the SDK doesn't provide shortcuts for calculating which section a Paragraph belongs to. From here you should be able to get a quick system for calculating sections.
