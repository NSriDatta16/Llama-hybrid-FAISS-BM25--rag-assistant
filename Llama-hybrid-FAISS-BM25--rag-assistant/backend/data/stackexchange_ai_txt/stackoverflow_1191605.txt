Is there a simple way to convert MySQL data into Title Case?

I have a MySQL table where all the data in one column was entered in UPPERCASE, but I need to convert in to Title Case, with recognition of "small words" akin to the Daring Fireball Title Case script . I found this excellent solution for transforming strings to lowercase, but the Title Case function seems to have been left out of my version of MySQL. Is there an elegant way to do this?
