It's actually quite simple! The patch controller will accept KVC's setValue:forKeyPath: just fine. (The desired key path will probably look like patch.Input_Ports.value .) To connect to your patch controller, you'll need to add an outlet to your app delegate. In your app delegate's .h file, add an instance variable IBOutlet NSObjectController* patchController . IBOutlet doesn't do anything for the compiler, but it signals to Interface Builder that there's an outlet there. Once you've added that line, you'll be able to go back to Interface Builder and control-drag from your app delegate to your patch controller, thus connecting the patchController outlet to the specific instance in your .nib file. (There is no .h file for QCPatchController, but it's a subclass of NSObjectController, so you can safely declare it as such.)
