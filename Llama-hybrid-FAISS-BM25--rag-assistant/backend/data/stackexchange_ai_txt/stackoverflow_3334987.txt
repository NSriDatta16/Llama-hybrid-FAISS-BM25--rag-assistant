C# Listview Drag and Drop Rows

I'm trying to implement a C# drag and drop row-reorder with a listview which would then update an SQL database with the current order of the rows. I've come across some snippets of code on the internet (one from this website which implemented a 'var' class) but none seem to be working with my needs. I don't need help updating the database as I have a good idea how I'd do this, but can't seem to get the row reordering to work correctly, any input would be appreciated. -thanks m&a
