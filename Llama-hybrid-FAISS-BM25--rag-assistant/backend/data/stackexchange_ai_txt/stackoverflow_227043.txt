From iTunes, drag the icon of your app to the desktop, this will give you a link you can use directly (for example, http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=284036524&mt=8 launches the AppStore to Crosswords, both on a desktop and an iPhone). Pop this into an NSURL and call openURL on it.
