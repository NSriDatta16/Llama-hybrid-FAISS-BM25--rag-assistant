Saxon PE and EE are XSLT 2.0 processor implementations where you don't need a node-set extension function as in XSLT 2.0 the difference between result tree fragments and node-sets does no longer exists. So you should be able to simply use e.g. $var/foo/bar instead of exsl:node-set($var)/foo/bar in your stylesheets where you process variables.
