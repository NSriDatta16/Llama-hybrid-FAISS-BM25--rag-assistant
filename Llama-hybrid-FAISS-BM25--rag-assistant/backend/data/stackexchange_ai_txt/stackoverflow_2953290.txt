What's the process you are running in there? Since you mentioned its a console application, perhaps, it was waiting for more input? Since running this as a webservice, is the executable running under the same permissions as the ASP webservice? It could be that the web-service is not releasing the executable as that is loaded in process, or that the web-service is designated to run forever until IIS gets restarted and then the Process's Exit event may get fired. It has come to my attention also, that there is no using clause around the Process's instantiated object i.e. using (Process proc = new Process()) { } Edit: Also, please see here a link to a similar concept. The only thing after comparing the results is that the property WindowStyle is set... ps.WindowStyle = System.Diagnostics.ProcessWindowStyle.Hidden;
