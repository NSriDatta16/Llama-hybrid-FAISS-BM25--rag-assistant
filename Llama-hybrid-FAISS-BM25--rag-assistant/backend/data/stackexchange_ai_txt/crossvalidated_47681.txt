You said: "I'm looking for a Sparse matrix dimension reduction." My intuition is that you want to find a solution for e recommendation engine. If it is so, IMHO the best alternative to PCA is Singular Value Decomposition SVD has implementation in domain specific languages Matlab and R , and in many mainstream languages Java , Python Moreover you said: "I want to apply mixture models for clustering my data." There are many methods data clustering in general, but is very important "what" and "when" (in which step) is clustered. For example you can cluster reduced scores for items or for products or for both. You will need to prototype to find best solution for your case. This is also a good resource.
