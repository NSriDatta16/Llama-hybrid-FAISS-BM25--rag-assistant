The way deep neural networks are usually understood is that the first layers do a "feature extraction", thus they extract and transform the input data into a form that is useful for the task at hand (e.g. classification or regression). The layers towards the end of the neural network than do the actual classification or regression. So I would assume that if your data is similar, it makes sense to use the same feature extraction, and you can leave the initial layers unchanged. If your data is however not very similar, you probably need a different type of feature-extraction, and you thus have to fine-tune the initial layers.
