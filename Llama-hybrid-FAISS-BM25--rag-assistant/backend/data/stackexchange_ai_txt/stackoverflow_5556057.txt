I haven't seen the movie, but let me state some assumptions: You have a search field which searches by name. You don't know the names of any sorority members. There is no other way to access the pictures (except the search box). In this scenario, I do not think there is an elegant answer. This may be one of those cinematic "I translate the ancient tablet in an unknown language" sort of moments. My guess is your best bet would be a brute-force search. If you search by common names (and last names), you could get a majority of the members. If you have the time and will, an actual brute force (letter by letter, etc) would eventually fill up the gaps missed by item 1. Edit: Also, in theory, if the sorority is large enough and everyone is named "Jane Smith", there would be no solution.
