Confidence score for all observations is between 0.50 - 0.55

Hello Data Science Stack Exchange Community, This question will appear to be open-ended, however any answers or thought will be much appreciated. I am trying to go-through a pre-trained Random Model Classifier with minimum documentation like what was the confusion matrix, ROC-AUC curve of the classification problem when the model was developed. I only have the pickle file and the data set on which it needs to run. When I ran the model I observed for most of the cases the prediction score or confidence score is between 0.50 to 0.55 I would like to know is it right to say that "model might have learn the pattern even tough all the confidence score is between 0.50 and 0.55" Because I would like to explain that since the all the predictions score are concentrated around a single value it is not right to say that the model learnt and probably if some one would have tried to plot AUC it would have been straight line. Again any thoughts and answers will be much appreciated.
