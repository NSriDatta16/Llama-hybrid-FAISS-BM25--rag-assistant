How to see from the PCA results if two original variables were correlated?

I perform principal component analysis (PCA) on a dataset with 120 variables. If I want to know if two variables A and B from my original dataset are correlated, how could I answer this question after performing PCA? As I understand from the answers to my previous question ( Does each eigenvalue in PCA correspond to one particular original variable? ), PCA transforms my variables, and original A and B are not available anymore.
