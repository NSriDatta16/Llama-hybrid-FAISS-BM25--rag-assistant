Ruby on Rails - Truncate to a specific string

Clarification: The creator of the post should be able to decide when the truncation should happen. I implemented a Wordpress like [---MORE---] functionality in my blog with following helper function: # application_helper.rb def more_split(content) split = content.split("[---MORE---]") split.first end def remove_more_tag(content) content.sub(â€œ[---MORE---]", '') end In the index view the post body will display everything up to (but without) the [---MORE---] tag. # index.html.erb And in the show view everything from the post body will be displayed except the [---MORE---] tag. # show.html.erb This solution currently works for me without any problems. Since I am still a beginner in programming I am constantly wondering if there is a more elegant way to accomplish this . How would you do this? Thanks for your time. This is the updated version: # index.html.erb 0, :separator => '[---MORE---]', :omission => link_to( "Continued...",post)) %> ...and in the show view: # show.html.erb
