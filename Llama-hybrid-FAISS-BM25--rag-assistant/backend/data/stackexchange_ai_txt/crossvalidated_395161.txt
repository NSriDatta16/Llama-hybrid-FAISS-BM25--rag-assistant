The percentages of families (15%, 45%, etc.) add to 100% so you can take $r_0 = 0.15, r_1=.0.45, r_2 = 0.25, r_3 = 0.13, p_4 = 0.02$ as approximate relative frequencies as the numbers of cars 0, 1, ..., 4 of cars per family. It is possible that a very small percentage of families has more than 4 cars, but for an an approximate value of $E(X)$ it seems unlikely that the value would be far off. Then you find $$E(X) \approx \sum_{k = 0}^4 kr_k = 0(.15) + 1(.45) + \cdots + 4(.02) = 1.42.$$ So it seems that, on average, a family has about 1.42 cars. This is an important concept, because as the size of the sample of families increases, the relative frequencies $r_k$ become increasingly close estimates of $P(X = k).$ Then the formal distribution of the expectation $E(X)$ of the random variable $X$ becomes $$E(X) = \sum_k kP(X = k),$$ where the sum is taken over all possible values $k.$ For another example, consider the random variable $Y$ that counts the number of Heads when a fair coin is tossed four times. The possible numbers of heads are $0, 1, 2, 3, 4$ and and the corresponding probabilities are $1/16,\, 4/16,\, 6/16,\, 4/16,\, 1/16.$ Thus, $E(Y) = \frac{0+4+12+12 + 4}{16} = 2.$
