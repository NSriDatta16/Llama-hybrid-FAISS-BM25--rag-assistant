Consider this: How does adding a second cookie make it any more difficult for someone who can steal arbitrary cookies to log in as that user? It doesn't. You have to tie it to something that the user can provide, but it can't be the same thing. If you can tie it to IP address, great. If not, consider hashing the user agent + user id using that first key as an HMAC or something. I'm still in the process of trying to design a secure login system myself, so I can tell you what definitely doesn't work--and this is one of those things.
