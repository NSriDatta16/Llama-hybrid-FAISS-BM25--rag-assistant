How does one set a custom WebAppClassLoader in Jetty through config?

I am trying to configure a Jetty (6.x) WebAppContext with a custom subclass of WebAppClassLoader . In code (Scala), it's simply this: val context = new WebAppContext() val cwacl = new CustomWebAppClassLoader(context) context.setClassLoader(cwacl) ... This works fine when embedding Jetty. In production, however, I just deploy a war file to a stand-alone jetty instance, so there's no opportunity to configure things in code like this. I can't figure out how to do the same thing via Jetty's configuration files. Any help is appreciated. Bonus: How would you configure maven-jetty-plugin to use the CustomWebAppClassLoader :)
