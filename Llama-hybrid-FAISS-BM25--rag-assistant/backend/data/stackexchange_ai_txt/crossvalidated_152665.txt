Most outlier detection algorithms in open source package are for business time series data with low frequency, daily/weekly/monthly frequency data. This data appears to be for a specialized area that is captured in minutes, so I'm not sure if open source outlier detction would be helpful. You could try to adapt this approaches to your data. Below I outline some available packages approaches in open source R : tsoutliers : Implements Chen and Liu's outlier detection algorithm within arima framework. see my earlier question on this site. Fantastic approach, but very slow not sure if it will be able to handle high frequency data like yours. It has the advamtage of detecting all types of outliers as mentioned in my earlier question/post. Twitter's Anomaly detection : Uses Rosner's algorithm to detect anomalies based in time series. The algorithm decomposes timeseries and then detects anomalies. In my personal opinion, this is not efficient and accurate in detecting outlires in time series. tsoutlier in forecast package: Similar to twitter's algorithm in terms of decomposing time series and then detecting outliers. Only will detect additive outliers or pulses. There are commercial packages that have dedicated approaches to try and detect anomolies. Another classic approach is Tsay's time series outlier detection algorithm, similar to Chen and Liu's approach it detects different types of outliers. I recently also stumbled on this commercial software solution called metafor which might be more suited for your data. Hope this is helpful
