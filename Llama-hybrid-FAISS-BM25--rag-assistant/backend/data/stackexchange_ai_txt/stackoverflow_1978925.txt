You didn't get much response last time you asked this question ; you still haven't provided enough information, so I wouldn't expect much to change this time around. Perhaps you could respond to some of the responses to the original question and explain why they're not suitable, or provide more detail so that we can provide a better answer? I think you want rentacoder.com (but first, you'll need to develop more of a problem spec - for instance, you'll probably want to find a service that can receive the SMS and turn it into something like an email that the application can process - unless you're planning on embedding a GSM modem into the computer running this app, in which case you'll want to figure out what modem you're going to use so the developer can figure out how to interface with it)
