Insufficient storage problem in HTC Wildfire

I am running Froyo on my HTC Wildfire. I have 17 MB storage free in my phone. The .apk I'm trying to install on the phone is 2.7MB but I get this wierd Installation error: INSTALL_FAILED_INSUFFICIENT_STORAGE . I'm using Eclipse and have enabled debugging on my device. I was able to install binaries with the size of 11 MB with the same free storage space a few minutes ago.
