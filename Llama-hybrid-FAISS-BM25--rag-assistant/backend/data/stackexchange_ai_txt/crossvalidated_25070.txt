Understanding and applying sentiment analysis

I was just having been assigned a project of conducting sentiment analysis for some document collections. By Googling, a lot of sentiment-related research has popped up. My questions are: What are the major methods/algorithms for sentiment analysis in the field of machine learning and statistical analysis? Are there any well-established results? Are there any existing open-source software that can perform the sentiment analysis?
