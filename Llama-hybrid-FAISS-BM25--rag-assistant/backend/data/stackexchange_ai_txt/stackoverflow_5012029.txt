"cancel" isn't actually a valid method on the draggable widget. The best way I've come across to cancel a drag event is to return false from the drag event handler. You could do this based on some condition that you set based on your event occurring: $("#draggable").draggable({ drag: function() { if ($(this).hasClass("cancel")) { return false; } } }); So you would apply the class cancel to stop the dragging. Here's a small example in which I set a timer which causes the element to stop being draggable after 5 seconds: http://jsfiddle.net/andrewwhitaker/y2yrA/1/
