Training Neural Network with Highly Correlated Inputs

I am trying to train a basic Neural Network to predict Football final scores based on: i) Time in the match ii) Current Score iii) Parameters representing strength of home and away team. In order to generate my training set, I sampled a number of games at regular times throughout the match (i.e. every 5 minutes). When I trained my network based on these samples, the performance wasn't particularly good (for one it did not learn that at the end of the game the score never changes). I believe one of the problems is that the training samples are very highly correlated as they are only separated in time by 5 minute intervals. What would be a good tactic to train the network given these highly correlated training samples?
