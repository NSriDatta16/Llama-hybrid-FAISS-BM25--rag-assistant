I'd try using the CumulativeManipulation instead. Whenever I need to do a UI element movement via dragging, I don't try to reuse the same variable and modify it by the delta and then reuse that same variable for setting position. It almost always gives me stability issues regardless of platform. Instead, try storing a variable when dragging starts and adding the delta to that variable only when you need to update position. So something more like this: Point origin; void MouseDown(Point location) { origin = location; } void MouseDrag(Vector cumulativeOffset) { SetControlLocation(origin+cumulativeOffset); } Also, what's the source of the ManipulationEvent? You'll definitely want to make sure it's not the current rectangle, or that will definitely cause the issues you're seeing.
