Adobe's "ColdFusion Developer's Guide" -- looks like it's for ColdFusion 8, and not the easiest read overall, but has good, broad coverage. Update: looks like the CF9 "Developer's Guide" stuff is just formatted/organized slightly different ( here ) than above link. I think "The CFML Programming Language" and "Building Blocks of ColdFusion Applications" sections would be a great first-step for new developers. You could couple that with "What's New In ColdFusion 9." Also see Railo and Open BlueDragon sites for unique features of these free and open source alternative CFML engines. Finally, you can spend all day wandering through Charlie Arehart's fine "CF411" resource guide.
