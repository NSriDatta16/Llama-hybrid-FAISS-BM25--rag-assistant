Relative importance of predictors in logistic regression

I would like to calculate an estimate (even a very rough one if it is the best I could get) of the relative importance of predictors in a logistic regression, something which can let me tell a common person, not proficient in statistics (just like me), for example: these are the predictors: x1, x2, x3, x4, They are all significant statistically, but as you can see, x2 is more important than x1, x3 and x4, because the value of "unknown datum" is higher than "unknown value/other predictor" . I read Relative importance of predictors in the final model , importance of each predictor in logistic regression , How to quantify the Relative Variable Importance in Logistic Regression in terms of p? , but I did not read what I am looking for. I use R and I know a package for it: caret ( https://github.com/topepo/caret/ ) and its function called 'varImp', but I can not understand how the absolute value of t-statistic is used, so I can not understand how to comment values obtained through this formula. The main question is: how can I tell, in practice, that one predictor of a logistic regression is more important than another? Secondarily: how can I tell how much a predictor in that logistic regression is more important than another? Can you explain to me, a statistician wannabe, how the absolute value of t-statistic could be helpful?
