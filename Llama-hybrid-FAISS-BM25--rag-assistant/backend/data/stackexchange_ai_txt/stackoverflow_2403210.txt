emacs supports the command fill-paragraph which is typically mapped to meta-q . Output from fill-paragraph on your second paragraph of text: /* Suppose I have a multi-line comment with hard line-breaks (here is * some added text for happy fun time) that are roughly uniform on the * right side of the text, and I want to add text to a line in order * to make the comment a bit more descriptive. */
