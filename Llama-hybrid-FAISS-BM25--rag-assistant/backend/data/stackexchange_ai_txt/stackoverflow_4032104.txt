HTTP Ajax Request via HTTPS Page

I am having a site with some pages on HTTPS connection. From these HTTPS pages, I have to use a HTTP Ajax request for some errors retrieval like blank fields. But this error messages are not coming. Is there any solution to it or I have to make that AJAX request to file on HTTPS connection?
