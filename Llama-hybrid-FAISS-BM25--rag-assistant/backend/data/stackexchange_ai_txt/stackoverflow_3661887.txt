How can I tie togeather extra space on Macintosh desktops with a distributed filesystem?

I have access to a bunch of Mac desktops, the hard drives of which are under-utilized. I want to set up a distributed filesystem to gang them together into one large virtual volume. The server has to be able to run as a normal user. I've tried PVFS2 , but it's designed for Linux and isn't running well on OSX (hangs the clients on write). What should I use instead?
