AND Gate with delayed inputs in C#

I am trying to implement a boolean AND gate with multiple inputs. Each input has an integer identifying it. Input signals arrive randomly, and are stored at the gate (so it's not a pure AND gate, but one with delayed inputs). Only when all the input signals have arrived, does the gate fire. Note: 2 signals arriving at the same input do not count as two. I figured I'd create a Dictionary which will store the inputs, and when stimulus arrives, update the Value for that particular input's Id Key, then AND all values. If the result is 1, then fire the gate and reset all Values of the Dictionary to 0 and wait again. Something doesn't sound right with my approach, and I have a feeling there must be something more elegant and performant (.Net).
