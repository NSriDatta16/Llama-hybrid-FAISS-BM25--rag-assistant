Xcode window organization tips?

I'm a fairly recent convert to Xcode and OS X. Even though I have two large monitors it feels likes I spend far to much time hunting for windows. I typically have at least the following windows open: The file I'm editing. A matching header file. Another source file. API Documentation. A browser window. It seems like whatever I want next is always underneath something else. There are lots of ways to switch windows (e.g., Expos√©, Spaces, OS X hotkeys, Xcode hotkeys), but that's part of the problem. There are so many different approaches, I can't blindly use one; I have to think about which is the right one for each situation. How do you organize your Xcode windows so you aren't switching all the time? Or, how do you effectively switch between windows?
