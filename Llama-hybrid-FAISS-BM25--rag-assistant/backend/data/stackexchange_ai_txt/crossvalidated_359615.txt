To draw together the information in comments (mostly from user @Joe_74). The answer to the problem is meta-regression. You include study mean age in your meta-analysis model as a moderator, preferably as a continuous moderator but categorised if you insist. Note however that this does not tell you whether older patients are more likely to benefit from the treatment in terms of their risk of stroke (or other outcome). What it does is to tell you whether being enrolled in a study with on average older patients improves your chances when treated. These are not the same.
