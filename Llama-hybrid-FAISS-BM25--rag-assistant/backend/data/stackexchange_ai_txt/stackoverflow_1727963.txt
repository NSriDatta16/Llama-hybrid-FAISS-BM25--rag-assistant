For an ideal hash function, the outputs are evenly distributed, so the chances of two colliding are one in 2^32. The birthday paradox, however, tells us that if we're comparing all pairs of hashes, we should expect to see a collision once we have 2^16 hashes, on average - so don't rely on only 4 bytes on the basis that "I have a lot less than 4 billion values". MD5 isn't an ideal hash function, as we know, but the weaknesses are somewhat incidental here: finding a collision on 4 bytes is well within the realm of a reasonable brute-force attack, so there's no need to resort to cryptographic weaknesses. If you're only concerned about randomly picked data, you're not going to see a significant statistical deviation from randomness.
