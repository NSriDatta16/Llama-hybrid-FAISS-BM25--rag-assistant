DiD vs. ANCOVA has been discussed in my workplace, a health insurance company, where DiD has been the industry standard for some time. I agree that DiD does not adequately account for regression to the mean effects. A simplified causal diagram for a typical pre/post study I've worked on is illustrated below: where: A = the health intervention (treatment), Y0 = the pre-treatment outcome (summed over a given time period, say 12 months), Y1 = the post-intervention outcome, Y1 - Y0 = the change score outcome for a DiD study. In this particular study, Y0 is a confirmed confounder of both A and Y1 and A and Y1-Y0. There is an uncertain relationship between Y1 and Y1-Y0 -- as Tennant et al. have pointed out, it's not obvious whether Y1 causes Y1-Y0 or Y1-Y0 causes Y1. Based on this diagram it should be clear that Y0 is a confounder which ought to be conditioned on when estimating either the average treatment effect of A on Y1-Y0 in a DiD model, or A on Y1 in the ANCOVA. In addition, conditioning on Y0 controls for regression to the mean effects. Note that both the DiD regression and simplified ANCOVA: $E[Y_1-Y_0]=\alpha_0 + \alpha_1Y_0 + \alpha_2A$ , and $E[Y_1]=\beta_0 + \beta_1Y_0 + \beta_2A$ produce the same estimates of the treatment effect ( $\alpha_2=\beta_2$ ). Hence, in this limited case with two time periods DiD doesn't appear to be necessary.
