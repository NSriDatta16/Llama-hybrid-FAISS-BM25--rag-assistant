Xcode Organizer: can not use iPhone (dyld_shared_cache_extract_dylibs failed)

When plugging my iPhone in and starting the Xcode organizer, a yellow circle next to the device show me that "This device is busy or otherwise unusable by Xcode." The Organizer is then processing two files (the second one takes quite a while to finish) and afterwards I get the error message as shown in the screenshot. I tried to google for that error message ("dyld_shared_cache_extract_dylibs failed") but could not find anything useful. I tried a couple things: repair permissions of my harddrive and run "sudo update_dyld_shared_cache -force". Still getting the error message. I am running iOS 4.2.1 and Xcode 3.2.5. I have not updated Xcode after updating from 4.2 to 4.2.1 (I think). The Xcode console is empty but the regular OS X console shows this: 1/22/11 10:56:19 PM Xcode[4187] Started symbol copying process 1/22/11 10:56:19 PM Xcode[4187] Skipped copying file 1 of 2 ("processed" sentinal found) 1/22/11 10:56:19 PM Xcode[4187] Skipped processing file 1 of 2 ("processed" sentinal found) 1/22/11 10:56:19 PM Xcode[4187] Skipped copying file 2 of 2 ("copied" sentinal found) 1/22/11 10:56:19 PM Xcode[4187] Started processing file 2 of 2 1/22/11 10:56:20 PM [0x0-0x4d04d].com.apple.Xcode[4187] arch already exists in fat dylib 1/22/11 10:56:20 PM [0x0-0x4d04d].com.apple.Xcode[4187] arch already exists in fat dylib 1/22/11 10:56:20 PM [0x0-0x4d04d].com.apple.Xcode[4187] arch already exists in fat dylib 1/22/11 10:56:21 PM [0x0-0x4d04d].com.apple.Xcode[4187] arch already exists in fat dylib 1/22/11 10:56:21 PM [0x0-0x4d04d].com.apple.Xcode[4187] arch already exists in fat dylib 1/22/11 10:56:22 PM [0x0-0x4d04d].com.apple.Xcode[4187] arch already exists in fat dylib 1/22/11 10:56:22 PM [0x0-0x4d04d].com.apple.Xcode[4187] arch already exists in fat dylib 1/22/11 10:56:22 PM [0x0-0x4d04d].com.apple.Xcode[4187] arch already exists in fat dylib 1/22/11 10:56:23 PM [0x0-0x4d04d].com.apple.Xcode[4187] arch already exists in fat dylib 1/22/11 10:56:23 PM [0x0-0x4d04d].com.apple.Xcode[4187] arch already exists in fat dylib 1/22/11 10:56:23 PM [0x0-0x4d04d].com.apple.Xcode[4187] arch already exists in fat dylib This error message is then repeated constantly.
