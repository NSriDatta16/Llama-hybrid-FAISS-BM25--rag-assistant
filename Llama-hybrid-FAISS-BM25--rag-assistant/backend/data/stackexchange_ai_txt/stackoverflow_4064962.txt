Recommendations for good 'paging' and 'tagging' plugins/gems in Rails 3?

I am building an app that will have galleries of thumbnail images to browse through. Potentially thousands or more. I am looking for recommendations on any existing plugins or gems for paging through large result sets and, for example, showing 50 thumbnails on a page with a link to show the next 50 and so on. Second, I want to organize these with tags (and other things). I would also like suggestions on good ways to be able to filter the thumbnail gallery based on desired tag(s). I know this is broadly asked... I am looking for your ideas! Thanks.
