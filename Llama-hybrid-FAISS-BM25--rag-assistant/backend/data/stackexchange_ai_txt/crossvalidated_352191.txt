Is it possible to calculate the probability the sum of one set of random variables equals the sum of a different set of random variables?

I'm doing data analysis at the business I work for. 23 people were asked for input for two separate lists. The first list the answers could be any integer 6 to 10. The second list the answers could be any integer 0 to 15. After receiving all inputs, the average number chosen for each list was identical. For the average to be identical so was the sum. Is it possible to calculate the probability the two sums were equal even though they drew from different ranges? The original question was how much would a prospective baby weigh. 23 people answered with a guess of pounds and additional ounces. The pounds were limited 6 to 10 and the ounces were limited 0 to 15. There was no discernible connection between the guess of pounds to the guess of ounces. Also, I need help with the calculation in addition to a yes or no answer. I need a calculation over results obtained through simulation but thank you for those results as well. I would comment on posts, however, I am not allowed to yet. Also, can you please try to answer in Layman's terms please.
