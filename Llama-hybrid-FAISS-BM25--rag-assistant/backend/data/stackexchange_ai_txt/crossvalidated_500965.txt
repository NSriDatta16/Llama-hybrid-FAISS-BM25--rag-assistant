Computing probabilistic forecasts for a ratio of two other given forecasts

I have three time series (Revenue, Volume and Price), with Price = Revenue / Volume. I have created probabilistic forecasts for Revenue and Volume and now need to derive a consistent forecast (including prediction intervals) for the Price time series. I've used Error Propagation for these kind of cases before (via https://github.com/r-quantities/errors ), where I've taken the given intervals for a certain confindence level and computed the ratio. Is there a recommended or better way for this problem? (which occurs whenever on is forecasting ratios, I assume) This question is related to Producing 'structurally reconciled' forecasts (e.g. revenue = price * volume) , but investigates a slightly different approach. Rather then reconciling all three timeseries, I'd like to forecast two and derive the third from them. I've attached a toy-example illustrating the general situation. library(tidyverse) library(fable) # forecast ratio airpass_ratio_tsbl % model(ets = ETS(value)) %>% forecast() airpass_ratio_fbl %>% autoplot(airpass_ratio_tsbl) # forecast basic series airpass_count_tsbl % model(ets = ETS(value)) %>% forecast() airpass_denom_fbl % model(ets = ETS(value)) %>% forecast() library(patchwork) plot_count # compare forecasts pred_count_denom $.mean / airpass_denom_fbl$ .mean pred_count_denom #> [1] 1.917643 1.891572 1.734807 1.854132 1.869472 1.754941 1.714958 1.703860 #> [9] 1.765008 1.908119 2.020705 1.898877 1.903647 1.879276 1.724877 1.844920 #> [17] 1.861557 1.748765 1.710115 1.700201 1.762379 1.906498 2.020249 1.899600 pred_ratio [1] 1.885775 1.900048 1.743849 1.769911 1.767676 1.634153 1.532947 1.532352 #> [9] 1.649004 1.780690 1.938846 1.792032 1.770182 1.782983 1.635852 1.659732 #> [17] 1.657062 1.531359 1.436011 1.434940 1.543618 1.666279 1.813602 1.675646 forecast::accuracy(pred_count_denom, pred_ratio) #> ME RMSE MAE MPE MAPE #> Test set -0.1442346 0.1640471 0.1456945 -8.878111 8.958497 # Forecasts don't match.
