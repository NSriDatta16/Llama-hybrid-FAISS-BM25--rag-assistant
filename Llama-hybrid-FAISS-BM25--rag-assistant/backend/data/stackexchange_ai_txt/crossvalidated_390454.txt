Why do Deep learning models need larger data sets compared with classical ML

It might be a very basic question but i cant find a good answer for that. Why do deep learning networks need larger data set then what needed for more classical ML models such as SVM , classical regressions (Logit, linear ) ? Is the bias / variance are depend more on the size of the dataset then other models ?
