Shorts in Android and Java

I have written some code that used strings to represent time such as "0620", but after careful thought I realised these could be parsed into shorts for comparison performance and storage gains. In a unit test, I have a short written as 0620 being compared against a return value of 620, expecting this to work. However, the test 0620 equals 620 (both are shorts) fails. The error message says 0620 was interrupted as 400 (and 400 != 620 explaining the failure). Removing the lead 0 fixes the problem, but I wanted to know, what's going on with this? This doesn't work assertEquals("Time Failed", 0620, st.GetTime()); This Works assertEquals("Time Failed", 620, st.GetTime());
