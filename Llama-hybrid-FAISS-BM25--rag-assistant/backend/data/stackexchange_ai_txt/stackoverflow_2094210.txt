The jQuery core library method .val() does not fire the change event. If you serve your own copy of jQuery, you could modify the library method, but that would probably not be wise. Instead, you could add your own value-setter that leverages .val() while also firing the change event with something along the following lines: jQuery.fn.xVal = (function() { return function(value) { // Use core functionality result = this.val.apply(this, arguments); // trigger change event if (result instanceof jQuery) { result.change(); } return result; }; })();
