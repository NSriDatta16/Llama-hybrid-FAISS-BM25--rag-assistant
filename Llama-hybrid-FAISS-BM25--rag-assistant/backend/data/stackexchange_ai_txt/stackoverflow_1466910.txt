Settings usually only store data in very simple objects or collections (xml-serializable, even Dictionary already causes problem!). Queue has special semantics and is not very suitable for data storage. I suggest to use List or StringCollection to store settings and create Queue on start of your application based on that collection. Saving is the same but in reverse order - create List from your Queue, put it into Settings class and save. Update: Standard settings mechanism uses XML serialization for object persistence. Object implementing IEnumerable must also have method Add(T value) to be xml-serializable . Queue doesn't have such method so can't be successfully deserialized. MSDN : XmlSerializer can process classes that implement IEnumerable or ICollection differently if they meet certain requirements. A class that implements IEnumerable must implement a public Add method that takes a single parameter
