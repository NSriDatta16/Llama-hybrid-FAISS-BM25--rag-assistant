If you want to prevent double submissions, you must store the state of "is submitted" versus "is not submitted". You have several options for where to keep this information. Database - Add an hidden field with an autogenerated value that is unique (you can generate a short random string it and append the current time). This value can also be used to identify the conversation -- if you need a stateful web conversation. Add this value to the database and make it unique. Disadvantages: redundant storage in the database, reduced performance on comment insert, have to generate a unique string. Session - Add the same hidden field with a value generated in a similar matter. When the user submits the form, save the value in the session if it's not there already. If it is, it's a double submission. Disadvantages: you still need to generate the unique token. Browser - (1) Add some javascript to disable the submit button once it's clicked. (2) have an hidden field that starts with the value 0 and is changed to 1 when the user clicks the submit button. If the user clicks the button again, you check whether the value is 1 and abort if it is. Advantages: no unique string. Disadvantages: requires javascript to be enabled; you might require the string anyway to implement stateful web conversations.
