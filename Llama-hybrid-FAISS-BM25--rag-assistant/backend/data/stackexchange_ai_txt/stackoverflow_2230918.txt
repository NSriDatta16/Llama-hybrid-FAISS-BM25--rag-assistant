Java has a culture of encouraging long names, perhaps because the IDEs come with good autocompletion. This site says that the longest class name in the JRE is InternalFrameInternalFrameTitlePaneInternalFrameTitlePaneMaximizeButtonWindowNotFocusedState which is 92 chars long. As for longest method name I have found this one supportsDataDefinitionAndDataManipulationTransactions , which is 52 characters.
