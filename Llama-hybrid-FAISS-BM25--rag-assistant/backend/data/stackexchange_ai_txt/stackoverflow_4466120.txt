I'd highly recommend jqueryui. Demos here: http://jqueryui.com/demos/ . Note the link to their Selectable and Draggable objects. Additionally, from a quick scan of your problems, it looks like a more specific solution would be the Sortable, which I love. Here's the two-list sortable with list interminglings: http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/#connect-lists Update: You also state that you need to leave the containing div and such. Here is the specific page on boundaries for draggable: http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/#constrain-movement . And in general, note the links to different examples on the right sidebar for each of the jQueryUI features. They represent everything that is available out of the box. If you need to go above and beyond, please send your implementation to the jqueryUI folks. Who knows, it might become the next feature of the next version of jqueryUI.
