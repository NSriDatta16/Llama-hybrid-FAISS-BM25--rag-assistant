Tips for collaboratively editing a LaTeX document

My default setup is to put the tex source in a subversion repository and insert notes to each other as comments in the source when making changes to other people's content. It all feels pretty sub-optimal, especially when there are subversion conflicts where all it tells you is "these two versions of this huge paragraph are in conflict." I've come up with a few tricks but I'm sure there are much better ideas (or better versions of my ideas) out there. For collaborating on code, see this question: How do you collaborate with other coders in real time? (Some of those answers will apply to collaboration on LaTeX documents as well.)
