gtkmozembed is not available on Windows, although you can use the gecko embedding interface directly. This would require you to write some C++ code. As far as I know, the gtk webkit port is not available on Windows yet, and still appears to be undergoing a lot of change. For an example of a cross-platform gecko embedding solution, check out Miro . Miro is python, and they've written just a couple of C++ classes to embed gecko on Windows, while using gtkmozembed on linux.
