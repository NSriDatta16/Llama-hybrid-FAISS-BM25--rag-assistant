If I understand what you are asking for, you add an @OneToMany relationship between the template and the product, and select your cascade rules, you will be able to delete all associated products for a given template. In your product class, you can add the "deleted" flag as you suggested. This deleted flag would be leveraged by your service/dao layer e.g. you could leverage a getProdcuts(boolean includeDeleted) type concept to determine if you should include the "deleted" records for return. In this fashion you can control what end users see, but still expose full functionality to internal business users.
