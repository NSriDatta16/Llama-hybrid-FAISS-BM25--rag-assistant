Importance for Color in X ray imaging for Detection of Pneumonia

I want to apply Deep learning architectures for detection of Pneumonia on chest X-rays, Should I directly apply CNN on RGB images or I should convert RGB into grayscale image and then apply CNN. Should not transforming RGB to grayscale lead to loss of important information of colours. Please help me in understanding it.
