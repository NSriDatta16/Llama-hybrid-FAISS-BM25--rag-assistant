Suggestions on correlation analysis of different time series

I have a uni project that requires correlation analysis of different time series but I don't have background in the field of statistical analysis. It's a comparison of google trends data with data such as housing prices or population I would really appreciate it if there is any suggestions on the recommended approaches for the analysis of my project. Thank you!
