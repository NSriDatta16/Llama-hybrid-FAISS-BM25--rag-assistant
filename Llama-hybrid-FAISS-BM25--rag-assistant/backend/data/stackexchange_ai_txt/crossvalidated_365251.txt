Typically, one uses Poisson regression when the outcome of interest is a count. If I am reading your model, your outcome of interest is a collection of categories that are coded numerically, and the numbers have no intrinsic meaning. You could model whether the customer made a purchase (use a Logistic Regression), or model the choice of category (multinomial logit).
