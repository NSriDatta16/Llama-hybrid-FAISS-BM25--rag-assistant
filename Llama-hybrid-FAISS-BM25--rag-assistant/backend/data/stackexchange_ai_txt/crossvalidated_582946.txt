In contrast to frank , I think this method is potentially useful. I think we can reasonably disagree here. I am less concerned with what frank sees as a problem: since you already look at multiple models, you are already trying to account for the fact that variable importance is (indeed) only measured within the context of a specific model . What I would be a bit careful about is any correlation between models. If your models are highly correlated (say, different Bayesian models with the same predictors and only small differences in priors), then they will likely output the same predictors as "important" - but this agreement does not mean much. So: if you do this, try to ensure your models are as dissimilar as possible. (In which case the question arises whether the importance percentage measures are still sufficiently comparable.)
