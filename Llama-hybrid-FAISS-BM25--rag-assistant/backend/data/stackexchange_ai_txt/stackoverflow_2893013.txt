I like to have a bare repo cloned somewhere else. It allows me to push without any problem. I will have: a bare repo cloned on my local drive, always accessible, preferably linked to some online synchronization service like DropBox . a cloned repo as a bundle (one file), where I can also push, but located on an USB key (that way I have also a backup which doesn't rely on Internet access) So even for solo development, cloning make sense provided it doesn't involve only your local desktop, but also some external storage.
