a question on multiplicative SMV kernel

I'm new to SVM and would like to use it to solve a problem formulated, for example, as follows: The patterns are four-dimensional vectors $(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4)$, and the kernel is $K(\bf{x_i}, \bf{x_j})=k1([{x_i}_1, {x_i}_2], [{x_j}_1, {x_j}_2]) \times k2([{x_i}_3, {x_i}_4], [{x_j}_3, {x_j}_4)$ In other words, the kernel is the multiplication of two other kernels, each of which takes a pair of sub-patterns as input. I came across libSVM and would like to know if the library is able to solve this kind of problem. Thanks.
