The enumerations should live in the same namespace as the types that use them - don't create namespaces that organize things by how they are designed. Just think - would you create namespaces like this? Comp.Project.Classes Comp.Project.Structs Comp.Project.Interfaces No, because that doesn't mean anything and provides no contextual information about the types that are contained there. Enums are just like any other type - they belong in a namespace that has contextual meaning to the enum itself.
