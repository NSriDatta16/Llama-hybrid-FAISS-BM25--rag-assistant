Firstly you should calculate correlation between your n-dimension data and your label column. That would give you knowledge which column you should consider to add to your model. Sometimes algorithm could not manage well on the multiple dimention and it's good to reduce it (It's called Curse of dimensionality ). The possible tricks to cut number of dimentions : PCA, LDA, t-SNE. You maybe should consider using ensemble algorithms (e.g bagging, boosting) which compute error and they try to reduce it on each iteration.
