WFP DataGrid ItemsSource binding to ObservableCollection doesn't update beyond first setting?

I am binding a WPF application DataGrid to an ObservableCollection via the DataGrid's "ItemSource". Initially the DataGrid does come up with headings and values, however the upgrades made to the ObservableCollection are not reflected? (i.e. when I come back programmatically and increase the "Total" value) The ObservableCollection I am using is below. Any ideas why & how to get the grid to dynamically update/bind correctly? public class SummaryItem { public string ProcessName { get; set; } public long Total { get; set; } public long Average { get; set; } public static SummaryItem ObservableCollectionSearch(ObservableCollection oc, string procName) { foreach (var summaryItem in oc) { if (summaryItem.ProcessName == procName) return summaryItem; } return null; } } EDIT - Or perhaps an add-on question is whether in this case DataGrid isn't the control I should be using to visualize what is effectively an in-memory table? That is the observableCollection of SummaryItem's is effectively the in-memory table.
