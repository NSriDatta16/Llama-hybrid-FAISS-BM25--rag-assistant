There are many different things you could do to this little program. However, the first thing to ask yourself in this situation is: what do you want to learn about next? After all, the purpose of your exercise is to grow as a programmer. Some examples that I'd pursue: Array handling: @JUST MY correct OPINION and @Daniel both offer a way of getting rid of the switch statement and handling this as arrays. Another might be to learn about classes and collections by creating a Card class and working with a collection to store the various cards as well as retrieve them. You could even extend the program to play a simple game like blackjack. There are many things to learn about like moving objects (cards) between collections (player hand, deck, dealer hand). Perhaps you could simulate a shuffle by reorganizing an ordered list. You could add persistance by saving the current "game" to an xml or json file. The above ideas have real world implications and don't require any "graphic" or online interface. What you currently have is pretty good quality code, so kudos. Just pick a new concept and apply it to better yourself.
