Both the common answer and your analogy are wrong. Pooling layers are added after convolution and ReLu layers. These layers gets the feature maps of image that where are the important features are. The problem with these features is the get this specific place of feature in feature map. A minor change in image will reflect a total change in feature maps. to solve this problem you can downsample the feature maps which is done by Pooling layers. Try reading about pooling and its types like max pooling and average pooling. It reduce the feature importance in a feature map by downsampling.
