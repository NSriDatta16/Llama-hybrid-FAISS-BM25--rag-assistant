How do I correctly organize output into columns?

The first thing that comes to my mind is to do a bunch of \t's, but that would cause words to be misaligned if any word is longer than any other word by a few characters. For example, I would like to have something like: Name Last Name Middle initial Bob Jones M Joe ReallyLongLastName T Instead, by including only "\t"'s in my cout statement I can only manage to get Name Last Name Middle initial Bob Jones M Joe ReallyLongLastName T or Name Last Name Middle initial Bob Jones M Joe ReallyLongLastName T What else would I need to do? EDIT: So I get that I should first count the maximum width of each column I want displayed, and then adding padding spaces accordingly. But how, and with what functions, can I go about doing this? Should I simply count the number of chars in a string and then go from there?
