Update or delete data from Solr index?

We have a php-application, which have a huge Mysql database and search index by Solr (with SolrPhpClient). Before updating our index (via Cron), we deleting all items, which are not in the stock at the moment. And only than we selecting items from Mysql (in stock) and add this data to Solr. I have an idea, that existing way of updating our search index is too expensive for app performance. In fact we reindex all this items (we use some filters in schema for russian word stemming, lower-case and so on...), instead of leaving out-of-stock items in index with flag (inStock=1). In the future, I suppose, we'll have more than 100 000 position (maybe more) in index. So this way of updating would make our index too slow and server load too high. Could you tell me your ideas about this problem from the positions of updating index and selecting data from it? Thank for your attention...
