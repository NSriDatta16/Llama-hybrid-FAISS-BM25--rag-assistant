Instead of diving into LDA directly, I would be rather start with simpler ones like TF-IDF and see whether it can extract keywords from each class/blog. Recently I got into this kind of problem where I need to extract topics out of tweets and I got fruitful results with TF-IDF being a part of my method. I would treat each blog as individual data point rather than merging them, so that documents can be clubbed based on similarity of words obtained and then extracting the topic out of them. At the end you can use views to see the average views each topic has got. Well you got tools like LSA which constructs a matrix based on word counts. This matrix is reduced by SVD which can be computationally time taking on matrices of huge sizes. So before trying any of the bigger methods, do try simpler ones and if the results are unsatisfactory, approach other methods. Hope it helps.
