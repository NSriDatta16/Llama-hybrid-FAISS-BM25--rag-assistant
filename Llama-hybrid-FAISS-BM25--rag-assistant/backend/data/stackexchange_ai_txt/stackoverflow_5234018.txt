There is a note on MSDN Control.ResolveClientUrl method description. The URL returned by this method is relative to the folder containing the source file in which the control is instantiated. Controls that inherit this property, such as UserControl and MasterPage, will return a fully qualified URL relative to the control. So the behavior of master page in your exampe is fully predictable (although this is not a very comfortable to work with). So what are the alternatives? The best one is to set the as a client control (remove runat="server" ); should work like a charm even in a master page: Example In the case if this control should be server side only: you could just build an URL from your code behind by using UriBuilder class: UriBuilder newPath = new UriBuilder(Request.Url); // this will add a #notificationPopup fragment to the current URL newPath.Fragment = "notificationPopup"; hyp1.HRef = newPath.Uri.ToString();
