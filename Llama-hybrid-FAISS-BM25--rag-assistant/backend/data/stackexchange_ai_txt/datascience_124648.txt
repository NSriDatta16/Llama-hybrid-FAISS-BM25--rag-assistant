Understand and compute confidence interval and coefficient of variation for regression model

I would like to better understand the concepts of: coefficient of variation and confidence interval. Trivially taking the definitions from wikipedia: confidence interval (CI) In frequentist statistics, a confidence interval (CI) is a range of estimates for an unknown parameter. A confidence interval is computed at a designated confidence level; the 95% confidence level is most common. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval coefficient of variation In probability theory and statistics, the coefficient of variation (CV), also known as Normalized Root-Mean-Square Deviation (NRMSD), Percent RMS, and relative standard deviation (RSD), is a standardized measure of dispersion of a probability distribution or frequency distribution. It is defined as the ratio of the standard deviation $\sigma$ to the mean $\mu$ , and often expressed as a percentage ("%RSD"). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval But going into more detail and using for example the XGBoost library for a regression problem what are these two values and how are they obtained in practice. EDIT 1 my progress in developing and understanding the problem so far I start from a simpler problem the linear regression on data with Gaussian noise N(0,1) 5 different sample with same trand but different noise always Gaussian N(0,1) Linear regression for each sample Interval coefficient estimated with formulas $\hat{y}_h \pm t_{(1-\alpha/2, n-2)} \times \sqrt{MSE \left(\dfrac{1}{n} + \dfrac{(x_h-\bar{x})^2}{\sum(x_i-\bar{x})^2}\right)}$ Block boostrapping I do not publish the code within the application for brevity but will upload the code to an online github repository as soon as possible For the same reason I removed the code for xgboost
