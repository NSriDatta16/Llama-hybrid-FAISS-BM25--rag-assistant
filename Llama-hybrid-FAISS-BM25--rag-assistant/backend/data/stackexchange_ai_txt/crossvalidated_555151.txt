I would rather use relative scores (as opposed to absolute scores, as you are trying to do). So for your example this would be the mean of $35/60 \approx 0.5833333$ , $15/40 = 0.375$ , $20/20 = 1$ , the mean being $\approx 0.6527778$ . Alternatively, if you want to take into account the effect of the tests, i.e. tests with more points are harder and this should be considered when evaulating this mean, then I would use a weighted average, with the total possible scores as the weights. In this case the weighted mean would be $\approx 0.5833333$ .
