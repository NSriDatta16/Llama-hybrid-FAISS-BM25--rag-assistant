Upgrading from MySQL 4.1 to 5.0 - What kind of performance changes (good or bad) can we expect?

Currently have approximately 2000 simultaneouse connections. We average approximately 425 reads and writes per second. We have a read to write ration of 3:1. All of our tables are myisam. Can we expect better or worse performance when we go from mysql 4.1.22 to 5.0?
