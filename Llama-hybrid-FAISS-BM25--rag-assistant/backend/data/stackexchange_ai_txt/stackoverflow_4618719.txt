Getting JBoss AOP working on my code

I've defined an Aspect class, annotated at class level and again at the method level with a pointcut to hit all public method executions. The method just fires off a log statement and does the standard invocation call. This is wrapped up in a jar renamed as aop, with a META-INF/jboss-aop.xml and dumped in the jboss deploy directory, alongside the application ear. I've got load time weaving set to true in the jboss aop deployer's mbean xml. My method is called on some org.jboss.jms methods when the server starts, but I don't see it fired for anything else. Is there something I need to do to enable it to work with my application/packages? JBoss 4.2.3. Java 5, not using -javaagent. Apologies; I can't post code samples, the code is on a network with no internet or external media access, so this is all from memory.
