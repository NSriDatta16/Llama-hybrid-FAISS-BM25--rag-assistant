In Visual Studio 2005 this is not possible because it simply doesn't know about .Net 3.5. Visual Studio 2008 is the first version which understands .Net 3.5. The best way to make sure you don't use any classes defined in 3.5 is to do the following Don't reference any DLL's from 3.5 (System.Core,System.Xml.Linq,etc ...) Run the FxCop rule which spots for 3.5 violations in 2.0 projects. This was initially added to Visual Studio 2008 but I don't see a reason you couldn't use it in a 2005 project if you installed the latest FxCop Here is a link to a blog article about the FxCop rule I was talking about. http://blogs.msdn.com/kcwalina/archive/2007/10/02/Multi_2D00_TargetingAndFxCop.aspx The article does talk about running it against VS2008. But I don't immediately see a reason it couldn't be used in VS2005. But I don't have an install handy to test it on.
