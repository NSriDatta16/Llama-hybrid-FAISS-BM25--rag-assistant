What is the best way to let users upload pictures to my WPF application

I have a WPF intranet app running in Trusted mode (local only). I would like the users to be able to upload an image and attach it to an article on my newsletters section. I am having trouble deciding where these images will be stored. Please provide me with your opinions. At present I have a few ideas myself; I could have an aspx page that runs parallel to this app, and run this inside a browser(I-frame). This page could then handle the upload and display of the image. I could also, have the users copy directly to a network share. It seems that there should be a more elegant sollution that I am not aware of. Any ideas?
