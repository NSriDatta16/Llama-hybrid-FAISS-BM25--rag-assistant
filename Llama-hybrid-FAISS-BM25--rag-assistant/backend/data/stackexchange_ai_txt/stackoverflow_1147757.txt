There are projects that attempt to integrate graph-drawing with data collection, storage and analysis (such as Cacti ), but if I were doing this I'd roll my own data management code and use an external language/library/program to make pretty graphics. If you're interested in doing that, I'd look at the following: matplotlib - a library for Python that allows you to make pretty graphs. R - a language that has functions for data analysis and drawing pretty. gnuplot - an open source program for plotting data. All of these can generate graphs for you given the data, but none of them take care of storing the data for you. If you want to see some beautiful graphics made with R, check out this web site: R Graph Gallery
