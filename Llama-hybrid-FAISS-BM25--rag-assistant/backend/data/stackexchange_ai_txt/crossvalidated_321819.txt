I made the assumptions before testing for cointegration that, both variable are tested in level form and non-stationary of order 1. And I also assume that there is a constant and a trend. After decomposition I found out that there is a quadratic trend in the series and the remainder has still some irregular behaviour. After differentiating (in purpose to remove the stochastical trend) the mean is still not zero so I may thought that this could implicate that there is constant. As you can see there is a big difference in the time series of price and Goggle Trends since the beginning/mid of the year 2013 for the shorter period (1st picture), where there was no Cointegration detected. It seems that this difference tend to disappear looking to the graph of the longer period (2nd picture), after ca. March/April 2014. Maybe this could explain the difference of cointegarion or like you said, the shorter period was just to short to detect cointegration. In the case of mainstream investors or structural breaks, I don't know any specific events but as you can see the amount of investment increased very strong and thus the price of the bitcoin increased very strong. Regarding the point of technology the only potentially helpful hint is that the cost of mining the next coin increases over time, while the marginal benefit decreases, miners receive less Bitcoins on the margin for each new block added to the chain.
