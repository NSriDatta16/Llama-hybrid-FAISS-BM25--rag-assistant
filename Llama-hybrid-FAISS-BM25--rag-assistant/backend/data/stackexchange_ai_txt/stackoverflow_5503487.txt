Android - failed to open zip archive

I am downloading apk file from web and storing him into Context.getCacheDir(). I am downloading file by HttpURLConnection - I am not asking actually on the code (it is fully working), so I am not posting it here. I successfully initiate download. File is downloaded into cache and then is prompted installation - but system cannot open my APK and writes error of analysis. Hence problem is as follows: 03-31 16:48:43.740: INFO/ActivityManager(59): Start proc com.android.packageinstaller for activity com.android.packageinstaller/.PackageInstallerActivity: pid=620 uid=10026 gids={} 03-31 16:48:44.749: WARN/zipro(620): Unable to open zip '/data/data/com.my.app/cache/myApp.apk': Permission denied 03-31 16:48:44.749: DEBUG/asset(620): failed to open Zip archive '/data/data/com.my.app/cache/myApp.apk' 03-31 16:48:44.930: WARN/PackageParser(620): Unable to read AndroidManifest.xml of /data/data/com.my.app/cache/myApp.apk 03-31 16:48:44.930: WARN/PackageParser(620): java.io.FileNotFoundException: AndroidManifest.xml Problem is - I don't have permission to access programaticaly /cache. Is there any way how to solve it? I don't want to use external storage as a download directory (installation process works when I download file to external storage), cache is great because the file won't be accessible for general user from file manager and that's what I want. Thanks for your thoughts. This problem has been for me unsolvable for over a month now... Edit: Still no solution, I am trying to think that I found 1st thing, that is not possible with Android Edit2: I must have been looking bad - my downloaded apk is present in cache... There is still no permission to allow install from that dir?
