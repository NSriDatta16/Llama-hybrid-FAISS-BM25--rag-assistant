Generating a 3D GUI through CGI

I'm implementing a web application that is written in C++ using CGI. Is it possible to use a 3D drawn GUI that also has animations? Should I just include some kind of mechanism that generates animated gifs and uses an image map ? Is there another, more elegant way of doing this? EDIT: So it sums up to Java or Silverlight or Flash 10. Is Flash 10 common already? If not is Java a better choice since it's more wide spread?
