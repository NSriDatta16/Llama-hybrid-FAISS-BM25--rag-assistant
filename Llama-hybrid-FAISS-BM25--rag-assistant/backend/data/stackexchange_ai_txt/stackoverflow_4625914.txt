I believe that my question is incorrect. This is what I believe is the correct answer: Maven2 always uses http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/ as a fallback when packages are not found in the repositories supplied. So one should supply the jboss repository, https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/groups/public-jboss/ , but it will only contain jboss specific packages. For everything else (javaee packages and so on) the maven2 fallback reposity should be used. I didn't understand that a Maven2 repository was always used as a fallback. So I got confused when I couldn't find the packages I needed in the Jboss repository.
