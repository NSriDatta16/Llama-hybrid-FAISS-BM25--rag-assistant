Showing that log( e^X + e^Y - 1 ) is approximately normal

Problem (not course-related) I believe that if $X$ and $Y$ are iid $N(\mu, \sigma^2)$ , where $\mu>0$ and $\sigma^2$ is not too large compared to $\mu$ , then: $$\log(e^X + e^Y-1) \approx N(\mu^{*}, (\sigma^2)^{*} )$$ for some new mean $\mu^{*}$ and variance $(\sigma^2)^{*}$ . I believe this to be true due to simulations like the following, which hold for various choices of the parameters: X = rnorm(N, mean=1.5, sd=0.8) Y = rnorm(N, mean=1.5, sd=0.8) thing = log( exp(X) + exp(Y) - 1) summary(thing); sd(thing) hist( thing ) I would like to: (1) prove this; (2) estimate $\mu^{*}$ and $(\sigma^2)^{*}$ ; and ideally (3) know how closely the approximation holds. My attempt I tried to find the MGF of $Z \equiv \log(e^X + e^Y-1)$ , hoping it would like somewhat like the MGF of a Normal: $$M_Z(t) \equiv \int_0^{\infty} \int_0^{\infty} \exp \Big\{ t \log \left( e^x + e^y - 1 ) \right) \Big\} f_{X,Y}(x,y) \; dx \; dy $$ $$M_Z(t) \equiv \int_0^{\infty} \int_0^{\infty} \left( e^x + e^y - 1 \right)^t f_{X,Y}(x,y) \; dx \; dy $$ $$M_Z(t) = \int_0^{\infty} f_Y(y) \Bigg[ \int_0^{\infty} \left( e^x + e^y - 1 \right)^t f_{X}(x) \; dx \Bigg] \; dy $$ $$M_Z(t) = \int_0^{\infty} f_Y(y) \; E_X \Big[ \left( e^x + e^y - 1 \right)^t \Big] \; dy $$ $$M_Z(t) = E_Y \Bigg[ E_X \Big[ \left( e^x + e^y - 1 \right)^t \Big] \Bigg] $$ Because the inner expectation was a mess, I approximated it using a second-order Taylor expansion. Then I did the same thing with the outer expectation. I ended up with a gigantic mess that bore no obvious resemblance to the Normal MGF. I would appreciate any suggestions about other ways to prove this.
