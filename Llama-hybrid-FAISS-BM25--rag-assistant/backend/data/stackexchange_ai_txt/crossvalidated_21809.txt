First quick glance at a dataset

Please pardon my ignorance, but... I keep finding myself in a situation, where I'm faced with a bunch of new data I managed to find. This data usually looks something like this: Date Number1 Number2 Category1 Category2 20120125 11 101 Dog Brown 20120126 21 90 Cat Black 20120126 31 134 Cat Brown (...) Usually at first glance I can't really tell if there are any trends here. The correlations between the various columns may not be very significant, but I would be delighted if I didn't have to manually create a plot for every possible combination of columns/categories. Is there a tool out there which would accept a table of data along with information which columns should be treated as numbers, dates and categories and then proceed to plot: correlations between each two numerical columns correlations between each two numerical columns, with separate trend lines for each category each number column as a time series, each number column as a time series, separated by category, etc. In the end this would generate a large number of plots, most of which would show only noise. Ideally, the tool could score the plots by correlation and in the end display a slideshow starting with the highest scoring plots. This would be a very imperfect, but useful first glance at the dataset. So? Is there a tool everyone uses for this and I just don't know about it, or is this something we need to make?
