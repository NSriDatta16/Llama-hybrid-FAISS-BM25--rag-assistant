How to copy all data from a HTML doc and save it to a string using C#

I need to create a data index of HTML pages provided to a service by essentially grabbing all text on them and putting them in a string to go into a storage system. If this were GUI based, I would simply Ctrl+A on the HTML page, copy it, then go to Notepad and Ctrl+V. Simples. If I can do it via good old point n' click, then surely there must be a way to do it programmatically, but I'm struggling to find anything useful. The HTML docs in question are being loaded for rendering currently using the System.Windows.Controls.WebBrowser class, so I wonder if its somehow possible to grab the data from there? I'm going to keep hunting, but any pointers would be very appreciated. Note: We don't want the HTML source code, and would also really rather not have to parse all the source code to get the text unless we absolutely have to.
