Egad. It's highly recommended by just about everyone that classes are contained in a file per class. Lines isn't very relevant directly, but it can be a symptom that you're creating an overly complex god class and need to break the logic up. Unit test driven development forces this when done correctly. edit (noticed the "why?"): from the fact you're asking it should be obvious :) A few (of many reasons): it's very hard to visualise the actual code layout in large files most IDEs are default set-up to show multiple files at a time, but not multiple views of the same file source control over a single file can be a problem: "can you please check in {godfile} so I can work on the project?" fragmenting code into namespaces/packages/branches is a problem
