ASP.NET MVC persistent data and code organization

I'm giving MVC another shot, and I feel like I'm learning freakin' HTML all over again. So, stupid question: At the top of my master page, I've got a partial view (or similar - I'm using the string template view engine and so far I love it) which either displays a small login form (similar to what NewEgg has), or a message like You are signed in as (Name). [Profile] | [Sign out] Unfortunately, I'm having a brain cramp and can't determine the best way to get that data (username, id) into the ViewData collection without explicitly specifying it in every controller method, like public ActionResult Index() { ViewData["IsAuthenticated"] = Session["IsAuthenticated"]; ViewData["user.firstname"] = User.FirstName; return View("login"); } That's pretty annoying to have to replicate all over the place. My next option would be to create a method called PopulateCommonViewData() and just call that from every action method, but that also seems lousy. Am I missing something here?
