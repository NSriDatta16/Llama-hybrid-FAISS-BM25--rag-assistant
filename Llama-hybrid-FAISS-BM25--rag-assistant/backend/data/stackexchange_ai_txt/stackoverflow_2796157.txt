Best practice to calculate the average speed from GPS coordinates

I have here a device which can give me GPS coordinates. The time interval I can define. I want to use it to calculate the average speed during driving or travelling by car. Actually I used a orthodrome formula to calculate the distance between two points and then divided it by the given time interval. By the implementation I followed this term . Unfortunately I could only find a German link, but I think the formula should be understandable in any language ;) Unfortunately, using this formula and a time interval of 1 second gives very unprecise results. The speed while walking is between 1 km/h and 20 km/h. So I wonder if there is a general reference on how to implement distance calculation between two GPS coordinates (I found something similar on SO) and particulary, which is the best time interval to update the GPS coordinates?
