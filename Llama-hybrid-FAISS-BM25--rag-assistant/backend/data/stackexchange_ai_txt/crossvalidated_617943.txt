Which model should I use for determinants of NPLs

I am working on a subject called The determinants of NPLs in a country (NPL = non performing loans). My data is a dynamic panel data of 15 years and i got my data yearly. The dependent variable is npl ratio and i have 8 independent variables. I have run tests on stata that i will mention below The vif test showed no multicollinearity issues Breusch pagan showed heteroscedasticity Autocorrelation showed first order correlation Finally , the Hausman test to whether proceed with fixed or random effects showed a p value of 0,09. My questions are: Should I do any other tests ? And what should I use for my estimations ? Some suggested Arellano bond but doesn't the Hausman test say that I dont have endogeneity problems ? I am really confused and I hope i made my questions clear. Thank you everyone in advance
