If a works, img or press will only ever relate to one artist, then you don't need a many to many, so the way you have it setup in your pseudo-code should suffice. You can check out the inline froms for the admin. You can specify things such as how many inline items to show of each type, etc. class MyModelInline(admin.StackedInline): model = MyModel # whatever other options you need for your inline class MyModelAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin): inlines = [MyModelInline,] Something like that should work for you. Like AlbertoPL said, there's more info in the docs with all the different options and functionality that you'd need.
