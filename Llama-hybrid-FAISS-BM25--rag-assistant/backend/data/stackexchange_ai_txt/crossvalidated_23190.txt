For each fold, a new model should be completely developed on a training set. Then the samples in the separate test should be classified to determine the error rate. The samples in the test set should not be used for any aspect of model development. This includes variable selection, selection of cutpoints, etc. I haven't worked with neural networks before but I assume this advice also holds true for them. If you are doing ten-fold cross-validation, you should make ten different, totally independent models. See this paper by Refaeilzadeh, et al., for an accessible overview: http://leitang.net/papers/ency-cross-validation.pdf
