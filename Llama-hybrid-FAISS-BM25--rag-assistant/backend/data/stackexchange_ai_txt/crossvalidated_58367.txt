It is helpful to see the scatter plot and full display of results. But in my view there is really no surprise here once you look at all you have shown. Multiple R-squared: 0.007986 does not to me imply a "really good model". (There could be a long debate on the limitations of that measure, but I don't think any of it weakens what is going on in your case.) Your model is in effect y = constant + extremely slight trend with x. That constant is, roughly, the mean of y. The residuals are all small, but so are all the values of y. P-values that are very small are just side-effects of a very big sample size. Looking at your scatter plots does underline that the underlying situations appear different, but fitting straight lines is not, in my view, going to illuminate either dataset. [LATER] The very small but supposedly significant slope in the first case could be a side-effect of the small cluster of points in the bottom right of your plot. They are exerting just enough leverage to make a difference, I guess. Another detail is that the intercept in the first case is significantly different from 0 at 1.795e-02. But that intercept estimate is, as usual, for x = 0, which is way outside the range of your x variable.
