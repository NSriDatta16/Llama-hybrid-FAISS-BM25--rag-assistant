The meaning of margin of error in a real life example?

I guess I almost understand the concept of confidence intervals and confidence levels with two real life examples. I still have some difficulties to understand "margin of error". Image that, in a survey, respondents were asked to indicate their own well being on a scale from 0 to 10, where 10 represents "the best possible life for you" and 0 the worst. The results stated that the confidence interval was between 4.88 and 5.26 with a confidence level of 95% +/-3, where +/-3 is the "margin of error". For the European data, one can say with 95% confidence that the true population for well-being among those without TVs is between 4.88 and 5.26. For those with TVs the 95% confidence interval for well-being is much narrower -- between 5.78 and 5.82 -- because of the larger sample size. In addition to sampling error, question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls. - (from ref2 below.) Without the "margin of error", the result means the average well being rating for people is 95% of the times expected to fall within 4.88 and 5.26". with the margin of error of +/-3, what does that mean? the example are adapted from ref and ref2 .
