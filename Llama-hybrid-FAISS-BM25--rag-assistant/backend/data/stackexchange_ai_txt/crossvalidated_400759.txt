This discussion suggests that binary cross entropy is used in VAE case mainly for better optimization behavior. Another reason it works well is that MNIST dataset roughly follows multivariate Bernoulli distribution - the pixel values are close to either zero or one and binarization does not change it much. For more in-depth explanation of this, see Using a Bernoulli VAE on real-valued observations .
