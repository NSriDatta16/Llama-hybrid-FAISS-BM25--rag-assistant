First time unit testing (in silverlight)

Hi I've searched some other posts, but most of them assumed that people knew what they were doing in their unit testing, and frankly I don't. I see the idea behind unit testing, and I'm coding an silverlight application much in the blind right now, and I'd like to write some unit tests to kind of be sure I'm on the right path. I'd like to be able to use the SL4 vs 2010 silverlight unit test project template, to keep it simple and not use external tools. So what I need an answer for are questions like: what are the methods of unit testing? what are the differences between unit tests, and automated unit tests? How do I meaningfully unit test in silverlight? What should I be aware of while unit testing (in silverlight) ? Also should I implement some kind of IRepository pattern in my silverlight app to make unit testing easier? EDIT: I will be posting useful links here as I explore this along the way: Implementing MVVM in silverlight - http://community.infragistics.com/pixel8/media/p/91949.aspx Mix10 MVVM talk - http://live.visitmix.com/MIX10/Sessions/EX14 Unit testing Ria apps - Link PK's great resource: http://dotenetscribbles.blogspot.com/2009/12/unit-testing-dependency-injection-and.html
