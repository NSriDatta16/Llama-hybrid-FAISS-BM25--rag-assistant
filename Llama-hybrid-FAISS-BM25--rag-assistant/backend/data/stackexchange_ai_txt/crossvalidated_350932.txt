There are a few problems in the way you are framing your question, but it sounds like what you are asking about is predicted probabilities of outcomes under different models . You should be careful to distinguish between the true probability of an outcome, versus an estimate of this probability based on your model. (It is better to denote the latter using hats on your estimated quantities.) You should also make sure that you are not making "predictions" of data that is actually observed. In your case you refer to "predictions" relating to the values $T_1, T_2, T_3$, but these are in your observed data. The estimated probabilities from your models are: $$\hat{p}_{\mathcal{B},j} = \bar{t} = 0.6 \quad \quad \quad \quad \hat{p}_{\mathcal{R},j} = \text{logistic}(\hat{\theta} x_j) = \frac{\exp(0.28 x_j)}{1 + \exp(0.28 x_j)}.$$ Let $\mathcal{E} = \{ T_{n+1} = 1, T_{n+2} = 1, T_{n+3} = 1 \}$ be the predictive event of interest (correcting to refer to the first three unobserved data points). The estimated probabilities of this event are: $$\begin{equation} \begin{aligned} \hat{\mathbb{P}}( \mathcal{E} | \mathcal{M_B}) &= 0.6^3 = 0.216, \\[8pt] \hat{\mathbb{P}}( \mathcal{E} | \mathcal{M_R}) &= \frac{\exp(0.28 x_{n+1})}{1 + \exp(0.28 x_{n+1})} \cdot \frac{\exp(0.28 x_{n+2})}{1 + \exp(0.28 x_{n+2})} \cdot \frac{\exp(0.28 x_{n+3})}{1 + \exp(0.28 x_{n+3})}. \end{aligned} \end{equation}$$ Notice that the first model predicts a fixed probability of each outcome and so the prediction for the event of interest does not depend on the explanatory variables for the predicted outcomes. The second model uses logistic regression and so the estimated probability of the event of interest does depend on the explanatory variables. If you add explanatory variables for the predicted values you can calculate the latter, and then it is trivial to figure out the difference in the estimated probabilities under the two models.
