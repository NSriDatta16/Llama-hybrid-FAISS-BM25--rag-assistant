Regarding your consideration of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), it's important to note that LSTM is primarily used for sequential data prediction tasks rather than clustering. LSTM is suitable when you want to predict future trajectories or classify sequences based on their temporal dependencies. You could try some of these too: K-Means Clustering: K-Means is a popular clustering algorithm that groups data points into a specified number of clusters. It calculates the distance between data points and cluster centroids to assign them to the nearest cluster. DBSCAN: Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) is another clustering algorithm that groups data points based on their density. It identifies dense regions separated by sparser areas. DBSCAN can be useful if your data has varying densities or if you want to identify outliers or noise in the trajectories. Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM): GMM is a probabilistic model that represents the data distribution as a combination of Gaussian distributions. It can capture complex patterns in your trajectory data and assign data points to different clusters based on the probabilities of belonging to each Gaussian component. Hierarchical Clustering: Hierarchical clustering builds a tree-like structure of clusters, also known as a dendrogram. It enables you to identify both individual clusters and nested subclusters within your trajectory data. Agglomerative clustering is a common approach in hierarchical clustering, where each data point starts as its own cluster and is iteratively merged based on distance or similarity measures. Self-Organizing Maps (SOM): SOM is an unsupervised learning algorithm that uses a neural network to create a low-dimensional representation of your trajectory data. It can help visualize and cluster the trajectories based on their similarities.
