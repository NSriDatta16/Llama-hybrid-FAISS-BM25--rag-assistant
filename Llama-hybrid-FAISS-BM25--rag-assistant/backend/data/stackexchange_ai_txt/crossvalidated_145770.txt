As mentioned by Andre5 the term is called 'feature engineering', and is mostly outside machine learning. I personally find the term misleading since it is all that is known about the problem (namely science)! Nevertheless one can come up with general guidelines by considering how similarity is represented In the algorithm Consider a Neural network, the fundamental operation is a dot product (cosine similarity).. So you need to ensure that what inputs seem similar to you are similar by dot product. So your example of movement doesn't seem like a good representation.. A better one would be left/right as one dimension and fwd/back as the other. Similarly your day of the year is bad because every day is orthogonal (not similar) to any other day. Instead you want your input to represent dimensions along which days are similar (and relevant to your problem) eg is it a shopping day/work day/hot cold day etc. Hierarchical representations where you add the the higher level category (eg week) can be helpful together with l2 regularisation (weight decay).. The idea being that you learn a simple model based on the higher level feature when you have a few instances per week, but as you get more examples you develop a more detailed model of daily effects
