Why not store XML file in the resource? This will allow you to have benefits of both: simple packaging, quick access, LINQ, and localization. However, I would not rule out SQL Azure, if you already have a database hosted there. Access to it is quick and you will not be paying any extra charges (provided you already have database deployed), no matter how often you connect to it. ATS is slightly slower (albeit way more scalable) but it'll cost you a fraction of a penny anytime you go to ATS for pretty much anything. Overall, there is a dozen ways to do this and all of them will be OK. If performance is your number one concern, embedding it into the application via resource is likely to be the best approach. If flexibility & deployment are your biggest concerns, SQL Azure is likely the best approach.
