Follow up: How do get some of the object from a list without Linq?

I have a question about this question . I posted a reply there but since it's been marked as answered, I don't think I'll get a response to my post there. I am running C# framework 2.0 and I would like to get some of the data from a list? The list is a List<>. How can I do that without looping and doing comparaison manually on each element of the List<>? It really looks like the answers are just a more elegant ways of comparing every element of the List. Given that the list is not guaranteed to be sorted prior to the search, do any of the methods provided in the original post ensure that they are looking at a smaller subset of the original list? EDIT: One thing to note is that I'm not trying to do anything here. I just want to know if the solutions provided in another question truly do what the OP asked, with regards to looping through the whole list. In general, to search an unsorted list (at least it's not required given the data structure), you will have to search the entire list. However, do any of the solutions on the other thread have an underlying optimization to prevent searching the entire list? EDIT: I really didn't get any answers that were all that helpful but I will give credit to the answer that at least confirmed my common sense belief. If I notice a new answer that is better, I will change my vote.
