principal component analysis on reduced data

I have the following experience about PCA and I don't understand why. I first do PCA on the original dataset, say, a collection of three-dimensional vectors $(x_1,x_2,x_3)$ . The first principal component explains about 99% variance, indicating the dimension of the original dataset is about one. I then drop one dimension (say $x_3$ ) from the dataset and do PCA (on reduced data $(x_1,x_2)$ ). This time the first principal component explains only 80% variance.
