Perceptron is an early type of a neural network for binary classification without hidden layers. It is a model of the form $$ y=\sigma(\mathbf w^T \mathbf x) $$ where $\sigma$ is the Heaviside step function . It can be trained using the perceptron algorithm. You could say that perceptron is a neural network with a single neuron. Image from https://towardsdatascience.com/what-the-hell-is-perceptron-626217814f53
