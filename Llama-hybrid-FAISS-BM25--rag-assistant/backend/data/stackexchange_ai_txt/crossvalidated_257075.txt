Logistic regression would be an easy way of doing this. With 60'000 events out of 65'000'000 measurements, you have abundant data for the 300 predictors. However, datasets this large always make me wonder whether all units (the rows) are independent. Without more details about your data I dare not make assumptions about this. Additionally, if you are interested in seeing which of your variables has the largest effect size, you might want to standardize the predictor variables and compare the effect per standard deviation.
