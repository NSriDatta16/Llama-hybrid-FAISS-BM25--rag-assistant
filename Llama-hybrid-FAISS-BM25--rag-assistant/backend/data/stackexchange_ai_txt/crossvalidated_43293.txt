When you have time series data .e.g.monthly sales and you wish to model them in order to make a forecast and detect unusual activity one needs to know the following. Model selection is done by identifying the underlying model by examinining it's autocorrelative structure. In some cases the data might be independent over time then one could use a simple regression model with time as a predictor. In most cases there is auto-dependence and then one has to identify an appropriate model. Assuming any model is always very dangerous. Early approaches assumed different types of models for pedagogical reasons. The correct approach is to identify an appropriate ARIMA model that incorporates sufficient autoregressive memory and include any level shifts, local time trends, seasonal pulses necessary to adequately describe the data. Pursue the web for "automatic arima softare" to help you. Try the different available solutions on your data and measure forecast accuracy from a number of origins. Most software vendors have free trial versions.
