In my view, the differences are more cultural than methodological. All three share a common mathematical foundation in probability theory, optimization, and linear algebra. I disagree that any one of these is more "rigorous" than any other. Each field has its PhD's who do mind-bendingly rigorous and difficult research. Each also has practitioners who utilize methods and heuristics to get the job done. As far as "analytics" there has been a concerted effort by INFORMS (the OR/MS society of the USA) to make the definition of "Analytics" more rigorous, to the point of developing a certification process (Certified Analytics Professional). The material for the exam covers far more than just statistics, machine learning, or operations research.
