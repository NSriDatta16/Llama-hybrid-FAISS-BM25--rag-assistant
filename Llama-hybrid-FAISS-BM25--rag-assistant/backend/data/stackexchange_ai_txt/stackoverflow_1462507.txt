Is the build agent down? Meaning the server that is actually running the build is offline or shutdown? If the build agent is unreachable you will get the behavior you are experiencing. Check if its down by going into team explorer then right clicking on builds and then left clicking on manage build agents from the context menu. I am assuming you are dealing with TFS 2008.
