Bart van Delfts answer pointed me in the right direction with this one so cheers for the hint! I was having this issue as well using [ javax.xml.transform.Transformer ] Whenever I tried to parse a snippet of formatted html, in my case:- the final output from the Node was being brought into my jsp as:- which was obviously screwing up any following code, owing to it being seen as more of the contents of the textarea element. setting t.setOutputProperty(javax.xml.transform.OutputKeys.METHOD, "html"); seems to have provided the self closing behaviour I expected. This property defaults to "xml" from my own testing, so obviously an xml tag with no nodes beneath it is perfectly happy as self closing. Hope this helps anyway.
