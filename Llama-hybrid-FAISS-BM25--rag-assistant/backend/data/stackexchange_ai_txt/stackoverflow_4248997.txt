What you are looking for is an AppleScript open handler . Here's a simple example that handles multiple files by opening a new outgoing email for each. Lots of variations are possible: on open what tell application "Mail" repeat with f in what set theAttachment to f set theMessage to make new outgoing message with properties {visible:true, subject:"My Subject", content:"My Body"} tell content of theMessage make new attachment with properties {file name:theAttachment} at after last paragraph end tell tell theMessage make new to recipient at end of to recipients with properties {name:"Some One", address:"someone@somewhere"} end tell end repeat end tell end open There is a lot more detail about handlers in Matt Neuberg's book AppleScript: The Definitive Guide .
