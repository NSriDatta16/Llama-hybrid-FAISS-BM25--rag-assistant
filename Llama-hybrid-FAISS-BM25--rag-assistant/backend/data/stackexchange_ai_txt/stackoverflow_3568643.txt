You should add some more details to get better answers. What are you use cases, do you need ACID, what is your storage you are writing to, etc. What is your OS, do you only write fixed size records. Just saying like I will do random access and this is my write rate is something is much too unspecific. You are writing at 240 kb/s, which are 20 GB/day. If you have just fixed size records, only append data and use Linux, then a plain file is great. Perhaps think about using some fsync calls, if your storage is fast enough.
