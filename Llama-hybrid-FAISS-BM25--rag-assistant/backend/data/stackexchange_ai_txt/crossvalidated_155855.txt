Residual diagnostics after a logistic regression model

I wonder about how the residuals of a logistic regression model should be distributed. Of course, running a linear regression model and by assuming the Normal distribution assumption, the residuals you predicted from that kind of model should be distributed as a Normal distribution with mean $\mu$ $=$ $0$ and standard deviation $\sigma$ $=$ $1$; But, what about if you run another kind of regression, with different distribution assumption as, for instance, the logistic one? Let's suppose one runs a logistic regression model, what distribution the residuals should have? And, moreover, what is the test I should run to check for the distribution assumption validity? Any hint, reference or whatever will be appreciated.
