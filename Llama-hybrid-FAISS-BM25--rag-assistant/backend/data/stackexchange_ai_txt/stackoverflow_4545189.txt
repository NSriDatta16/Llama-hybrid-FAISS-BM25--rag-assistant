I figure it out .. The problem appears when i drag and drop entity from data source as "Details" control .. the problem was that there is no connection between the context and the new item in binding source ( which created by clicking the "Add" button in the navigator ) .. so we have to make this connection manually by getting the new entity and added it to the context every time we add new item . Finally we should end the edit mode in the binding source and accept all changes after saving changes in the context ( accepting changes will allow us to update the new item after saving it ) .. and here is the code : private void bindingNavigatorAddNewItem_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) { MyEntity newEnt = new MyEntity(); newEnt = (MyEntity)MyEntityBindingSource.Current; ctx.AddToAuthors(newEnt); } private void MyEntityBindingNavigatorSaveItem_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) { try { MyEntityBindingSource.EndEdit(); ctx.SaveChanges(); ctx.AcceptAllChanges(); } catch (Exception ex) { MessageBox.Show(ex.Message); } } I hope this was helpful..
