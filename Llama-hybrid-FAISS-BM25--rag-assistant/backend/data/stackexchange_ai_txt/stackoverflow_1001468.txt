You can rewrite it like this: var opportunites = from opp in oppDC.Opportunities join org in oppDC.Organizations on opp.OrganizationID equals org.OrgnizationID select new { opp.OpportunityID, opp.Title, opp.PostedBy, opp.Address1, opp.CreatedDate, org.OrganizationName }; if(condition) { opportunites = opportunites.Where(opp => opp.Title.StartsWith(title)); } EDIT: To answer your question in the comments, yes, you can keep appending to the original Queryable. Remember, this is all lazily executed, so at this point all it's doing it building up the IQueryable so you can keep chaining them together as needed: if(!String.IsNullOrEmpty(title)) { opportunites = opportunites.Where(.....); } if(!String.IsNullOrEmpty(name)) { opportunites = opportunites.Where(.....); }
