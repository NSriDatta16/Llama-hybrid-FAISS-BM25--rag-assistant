Hide curly braces in C#

After getting back into Python, I'm starting to notice and be annoyed more and more by my C# coding style requiring braces everywhere if (...) { return ...; } else { return ...; } preferring the (subjective) much cleaner looking python counter-part if ...: return ... else return ... is there any way I can go about hiding these braces (as they do take up about 30% of my coding screen on average and just look ugly!)
