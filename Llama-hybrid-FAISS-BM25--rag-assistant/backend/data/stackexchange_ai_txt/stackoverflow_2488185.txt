Pypcap for mac on python 2.6?

How do you end up running pypcap for python 2.6 on a mac? It seems that there hasn't been any new releases since 2.5 or am I just looking in the wrong places? I seem to be unable to install the 2.5 binary with the following error: You cannot install pcap 1.1 on this volume. pcap requires System Python 2.5 to install.
