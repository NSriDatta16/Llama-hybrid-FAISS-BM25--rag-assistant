Can I train a CNN to detect the number of objects without localizing them first?

So I was trying to search but couldn't find any answers. I was wondering if it possible to train a model to detect the number of items of interest in a photo without having bounding boxes or dots to locate the objects in the training set. For example say I wanted to count something simple like street poles in a photo, would it be possible with just the photos in the training set and the number of poles as the target only. So no bounding boxes or points labeled for the training data targets.
