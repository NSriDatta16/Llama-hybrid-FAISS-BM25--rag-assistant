Multivariate logistic regression is like simple logistic regression but with multiple predictors. Logistic regression is similar to linear regression but you can use it when your response variable is binary. This is common in medical research because with multiple logistic regression you can adjust for confounders. For example you may be interested in predicting whether or not someone may develop a disease based on the exposure to some substance. In that case you may use a simple logistic regression model but it may be the case that the disease has no relation with the substance but with age. In that case you can include in the model both: substance exposure and age so you can analyze if age is a confunder, i.e., the disease may be correlated with age but not with the substance. You can also use multiple logistic regression to increase your prediction power by adding more predictors instead of just using one.
