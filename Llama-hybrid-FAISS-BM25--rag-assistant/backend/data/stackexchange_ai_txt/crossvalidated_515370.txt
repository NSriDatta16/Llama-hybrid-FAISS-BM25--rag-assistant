Non stationarity and forecasting

Let's assume we have estimated a linear regression model on a dataset from 2000 to 2017. The data were stationary. What happens if the data are no longer stationary in the next years? Do the forecasts stop being valid and should not be taken into account? What should a model developer do in this case? And a related question: regressing non stationary time series automatically leads to spurious regressions?
