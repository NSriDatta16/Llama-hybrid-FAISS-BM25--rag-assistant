Classifying dataset with few positive results, how to handle false positive paradox?

I'm working on a classification task with data that have only 2% of positive results and it's hard to get high true positive result with low false positive. Maybe you know how to handle such data, or any tips and tricks? I tried Boosted Tree Forest, Logistic Regression, Random Forest and some others.
