Should I keep or eliminate an insignificant confounding variable?

Let's say that I am fitting a logistic regression model for a binary outcome and I have two covariates: $x_1$ and $x_2$ (both quantitative). I am confused as to what the correct course of action would be if $x_1$ is statistically insignificant, but upon deleting $x_1$ the estimate of $x_2$ changes dramatically. Obviously, if the estimate of $x_2$ changes dramatically, then it is due to the fact that $x_1$ and $x_2$ are correlated, but my question is this: Should I keep $x_1$ in the model since it is a confounder of $x_2$ or should I delete $x_1$ because it is insignificant?
