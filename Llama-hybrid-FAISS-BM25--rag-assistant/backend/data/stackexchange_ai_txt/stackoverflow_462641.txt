How can I select the Next/Previous TreeViewItem in a TreeView?

I have First/Last/Previous/Next buttons that change the selected child node of a TreeViewItem. Setting the First and Last node as selected is not a problem. For example, to select the last child node: TreeViewItem selectedItem = (myTreeView.SelectedItem as TreeViewItem); TreeViewItem ParentItem = (selectedItem.Parent as TreeViewItem); (ParentItem.Items[ParentItem.Items.Count - 1] as TreeViewItem).IsSelected = true; What would be the easiest/most elegant way to set the Previous/Next item as being selected? Thanks!
