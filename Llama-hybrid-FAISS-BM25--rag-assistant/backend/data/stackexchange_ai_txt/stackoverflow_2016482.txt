You could use Windows Forms or Windows Presentation Foundation to develop your GUI; although, Windows Forms might feel more familiar to you. If you search on Google for Windows Forms tutorial , you will get many options for getting started. If you need to use .NET 2.0, you will be limited to Win Forms. WPF requires .NET 3.5. I would suggest downloading Microsoft's free Visual Studio Express Edition to use for developemnt. it includes an excellent drag-and-drop GUI design tool.
