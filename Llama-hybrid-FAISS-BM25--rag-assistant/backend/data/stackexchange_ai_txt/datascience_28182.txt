LSTM with auxiliary data achieves abismal results

I have a fairly simple LSTM models that achieves ok results. I wanted to add auxiliary data as appeared in the keras docs . I added only one binary variable. I expected this model to be at least as good, assuming that if it has no information its weights will go to zero. In reality, the model fails and just predicts zeros for my entire test set. The second model: More specifically, I'm predicting a time series of human-behaviour, and my binary feature tags whether the time point is in a weekend. I'd expect it capture some of the weekend (black background) reduction, and if not, at least not to ruin the model completely.
