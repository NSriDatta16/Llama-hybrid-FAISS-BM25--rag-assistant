Number of model DoF in XGBoost regressor?

I'm using XGBoost (python) to solve a regression problem. I instantiate the model like so: import xgboost mod = xgboost.XGBRFRegressor() I would like to extract the number of model degrees of freedom from this, in order to compare performance with simpler models. I am aware that there are alternate approaches, such as cross validation, but I'm curious as to whether an xgboost model has a clearly defined DoF, and if that's possible to obtain. I've looked at the docs but cannot find any mention of model DoF.
