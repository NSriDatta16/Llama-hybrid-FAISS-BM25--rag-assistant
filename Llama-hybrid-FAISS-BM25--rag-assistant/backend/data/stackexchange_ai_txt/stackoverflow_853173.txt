Existing T4 database helpers for DB schema retrieval

Do you know any T4 template which would provide me with basic DB schema methods and properties ( GetTables , GetColumns , MapSqlTypesToClr , etc.)? I know it's easy to retrieve that information, but there are a lot of extra helper functions around it, so why reinvent the wheel?
