The pattern matching rules used by IsolatedStorageFile.GetFileNames() is the same as that used in System.IO.Path . They both use the Win32 API FindFirstFile / FindNextFile Functions, namely: The directory or path, and the file name, which can include wildcard characters, for example, an asterisk (*) or a question mark (?). This parameter should not be NULL, an invalid string (for example, an empty string or a string that is missing the terminating null character), or end in a trailing backslash (). If the string ends with a wildcard, period (.), or directory name, the user must have access permissions to the root and all subdirectories on the path. In the ANSI version of this function, the name is limited to MAX_PATH characters. To extend this limit to 32,767 widecharacters, call the Unicode version of the function and prepend "\?\" to the path. For more information, see Naming a File .
