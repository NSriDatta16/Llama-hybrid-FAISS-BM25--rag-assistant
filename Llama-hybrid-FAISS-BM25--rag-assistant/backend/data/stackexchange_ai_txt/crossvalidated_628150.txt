Modeling time series of sinusoid with inclining amplitude plus white noise

I'm trying to get a better understanding of how to approach modeling time series data. I have made a synthetic dataset that is the sum of a sinusoid whose amplitude increase with time plus white noise. I'm considering each timestep as hourly so the sequence has a period of 12 hours. What would be the procedure if I wanted to fit as SARIMA model for this (assuming no knowledge of the underlying function that generated it)? Or is some other model class better suited? How should I approach this if the noise exhibits heteroskedasticity (say increasing variance with time)? Code from statsmodels.tsa.statespace.sarimax import SARIMAX from statsmodels.tsa.seasonal import seasonal_decompose from statsmodels.graphics.tsaplots import plot_acf, plot_pacf from statsmodels.tsa.stattools import kpss, adfuller import numpy as np import pandas as pd result = [] for i in range(500,5000): result.append(np.sin(np.pi/6 *(i -6)) * i /1000 + np.random.normal(scale=1)) result = np.array(result) The p-values for the kpss and adfuller test outputs print(kpss(result )[1]) print(adfuller(result)[1]) 0.036179219434385186 1.1328771447754276e-25 The autocorrelatoin and partial autocorrelation plots are below:
