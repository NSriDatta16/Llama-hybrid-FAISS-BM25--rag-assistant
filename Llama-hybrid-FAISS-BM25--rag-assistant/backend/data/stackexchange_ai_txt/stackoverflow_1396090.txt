As far as "drag and drop" is concerned for file uploads, this cannot be achieved with (today's) standard browser technology. You must use a plug-in (like Flash, ActiveX, etc.) to achieve that scenario and overcome the limits of the browser. [ SIDE NOTE: Silverlight offers no help here (yet) either. It's security model does not allow dragging files from the desktop "in to" the plug-in for operations like file upload.] For multi-file uploads, you have a couple of solutions: For true, "select multiple files at once" (Shift/Ctl + click), you still must use a plug-in, like Silverlight or Flash. As an example, Telerik makes RadUpload for Silverlight that can be used in an ASP.NET website to enable "true" multi-file upload experiences: Demo of RadUpload for SL in ASP.NET If you don't want a plug-in, you're limited by browser upload standards again to selecting one file at a time. You can, of course, select many files and then upload them together, but you have to make the selections one file at a time. For this type of scenario, there are controls like the RadUpload for ASP.NET AJAX that pretty much enable you to do as much as you can with browser standards: Demo of RadUpload for ASP.NET AJAX Due to security, browsers do have pretty limited support for rich uploading experiences. It's probably one of the most common browser "limits" that plug-ins like Flash and Silverlight help overcome. Hope that background helps.
