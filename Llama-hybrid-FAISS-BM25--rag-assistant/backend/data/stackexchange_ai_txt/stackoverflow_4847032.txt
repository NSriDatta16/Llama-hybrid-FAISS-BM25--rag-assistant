I would approach your question in the following way. The task is to organise a keyboard in such way as to minimise key strokes and hand movement for given text. Steps toward a possible solution. Make a program that: Takes a text file with source code. (The bigger the better and from various sources!) Counts the frequency of use of each symbol (its presence in the text). (optional) Based on step 2: The program generates key stroke count for each symbol plus how far the hand has to go from central position. As a result you will have a measure how effective your keyboard layout is. Now manually or by writing a program Redefine your layout in the following way. Put most frequently used symbol in a central position closer to your strong hand. The second symbol goes to your weak hand in central position. The third symbol goes back to your strong hand...and so on. Then you gradually move from central position of the hands into more "distant" areas of the keyboard. When all keyboard is full then you continue the process of assigning keys but this time with Shift key pressed. The other difference would be that you do not rotate strong and weak hand for each symbol when the Shift is down. With shift key down first you would fill in central positions on the keyboard and then move to more distant positions. When you do all that perform step 3 again for the new layout to see how the layout was improved. You may have to carry your keyboard with you at all times. On the bright side nobody will touch your computer. It will make you look like a Pro. Finally, don't forget to share your findings.
