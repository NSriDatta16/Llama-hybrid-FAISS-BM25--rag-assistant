First thing, have a gander at Steve Sanderson's Pro ASP.Net MVC book. The section on actionfilters and the controller lifecycle is important to you, mostly b/c there's some special treatment of Authorize filters that 'regular' actionfilters don't get. Second, you should be able to do this: filterContext.Result = new RedirectToRouteResult(/*params*/); and get the effect you want.
