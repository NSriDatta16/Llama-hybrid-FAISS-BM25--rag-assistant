Origin of discouraged perl idioms: &x(...) and sub x($$) { ... }

In my perl code I've previously used the following two styles of writing which I've later found are being discouraged in modern perl: # Style #1: Using & before calling a user-defined subroutine &name_of_subroutine($something, $something_else); # Style #2: Using ($$) to show the number of arguments in a user-defined sub sub name_of_subroutine($$) { # the body of a subroutine taking two arguments. } Since learning that those styles are not recommended I've simply stopped using them. However, out of curiosity I'd like to know the following: What is the origin of those two styles of writing? (I'm sure I've not dreamt up the styles myself.) Why are those two styles of writing discouraged in modern perl? Have the styles been considered best practice at some point in time?
