Not only is the OLS estimator consistent in the presence of a deterministic trend, it is, as they say, superconsistent , because it converges to the true value of the coefficient on the linear trend faster then the usual $O(T^{-1/2})$ rate -at $O(T^{-3/2})$. The estimator for the constant term converges at the usual rate, which makes a bit more complicated the derivation of the vector function that has an asymptotic distribution. Consider $y_t = \beta t + u_t$ The OLS estimator will be $$\hat \beta = \frac {\sum_{t=1}^Tty_t}{\sum_{t=1}^Tt^2}= \beta +\frac {\sum_{t=1}^Ttu_t}{\sum_{t=1}^Tt^2}$$ One way to see the convergence is to consider $$\operatorname {Var}(\hat \beta) = \sigma^2_u\frac {\sum_{t=1}^Tt^2}{\left(\sum_{t=1}^Tt^2\right)^2} = \sigma^2_u\frac {1}{\sum_{t=1}^Tt^2}$$ $$\Rightarrow \operatorname {Var}(\hat \beta) = \frac {\sigma^2_u}{T(T+1)(2T+1)/6}$$ This obviously goes to zero -and fast . So the variance of the estimator goes to zero (and it is also unbiased), which are sufficient conditions for consistency. The result does not change if we add regressors in the specification -again we will have different rates of convergence of the estimators of the stationary regressor coefficients. It will require of course more sophisticated treatment. Hamilton's "Time Series Analysis", ch. 16 contains a more elaborate discussion, examining also the asymptotic distribution of the estimator. In short, from the two assumptions that you stated in your question, assumption 1) is a "convenient overkill", as regards consistency in the presence of a deterministic trend, and it is mainly needed for stochastic regressors. Note that it is critical for these results that we are talking about a deterministic trend.
