how do i get save, edit, delete, and search ,MIDLET application?

I am a student. I need to make a application. I have built the GUI. Now I need to know how to do it? I have heard about sql server compact, but does it work together with j2me? If not, something to solve the problem? It will be better if you can pass me a example. If you couldn't, not worry, I just to need to know a database program for mobile (with j2me). Could it be possible without use a database program? For example, using a text file? Or any other storage mechanism. Appreciate any help.
