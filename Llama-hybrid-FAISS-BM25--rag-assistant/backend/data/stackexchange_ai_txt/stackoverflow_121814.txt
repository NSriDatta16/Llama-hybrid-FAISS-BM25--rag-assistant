As someone said before, if you mock everything to isolate more granular than the class you are testing, you give up enforcing cohesion in you code that is under test. Keep in mind that mocking has a fundamental advantage, behavior verification. This is something that stubs don't provide and is the other reason that makes the test more brittle (but can improve code coverage).
