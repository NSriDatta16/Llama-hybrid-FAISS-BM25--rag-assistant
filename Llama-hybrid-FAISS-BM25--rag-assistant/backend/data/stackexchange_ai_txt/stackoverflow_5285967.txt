Disable shortcut/shotkeys of browser in Silverlight?

I am trying to add some shortcut handlers like Ctrl+B in my Silverlight application. However, in IE when we press the Ctrl+B, it comes out a child window of " Organize Favorings". Is it possible to disable these browser shortcuts with Silverlight? Many many thanks! Mrainy
