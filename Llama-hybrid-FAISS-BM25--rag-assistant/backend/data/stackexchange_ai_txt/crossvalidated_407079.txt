What are the differences between GNG and RNNs?

I'm interested in the differences of RNNs (e.g. LSTMs)to Temporal/Growing Neural Gases (NG which can handle temporal data) and I would like to know when to use what? Especially for the use case of classification of temporal data and anomaly detection.
