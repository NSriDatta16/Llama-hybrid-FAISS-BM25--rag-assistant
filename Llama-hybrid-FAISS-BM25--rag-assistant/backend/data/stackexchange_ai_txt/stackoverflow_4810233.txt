Let's take a quick example like the outline view below. There are 3 columns: firstName , lastName , and fullName . In this particular example, let's say we want to only allow firstName and lastName to be editable while fullName (which is potentially derived from firstName and lastName ) is not. You could set this up in Interface Builder by checking or unchecking the editable checkbox for the table column. To do that, click 3 times on one of the table columns (not the header, but inside the outline view); this first selects the NSScrollView , then the NSOutlineView , then an NSTableColumn : You'd set the attributes like the following: That provides a start by setting a default editable value for the entire column. If you need more control over whether a particular row's item value should be editable or not, you can use the outlineView:shouldEditTableColumn:item: delegate method: #pragma mark - #pragma mark - (BOOL)outlineView:(NSOutlineView *)anOutlineView shouldEditTableColumn:(NSTableColumn *)tableColumn item:(id)item { if ([[tableColumn identifier] isEqualToString:@"firstName"] || [[tableColumn identifier] isEqualToString:@"lastName"]) { return YES; } else if ([[tableColumn identifier] isEqualToString:@"fullName"]) { return NO; } return YES; } If you want to control whether a particular row in the outline view is selectable (for example, you could prevent selection of a group item), you can use outlineView:shouldSelectItem: . - (BOOL)outlineView:(NSOutlineView *)anOutlineView shouldSelectItem:(id)item { // if self knows whether it should be selected // call its fictional isItemSelectable:method: if ([self isItemSelectable:item]) { return YES; } /* if the item itself knows know whether it should be selectable call the item's fictional isSelectable method. Here we are assuming that all items are of a fictional MDModelItem class and we cast `item` to (MDModelItem *) to prevent compiler warning */ if ([(MDModelItem *)item isSelectable]) { return YES; } return NO; }
