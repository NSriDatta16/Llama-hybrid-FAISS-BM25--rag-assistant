Sorry if this is answering a different question, but rather than doing that, I would repurpose their classifier as a discrete time survival model. ie use xgboost to predict p(survive month x| survive to month x-1) this will give you all the advantages of a survival model ( assuming you don't actually care about continuous time). (then to predict survive month 3| at month 0, you multiply the individual probabilities: P(survive month 3|2) :P(survive month 2|1): P(survive month 1|0)
