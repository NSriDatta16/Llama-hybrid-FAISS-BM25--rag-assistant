Database abstraction class design using PHP PDO

I am in the process of designing a web application (really, it's a hobby, and I'm trying to teach myself design, and what better way is there than doing it :). Anyway, I was thinking about how I would deal with my database. I am comfortable with PDO , and I was thinking of leveraging PDO in my abstraction class. I am thinking of making a singleton, so that there's only one database connection. This singleton would create a PDO connection. After that, I fail to see why I would need to do too much else. I can then just use the database handler to call PDO functions. I may want some helper functions, but when it gets down to it, I would just use PDO for the actual SQL queries. Is there something wrong with this approach? It seems overly simple compared to the abstraction classes I've used.
