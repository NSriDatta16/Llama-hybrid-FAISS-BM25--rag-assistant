It's quick and dirty I know, but...alternatively, set the foreground colour of the window to the same colour as of the background in order to hide the texts flashing by, see here for an example of how to do this, its in the 7th posting on that page that shows the code to do so. The color you would want is 0x0, black on black...in that way, it looks blank, and no one would see it.. Dirty I know...admittedly SLaks answer above would be more elegant... Hope this helps, Best regards, Tom.
