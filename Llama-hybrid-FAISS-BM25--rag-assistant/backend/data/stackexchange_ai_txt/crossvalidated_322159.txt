Bayesian linear regression - posterior distribution

This is about bayesian linear regression. In this link http://fourier.eng.hmc.edu/e161/lectures/gaussianprocess/node2.html there's a derivation for = The part that I don't understand is how it is that $p(y|x^*,w) = w^Tx^*$? $x^*$ is a new data point and $y^*$ is its predicted value.
