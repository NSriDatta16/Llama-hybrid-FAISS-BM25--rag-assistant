Building custom Spring config tags for a framework

I have a framework which currently requires pretty verbose setup in Spring: {"dpHibernate" : { "serializerFactory" : "org.dphibernate.serialization.SpringContextSerializerFactory" } } I'd like to look at providing a more elegant configuration tag, similar to user-friendly tags used elsewhere in spring: etc., However, I don't really know where to start. How does this approach work? What are these tags called? What's their base class? If someone could point me to the class names in the source (ideally, the , as that's the closest problem set to my project), then I can go from there. I just don't really know where to start!
