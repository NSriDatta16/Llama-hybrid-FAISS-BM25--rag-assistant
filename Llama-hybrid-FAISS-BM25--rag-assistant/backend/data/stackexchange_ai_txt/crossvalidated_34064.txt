I suspect whuber's answer is (as usual) more replete than what I am about to type. I admit, I may not fully understand whuber's answer... so what I am saying may not be unique or useful. However, I did not notice where in whuber's answer the nesting of preferences under individuals as well as the nesting of preferences within test-cases was considered. I think given the question asker's clarification that: The cases are indeed a random sample of all possible cases. I think an analogy is the following: the election is determined by what happens at the polls, but I do have for each voter their party affiliation. So it would be almost expected that a candidate from one party appeals to the voters affiliated with that party, but this is not necessarily a given, a great candidate can win in his party and win over people form the other party. ... these are important considerations. Therefore, perhaps what is most appropriate is not $\chi^2$ but a multi-level logistic model. Specifically in R I might cast something like: lmer(PreferenceForM1~1+(1|RaterID)+(1|TestCaseID),family=binomial) PreferenceForM1 would be coded as 1 (yes) and 0 (no). Here an intercept over 0 would indicate an average rater's preference for method 1 on an average test case. With samples near the lower bounds of usefulness for these techniques, I'd probably also use pvals.fnc and influence.ME to investigate my assumptions and the effects of outliers. The basic question about ties here seems well answered by whuber. However, I'll (re-)state that it seems that ties reduce your ability to observe a statistically significant difference between the methods. In addition, I'll claim that eliminating them may cause you to over-estimate the preference individuals have for one method versus the other. For the later reason, I'd leave them in.
