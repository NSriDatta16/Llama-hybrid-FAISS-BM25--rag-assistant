We subscribe to the "everything goes under source control" school of thought (anal retentive doesn't even begin to describe us). That means test cases (code and data) for all levels of testing that we're responsible for (unit, system, integration, translation ...), development software CD/DVD images, OS images, VM's for the test environments, all doco, basically everything that would be needed to put together the development/test environments if all PCs and software in the team were to be stolen - except for the hardware but that's only because we haven't found a way to check it in yet :-). Disk space is far cheaper than the time it would take to re-source everything we need. And when a version of the software is released to the wild, we actually check out everything needed to construct that version, burn it to multiple DVDs and test the process on virgin hardware. Then we make multiple copies and distribute it to the four corners of the universe ... oops, sorry, got carried away. But we do do everything I stated although the build DVDs are distributed to multiple geographically separated locations (on the planet, not across the universe). As to where it goes in the source control tree, the top level of our tree is always a version, everything to do with that version exists under there. This gives massive duplication but makes things very easy to manage. And, generally, disk storage is a lot cheaper than human resources.
