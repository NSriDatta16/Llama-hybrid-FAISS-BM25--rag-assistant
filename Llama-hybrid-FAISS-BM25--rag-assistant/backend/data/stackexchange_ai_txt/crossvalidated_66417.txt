It is used to test means of different populations in a multivariate sense. Hotelling's $T^{2}$ test is the multivariate analog of Student's $t$ test. So, the 'mean' is in the sense of a mean vector. As far as logistic regression, I don't know. Perhaps you mean a general linear model with a logistic link function, since a logistic regression is a univariate procedure.
