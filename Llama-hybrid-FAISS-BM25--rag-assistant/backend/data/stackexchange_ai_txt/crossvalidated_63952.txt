Estimating logistic regression coefficients in a case-control design when the outcome variable is not case/control status

Consider sampling data from a population of size $N$ in the following way: For $k=1, ..., N$ Observe individual $k$'s "disease" status If they have the disease, include them in the sample with probability $p_{k1}$ If they do not have the disease, include them with probability $p_{k0}$. Suppose you observed a binary outcome variable $Y_i$ and predictor vector ${\bf X}_i$, for $i=1, ..., n$ subjects sampled this way. The outcome variable is not the "disease" status. I want to estimate the parameters of the logistic regression model: $$ \log \left( \frac{ P(Y_i = 1 | {\bf X}_i) }{ P(Y_i = 0 | {\bf X}_i) } \right) = \alpha + {\bf X}_i {\boldsymbol \beta} $$ All I care about are the (log) odds ratios, ${\boldsymbol \beta}$. The intercept is irrelevant to me. My question is: Can I get sensible estimates of ${\boldsymbol \beta}$ by ignoring the sampling probabilities $\{ p_{i1}, p_{i0} \}$, $i=1, ..., n$ and fitting the model as if it were an ordinary random sample? I am pretty much certain the answer to this question is "yes". What I'm looking for is a reference that validates this. There are two main reasons I'm confident about the answer: I've done many simulation studies and none of them contradict this, and It is straightforward to show that, if the population is governed by the model above, then the model governing the sampled data is $$ \log \left( \frac{ P(Y_i = 1 | {\bf X}_i) }{ P(Y_i = 0 | {\bf X}_i) } \right) = \log(p_{i1}) - \log(p_{i0}) + \alpha + {\bf X}_i {\boldsymbol \beta} $$ If the sampling probabilities did not depend on $i$, then this would represent a simple shift to the intercept and the point estimate of ${\boldsymbol \beta}$ would clearly be unaffected. But, if the offsets are different for each person this logic does not quite apply since you will certainly get a different point estimate, although I suspect something similar does. Related: The classic paper by Prentice and Pyke (1979) says that logistic regression coefficients from a case-control (with disease status as the outcome) have the same distribution as those collected from a prospective study. I suspect this same result would apply here but I must confess I don't fully understand every bit of the paper. Thanks in advance for any comments/references.
