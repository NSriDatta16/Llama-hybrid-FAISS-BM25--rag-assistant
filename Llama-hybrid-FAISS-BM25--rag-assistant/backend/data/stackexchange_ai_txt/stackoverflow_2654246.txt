I totally follow and propose the logical ("by-feature") organization! A package should follow the concept of a "module" as closely as possible. The functional organization may spread a module over a project, resulting in less encapsulation, and prone to changes in implementation details. Let's take an Eclipse plugin for example: putting all the views or actions in one package would be a mess. Instead, each component of a feature should go to the feature's package, or if there are many, into subpackages (featureA.handlers, featureA.preferences etc.) Of course, the problem lies in the hierarchical package system (which among others Java has), which makes the handling of orthogonal concerns impossible or at least very difficult - although they occur everywhere!
