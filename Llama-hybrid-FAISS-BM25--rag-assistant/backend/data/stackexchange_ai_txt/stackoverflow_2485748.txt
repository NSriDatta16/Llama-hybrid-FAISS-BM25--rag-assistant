Can't call animated png script from external js file

I'm trying to put an animated PNG dynamically from external .js file. First I found a simple animated png solution, which draws an animation wherever you put the code within tags, but now it looks like I don't know how to call the function properly from external file. The script is from AnimatedPNG , and it looks something like this: fishAnim = new AnimatedPNG('fish', 't01.png', 3, 100); fishAnim.draw(false); Now, I'm trying to call this from external.js file and jQuery: function addFish(){ $('#pnganim').html(' '); fishAnim = new AnimatedPNG('fish', 'fish01.png', 3, 100); myFish = fishAnim.draw(false); $('#pnganim').append(myFish); } ... and it's not working. After I click a button that calls the addFish function, it opens only the first frame on a blank page. What am I doing wrong here? Thanks
