I can imagine a report that summarizes statistically significant model structures for each time series. This report would contain information like the #of step/level shifts encountered, the # of positive pulses , the # of negative pulses , the # of deterministic trends , a pointer indicating a stochastic trend ,# of break points in error variance etc. . This information could then be post-processed for purposes of distinguishing between the characteristic of 'flatness' . I have programmed a number of these summary reports which enable contrasts to be made. This is a feature of AUTOBOX which I have helped to develop and it might be useful for you to see them as an example of what you could possibly implement.
