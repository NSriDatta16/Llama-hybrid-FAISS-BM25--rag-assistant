Add offset to IntPtr

I'm looking for a way to perform pointer operations in C# or .NET in particular. I want to do something very simple Having a pointer IntPtr I want to get IntPtr object which points to 2 bytes ahead. I read some post that the foolowing snippet will work... IntPtr ptr = new IntPtr(oldptr.ToInt32() + 2); But I have doubts whether this statement is also valid for 64-bit machine (since addressing is in 64-bits there).. I found this elegant method to add offset, but unfortunately is in .NET 4.0 only http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.intptr.add%28VS.100%29.aspx
