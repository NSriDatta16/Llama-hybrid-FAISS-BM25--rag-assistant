Which is the best approach to consume webservices and manipulate its data?

Need some advice on the best approach. Currently we are going to start a new CI web project where we need to leverage data heavily from a external web-services or API for data? Is it better to manipulate the data programically (in objects or array) when i need to sort them or store them in database and call them with order, group by etc..? Is there a known architecture or framework for this? What's the best approach use nowadays like how aggregater website is doing where they pull many data sources from various vendor API?
