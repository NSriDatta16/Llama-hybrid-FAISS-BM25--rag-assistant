Another approach would be to use Bayesian statistics. Model the probability of each team winning as a beta distribution and calculate the probability of a sample from one distribution being larger than a sample from the other. This approach is used to test cancer drugs. It takes into account not only which drug has a better response rate but also which drug has more data. Comparing two players or two teams is exactly analogous. This may sound more complicated than it is, but there is free software for doing these calculations, and in some cases the calculations are easy enough to do by hand. See an introduction to random inequalities and specifics about beta distribution inequalities .
