regression modeling - logistic

My task is to run a logistic regression that models the probability that revenue is non-zero (in the logistic regression parlance, a positive revenue is a success). Revenue variable is numeric and expressed in thousands of euro. My code looks like this: my_data 0, 1, 0) logistic_model Is it correct or there should be revenue variable itself when estimating the equation? I want to know if the equation is correct, because it gives different values when I type either revenue or success in the equation
