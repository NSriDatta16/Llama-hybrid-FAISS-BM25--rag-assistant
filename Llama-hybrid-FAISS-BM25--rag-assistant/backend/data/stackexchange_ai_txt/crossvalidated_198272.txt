Could you please help getting started in predictive modelling a large dataset in R?

I am fairly new to machine learning, I am understanding the basics of regression analysis currently. I have come across this dataset California Housing https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing provided by UCI. Is there any place that walks through for above dataset ( or any large dataset in general ) how to break down a unknown dataset and build a regression model out of it? This will really help me in giving a high level picture and then i can work on details. Thanks in advance!
