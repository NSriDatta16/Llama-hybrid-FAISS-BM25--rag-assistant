I would go with a single table. With an index on userId, you should be able to scale easily to millions of rows with little issue. A table per user might be more efficient, but it's generally poor design. The problem with a table per user is it makes it difficult to answer other kinds of questions like "who was in user management yesterday?" or "how many people have changed their passwords?" As for storage space used - I would say a table per user would probably use a little more space, but the difference between the two options should be quite small.
