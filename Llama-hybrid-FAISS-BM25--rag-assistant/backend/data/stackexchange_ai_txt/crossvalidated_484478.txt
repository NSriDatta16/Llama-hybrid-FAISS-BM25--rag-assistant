Likelihood of my friend being able to guess skittle taste

I'm preparing for a data science interview, and here's a question I encountered during my preparation: Your friend claims he can tell the five colors of skittles apart by taste alone. The probability of a skittle being any particular color is 1/5. You give your friend 3 skittles and he gets 2 correct. Should you believe him? What if you give him 100 and he gets 40 correct? I'm pretty sure the answer is yes, I should believe them in both instances. Here's my reasoning: Let $X_i$ be an indicator random variable equalling $1$ if my friend is correct on the $i^{\text{th}}$ guess so that $E(X_i) = 1/5$ and $\text{Var}(X_i) = 4/25$ . The expected number of successful outcomes are 3/5 and 20, and the variance on three guesses is $12/25$ , so guessing two correctly is more than two SD above the mean, and the variance on $100$ guesses is $16$ , so they are just over one standard deviation above the mean. I'm really not sure if my reasoning is correct, and I'd appreciate any sort of insight.
