I am new to iphone app development. I have placed images in UITableView as an image gallery,in rows and columns. Now, I want to drag images with in the tableview,by which position of images can be changed. I have searched for it, but I didnt find any proper solution. It will be like UIView --TableView ---TableViewCell ----custom UIView -----ImageViews A row in a table view contain more than one image. Also if we clicked on an image, should open another view showing full image. Please can anyone help me..,thanks in advance.
