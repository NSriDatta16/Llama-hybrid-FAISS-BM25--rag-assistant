CKEditor clearing all SESSION vars

I am using CKEditor in the backend of a website and stragely enought it wipes all of the SESSION vars when it gets loaded... I have no clue as to why this happens. I have used it before and it's never done this. Nothing seems to be new or changed from previous times it was used. Any idea what it could be? Could it be server-specific? Thank you.
