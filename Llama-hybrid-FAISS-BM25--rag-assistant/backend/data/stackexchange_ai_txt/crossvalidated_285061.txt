As you note, your model is an ARX(2) model. I'd recommend you look at Rob Hyndman's The ARIMAX model muddle blog post for a short discussion that contrasts ARIMAX models with regressions with ARIMA errors, which are easier to interpret. I'm not aware of any books specifically on this topic, but if you are mostly interested in regression with ARIMA errors, then you can of course refer separately to textbooks on regression and to textbooks on time series analysis, for instance Forecasting: Principles and Practice by Hyndman & Athanasopoulos . Or you may find previous questions tagged both "arima" and "regression" helpful.
