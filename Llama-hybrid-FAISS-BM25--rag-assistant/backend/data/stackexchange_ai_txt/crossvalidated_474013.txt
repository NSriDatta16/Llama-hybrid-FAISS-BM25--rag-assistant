How can I plot presence/absence data on a time series?

I have some schedule data in the following format groupA 10 16 groupA 10 16 groupA 12 18 groupA 12 14 groupB 16 20 groupB 16 22 groupB 18 24 groupC 00 10 groupC 04 12 groupC 08 16 I want to create a plot with three lines on the Y axis, and a range from 0 to 24 on the X axis. At a minimum I want to be able to create a gantt-like chart, with a separate line in the plot for each line above, colour coded by the first column (group identifier), but preferably, I'd like to have it so that there are only three lines in the plot, one for each group, increasing the hue of across the line to represent density - although it just occurred to me that this may be a case wher a violin plot could work. Any suggestions on how to do this?
