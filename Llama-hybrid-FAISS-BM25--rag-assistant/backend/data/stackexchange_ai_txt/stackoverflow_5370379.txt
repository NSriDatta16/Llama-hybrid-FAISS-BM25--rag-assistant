Android - Save image to SD and then Load Image

I've designed quickly a piece of code which loads from an specified URL and then saves it to the SD card, however it is not saving to the SD. URL myFileUrl = new URL( Image_HTML); String filepath = Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory().getAbsolutePath(); try { HttpURLConnection conn = (HttpURLConnection) myFileUrl.openConnection(); conn.setDoInput(true); conn.connect(); InputStream is = conn.getInputStream(); bm = BitmapFactory.decodeStream(is); FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(filepath+image_name); bm.compress(CompressFormat.PNG, 100, fos); fos.flush(); fos.close(); bm = BitmapFactory.decodeFile(filepath+image_name); image_loader_view.setImageBitmap(bm); } catch (FileNotFoundException e) { e.printStackTrace(); Log.i("Hub", "FileNotFoundException: "+ e.toString()); } catch (IOException e) { e.printStackTrace(); Log.i("Hub", "IOException: "+ e.toString()); } I have tried to make this code as lightweight as possible, and I have also activated the EXTERNAL.STORAGE.WRITE in the android manifest.
