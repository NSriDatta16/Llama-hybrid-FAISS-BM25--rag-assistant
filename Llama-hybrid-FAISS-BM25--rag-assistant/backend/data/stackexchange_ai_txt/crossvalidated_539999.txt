How does decision tree classifier work for text sentences?

This is an image created using decision tree classifier in which, 30 sentences of two different categories like sports and crime were used. These texts were converted into vectors using sbert (each sentence is now represented as integers) and length of each sentence is made to be 112 ( length of short sentences is also made as 112 to make feature every sentence have feature from X0 to X111). I am trying to figure out how this decision tree works. What do the numbers 345, 196, 5131.5 denote?
