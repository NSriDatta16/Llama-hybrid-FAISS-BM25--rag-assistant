Skewness, kurtosis and normality of a time series

I have a sample size of $21$ with $496$ observations.Can I presume an approximately normal distribution,and use a $t$-test to compare the difference in means, and difference in various financial features (Financial data daily prices)? In addition, sometimes I get insignificant differences on the daily basis, however, if I annualize the mean and the standard error, it becomes highly significant, like a difference between two means per day is $0.10%$ at the end of the year using this formula it will be extremely huge $((1+R)^{240}))-1$, any converting the standard deviation by the formula $\sqrt{240}* SD_{daily}$. First it was a typo yes, the difference in the daily return is 0.10%, then the data will be auto-correlated for sure, since the market regulations allows the price to fluctuate by 2% only per trading session so the pattern will be there, what I am doing is Mainly constructing indexes in the market, grouping the 21 stocks into two groups, 16 stocks and 5, and then I will be comparing the indexes returns, Sharpe ratio etc, so when I'm using t-test to check statistical difference as this formula (x1-x2) difference in means / SQRt(SE^2+SE^2) the results were not statistically significant but financially 0.10% per day will be at the end of the year 15-17% difference which is MASSIVE!!!!! and I provided the statistics for the daily data Kurtosis: the whole market (7.392221073) first group (6.344474009) second group (14.0065786) Skewness the whole market ,(0.930473559), first group (1.173843213), second group(1.325395262). So I'm actually taking the whole population which is only 21 firms in the emergent market, so in my research introduction chapter I have to talk about this issue so do you think I have to say by the central limit theorem, I have more than 20 sample size, and I would use t-test for comparing, if not it is not acceptable, tell me any other test for comparing the differences between the means and in details please.
