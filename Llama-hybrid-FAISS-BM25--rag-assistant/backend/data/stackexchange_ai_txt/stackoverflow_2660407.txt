Open a web page in the browser using flash

Am using this AS 2.0 Code on a button in flash CS3 : on(press, release) { getURL(" http://somethinghere ...","_top"); } unfortunately, it doesnt work. However, when i Ctrl+Enter in flash and click the button, it does. it doesnt work after embedding the SWF movie in the webpage/browser. any ideas?
