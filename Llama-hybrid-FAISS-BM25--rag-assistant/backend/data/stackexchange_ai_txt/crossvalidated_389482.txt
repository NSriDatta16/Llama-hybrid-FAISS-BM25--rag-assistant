Building a model by considering significance of predictors/their interactions is a generally poor policy that leads to poor properties of estimators and confidence intervals, a lack of generalizability/out of sample performance and so on. Whether something is "significant" or not does not really result in any meaningful properties of the predictor: it can still be incredibly important despite being "non-significant", "significance" can arise in a very spurious fashion and can be practically irrelevant. It matters much more whether there are considerations (theoretical/biological/based on how treatment decisions are made/etc.) why predictors/interactions should matter, whether the influence of a variable is so striking that you cannot ignore it and/or whether cross-validation shows improved performance (in terms of whatever you care about - the third criterion should hopefully cover the second one). Another important question is whether this is confirmatory work (i.e. you want to publish the results of this and claim something e.g. with a p-value) or not. If it is, then you should really have a single pre-specified model, in which you perhaps specify a bunch of things you are not sure are needed, but which you leave in the model just in case they are needed. On the other hand, if you are trying to generate hypotheses/models/algorithms/whatever and then want to test them in a new experiment (or on a hold-out test set that you have made very sure to not look at while building your model) after you have decided on what you consider your most promising model, then you have a lot more freedom (but probably still want to do something like cross-validation/assessment on a validation set to not fool yourself). Additionally, for comparing treatments something like propensity scores (as mentioned by @EdM) or structural equation models (if treatment decisions happen at multiple occasions) are well-known alternatives to regression adjustments. I actually think it would be no problem to have a propensity score (or regression adjustment) that includes a location by age interaction, because if the treatment assignment mechanism simply includes these E.g. doctors in location a are more likely to assign a certain treatment to the elderly than doctors in the rest of the country, or if the middle aged people have worse outcomes in one part of the country than another, then those things are simply the sort of things that might be the case. What we care about is the treatment effect on top of that, so we try to adjust for these things. It becomes a different matter when we talk about treatment by location/age interactions. Those really lead to a different interpretation (if the interactions are not really small) that would imply that the treatment works different well by locations/age. That may be true and may be worth investigating, but it is almost a different question than the question for the average treatment effect adjusting for other factors.
