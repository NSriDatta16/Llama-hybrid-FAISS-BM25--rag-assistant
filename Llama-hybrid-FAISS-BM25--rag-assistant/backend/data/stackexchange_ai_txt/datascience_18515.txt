Creating an Artifical Neural Network that produces a set of possible outputs

I'm new to machine learning, and was working on creating an ANN which would classify each observation to a certain value. I have worked primarily with the sigmoid function up to this point to get the probability of an observation (true/false or binary output). In this instance, I want each observation to be classified to one of 5 values: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. I am using the sklearn library's StandardScalar function to scale the input data. What would be recommended in terms of: Best way to scale the output data, and Appropriate activation function to use for the output layer. Thanks!
