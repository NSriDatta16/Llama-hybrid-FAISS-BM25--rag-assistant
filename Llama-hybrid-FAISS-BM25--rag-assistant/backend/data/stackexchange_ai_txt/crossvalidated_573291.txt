I think this is a misunderstanding of what statistics does. You cannot in any meaningful sense do a test to state that student X's grade in one test is significantly different from student Y's. Statistics tends to be about generalising from sample to population, and a sample size of 1 per category (i.e. student) will in almost all cases not allow you to conclude anything meaningful about differences between categories/populations. I say almost always because we can imagine situations in which a single data point can overturn our expectations . But without a strong expectation (or Bayesian prior) that can easily be refuted by a counterexample, one data point doesn't tell you enough to conclude anything meaningful about differences between categories. This is because you have no data about the variance in each student's grades. You might be able to use prior expectations of this variance, but this is entering complicated territory; I wouldn't use that approach to compare the scores of individual students anyway.
