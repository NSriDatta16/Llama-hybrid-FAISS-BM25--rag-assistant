Is it possible to add 2 or more hazard ratios?

I'm trying to establish a connection between interarm systolic blood pressure difference and 10 year cardiovascular disease risk. Since this is a small study, patient-participants will not be followed for 10 years or more to observe the direct outcome. So rather than use logistic regression for the binary outcome, I am conducting a multivariate survival analysis for time-to-event. Various risk factors are being considered. Hazard ratios for each of these are calculated for cardiovascular risk. The model output I obtain says the following: I have the S0(10)= 0.94833 and the HR of age 15.2, HR of BMI 1.67, HR of smoking 1.86 etc. How can I interpret these values? Furthermore, I would like to know how to measure and contrast their separate and joint effects on risk. And I would like to know how to predict the absolute risk of the outcome from my model results. For example I want to say that some percentage of my population is found with a high difference of interarm systolic blood pressure and predicted to have a 3-fold cardiovascular risk, how would I report the 10 year absolute risk of CVD?
