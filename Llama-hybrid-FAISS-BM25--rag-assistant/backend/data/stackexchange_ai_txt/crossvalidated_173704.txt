Improving the Efficiency of an Idiosyncratic Volatility Function

I have a function I wrote to calculate idiosyncratic volatility, but its really inefficient. Does anyone have any suggestions to make the code below more efficient? Specifically, I am trying to take a time series and run a linear regression using a N_Max lookback. I then want to extract the residuals for the dates used in the linear regression and calculate the standard deviation. If there is not N_Max dates, I want to use as many dates as I have available provided it is larger than N_Min. Idiosyncratic_Volatility = Max_n) { # Window is an R function that allows you to do run calculations over # desired rolling date ranges. RollingIndependent length(RollingDependent) | length(RollingDependent) > length(RollingIndependent) | length(RollingDependent) > length(dates)) { result[i] = Min_n) { # Window is an R function that allows you to do run calculations over # desired rolling date ranges. RollingIndependent length(RollingDependent) | length(RollingDependent) > length(RollingIndependent) | length(RollingDependent) > length(dates)) { result[i] Thank you for your time!
