What is the depth of an image in Convolutional Neural Network?

I am learning cs231n Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition. The lecture notes introduce the concepts of width, height, depth. For example, In CIFAR-10, images are only of size 32x32x3 (32 wide, 32 high, 3 color channels) However, in another example, a volume of size [55x55x96] has 96 depth slices, each of size [55x55] What does width 96 means? Does it mean 96 color channels? Why can we have more than 3 color channels?
