Using PRAGMAs as sources in SQLite in getting column names

Problem: I want to do this operation select name from pragma table_info(my_awesome_table) However, it yields a syntax error. I have the sneaking suspicion this is possible, but it doesn't seem to be documented as usable in the SELECT docs with sqlite.
