If you are storing it in a file system, why not use.... folders? That's what OneNote does. A "notebook" and a "section group" are simply regular file system folders. The only other level is a section which is the .one file. There is a very limited hierarchy in there (it's just pages, any of which can be marked as subpages but these are not really linked in any way to a parent.) Inside the .one file you can use XML to represent your pages, though this is not what OneNote does. OneNote uses a binary file format in order to facilitate fast edits, object-level synchronization, multi-user access, and compact storage. If you look around for info about "random access files" you can get an idea for how to do this. But try to avoid using XML if you think it can get large because it will become cumbersome to make edits. You'd need to load the entire XML file, make changes in-memory, then write the whole thing back out again.
