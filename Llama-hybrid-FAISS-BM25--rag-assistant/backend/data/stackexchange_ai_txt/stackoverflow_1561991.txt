Dictionary is a Hash Table. It only calls Equals(object obj) if two objects produces the same hash values. Provide a good hash function for your objects to avoid calling Equals(). Keep in mind that the Hashing part has the complexity O(1) and the search part has the complexity O(n) in worst case and O(n/2) in average case. You should avoid objects that generate the same hash value, otherwise this objects are searched linear
