If you could buy two books on iOS development, which ones would you choose?

Addition : Think it's worth having a look at this again as a number of new books have/are being released with updates to iOS 4 and the inclusion of iPad programming. OK, I have read a number of posts regarding iPhone development books, Cocoa and Objective-C. The general consensus seems to lead to one of four books. Kochan's Objective-C book. Hilleglass' Cocoa book. The pragmatic programmers iPhone SDK development book. And Beginning iPhone Development: Exploring the iPhone SDK by Dave Mark and Jeff LaMarche. I've also added in the following: iPhone Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide I'm looking for advice on which two to buy in order to get started. I'm looking firstly to get a better understanding of Objective-C. Which two books would compliment each other? I have a background in Java, with NO Objective-C experience and NO C or C++ experience either. Firstly, I'd like to get a good idea of the layout and structure of objects and certain data types - obviously it's worth keeping in mind a lot of this will be similar to that of Java. Concepts like pointers and garbage collection are completely new to me.
