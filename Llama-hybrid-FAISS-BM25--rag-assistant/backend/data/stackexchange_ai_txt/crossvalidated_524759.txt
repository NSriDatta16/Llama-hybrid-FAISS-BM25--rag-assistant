In your quantile regression, include lags of price and lags of position as regressors. Then use an $F$ or $\chi^2$ test of the hypothesis that coefficients on lags of position are all equal to zero. This will be a test of the null hypothesis that position does not Granger-cause price. This assumes both the price and the position time series are stationary. For integrated and cointegrated series, a more involved procedure would be needed. Here is sample R code for running the model with 3 lags for the median (quantile level tau=0.5 ): library(quantreg) tau=0.5 lag=3 set.seed(1); price =runif(100) set.seed(2); position=runif(100) prices =embed(price ,lag+1) positions=embed(position,lag+1) model=rq(prices[,1]~prices[,2:(lag+1)]+positions[,2:(lag+1)],tau=tau)
