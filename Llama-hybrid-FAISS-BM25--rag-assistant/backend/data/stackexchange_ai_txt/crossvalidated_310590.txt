Two ways of time series cross-validation for ARIMA giving different results

I have data x that I have split into train and test data: train = x[1:80,1] test = x[81:length(x), 1] I am trying to do cross-validation: i.e. fit the model to train and then see how it performs compared to the test data. The first method I'm using is through the Arima() function: fittrain = Arima(train, order=c(1,1,0)) fittest = Arima(test, model=fittrain) accuracy(fittest) > accuracy(fittest) ME RMSE MAE MPE MAPE MASE Training set 346.2611 414.9891 353.2179 0.1926218 0.1965906 0.2973771 ACF1 Training set -0.1857537 I wanted to confirm that this is indeed comparing the fitted model to my test data: fit = Arima(train, order=c(1,1,0)) preds = as.vector(forecast(fit, h = length(test))$mean) RMSE = sqrt(mean((preds - as.vector(testdata)) ^ 2)) RMSE > RMSE [1] 4022.871 Why am I getting such different values for the RMSE? Is there a function that will compare my model forecasts to the actual test data values and give me a bunch of different metrics?
