Create drag-drop graphic when installing OS X application from dmg

A lot of applications on the mac show a little graphic when the installer DMG is initially opened - the graphic basically allows you to drag and drop the app in that window without having to do it in finder (I'm not talking about package manager here). Any idea if there's a standard way to create that type of experience?
