To me, "size" is used when describing a structure or other way to organize bytes in a computer. It doesn't necessarily have to be instantiated. "length", on the other hand, implies how large a particular buffer of bytes in memory is at a given point. E.g. What is the length of the buffer you're providing? It is the same number of bytes as the size of structure x.
