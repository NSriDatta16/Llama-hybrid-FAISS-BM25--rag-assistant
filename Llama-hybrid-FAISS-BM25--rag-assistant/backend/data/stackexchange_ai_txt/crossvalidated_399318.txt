Invariance of results when scaling explanatory variables in logistic regression, is there a proof?

There is a standard result for linear regression that the regression coefficients are given by $$\mathbf{\beta}=(\mathbf{X^T X})^{-1}\mathbf{X^T y}$$ or $(\mathbf{X^T X})\mathbf{\beta}=\mathbf{X^T y} \tag{2}\label{eq2}$ Scaling the explanatory variables does not affect the predictions. I have tried to show this algebraically as follows. The response is related to the explanatory variables via the matrix equation $\mathbf{y}=\mathbf{X \beta} \tag{3}\label{eq3}$ $\mathbf{X}$ is an $n \times (p+1)$ matrix of n observations on p explanatory variables. The first column of $\mathbf{X}$ is a column of ones. Scaling the explanatory variables with a $(p+1) \times (p+1) $ diagonal matrix $\mathbf{D}$ , whose entries are the scaling factors $ \mathbf{X^s} = \mathbf{XD} \tag{4}\label{eq4}$ $\mathbf{X^s}$ and $\mathbf{\beta^s}$ satisfy $\eqref{eq2}$ : $$(\mathbf{D^TX^T XD})\mathbf{\beta^s} =\mathbf{D^TX^T y}$$ so $$\mathbf{X^T XD}\mathbf{\beta^s} =\mathbf{X^T y}$$ $$\Rightarrow \mathbf{D \beta^s} = (\mathbf{X^T X)^{-1}}\mathbf{X^T y}=\mathbf{\beta}$$ $\Rightarrow \mathbf{\beta^s}=\mathbf{D}^{-1}\mathbf{\beta} \tag{5}\label{eq5}$ This means if an explanatory variable is scaled by $d_i$ then the regression coefficient $\beta_i$ is scaled by $1/d_i$ and the effect of the scaling cancels out, i.e. considering predictions based on scaled values, and using $\eqref{eq4},\eqref{eq5},\eqref{eq3}$ $$\mathbf{y^s}=\mathbf{X^s \beta^s} = \mathbf{X D D^{-1}\beta}=\mathbf{X \beta}=\mathbf{y}$$ as expected. Now to the question. For logistic regression without any regularization, it is suggested, by doing regressions with and without scaling the same effect is seen fit mtcars $mpg mpg * 10 fit When the variable mpg is scaled up by 10, the corresponding coefficient is scaled down by 10. How could this scaling property be proved (or disproved ) algebraically for logistic regression? I found a similar question relating to the effect on AUC when regularization is used. Is there any point to scaling explanatory variables in logistic regression, in the absence of regularization?
