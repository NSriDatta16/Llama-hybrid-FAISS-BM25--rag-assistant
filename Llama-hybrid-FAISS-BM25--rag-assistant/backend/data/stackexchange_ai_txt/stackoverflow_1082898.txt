How exactly dependency injection is implemented internally in Spring.net?

I'm just curious to know about this.When i heard about Spring.net and tried some sample codes of DI i found it cool and eventually i was curious to know how it works and implemented internally? Even though have the src along with the framework i'm not yet good enough to find out where and how it is done. Is this something to do with Reflection ? (A Dilbert quote here:- "A little knowledge can be too dangerous" :-) )
