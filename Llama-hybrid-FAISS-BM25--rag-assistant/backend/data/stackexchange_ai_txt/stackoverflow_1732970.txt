Marc Novakowski is right. The console output gets logged on the phone, and when you connect your Mac to your phone, the console output is available in the organizer window. Just select your phone in the devices panel, and select the console tab. The recent console output will be right there. Very cool. I just figured this out. That will be very helpful in situations like you describe where you need to be away from your computer. BTW, I have a solution to your need to test weak WiFi signals. Just wrap your phone in aluminum foil, with the USB cable sticking out from the foil wrapper. If you are running with it tethered you can single-step through the code in the debugger. You can't manipulate the user interface, but you can degrade/eliminate radio signals like 3D, WiFi, and GPS. If you want to degrade the signal strength but not cancel it completely, you may need to experiment with partly covering the phone with foil, putting small holes in the covering, etc. One caution: Don't leave the phone wrapped in foil for more than a few minutes at a time. It will likely overheat.
