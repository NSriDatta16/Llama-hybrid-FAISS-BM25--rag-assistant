How can Ruby on Rails help to embed video to the pages?

Is there any helper (perhaps, an interface to some other video embedding framework) that can be given a filename (of a local file) and would then yield HTML/Flash/something else that shows basic video player? It shouldn't be an interface to youtube or something like that. The video should be hosted at the server I'm developing.
