I think it depends on your need from my experience if you want to just include a blog roll and allow for people to move over to another section of your site that you can do that with any of them and RSS. A little programming or xsd styling and you can include your homepage. If you want to have more control or display the entire site you could use frames (although I do not encourage it). With a past site I worked on I did the feed route and made sure I could host the wordpress blog on the same hosting/domain. That way the main page is clean and shows more of the business (along with the large RSS feed). Then instead of sending uses to another domain like mysite.wordpress.com I just redirected them to mysite.com/blog. All the traffic stayed on one domain and I could control everything. Including the theme and CSS. I found that some of the free blogging platforms provide the average person 90% of what they need, I just needed more control and hated having to send users to another domain, appears cheap to me. Good luck.
