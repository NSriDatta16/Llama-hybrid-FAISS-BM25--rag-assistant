Generative model is widely used! Here are some widely used examples Naive Bayes Mixture of Gaussian Bayesian Network (and other probablistic graphical models) ... many more Your math is incorrect. For both generative model and discriminate model we are trying to get $P(Y|X)$. Discriminate model directly gets $P(Y|X)$ from data. Generative model gets $P(Y|X)$ from the joint $P(X,Y)$, and the joint is calculated from $P(Y)$ and $P(X|Y)$. Here is the intuitive explanation: let us assume we want to use a car's weight, to predict the car's transmission type, i.e., manual or automatic. (check mtcars[,c('wt','am')] in R to see how data looks like.) The discriminate model will think about where should we set the threshold on weight to have better results. And setting the threshold is essentially specify $P(Y|X)$. Generative model will first look at training data for how may manual car and automatic car we have (This is $P(Y)$) and what's the characteristic/weights of for different cars (This is $P(X|Y)$), and eventually calculate $P(Y|X)$.
