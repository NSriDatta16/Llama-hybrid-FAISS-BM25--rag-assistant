Since there is no option in the TextMate preferences, there is no easy option. The only way to accomplish this is to change your preferred system language, i.e. going to "System Preferences" > "Language & Text" > "Language" and dragging the language you want to spell-check to the top. You have to log out and log in again to make this change work. Hopefully there will be an easier solution in TextMate2.
