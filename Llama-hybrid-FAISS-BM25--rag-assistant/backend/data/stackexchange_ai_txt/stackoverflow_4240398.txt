Java app slower due to web start

I'm trying to deploy my Java application using Java Web Start, but I've come across a problem. When running the application through my IDE (Netbeans) it's lightning fast; everything happens within seconds. However if it's launched with Web Start it's excruciatingly slow. Any ideas why? I'm self-signing everything and using full permissions in the JNLP.
