We'll need to see some code. My feeling is you're missing some essential escaping step somewhere. In particular: As soon as the string which contents "#"(basically when i try to change the color of the font) character Implies to me that you might be sticking strings together into a URL like this: var url= '/something.php?content='+html; Naturally if the html contains a # symbol, you've got problems, because in: http://www.example.com/something.php?content= the # begins a fragment identifier called #123456"> , like when you put #section on the end of a URL to go to the anchor called section in the HTML file. Fragment identifiers are purely client-side and are not sent to the server, which would see: http://www.example.com/something.php?content= However this is far from the only problem with the above. Space, and = are simly invalid in URLs, and other characters like & will also mess up parameter parsing. To encode an arbitrary string into a query parameter you must use encodeURIComponent : var url= '/something.php?content='+encodeURIComponent(html); which will replace # with %35 and similarly for the other out-of-band characters. However if this is indeed what you're doing, you should in any case you should not be storing anything to the database in response to a GET request, nor relying on a GET to pass potentially-large content. Use a POST request instead.
