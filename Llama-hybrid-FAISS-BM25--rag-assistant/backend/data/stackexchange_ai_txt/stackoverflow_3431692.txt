I think that every language is designed according to some need. That need of course can just be the language designers own desire for a more elegant language, a language he himself feels more comfortable programming in. However, the language that are successful will very likely provide some solutions to a more general need. This need my not necesarely be evident at the time the language is designed, but for it to get recognition I think it has to be a need that is shared and gets shelved out as a general desire at some point. There are probably a lot of languages out there that did not necessarely address a problem that is shared by many others or maybe even adresses needs that have not been wiledly realized as such. To you concrete question: I think the best way to discover the shortcomings of current languages is to use them. Of course, the theory may help you to come up with appropriate solutions. So I'd say the best way is (as always) to have theoretical knowledge and practical experience.
