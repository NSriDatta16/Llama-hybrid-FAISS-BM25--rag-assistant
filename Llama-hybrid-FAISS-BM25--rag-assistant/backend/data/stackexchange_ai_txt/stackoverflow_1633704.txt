Note, Fiddler itself is a proxy, so this can be a confounding factor. You'll generally want to use a lower-level tool (like NetMon, www.fiddler2.com/redir/?id=netmon) to see what's going on. It's possible (likely?) the the proxy server is buffering the entire HTTP response (as Fiddler will do unless you push the "Streaming" button) and scanning it for malicious content before returning it to IE all in one block. If it was only doing that for IE user-agents (and not for Firefox) that would explain what you're seeing.
