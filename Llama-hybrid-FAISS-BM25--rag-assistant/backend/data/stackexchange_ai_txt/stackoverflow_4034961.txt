A better way to do it is to split your form processing into its own script. This makes it more organized and more logical so that you can do things like POST to it via AJAX easier. A tip for solving the other problem I see you are having is if you are having a multipage form you should store the data they submit on previous pages somewhere. A common place is in session data. There are other ways to do it like storing it all in a javascript data object until the form is completed. Look into using a framework, they will help.
