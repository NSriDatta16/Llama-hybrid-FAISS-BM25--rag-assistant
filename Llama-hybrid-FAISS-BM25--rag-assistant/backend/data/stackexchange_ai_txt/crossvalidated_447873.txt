First, the quote is Wrong! . If you repeated the study a thousand times then you would get a thousand different intervals and about 95% of those intervals would include the true value. But the only way that 95% of the estimates from the thousand replications would be in the single interval created from the original study is if that interval was based on an estimate that exactly equaled the true parameter, but if that were the case, then we would not need a confidence interval. Second, the way you want to interpret the interval is closer to the Bayesian interpretation than the traditional frequentist approach. If you really want a Bayesian interpretation, then it is best to do a full Bayesian analysis and look at the posterior distribution. If your interval above was from a Bayesian posterior and the posterior is fairly symmetric, then your statement about the parameter being more likely negative than positive would be true. But it is also possible that the posterior is left skewed (something that you cannot tell from just the interval) enough to make the statement false. If that is what you are interested in, then it would be better to compute the probability of being negative/positive from the posterior.
