Machine learning algorithm for a dynamic set of attributes

I'm new to machine learning programming and am working on an application which will calculate weights of the attributes to calculate the ETAT (Estimated Turn Around Time) of some tasks in workflow. The set of attributes is not fixed. For example: ETAT will depend on- Language No of properties Experience level of resources and many more. For each workflow entity there can by a set of these attributes, i.e. a single workflow may be like: Language - English No. of properties - 1200 Experience level of resources - Expert and Language - Russian No. of properties - 21000 Experience level of resources - Basic Now for the above set of attributes, how can I design my machine learning algorithm? Any pointers will be highly useful.
