Since the size of your sample is almost the same as the size of your rage you could just generate all the integers from 1 to 10, shuffle them then take the first 8 elements. If the sample size (k) is a lot less than the range size (n) you can use a variation on the Fisher-Yates shuffle where you stop the algorithm after k steps instead of shuffling the entire array. If the sample size is small but the range size [0,n) is too large to store in memory then you can use yet another variation where you pick first a random number s1 in [0, n). Then you pick a number in [0, n-1) and add one to it if it is equal to or greater than s1, giving s2. Then pick a number in [0, n-2) and add one to it for each of s1, s2 it is greater than or equal to, etc...
