Trouble designing a nosql database that needs to store a relationship between people and the tasks they accomplished

I'm trying to use a NoSql database MongoDB (for personal learning of nosql) and at the moment I'm having trouble with how to organize data. I have a list of people who are suppose to be doing set tasks from a list of tasks, now what I want to create is an application that shows each person which tasks from a list they have completed and what tasks still remain to be completed. Normally in a sql database this is becomes [Person] -> [PersonTask] -> [Task] Now for a nosql solution I'm not sure how to organize the data, do I a) Have a collection of tasks, and a collection of people and each person has a list of task id's that they have completed. b) Have a collection of tasks, and a collection of people and each person includes the tasks they have completed. c) Do I need to rephrase the problem to work correctly in a nosql environment d) Is this just a traditional sql problem and it doesn't work any other way Any help would be greatly appreciated.
