Problems with header() when displaying a PDF file in IE8

So, I have a file that sends the following: header("Pragma: public"); header("Expires: 0"); header("Cache-Control: private"); header("Content-type: application/pdf"); header("Content-disposition: inline; filename=file.pdf"); header("Content-length: 7735"); then I echo out the file - it is a PDF file. Works fine in IE6 & 7 on XP (and FF for that matter) The very same code shows nothing when running on IE8 on either XP or Vista. There are no security warnings, etc so I don't think it has to do with that. And, if my memory serves me correctly, this worked on IE8 a while ago. What am I doing wrong here? Am I missing something out of the headers? Is there a way for me to see what header information normal comes over when viewing a PDF in IE8 so I know what to emulate? After looking at things it still works in IE8 EXCEPT when SSL is on
