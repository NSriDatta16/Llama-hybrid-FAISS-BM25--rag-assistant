I'll try to answer in-line below, but one general point is that the thresholds for defining normal/abnormal results, as well as the conventions for which goodness-of-fit measures should be reported, can vary a great deal across research problems, industries, and academic disciplines. Is the R-squared measure above is correct? If so, is it normal to get such high R-squared value as 0.9949825? Do I need to exclude the fixed effects and report the lower R-squared value 0.7517982 instead although I still have to report the fixed effect model results? Is the method for R-squared value correct? If the independent variables in your model explain the vast majority of variability in your dependent variable, then yes it is plausible to observe an R-squared value that high in a descriptive model. In this case, the difference between the R-squared value from the model including your fixed effects (~0.99) and the model excluding your fixed effects (~0.75) suggests that those fixed effects might explain a significant amount of variability in your class labels - is it possible that some of the categories only occur in certain countries or in certain years? That might explain why including these variables increases R-squared to near ceiling. Ultimately, whether you need to include in your model depends on the question you're trying to answer or the problem you're trying to solve. If you need to be able to explain the impact of x1 on your outcome, conditioned on the year, then it would be important to leave year in the model. How can I get the chi-squared values given the limited information I have with no degrees of freedom values for null and residual deviances? One possibility is the multinomial.test() from the EMT package ( see documentation here ), which only requires class probabilities and true population proportions. Whether you need to report chi-squared along with R-squared depends on the audience. Is it possible to report the R-squared and chi-squared values for each of the three different dependent variables? Otherwise, is it normal to report only one R-squared and chi-squared values for the entire three different dependent variable regression? One common way to accomplish this is to estimate separate binomial logistic regression models, treating each category as a binary outcome. Here, you'd have a "1 vs. not-1" model, a "2 vs. not-2" model, and a "3 vs. not-3" model.
