If these are your actual data, the table you display tells a pretty clear story already. You want to avoid the A1,B1 combination that fails three-quarters of the time. There are few failA failures, and failC failures predominate with a few exceptions ( A2,B2 , A2,B3 ). The A3,B2 combination seems superior, showing only half the overall failure rate of its nearest competitors, A1,B3 and A1,B2 . If you need a more formal examination, your data have the structure of a multinomial response instead of a binary response. There are 4 mutually exclusive outcomes for each test,* including "no failure" as an outcome, and there is no intrinsic ordering among all 4 outcomes. Those are set up as a set of binary regressions against a reference outcome level, done in a way that ensures probabilities adding up to 1 (not ensured with separate logistic regressions). If you use "no failure" as the reference outcome level, you get models for the log-odds versus "no failure" for each of the fail types. Even if you think that the levels of predictors A and B are ordered, your data suggest that you should evaluate them as unordered factors and include interactions between A and B . This UCLA web page illustrates the procedure for R. The software used on that page will even accept data essentially in the tabular format you show (once you calculate the "no failure" numbers), accepting a matrix of counts as the outcome. You do have to do some work to put together the regression coefficients to describe differences between prediction scenarios, illustrated on that page. Links for multinomial regression with other software are on this page . Although you think of A and B as predictors, it's logically similar to treat the problem as a 3-dimensional contingency table and use a Poisson or related count model with the counts as outcomes. You formally treat the fail type as a categorical "predictor" in the regression, along with the A and B categorical predictors, and include all interactions among A , B and the fail types for what's sometimes called "log-linear" analysis . With exactly 100 tests for each combination of A and B levels, you only need to include counts (and "predictor" levels) for the 3 fail types. Again, you will get a large set of regression coefficients, but their scales will be in terms of log-counts rather than log-odds. *This ignores the possibility of multiple failure types with only 1 recorded. You have to use your knowledge of the subject matter to decide if that's good enough.
