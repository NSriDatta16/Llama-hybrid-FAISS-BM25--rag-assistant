The primary issue is that $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)$ only if $A$ and $B$ are mutually exclusive. More generally, $$P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$$ with a more general form for finding $P(\bigcup_{i=1}^k A_i)$. This is known as the inclusion-exclusion rule . To reverse the process, you can realize that the probability of at least one sample failing is the complement of none of the samples failing (this is one version of De Morgan's Law ). Let $A_i$ be the event that the $i^{th}$ sample fails. \begin{align*} P(A_1 \cup A_2 \cup \cdots A_5) &= 1 - P((A_1 \cup A_2 \cup \cdots \cup A_5)^c) \\ &= 1 - P(A_1^c \cap A_2^c \cap \cdots \cap A_5^c) \\ &= 1 - P(A_1^c)P(A_2^c)\cdots P(A_5^c) \\ &= 1 - 0.8^5 = .67232 \end{align*} As a final comment, you could look into the Binomial Distribution for a more flexible approach. Suppose you select $n$ samples, and the pass rate is $p = 0.8$. If $X$ is the number of samples which pass inspection, then $X \sim \text{Binomial}(n, 0.8)$ with probability mass function $$P(X=x) = \binom{n}{x}\ 0.8^x\ 0.2^{n-x}$$ This general formula allows you to easily answer both questions posed above, as well as any other probability questions you may have.
