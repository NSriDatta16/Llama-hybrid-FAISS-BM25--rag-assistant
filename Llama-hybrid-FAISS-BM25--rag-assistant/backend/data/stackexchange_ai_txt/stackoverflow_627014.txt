Object definitions not being rendered for ASP.Net Page Methods

I am using ASP.Net Ajax's Page Methods and I have an issue that an enumeration's definition is not being rendered. Here is what I have: public class Contact { public string FirstName{get;set;} public IList PhoneNumbers{get;set;} } public class PhoneNumber { public string Number{get;set;} public PhoneNumberType {get;set;} } public enum PhoneNumberType { Home, Work, Fax, Cell } I then have a simple web method such as: [WebMethod] public static Contact GetContact(Guid id) { return ....; } On the client side I end up with a MyNamespace.Contact class; however, I do not have a MyNamespace.PhoneNumber or MyNameSpace.PhoneNumberType. I've found that if I explicitly add fake webmethods that just return those types then client side types are rendered. Is there a way to force that enum to be rendered other then fake web methods? I want the enum because I need to iterate through that List<> and based on the PhoneNumberType do something different. I'd rather not hardcode magic numbers or hardcode the enum deffinition.
