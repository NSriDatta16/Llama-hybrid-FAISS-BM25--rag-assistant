There are many ways to do this. In modern browsers that support CSS rounded corners, you could probably do it without any additional image files, but you could also have a simple circular image as a background. Then you'd position some clickable elements with transparent backgrounds and white/black/purple/whatever text for the buttons. Mouse drag around the circle would be possible and a fun project but probably not trivial (mouse dragging always has some quirks.) I've never seen a jQuery plugin for such a thing but I wouldn't be surprised if one exists. However, if it's just clickables around a circle, that wouldn't be too hard. Javascript supports all the trig functions you'd need.
