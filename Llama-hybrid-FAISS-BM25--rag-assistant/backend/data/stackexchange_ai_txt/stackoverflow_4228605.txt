You need to setup your application like most every other application your organization deploys. That means you place the software application on each computer. So, when you want to use a program like word, you install it on each work station. And, when you want to use a program like Excel, you install it on each work station. That way, if one person in your organize has a program with word, it don't impact everyone in the company and they all go home while the one person's problem is fixed. The exact same advice applies with Access. You are now using a development tool that builds software, and like any other program; you install this program on EACH work station. Everyone quite much worked this way in our industry for 20+ years. It is possible that you don't understand the difference between a data file (that word, or Excel or your program) can consume, and that of an application with a UI and code that runs. That program part has traditionally been placed on each computer to isolate programs. Can you imagine one person having a problem with Excel and everyone else has to go home while that is fixed? Do the same with your software, and the fact that you are writing your own in house software as opposed to purchasing is not an excuse to ignore how you have been deploying all of your other software. I explain the simple process of splitting here: http://www.members.shaw.ca/AlbertKallal/Articles/split/index.htm Do the above not only improves reliability, but it also means you can develop on a copy of the next great release of your application while users are working and using the current version. Splitting takes less time then it takes to write this post, and is really much a requirement the instant you deploy code to more then one user.
