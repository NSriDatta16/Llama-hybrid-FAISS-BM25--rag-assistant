vector or map, which one to use?

I've heard many people say that if the number of expected elements in the container is relatively small, it is better to use std::vector instead of std::map even if you were to use the container for lookups only and not iterating. What is the real reason behind this? Obviously the lookup performance of std::map cannot be worse than std::vector (although it may differ in nanoseconds/microseconds) so does it have something to do with memory usage? Does std::vector fare any better/worse than std::map in fragmenting the virtual address space? I am using the STL library that comes along with Visual Studio (i.e. Microsoft's implementation). Does that make any difference compared to other implementations?
