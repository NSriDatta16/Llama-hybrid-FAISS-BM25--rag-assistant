How to store sets, to find similar patterns fast?

(This is no homework and no work issue. It's just my personal interest/occupation and completly fictional. But I am interested in a good algorithm or data structure.) Let's assume, that I would run a dating site. And my special feature would be that the singles were matched by movie taste . (Why not?) In that case I would need a way to store the movie ratings for each user. (So far no problem.) And I would need a data structure to find the best fitting user. The distance between two taste patterns would be the average distance between all ratings that both users made. Example movies A B C D E F G H I J K L M ... user Xm 9 5 1 1 5 user Ym 4 6 1 8 user Zf 9 6 4 7 Distance(X,Z) = avg( abs(9-9) + abs(1-4) ) = 1.5 Distance(Y,Z) = avg( abs(4-6) + abs(6-4) + abs(8-7) ) = 1.666 So Mr. X fits slightly better to Mrs. Z, than Mr. Y does. I like soulution that ... ... don't need many operations on the database ... don't need to handle a lot of data ... run fast ... deliver the best matching Ok, maybe I would consider good approximations too. Try to keep in mind that this should also work with thousands of possible movies, users that rate only about 20-50 movies, and thousands of users. (Because this is a mental puzzle and not a real problem, work-arrounds are not really helping.) What would be your search algorithm or data structure?
