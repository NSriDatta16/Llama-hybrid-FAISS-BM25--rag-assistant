For MySql 5 using InnoDb as the storage engine, TRUNCATE acts just like DELETE without a WHERE clause: i.e. for large tables it takes ages because it deletes rows one-by-one. This is changing in version 6.x. see http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/truncate-table.html for 5.1 info (row-by-row with InnoDB) and http://blogs.mysql.com/peterg/category/personal-opinion/ for changes in 6.x Editor's note This answer is clearly contradicted by the MySQL documentation : "For an InnoDB table before version 5.0.3, InnoDB processes TRUNCATE TABLE by deleting rows one by one. As of MySQL 5.0.3, row by row deletion is used only if there are any FOREIGN KEY constraints that reference the table. If there are no FOREIGN KEY constraints, InnoDB performs fast truncation by dropping the original table and creating an empty one with the same definition, which is much faster than deleting rows one by one."
