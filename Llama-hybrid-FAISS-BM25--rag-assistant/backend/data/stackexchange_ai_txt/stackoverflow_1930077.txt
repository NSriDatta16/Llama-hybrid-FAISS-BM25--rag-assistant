Edit to text more1 more text 1 text more2 more text 2 and $(document).ready( function() { $("table#table_id tr td a.link").click( function() { $(this).next('p').toggle(); }); }); use next('p') so if you add another tag between the link and the paragraph the code will most likely work, as far as you doesn't add another paragraph between ;) And as mention in another post. The ID attribute is unique in every HTML document, You can't have multiple with the same value
