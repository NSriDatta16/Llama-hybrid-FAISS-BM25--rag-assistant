I wrote up a blog article a little while back with a sql query to find missing images. It doesn't disable products, but it's a start at least: http://prattski.com/2010/06/29/magento-sql-to-find-missing-images/ . Should be pretty easy to do from this point. You may have to change the attribute ID if yours doesn't happen to match mine.
