You can use launchd for that purpose. Launchd can be configured to automatically launch a program when a file path is modified. For example the following launchd config plist will launch the program /usr/bin/logger when the desktop folder of my user account is modified: Label logger ProgramArguments /usr/bin/logger path modified WatchPaths /Users/sakra/Desktop/ To activate the config plist save it to the LaunchAgents folder in your Library folder as "logger.plist". From the shell you can then use the command launchctl to activate the logger.plist by running: $ launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/logger.plist The desktop folder is now being monitored. Every time it is changed you should see an output in the system.log (use Console.app). To deactivate the logger.plist, run: $ launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/logger.plist The configuration file above uses the WatchPaths option. Alternatively you can also use the QueueDirectories option. See the launchd man page for more information.
