Keras has some accuracy metrics for multiclass neural networks. CategoricalAccuracy Top K Categorical Accuracy Sparse Top K Categorical Accuracy There are some others if you want to implemented from scratch. Taken from: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306457309000259 These work for most problems rather nicely combined with a good cross validation approach and leak prevention. Having an imbalanced dataset always makes it challenging but picking a metric that doesn't punish results too much like Top K Categorical Accuracy combined with n-fold cross validation like this article suggests , is often enough to have a solid evaluation procedure that you can work on.
