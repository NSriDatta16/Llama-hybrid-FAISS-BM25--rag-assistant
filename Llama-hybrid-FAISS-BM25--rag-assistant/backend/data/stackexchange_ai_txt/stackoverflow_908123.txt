Branch Coverage

When writing test cases which are supposed to have 100% branch coverage, is it ok to have one of your cases that covers two branches and another case that only covers one. note: we are assuming there are only three branches in the code. edit: 3 branches means three basic if statments that are all seperate to each other within a body of code. e.g. input (x, y) if (x y) something output (x) I have one test case that covers the first branch and one test case that covers the other two branches
