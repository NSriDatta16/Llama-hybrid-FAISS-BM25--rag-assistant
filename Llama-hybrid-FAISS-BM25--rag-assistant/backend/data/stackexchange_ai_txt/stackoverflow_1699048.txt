Apples and oranges: An analysis services OLAP cube is a fundamentally different type of storage than a SQL Server database, and they are designed to do different things. Technically MDX is not "faster" than T-SQL, or vice versa -- they are just languages, but designed for different needs. Having said that, a cube is usually what works best for doing numeric analysis of static data, such as aggregating large numbers of sales/transactions/whatever records over time. In contrast, a traditional relational database generally works just fine, if the schema and indexes are well constructed, for search. A simple way to judge: if your SQL queries have to do a lot of select grock, sum/min/max/avg( foo ) from bar group by grock -- Ideal Analysis Services problem then a cube may help (it's designed for aggregate math functions - sum() and group by). OTOH if your queries do a lot of select cols from foo where -- Not so much then a cube probably will not help, and I would focus instead on tuning the schema, the queries and indexing, and perhaps table partitioning if the data can be suitably partitioned. Do you have a clustered index and covering non-clustered indexes that match the queries?
